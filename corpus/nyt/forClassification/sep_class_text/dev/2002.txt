the mother knew something was wrong within minutes of her daughter s birth , when a nurse at southampton hospital whisked the baby away but the mother does not speak english , and no one in the maternity ward spoke spanish so a pediatrician called in katherine hartnett , a bilingual social worker who runs a hispanic outreach program for the roman catholic church on mother s day , ms hartnett drove the parents to north shore university hospital , where the baby had been transferred it turned out she had down syndrome the mother was confused , overwhelmed , depressed , ms hartnett said no one could tell her in any meaningful way what was wrong with the baby i am always happy to help when the hospital calls me , but medical vocabulary is not my specialty just speaking spanish is not enough the family , recently emigrated from mexico , entered the united states illegally , and because they are afraid of being deported , they asked that their names not be used this family is part of the expanding hispanic population on the south fork in the towns of east hampton and southampton , 102 percent of a total population of 74 , 431 is now hispanic , the area s fastestgrowing ethnic group , according to the 2000 census since 1990 , the town of southampton s hispanic population has nearly quadrupled to 4 , 700 , or 86 percent despite the growth in the hispanic population , southampton hospital , the only hospital in the towns of east hampton and southampton , does not have a spanish translator on staff just last month , the hospital found a volunteer translator , who is in the building or on call thursday through saturday the other four days of the week are not covered advocates for the hispanic community , including ms hartnett and her predecessor at the catholic church s latin american outreach center in southampton , say they have spent years urging the hospital , a private institution , to provide translators there is not much improvement from what i 've seen , ms hartnett said , adding that the problem was most acute in the emergency room and billing office usually i get someone with 20 , 000 worth of hospital bills and no insurance the hospital is unable to communicate with them , so they do n't learn there are options like medicaid for getting the bills paid sharon disunno , the hospital s vice president for quality management , said she was not familiar with the case of the down syndrome baby ms hartnett cited she said she would take a look at the file , but four days later , she had not responded i have a problem with storytelling about hospitals , ms disunno said by the time the story gets to the outside , maybe that s not really what happened but she added , we recognize that no system is perfect , and we continually strive to do better ms disunno said that in the last year , the hospital has hired 21 spanishspeaking employees and that the hospital also has five staff doctors who speak spanish but no employees have been tested for fluency in the language or in translating medical terminology , she said the spanishspeaking employees represent about 4 percent of the hospital s 665 employees when no spanish translator is available , ms disunno said , the hospital uses att s translation hot line , which has speakers trained in translating medical information that service is the national standard for hospitals , she said if you 're in pain , i'm sure it s annoying to have to use the phone , but the service has equal status with facetoface communication last year , the hospital called the hot line 336 times at a cost of 4 , 143 , and 90 percent of the calls requested spanish translation , said donna sutton , the hospital s publicaffairs director ms sutton said the hospital did not keep records on the number of spanishspeaking patients it served ceal havemeyer , a member of the southampton town antibias task force and perhaps the hospital s most vocal critic , said that administrators have continually denied that any problem exists for years , the task force encouraged patients who experienced communication problems to write to the administration and board of directors , but none ever got a response , she said because the hospital was digging out of a 50 million deficit , in 1999 the task force raised money to have a college professor teach an intensive spanish class geared to medical professionals eight employees attended , ms havemeyer said , but communication complaints continued the problem is so easy to solve if there s a will , she said just fill every empty job with someone who speaks spanish she called the hospital s reliance on the telephone translation service ludicrous how can you expect people to use the phone when they need a bedpan in a hurry \? she said it just is n't practical the hospital says the care is good , but communication is key to good care for its part , the hospital says that hiring spanishspeaking employees is easier said than done edward haran , its humanresources director , said the hospital recently placed ads in el diario , the spanishlanguage newspaper , and was able to find a bilingual nursing assistant who was willing to relocate
untangled , the events of armistice day 1944 , in the southern michigan town of julie jensen s play cheat , went something like this a young man named sonny came across his fianc e , roxy , in a compromising position with his mother he was so upset he ran out and enlisted in the army that afternoon that upset reva , his mother , so much that she tried to find him and stop him , and that upset roxy so much that she got drunk and took off after reva unable to find her , roxy threw herself instead into the arms of an older man , a genial boob known as ddubb after the encounter , roxy is pregnant none of this , however , happens on the stage instead , the play the opening production of the 25thanniversary season of the women s project takes place early the next year and is about the consequences of that busy afternoon information about sonny is scarce , but he is apparently in france on his way to the ardennes and the battle of the bulge by the time the curtain rises , roxy and reva , who both work in the local munitions plant where much of cheat takes place , are estranged roxy and ddubb , who owns a gas station , are married what ms jensen evidently intended is a story that shows that world war ii ravaged the lives of the women left at home with a virulence and poignancy equal to that visited on the soldiers abroad and there are scenes in her play that sensitively and simply portray the emotions of an unhappy young wife but the events she has concocted to get her characters to this point are , well , unusual to say the least one sign that the plot has been tortured is that the playwright has not settled on the characters' ages roxy and her best friend , edie , are supposed to be in their 20 s , yet edie , who is married and has a child , is said to have been in high school the previous year in the script , ddubb is , at different times , said to be in his 40 s and his 50 s more significant , though it is not the critic s job to write about the play the playwright did n't write , is that a young woman s happening to fall in love with her fianc s mother seems to demand examining and not just stipulating in any case , to show how such a thing could happen would almost certainly yield more original and compelling drama than the saccharine memories of the affair \( involving picnics and a tango dancer in tangier named raoul \) that roxy invokes to try and lure reva back to her or the whiny , final breakup scene in which reva sends roxy on her way , followed by the teary final breakup scene in which roxy walks out on ddubb for all the period detail provided by ms jensen and the designers \( the costumes and sets are simple and attractive \) , the emotions explored throughout the play in such thuddingly familiar scenes are largely generic as a result , cheat feels flimsy , even at a mere 90 minutes , and artificially weighty as directed with oppressive earnestness by joan vail thorne this works to the disadvantage of the very good actors who seem to have been encouraged to bring the audience down as roxy , lucy deakins begins with a sweet and ingratiating appeal that grows steadily thinner as her character becomes ever more glum as reva , whose mostly unexplored inner life represents another rich vein the playwright chose not to tap , karen young is appropriately stoic yet able to show fissures in her severe exterior and kevin o'rourke is amusing and sad as an optimistic meathead who chews with his mouth open and ca n't understand why anyone namely his wife does n't like a good joke the fourth character , edie , is not essential to the play s central emotions , but as played by shayna ferm with the flounce and pout of a schoolgirl barely grown up , she injects the play with a welcome liveliness it is otherwise without cheat by julie jensen directed by joan vail thorne sets by david p gordon costumes by gail cooperhecht lighting by michael lincoln original music and sound by scott killian production manager , b d white production stage manager , jana llynn presented by women s project and productions , julia miles , artistic director georgia buchanan , managing director at 424 west 55th street , clinton with karen young \( reva \) , lucy deakins \( roxy \) , kevin o'rourke \( ddubb \) and shayna ferm \( edie \) photo lucy deakins , left , and karen young are workers at a world war ii munitions plant in cheat , presented by the women s project \( martha holmes \)
deepening the mystery of the biological attacks that terrified the nation last fall , federal investigators have discovered that the anthrax sent through the mail , in general , grew more potent from one letter to the next , with the spores in the final letter to be opened the one sent to senator patrick j leahy of vermont the deadliest of all the finding has surprised and worried investigators , who say it poses a new riddle was the culprit an amateur making gradual improvements through experimentation , a malevolent professional intentionally ratcheting up the potency of the germ powder , or someone else entirely \? it also suggests that after more than six months of painstaking effort , government experts investigating the anthrax strikes are still at sea part of the problem , they admit , is a lack of advisers skilled in the subtleties of germ weapons the discovery of the progressive potential deadliness of the anthrax is the latest conclusion of scientific testing that investigators are hoping will help crack a case that has baffled the fbi since the first anthrax fatality that of robert stevens , a photo editor at a florida supermarket tabloid , who died on oct 5 with five anthrax deaths linked to the contaminated mailings , the fbi inquiry has consumed millions of hours of interviews , neighborhood sweeps and other detective work for example , fbi laboratory analysts matched the serrated ends of the strips of cellophane tape used to seal the anthrax letters that meant that whoever sealed the letters , without leaving any fingerprints , tore off successive strips of tape from the same roll , officials said but investigators acknowledge that they still have no idea who is behind the tainted letters so they are increasingly turning to science to unravel the mystery tests being conducted at several private laboratories may reveal the precise biological signature of the anthrax used in the mailings , helping to narrow the search for the laboratory from which it came analyses of the anthrax sample and the chemicals used to coat it could leave telltale clues to the techniques and equipment used to manufacture the germ material investigators previously believed that the anthrax sent to mr leahy , the democrat who is chairman of the senate judiciary committee , and tom daschle , the senate majority leader , were identical in strength each letter was mailed from trenton on oct 9 , 2001 each had the same photocopied message inside but it turns out that the leahy anthrax is finer , its spores having a smaller range of particle sizes , officials familiar with the federal investigation said it could be that the final steps of the processing were done in steps , a senior government official said you take it so far , and take off a bunch you go further , and take off another bunch despite the increasing sophistication of the anthrax , investigators say they still judge that the deadly powder could have been made in any of thousands of biological laboratories , though getting the right starter germs would have been difficult an aide to senator daschle opened the letter on oct 15 , and officials quickly warned that its anthrax was of high quality compared with earlier mailings , to news media offices in new york the leahy letter was impounded , along with all other congressional mail , and was not discovered until nov 16 investigators made painstaking safety and forensic preparations before opening it in early december the analysis of the contents of the leahy letter is proceeding slowly , the investigators say , because they are learning the science as they go along and want to make sure that none of the scarce , lightweight but extremely valuable evidence is lost , corrupted or misinterpreted they are getting help , they say , from scores of scientists across the nation we 'll have to take this into court , the law enforcement official said of the evidence we had to assure ourselves that we had a quality program a senior bush administration official expressed sympathy for the fbi because the inquiry had grown so scientifically complex and knowledgeable advisers are so few they 're having to review a lot of the initial takes on things , the official said there s an evolving picture the bureau has gone back to scratch to invent the science it is sometimes hard even to do reappraisals in the florida case , no letter or residual powder was ever recovered , leaving many questions about the anthrax there federal officials said the first wave of welldocumented attacks with mailed anthrax in letters from trenton postmarked sept 18 to nbc news and the new york post was relatively crude the powder was heavily contaminated , they said , with what biologists call vegetative cells anthrax bacteria before processing in the laboratory turns them into hardened spores vegetative cells in dry anthrax powder are generally dead and therefore harmless , experts said by contrast , the tiny spores live in a dormant state individual ones are light enough to float easily in the air and , if inhaled , small enough to reach deep into human lungs , eventually germinating into bacteria and causing the respiratory form of the disease , which can be fatal they can also cause the less dangerous cutaneous form if rubbed into the skin
cambridge , mass by title , they are economic advisers to the president by training , they are disciples of marty marty martin s feldstein may well be the most influential economist in washington , even though he has not worked there since 1984 , when he returned to the harvard faculty lawrence b lindsey , president bush s top economic official , once worked as mr feldstein s top teaching assistant , overseeing the logistics of his big economics lecture to harvard undergraduates r glenn hubbard , now chairman of the white house council of economic advisers , fed punch cards filled with data into an early computer to help mr feldstein with his research in one of mr hubbard s first classes as a graduate student at harvard taught , of course , by mr feldstein he sometimes sat with richard h clarida , who now runs the economic policy division of the treasury department add mr clarida s deputy and mr hubbard s chief of staff , among others , and the bush administration s economic team begins to look like a feldstein alumni club i do n't think it s chance , mr lindsey said i think it s marty almost two decades after the softspoken but harddriving mr feldstein ended a fractious stint in the reagan administration , he has built an empire of influence that is probably unmatched in his field aside from his administration ties , he holds sway over many fellow economists as president of the nation s premier economic research organization , and thousands of harvard students who have taken his , and only his , economics class during their harvard years have gone on to become policy makers and corporate executives mr feldstein s stature and his vigorous defense of mr bush s economic policies have won him frequent mention as a possible candidate to succeed alan greenspan eventually as chairman of the federal reserve known for his wideranging research on taxes and government spending that examines the ways public policy affects people s behavior , mr feldstein has helped shift the economic consensus to the right over the last three decades as an adviser to mr bush s 2000 campaign and a frequent contributor to oped pages , mr feldstein provided much of the intellectual rationale for the tax cut last year he continues to push for changes in the social security system that would include private investment accounts a slight , bookish man with a friendly manner , mr feldstein has become a mentor even to many economists who think he exaggerates the effect of taxes his work was on the one hand on the cutting edge of research theory and on the other hand directly relevant to the policy of the day , said lawrence h summers , the president of harvard , another student of mr feldstein and a treasury secretary in the clinton administration that s why he drew so many graduate students to him jonathan gruber , an economist at the massachusetts institute of technology who studied with mr feldstein and also worked in the clinton administration s treasury department , added , he has shown that taxes matter since 1977 , mr feldstein has wielded academic power as the president of the national bureau of economic research , an elite , nonpartisan group of about 500 economists best known as the body that decides when recessions begin and end more important , it publishes research papers long before any academic journal does , determining which work is likely to receive wide attention from his corner office at the bureau , above a cambridge furniture store , mr feldstein helps shape the public debate and determine the research priorities of other economists as he chooses the subjects of the bureau s books and conferences aside from traveling with his wife , kathleen , who is also an economist , and spending time at their homes in the boston suburbs , cape cod and vermont , mr feldstein is almost always at the bureau when he is at harvard , he shows a fondness for the classroom unusual for his rank he still teaches that introductory economics class , the college s largest lecture while the curriculum is by no means out of the mainstream , it does bear his conservative stamp i think that is quite a remarkable number , he said during a lecture one recent monday , using a laser pointer to direct attention to 4365 percent displayed on an enormous screen inside the steeply tiered sanders theater , just off harvard yard the percentage signified the portion of every additional dollar earned by somebody making 35 , 000 a year that goes to paying taxes i find it quite strange that somebody at this relatively low income is paying about half of his income in taxes , he said in his clear , dry speaking style what high marginal tax rates do is distort behavior except for a few beeps emanating from electronic devices , the class could have happened decades earlier mr feldstein himself took introductory economics in this theater as a freshman more than 40 years ago at the time , he planned to follow the career path of his father , a lawyer , but was seduced by economics
stock prices plunged and then recovered yesterday after worldcom s announcement that it had overstated its profits , leaving major market indexes just above their postsept 11 lows with investors uneasy about corporate accounting scandals , economic weakness , the falling dollar , and the possibility of future terrorist attacks , stocks have slid relentlessly since march yesterday , only the lateday rally saved the nasdaq composite index and the standard poor s 500stock index from closing below their lows of sept 21 , when stocks bottomed after the attacks the losses this year compound two years of declines in the nasdaq and s p 500 , the most important indexes since the technology stock bubble burst in march 2000 , the s p 500 is down more than a third , and the nasdaq has plunged 72 percent , the biggest drop in any major market gauge since the depression this year s declines have come even though wall street s worst fears after the attacks have not happened the economy , which was shrinking at the time of the attacks , avoided a deep recession and rallied strongly in the first quarter of this year most forecasters do not expect a second recession , although hopes for a vigorous recovery have faded the united states has not suffered another major terrorist attack but none of that has comforted investors , who now find that the boom of the late 1990 s left stocks very expensive by historical standards and that the confluence of technological innovation and geopolitical stability that supported those gains may not be repeated for many years at the same time , a series of accounting scandals has shaken the faith of investors in the honesty of wall street and corporate america and led some foreign investors to reduce their holdings of united states stocks chief executives , accountants and wall street analysts have all faced criticism from investors some of whom gladly overlooked conflicts of interest and dubious accounting practices when stocks were rising there s general unease about the market because of mistrust of ceo s , mistrust of corporate accounting , mistrust of analysts , said steven l colton , manager of the 370 million phoenixoakhurst growth and income fund people are wondering what the actual earnings numbers really are yesterday , the s p 500 fell 261 points , or 03 percent , to 97353 , its lowest level since sept 21 , when it closed at 96580 the nasdaq composite index gained 534 points , or 04 percent , to close at 1 , 42933 , just above its sept 21 low of 1 , 42319 the dow jones industrial average finished the day essentially flat , losing 671 points , or less than 01 percent , to close at 9 , 12011 in a sign of the market s struggle to find direction , telecommunications and financial companies , along with any company perceived to have accounting issues , were much lower but information technology and drug stocks , which have been battered this year , rose sharply for most of the day , the indexes were much lower the dow briefly was down more than 200 points and the s p 500 off more than 20 yesterday was the third consecutive day that the indexes tested but did not break their sept 21 lows , and the market s refusal to break through those bottoms may signal at least a temporary halt to its recent declines in fact , many professional investors and strategists argue that stocks are reasonably priced , or even cheap , at current prices since march , the s p 500 has declined nearly 17 percent , while profit estimates have risen meanwhile , inflation appears quiescent , and interest rates on 10year treasury notes have fallen to 475 percent with the s p 500 expected to earn 57 a share in the next 12 months , it is now trading at a forward priceearnings ratio of only 17 , for an earnings yield of 59 percent in general , when the earnings yield on the s p 500 is significantly below the interest rate on the 10year treasury note , investors should sell bonds and buy stocks , analysts say subodh kumar , chief investment strategist at cibc world markets , said he believed that stocks were poised for a strong rally the bulk of what i would call the fundamentally driven people are more focused on when this market is going to bottom out than are looking to get out , he said but the professional optimism of wall street forecasters has left at least some individual investors cold having suffered through two years of losses , they say they have little faith in the profit figures that analysts and companies are offering william pfeffer , a 71yearold retired stockbroker from chicago , said he was optimistic after sept 11 because he had watched the markets weather several other national and corporate crises during his 50 years of investing but news reports of corporate fraud have undermined his confidence , he said it s unconscionable what s going on , mr pfeffer said absolutely unconscionable it may take as much as another generation before people regain confidence in wall street mr pfeffer s portfolio has been damaged by several companies implicated in the accounting scandals , including enron and worldcom since sept 11 , he has cut the amount of his portfolio in stocks from about half to less than 40 percent i really think to build confidence back in these markets , some of these whitecollar guys have to spend 10 years in jail , he said wall street too often gets off the hook there are no consequences besides paying money yet , as yesterday s sharp rally showed , some investors are holding their noses and looking for bargains nikita seldon , a manager at texas instruments in dallas , said he planned to buy technology stocks i believe in america , and i believe the markets will come back up , he said roxana milbury , a high school math teacher from rahway , nj , said she was unfazed by the recent corporate transgressions ms milbury noted that her portfolio , which is composed almost entirely of stocks , was losing money before sept 11 so she is holding on , although she does not expect a rally any time soon in my experience , what goes down real fast takes time to get back up , she said graph tracks the dow jones

farmingdale , ny , june 16 a serious run by phil mickelson and a 49minute delay because of bad weather altered the plot today , but the basic story did not change when tiger woods enters the final round of a major championship with a lead , he is one of the safest bets in sports woods has it figured out , that if a player with his ability does not defeat himself , he is unlikely to lose he is 8 for 8 when entering the final round of a major with at least a share of the lead so with woods taking a fourstroke advantage into the final round of the united states open , the last 18 holes unfolded like a familiar movie , with woods the star and the supporting cast chasing a carrot that always seemed out of reach the march toward a grand slam for woods is alive , and the journey that has successfully taken him through georgia and new york will continue next month in scotland at the british open becoming the first player since jack nicklaus in 1972 to win the masters and the united states open in the same year , woods won his eighth major championship by three strokes today at bethpage state park s black course leading wire to wire , woods finished at threeunderpar 277 after a finalround 72 his only round over par in the tournament mickelson \( 70 \) was second at 280 and jeff maggert \( 72 \) was third , five strokes back at 282 sergio garc a , who shot a 74 while playing with woods , finished fourth at 283 nobody has won the four professional majors in the same year , but woods already has his own version of the slam , winning four consecutive majors starting with the 2000 united states open now woods is halfway to winning all four in the same calendar year , and he can complete the grand slam if he wins the british open next month and the pga championship in august woods , who at 26 has won eight majors faster than anyone else , made the first open held on a truly public facility even more memorable by subduing a challenging course where nobody else finished under par he outplayed everyone who threatened him and won 1 million it was brutal how hard this golf course played , said woods , who bogeyed no 16 and no 18 but led by enough to lessen the impact i did n't get off to the greatest start , and phil got off to a great start but i hung in there i fought hard for this one so many victories by woods appear to have been executed on autopilot , but this one tested him more than most today , he looked nervous at the start , making threeputt bogeys on his first two holes and giving those behind him some hope but it was false hope the first two bogeys by woods were his only two when it mattered , and nobody got closer than two strokes the last serious threat came when mickelson pulled to two strokes back with a birdie at the par5 , 554yard no 13 after a long drive , mickelson hit his second shot just onto the front of the green and made a great lag putt from 60 feet that stopped about 2 feet from the hole , allowing him to make the short putt for birdie the gallery cheered wildly , trying to lift mickelson to a miraculous run that would have been remembered as one of golf s greatest comebacks at one point early in the third round saturday , he trailed woods by 10 strokes and his chances to win the tournament seemed slim at best give mickelson credit for tenacity , but a threat only seems to bring out woods s best playing in the group behind mickelson , woods responded with a birdie at no 13 , reaching the green in two strokes and just missing a 25foot eagle putt before his tapin birdie extended his lead to three then mickelson snuffed out his dreams with bogeys at no 16 and no 17 he failed to get up and down from a bunker at no 16 and missed a 3foot putt for par at no 17 once again , mickelson was no 2 today was mickelson s 32nd birthday , and he was serenaded several times by the gallery , pulling for a superb player still seeking his first major championship but woods has spoiled the party for mickelson before , and it happened again i had a great time today , but i'm sorry i came up a little short , said mickelson , who has finished second or third in the last three majors when he made a couple of bogeys early , i thought that this might be a good opportunity it was difficult to make birdies out there when i birdied no 13 and got to within two , i thought i had a very good opportunity i have been playing consistently well in the major championships , competing in all of them , and i feel as though it will eventually happen it just was n't my time nor was it garc a s time he faded on the back nine while playing with woods in the final group by the time garc a made the turn on the back nine , he was six strokes behind woods , after costly bogeys at no 7 and no 9 garc a was heckled heavily by the crowd saturday , after making an obscene gesture on friday and then contending after his round that if woods had been on the course during the day s heavy rain , united states golf association officials would have halted play today , the crowd was far nicer to garc a than it had been , but his own game was unkind it was a little frustrating after he bogeyed no 1 and no 2 , because i thought i had a great chance , garc a said he was a little nervous , no doubt about that he felt the pressure but unfortunately , i could n't get the ball in the hole he s the best he did what he had to do to win what garc a or anyone else did may not have mattered , because woods looked as if he would have done whatever was necessary a thunderstorm halted play with woods on the 11th tee , and none of the players were allowed to return to the driving range to warm up but when play resumed , woods remained focused just as in 2000 , when he won the open by a recordsetting 15 strokes at pebble beach , woods was the lone player under par the length \( an open record 7 , 214 yards \) and difficulty of bethpage quickly weeded out those who did not hit the ball straight enough , putt consistently enough or believe in themselves enough but the goals of this week were to successfully bring a major championship to a public course and to identify the best player both missions were accomplished , and woods got what he came for another major , and another leg of the grand slam it s awesome to win the nation s title , on a public facility , in front of these fans , woods said i do n't think anyone appreciates how hard it is to win major championships this one was hard i'm going to celebrate photos scott hoch , left , honoring america and new york , tied for fifth jeff maggert shot a 72 and finished in third , five strokes off the lead \( photographs by associated press , left agence francepresse \) phil mickelson made a birdie putt on no 11 to inch closer to tiger woods he

before reminding the madison square garden fans of what a franchise center looked like on sunday , shaquille o'neal opined on the downfall of the knicks simply and succinctly , he traced the knicks' current plight to the trading of patrick ewing trade a legend , bad things happen to you , said o'neal , the los angeles lakers star the knicks , on the verge of missing the playoffs for the first time in 15 years , are certainly evidence of that while ewing , who was 38 when he was dealt to seattle in september 2000 , did not have much to offer on the court anymore , the knicks' decision to trade him was the first in a series of frontoffice moves that were imprudent from a financial standpoint and questionable from a basketball standpoint those moves , combined with the untimely and unexpected resignation of jeff van gundy as head coach earlier this season , marcus camby s constant injury problems and the premature retirement of larry johnson , have caused the knicks to deteriorate into one of the worstsituated teams in the national basketball association with a leaguehigh 855 million payroll and a roster full of overpaid role players , their prospects for swift improvement are as unfavorable as their current 2034 record most general managers around the league feel the ewing trade was the single most drastic thing , because look at what it turned them into , said an eastern conference executive , speaking on condition of anonymity if they had just let ewing go , they would n't have guys like travis knight , howard eisley and shandon anderson signed to those longterm deals the seeds for the ewing trade were planted when the players , the public , and even dave checketts , then the president of madison square garden , began thinking the knicks were better off without ewing during their run to the 1999 nba finals so when ewing , angry over the lack of respect he received and aware that the knicks would not extend his contract , demanded a trade , the knicks sought to satisfy him if the knicks had gotten great value , trading ewing at that point in his career would not have been so damning but the knicks were afraid he would be disruptive if brought back for one more season , so they accepted a package of aging , injured , illfitting players with longterm contracts totaling 904 million rather than keeping ewing around and chopping his 16 million off their payroll after the 20001 season the club s thinking was that by pulling off the fourteam trade that sent ewing to seattle , it would be in position to trade for dikembe mutombo , still a topflight center , during , or after , the season i was an assistant at the time and as far as i was told , there were conversations in terms of trying to get mutombo , knicks coach don chaney said they were working on that we thought we had a chance at getting a big guy , and the big guy was mutombo i was told through the coaches that mutombo was the guy in sight for us to bring in here while david falk , the agent for mutombo and glen rice , never told the knicks he would deliver mutombo , the knicks knew that taking care of one of his clients would not hurt in the pursuit of another so they gave rice , who was 33 at the time , a fouryear , 36 million contract rice s only other option at the time was to accept a oneyear , 75 million offer from the chicago bulls the knicks tried to cultivate a good relationship with people who could help them , falk said that s called good business i'm very fond of dave checketts and we developed a good relationship if dikembe had not been traded from atlanta to philadelphia , would the knicks have had a good chance of getting him \? absolutely the knicks were so focused on getting mutombo that they were willing to look past luc longley s poor health and sixyear , 324 million contract and agreed to accept him in the ewing deal to make the trade work for the supersonics while the knicks wound up surprised that longley was limited to only 25 games in the 20001 season , they knew beforehand that he would not be a major contributor in fact , longley , who ended up retiring because of a degenerative condition in his ankle in september , said the knicks knew he was banged up before trading for him phoenix knew what was going on , longley said last summer that s why they traded me their doctors had seen the xrays and giggled at them i brought up my ankle in my physical with the knicks , and they said , 'have you been playing \? ' i said , 'yes , ' and that was it now longley is retired , and the knicks will have ended up paying him approximately 25 million scott layden , the knicks' president and general manager , would not comment on the knicks' series of deals , but one person who was close to him said , it would have been a great trade if it had all turned into mutombo , but those are some of the gambles you take checketts was forced out last spring , and layden ultimately saw his duties expanded the knicks then took another gamble last summer , miscalculating the health of charlie ward and compounding the financial repercussions of the ewing trade by sending rice to houston in a threeteam deal for anderson and eisley the knicks knew they needed to move rice because he was unhappy coming off the bench , and they also wanted another point guard because they were afraid that ward s knees would not hold up this season
by june of 2000 , a lawsuit by the nauheimer family against a westchester county priest , the rev gennaro gentile , was down to a single claim of assault and battery other alleged encounters between the priest and the family s two sons had been thrown out because the statute of limitations had expired the archdiocese of new york , which had been a defendant when the suit was filed in august 1997 , had also been dropped from the case but even then , the family s lawyer , robert j hilpert , was sharply limited by the courts in what he could ask the priest in a formal deposition , about what had happened with the nauheimer boys and what the priest might have done with other boys with a judge s ruling that father gentile s character could not be explored , the family could neither establish if the priest s seven jumps from parish to parish over 17 years resulted from people making similar claims nor if the contact with their younger son was merely friendly , as the priest insisted , or intended to be sexual a little over a year later , what had begun as a 55 million lawsuit was settled quietly , still shrouded in uncertainty the lawyers and several principals are barred from talking about the case at all but whatever the terms of the secret settlement , the court record and interviews with participants make clear that the case , as with many others like it involving emotional , intensely fought charges of abuse by clergy , resulted in no shortage of pain , confusion and lack of resolution the younger nauheimer son whose lawyer had been barred from delving into the priest s past had to undergo psychological exams for the defense that concluded the boy , 13 years old at the time of the incident , had found the priest s touching him unwelcome because of his own latent insecurity about homosexuality and a priest who came forward with information that there had been concerns about father gentile says he was branded a malcontent and punished for it others who signed affidavits claiming father gentile had behaved inappropriately with them have no idea if their coming forward achieved anything another family whose son was dragged into the case says they were disturbed to learn that money they received for counseling came out of a parish church fund earmarked for the indigent father gentile continues to work for the archdiocese , on marriage annulments his brief assignment to a bronx parish last year set off protests from parishioners who threatened to boycott the collection plate and keep their children home until he was removed neither father jerry , as he is known , nor his lawyer , mark k malone , returned phone calls on friday seeking to discuss the case the specter that a priest with problems might be shunted from parish to parish was precisely what drove the nauheimers to court , judging from statements they made before they were barred from talking even though what happened to their children was not as serious as what happened to other kids , they felt they had an obligation to the other kids in the parish to try to expose this guy and stop him , said the rev ron lemmert , the former assistant pastor to father gentile , who cooperated with the nauheimers father lemmert said he took some solace in knowing that for all the discomfort he and the nauheimers have endured , his former supervisor now has a bell around his neck and wherever he goes that bell will go 'tinkle , tinkle , ' he said at church of the holy name of mary , in crotononhudson , where father gentile worked at the time of the incidents , the allegations and their fallout have rippled through the community for years the contact between the nauheimer boys and father gentile , a onetime family friend , began in 1993 , according to the court record the older son , vincent jr , said that on one occasion , the priest urged him to choose a gift from a men s clothing catalog that featured thongs and novelty items later that year , he said the priest invited him to his lakeside retreat , and offered a massage that the boy said he had to stop the boy was 15 at the time and did not tell his parents the following year , father gentile was invited for dinner and to watch a video at the nauheimer home after dinner , the priest and brian , who was 13 at the time , were alone in the basement watching hobbit according to brian , the priest asked him to move closer and began twirling the boy s hair when the contact shifted to his ear , neck and shoulders , brian left the room and got his mother at first , the family was inclined to let the matter go but after learning in 1997 that another teenage boy had had a similar encounter , they filed suit in supreme court in white plains they and their lawyer have said often that the case was never about money proceeds would go to fight sexual abuse , they pledged yet , 55 million was attached to the suit , and the diocese answered forcefully in an unusual tactic , msgr edward o 'donnell , personnel director for the late cardinal john j o'connor of the archdiocese of new york , went to the pulpit of holy name of mary and suggested at least to some of those in attendance that the case was without merit and in his representation of father gentile , mr malone included in his briefs the mother s income as a nurse , the father s recent unemployment and the brothers' tuition bills mr malone also claimed that the father of the nauheimer boys may have been motivated by a vendetta against the church because of his own sexual abuse as a child at the hands of a priest

\( my father and i were on fire island , transfixed by a grainy image on a blackandwhite portable tv in the dank laundry room while our deserted weekend guests milled around outside in the effulgent sunshine , cranky and unfed \) after the '94 world cup , the wellspring of soccer goodwill led to the birth of what currently passes for the gold standard in this country major league soccer while it has lasted considerably longer than , say , the xfl , mls has never really planted its flag in the national consciousness like the cosmos did my father , for instance , has n't attended a single metrostars game in seven years no doubt the most rhapsodic moment in american soccer came in 1999 when the united states captured the women s world cup and the heart of the country and though my father never quite bought into the miabranditiffeny mania , he was at least heartened that the united states had finally won something in his beloved sport all along , however , he averred that the professional women s league \( wusa \) that the victory spawned would pale next to the outsized joys of ripoffyourjersey patriotism fueled by the world cup bereft , my father and i have taken to going to irish and italian bars not to drink but to watch english and italian games beamed onto crude satellite dishes that frequently conk out halfway through a telecast , resulting in scenes of grown men throwing scones and cannoli and occasionally each other at the screen at one of those italian cafes on the lower east side , a man turned to me and asked incredulously , in fractured english why you americans here \? the same question may well be on the minds of the 31 other countries competing in this year s world cup , none of whom finished lower than the united states did in the last goaround my father and i harbor no illusions well , not too many about our chances this year but we will not brook another onegoal , threegamesandout debacle my father looks at landon donovan and damarcus beasley , two american players barely out of their teens , and sees the first glimmer of hope that the united states has finally produced homegrown talent that can stick the ball in the back of the net he looks at kasey keller and brad friedel and sees two goalkeepers who have already proven they can keep the ball out of the net at the highest levels and me \? i look at my father and i see a man who , despite all the disappointing bounces the ball has taken over the years , will awake at sunrise to watch the most beautiful game he knows , a game whose dawn in america he still believes is only a couple of goals away and hopefully , he 'll leave me that extra bagel drawing \( nathan fox \)

berlin , feb 28 a european union that has become increasingly distant from its citizens began an extraordinary effort today to create a more representative government as the 15nation bloc expands across the continent and absorbs as many as nine new members a group of 105 parliamentarians , experts and governmental nominees opened a yearlong constitutional convention of sorts in brussels that was designed to chart a more efficient and more democratic structure for the growing union if we succeed , in 50 years' time , europe will have changed its role in the world , said the convention s chairman , val ry giscard d'estaing , the former french president it will be respected and listened to , not only as the economic power it already is , but as a political power that will speak as an equal with the largest existing and future powers on the planet symbolic of european aspirations for a more perfect association , the convention began on the day that national currencies like the french franc and the german mark officially stopped circulating , replaced by a single european currency , the euro , in 12 of the member states already creaking at its current size , the european union is expected to expand to as many as 24 nations by the middle of 2004 , as it takes in the poorer countries of formerly socialist eastern europe , with the balkan states and turkey still to come but how such a vastly bigger european union should be shaped and governed as a federation or as a confederation of different states , and in a way that small countries have a say and large countries have a stake and ordinary citizens feel some real connection to the bureaucrats in brussels has bedeviled busy leaders for years so last december , at their summit meeting in laeken , belgium , european nations agreed to set up this convention , which has been likened to the american constitutional convention of 1787 if we fail , mr giscard d'estaing warned the delegates today , each country will go back to the logic of a free trade area none of us , not even the biggest , would have sufficient weight to deal with the big powers of this world in his opening address today , he switched from french to english to german , and , rather like the pope at christmas , greeted the assembled ladies and gentlemen in all 11 official languages of the european union , and then in polish as a gesture to the candidate states how to better share sovereignty between brussels and the member states , whether to directly elect a president of europe , whether to give more executive powers to the governmentappointed european commission in brussels and more legislative powers to the european parliament are knotty questions that go to the heart of europe s future but the delegates will also grapple with how to make decisionmaking more efficient in a europe where some nations want to move faster than others and france , for example , does not want to lose the old principle , enshrined in the early days of the union , of equality with a germany that is now reunited and much larger nor do smaller states , like denmark , finland or ireland , want to be bulldozed by the larger states , so the smaller ones are likely to favor continued strong powers for the commission the convention could even try to draft a european constitution , which would try to put the last 50 years of stopgap treaties into one , coherent document it will be the leaders of the member nations who will receive the recommendations of this convention and decide what to do but it will be harder for the leaders to ignore the recommendations that emerge from this open process , and harder for them to maintain the european union as a topdown affair , with little power given to the european parliament for all the talk of philadelphia in 1787 , the dream of a united states of europe , which animated one of the european union s founders , jean monnet , the french economist , has been dead for years the president of the european commission , romano prodi , said that the real aim of this convention is not to build a superstate european integration is unique , he said , and the eu is unique in that it is a union of peoples and states but he supported the idea of a constitution for europe , saying that such a document would mark the birth of europe as a political entity

tampa , fla , march 28 one of the toughest things about the baseball life , manager joe torre said today , is thinking you are close to your players but knowing you will have to part ways sooner or later , you 're going to have to tell somebody or somebody s going to have to tell you it s over with , torre said it was over today for luis sojo , the indomitable infielder who played six seasons for the yankees and hit the decisive single in the final game of the subway series torre told sojo he had chosen ron coomer to back up at third base and first base , and that barring injury , sojo was not in his plans torre had similar conversations with other players today as the yankees came close to completing their 25man roster but none of the players have made the kind of impact sojo has this is no fun , torre said pitcher mike thurman and catcher chris widger were reassigned to the minor league camp , and the veteran utility player f p santangelo was asked to accept an assignment to class aaa columbus that leaves the yankees with 28 players in camp , and the remaining decisions are clear randy choate , adrian hern ndez and jay tessmer are competing for the final two spots in the bullpen choate is the only lefthander of the three , and tessmer is the only one not on the 40man roster the yankees are not sure whether rondell white will need more time to come back from the strained rib cage muscle that has caused him to miss the exhibition season if white is not ready , juan rivera or marcus thames will take his place and start in the outfield torre will watch white play in a minor league game on friday white played five innings in the field in a minor league game today , and he was cautious i threw a ball in , cut one off , white said i thought about diving once , but i said , 'i ca n't dive' santangelo offered versatility and speed , and he had a 486 onbase percentage in spring training but his average was 182 and , perhaps more important , another reserve outfielder , gerald williams , is guaranteed 2 million this season williams is hitting 211 with a 262 onbase percentage and has played much more than santangelo i just kind of had blinders on the whole time and just played baseball , said santangelo , who was not sure whether he would accept the minor league assignment thurman , who was impressive early in camp but was hit hard late , will be in the rotation at columbus the decision that seemed hardest for torre was coomer or sojo coomer has more power than sojo , and without coomer on the roster , the yankees would not have had much righthanded power off the bench coomer , 35 , has spent most of the last five seasons as an everyday player for the twins and the cubs , but he will adjust to a new role i know who s going to start and who s not 99 percent of the time , coomer said but if you look at it like you 're not going to play , you kind of let your body shut down and you 're not prepared to play so i 'll prepare every day like i'm going to play , and if i get in there , i 'll be ready sojo , who was not available for comment , always seemed to be ready torre and others praised his ability to get a clutch hit after sitting on the bench for days sojo was also popular in the clubhouse , helping young players adapt to the majors recently , he befriended infielder enrique wilson , even though wilson displaced him as the reserve middle infielder he was the ultimate team player , center fielder bernie williams said sojo , 36 , came to camp saying he would make the team or retire , but he batted 345 and later said that he might try to sign with another team if the yankees cut him torre told sojo the yankees want to keep him in the organization it wo n't be too long until we see him in the big leagues as a coach or a manager , catcher jorge posada said inside pitch joe torre was friends with milton berle , who died at age 93 on wednesday berle was a baseball fan , said torre , who met him during his playing days in the 60 s berle taught torre how to smoke a cigar , took him to a dodgers game on an offday once and held a roast in his honor two years ago orlando hern ndez said he felt fine after allowing five runs in five innings in thursday s 164 loss to the cincinnati reds hern ndez , whose start was pushed back two days because of tightness in his elbow , said he believes he will be ready for the regular season hern ndez hit two batters and allowed six hits , but he threw 80 pitches and said he did not feel limited torre said hern ndez would start the fifth or sixth game of the season photo luis sojo played six seasons for the yankees and hit the decisive single in the final game of the subway series \( steve nesius for the new york times \)
bangkok , aug 24 a leader of myanmar s military junta said this week that democracy would not come quickly to the country , the former burma , and that when it did it might look quite different from democracy in the west such a transition cannot be done in haste and in a haphazard manner , said lt gen khin nyunt , the thirdranking member of the junta coming three months after the release from house arrest of the prodemocracy leader , daw aung san suu kyi , the general s remarks were a reminder that her freedom did not signal the significant changes some people had hoped for since her release on may 6 from 18 months of confinement , mrs aung san suu kyi has been allowed to travel widely and to meet with her supporters , something she had been barred from doing for more than a decade but the confidencebuilding talks she had been having with the generals before her release have not resumed , nor have there been the substantive policy talks she predicted the junta has continued to free small groups of political prisoners , but the slow pace has drawn the first critical comments from mrs aung san suu kyi since may more than 1 , 000 political prisoners are estimated to be in detention until all our political prisoners are free , none of us can say that burma is now truly on the road to democratic change , she said in a videotaped statement in his speech last monday , general khin nyunt made it clear that the government s fundamental positions had not changed with the release of the opposition leader the world is full of examples where a hasty transition from one system to another led to unrest , instability and even failed states , he said the democracy that we seek to build may not be identical to that which prevails in the west but it will surely be based on universal principles of liberty , justice and equality this is essentially the same position the junta has stated since coming to power in 1988 it justified repression by saying that moving to democracy was a delicate process that required time the government demonstrated its determination to keep a tight grip on the country this week by arresting 21 students in its first major crackdown since it freed mrs aung san suu kyi three were arrested apparently for starting an unauthorized literary group and one for distributing prodemocracy pamphlets general khin nyunt s position was given added weight by an endorsement from the visiting malaysian prime minister , mahathir mohamad we are aware that the process of change must be gradual , said dr mahathir , who has been encouraging the generals in their new , more open stance a united nations envoy , razali ismail , struck an optimistic note when he paid his eighth visit to myanmar two weeks ago mr razali , a malaysian diplomat close to dr mahathir , predicted unspecified major changes in the year to come he said that the junta would begin substantive talks with mrs aung san suu kyi very soon and that there was a possibility that she would be allowed to travel in asia early this month , mrs aung san suu kyi endorsed some foreign assistance for myanmar after she met with foreign minister yoriko kawaguchi of japan , a japanese spokesman said mrs aung san suu kyi does not oppose foreign assistance which will reach really needy people , but in that process transparency and accountability should be guaranteed
michael r bloomberg , the candidate , was firmly opposed to raising taxes , arguing they would destroy this city mr bloomberg , the mayor , changed his tune only slightly after he was sworn in , saying tax increases were still anathema , largely because they could never get approved in an election year but now , the mayor has all but conceded that new taxes whether property , personal income or commuter are coming and he has referred to other ways of raising the city s revenues , like tolls on the east river bridges and increased fines and summonses for certain violations mr bloomberg is also clearly in the process of making large cuts to the city s budget , which , he said this week , could come up 1 billion short at the end of the current fiscal year all city agencies have been asked to report to city hall with ideas for 75 percent cuts among them proposals to close some firehouses at night and to trim the police force further , 103 sanitation workers who once toiled at fresh kills landfill in staten island were laid off this week , although mr bloomberg insisted yesterday that widespread labor cuts were his last resort but the budget conversation in new york has tilted over the last week toward how the city can raise money , even as the governor and other officials balk at the notion this has puzzled many budget experts , who wonder why mr bloomberg does not hold off on the tax talk until he has made public more of the inevitable cuts coming new york s way it is popular in new york politics to talk about taxes only as a last resort , said edmund j mcmahon jr , a senior fellow at the manhattan institute , a conservative research and policy center but in fact now it is the only thing anybody is talking about everyone has a checklist drawn up of their favorite taxes , and yet no one seems to have a checklist outlining spending reductions there are several reasons that the tax talk has gotten so much more explicit in recent weeks for one thing , wall street is not recovering at the rate of even pessimistic projections made last spring , and the city s tax receipts foreshadow more gloom in reviewing our projections for the next eight months , mr bloomberg said yesterday on his weekly radio program , the rest of fiscal '03 , going from now until june 30th , is starting to look like the revenues may come in lower than what we projected before further , it can be easier for officials to talk about potential tax increases , which most residents ignore or go into denial about , as opposed to specific spending cuts , which tend to galvanize special interest groups to oppose them fundamentally you want to keep your plans for cuts as quietly as possible so the constituency for that cut does n't fight back , said doug turetsky , a spokesman for the city s independent budget office just as important , as the candidates for governor enter the home stretch of the campaign , none are eager to tell new yorkers about the service cuts ahead as one city hall official put it as soon as the election is over , the debate will change there are going to be cuts and taxes and service decreases the debate will be over the mix mr bloomberg has said repeatedly over the last two weeks that the city cannot cut its way to solvency this week , union leaders were told that the department of sanitation would lay off 103 employees this is the first set of layoffs since mayor rudolph w giuliani laid off about 800 public hospital workers in 1998 the bottom line is that there simply is no work for these specialized trade workers right now , vito a turso , a spokesman for the department , said yesterday bloomberg officials said yesterday that this was not part of a citywide layoff package and on his radio program , the mayor said of labor cuts that will be my last resort but if it comes down to a last resort , the law says that i 've got to do it meanwhile , he has begun talking again about putting tolls on the east river bridges , and his deputies have sent out feelers to the city council about a possible property tax increase council officials , who called for a tax package last spring when the current budget was being negotiated , are angry that mr bloomberg left the property tax issue for a year in which many members will be seeking reelection and gov george e pataki stated outright this week that he would not brook a commuter tax , and that he disliked the idea of east river tolls the governor s spokesman , michael mckeon , denied there was any tension over this disagreement but mr mckeon , who often takes pains to stress the unity of the two elected leaders , also said this week that mr pataki had not considered the toll issue , the very same day the governor told a newspaper editorial board that he did indeed oppose tolls , and the day after mr pataki reiterated his opposition publicly privately , staff members on both sides have joked about how the tenor of discussions may shift after the election and one aide to the governor pointed out that mr bloomberg s recent comments have actually been helpful are we irritated that the governor gets to tell people in the suburbs that we are not going to raise commuter taxes \? no , the aide said does it bother me that we can tell people in brooklyn and queens that we are not going to make them pay to come into the city \? not a bit but others , especially fiscal conservatives , are less amused they say the city failed to make tough budget cuts in the last goround , and that 250 million worth of concessions the city asked the unions for have not yet materialized they also say talking about taxes now diminishes the urgency to cut services if you give up taxes from the getgo , there is nothing to negotiate , one former city official said you 've got to have the cuts on the table that can be bought back with revenue increases william t cunningham , mr bloomberg s communications director , said that the talk would turn to budget cuts again soon enough we do n't have a final product to show you yet , he said if agencies say they can only get to 3 percent or 5 percent , then sometimes we have to show them where they can cut more that process is probably not as juicy an item as the word 'tolls' photo the city s tax receipts for this fiscal year may fall short of even pessimistic projections made last spring , mayor michael r bloomberg said yesterday \( frances roberts for the new york times \)

washington , feb 20 treasury secretary paul h o'neill said today that the world bank had driven poor countries into a ditch by lending instead of donating funds to fight poverty , and he sharply criticized allies for failing to back a plan to revamp aid policies none of the united states' counterparts in the group of 7 industrialized nations has endorsed a proposal by president bush that would convert half of all development loans to grants despite months of lobbying by washington britain , france and germany insisted at a recent negotiating session that mr bush s proposal could hobble the world bank , the main lender to poor nations in a well publicized speech last july , mr bush called grants like these compassionate conservatism at the international level his argument was that it made more sense to donate money for health , education and sanitation projects than to burden poor countries with debt mr bush said he would like to see up to 50 percent of the world bank s 6 billion in annual outlays for the poorest countries provided in grants , compared with about 1 percent now european countries have remained cool to the idea , arguing that making countries pay back the money , even over 40 years at low interest rates , instills discipline among borrowers and lenders some officials also say they fear that the bush administration s proposal could undermine the world bank by forcing it to give away its capital european leaders have said they could support converting as much as 10 percent of the bank s loans to grants canada and japan have indicated that they would back converting 16 percent both are far from the american goal of 50 percent speaking to experts at the international institute of economics in washington today , mr o'neill sharply questioned the logic of europe s position i say the hell with it , he said somebody tell me a good reason for 10 percent mr o'neill said the united states had indicated some flexibility in what percentage of aid should be made in the form of grants , but suggested that 10 percent was too low it s hard for me when i look at primary education and i look at the stage of underdevelopment for billions of people , it s hard for me to say , well , let s do postconflict countries and let s do a little hiv aids and keep it under 10 percent , mr o'neill said american officials had hoped to persuade allies to remake the world bank s antipoverty programs before mr bush attends a development meeting in monterrey , mexico , next month but officials involved in the talks say any overhaul will be much more modest than mr bush and mr o'neill once envisioned mr o'neill expressed frustration at the difficulty of changing the world bank , which he suggested had failed to achieve its desired goals of alleviating poverty at least in part because it contributed to a debt crisis among poor countries lending agencies have driven them into a ditch by extending loans that borrowing nations have trouble repaying , he said , adding that heavy debt loads frighten away global investors
sapporo , japan , june 7 few matches in world cup soccer are as exalted as the showdowns between england and argentina the game tonight between these two bitter foes , the most anticipated of the weekold tournament , was another one for the history books after years of humiliation , england extracted a small measure of revenge by defeating argentina , 10 england s star playmaker , david beckham , scored the winning goal on a penalty kick late in the first half , earning redemption for the red card that had forced him off the field the last time the two teams met in the world cup , in france four years ago the game tonight featured nothing as dramatic as the infamous hand of god goal by diego maradona in 1986 , but the passing was sharp , the defense gritty and the emotion high while not an upset on the scale of senegal s victory over france or the united states' victory over portugal , england s defeat of the favored argentines added a bit of serendipity to this quirky world cup , the first in asia the closely contested victory also gave england four points and created a twoway tie at the top of the socalled group of death , the most difficult firstround bracket sweden , which beat nigeria , 21 , earlier today , also has four points , while argentina has three nigeria has none and has been eliminated the two teams that will advance from the bracket will be determined wednesday , when england plays nigeria and sweden faces argentina like the epic battles between england and argentina in 1966 , 1986 and 1998 , both sides blocked , stomped and pushed each other from the opening whistle beckham , the team captain and a star with manchester united , drew the loudest cheers and jeers he was returning from a foot injury inflicted by an argentine player earlier this year four years ago , he was sent off for fouling diego simeone , who was playing for argentina again today beckham loomed just as large today , making amends for his disastrous performance in 1998 he barked orders to his teammates and fired pinpoint passes across midfield and from the corners with time running out in the first half , michael owen , who made several graceful runs , was tripped by mauricio pochettino in the penalty zone beckham buried the penalty kick , exorcising some of the demons from his world cup closet it s unbelievable , beckham said afterward it s been four years it s been a long four years the penalty kick ended a 45minute period filled with hardnosed jockeying argentina started the game challenging every english possession , hoping to force an error and hush the bellowing british fans both sides struggled to find openings , the argentines with long , graceful strikes and the english with short passes with few openings to be had , the players resorted to elbows and stray kicks the referee , pierluigi collina , dished out yellow cards to the argentine striker gabriel batistuta and the english defender ashley cole argentina , which featured five veterans from the 1998 world cup team , controlled the ball for long stretches in the second half , but could not find the net argentine coach marcelo bielsa tried to find the right formula , removing batistuta in favor of hern n crespo at the 61st minute but the men in red repelled repeated attacks by the sharpshooting argentine team , leading the ultrapartisan english supporters to breathe collective sighs of relief it was very hard in the last few minutes , england s coach , svengoran eriksson , said we were tired and they attacked a lot when the final whistle blew , both sides ignored custom and did not exchange jerseys the argentines coolly walked off the field the english , eager for a teammate s hug instead of a rival s handshake , went to the stands to bathe in the cheers of their fans
rereading books is a form of archaeology you excavate old selves fragments of them anyway and once you start to look closely your view of the present changes at least as much as your view of the past how old were you when you first read huckleberry finn \? we studied it in english class my freshman year in high school , with an excellent and progressive teacher who made quite a point of its being a major work of literature and social criticism this did not stop me from being embarrassed by nigger jim not all the way through the book , but certainly in more than one place i did n't really know how to express this clearly ambivalence is always hard to express clearly and it did n't help that i was the only one in the class who shared jim s racial origins \( a fact that never fazed me when we discussed a text with just white characters \) clearly i was not and am not alone in this ambivalence people are still arguing about whether huckleberry finn is a racist book and whether or not it should be banned on those grounds no , it should never be banned it should be read , analyzed and debated actually , debated is too tepid a word it should be disputed , quarreled over , with intelligence and opponents need to find words and ideas a lot more textured than racist \( meaning how dare we read and admire anything in it \? \) or masterpiece \( meaning how dare we name and be troubled by its shortcomings \? \) i see now that when it comes to jim , huck s mixed feelings and actions are twain s how could it be otherwise \? he was a man of his time , even as he was ahead of it huck is a backwoods deadend kid \( precursor of the juvenile delinquent who would obsess america a century later \) also a rebel who finds a just cause without having to give up his prankster rights jim is a runaway slave , an ingratiating servantcompanion and a clown , the object of bumptious jokes between huck and tom and between huck and the reader jim is also a clown in the process of becoming a man with a right to the reader s respect first by running away , then by starting to voice opinions and objections these contradictions run all through twain s work the lighthearted jests and reassuring plots the hard , cold eye and exacting ear of a satirist i think his split selves mirror the divide between jim as clown and jim as man twain was an ambitious and demanding writer he was an applausehungry comic too , a minstrel himself if we define minstrelsy as a form of broad comedy a comedy of topical extravagance performed from behind an ethnic mask think of twain onstage , telling his jokes and tales all in white white hair , white mustache , white suit he is one of those writers dickens is another whose works are performances as much as written fictions we build a stage for them in our minds and then we watch and listen , responding to every gesture and intonation \( we do n't respond to hawthorne or melville that way , or to trollope or eliot \) i used to resent the advantage that being the novel s narrator gave huck but twain could n't possibly have imagined jim from inside , the way he did huck he made the right choice , artistically and culturally he was learning as he wrote that s a crucial part of the book s fascination , and its knotty , ugly greatness the jazz composer thelonious monk called one of his pieces ugly beauty to me ugly beauty is the glorious paradox of the best american art when it comes to race and gender greatness has nothing to do with finality or perfection can the artist bring all of his or her resources talent and craft , thought and feeling , courage and vulnerability to the work \? that is the test but on to europe for a moment i was recently urged to reread anna karenina by a writer friend who reads it every 10 years or so at 13 or 14 \( that s when i first read it too \) , she was enchanted by anna s affair with vronsky , but the way a child in a theater is enchanted safely outside it all , seated in the audience by her early 20 s she felt she understood the lineaments of anna s desire her emotional identification was complete and free of complications ten years later and newly married , she found herself frightened , even alienated , by the reckless power of adultery in the novel a decade after that , still safely married , she found the question of infidelity \( its pull , its repercussions \) intriguing to contemplate now both of us are old enough to know that the choices people make or refuse to make can have unalterable consequences \( who thinks anything is unalterable at 20 or 30 \? \) maybe anna was more a fool for love than a heroine anna s husband was a decent man , if cold how much consideration did he merit \? when i was young , my friend said , i never thought about my place in a social geography and from a very different perspective i am single i found myself appalled and terrified as i finally reread this book that vronsky had to give up his career mattered to me i could n't give up my work for anyone and , awful as it was to admit , when anna left her family she left her internal protections behind , not just her social ones i wanted to shout stop ! find another way the two of you will be left alone in a void with nothing but obsessive love you 'll starve but none of this is just personal , to borrow jay gatsby s words rereading is cultural archaeology too new criticism , marxist criticism , biography and psychoanalysis , deconstruction , africanamerican and ethnic studies , postcolonial studies and feminist criticism every school of criticism unearths material that some dismiss and others welcome books like huckleberry finn and anna karenina are artifacts through them we trace centuries of private desire , public ideology , artistic struggle and historical necessity drawing \( dusan petricic \)
in a sign of how a thirdparty candidate , especially a rich one , can roil the political waters , tom golisano , the presumed winner of the independence party primary and a persistent annoyance to gov george e pataki , plans a fresh barrage of television advertisements within a couple of days advisers to mr golisano , who is pressing ahead even without a final vote tally , declined to describe the content of the advertisements yesterday , but in the primary and his past two campaigns for governor , mr golisano , a billionaire businessman from rochester , has harshly criticized mr pataki s perceived shortcomings mr pataki , the republican incumbent who is widely considered to be the frontrunner in the race over mr golisano and the democratic nominee , h carl mccall , may begin broadcasting his own ads as soon as tomorrow , his aides said mr mccall s advisers declined to comment on that aspect of their strategy the talk of media campaigns reflected the behindthescenes strategizing going on yesterday , even as the three candidates suspended campaigning in deference to the sept 11 anniversary the day after a primary is usually filled with blatant politicking , as winning candidates barnstorm the state and hold victory rallies not this year the anniversary is also believed to have tempered voter interest turnout was 115 percent of registered voters , the lowest for a governor s race primary in the past three decades , said lee daghlian , a spokesman for the state board of elections mr pataki and mr mccall , the state comptroller , spent much of the day after the primaries at commemorations and memorial services mr golisano also stayed off the campaign trail , meeting with advisers and telephoning his supporters unofficial results showed mr golisano leading mr pataki 52 to 48 percent in the independence primary , potentially delivering mr pataki his first loss ever in an election the difference , as of late yesterday , was 900 votes although mr golisano s aides were confident that the results would stick , and mr pataki s aides all but conceded , the results will not be official until an uncertain number of absentee ballots are counted , probably by the end of next week besides his republican ballot line , mr pataki also sought the independence nomination to knock mr golisano , an adversary with a lot of money for ads , out of the race mr pataki , according to unofficial results , handily beat mr golisano on the conservative ballot line mr golisano was competing as a writein candidate , a longshot strategy few political analysts give mr golisano much chance to overtake mr pataki and mr mccall , but he can make mr pataki s bid for a third term tougher by tarnishing his image with negative commercials and delivering an antitax message that could draw away republican voters roger stone , mr golisano s campaign strategist , said yesterday that mr golisano had already spent slightly less than 30 million on his campaign , and was willing to spend even more than the 75 million paid out of his own personal fortune that he had pledged to spend but mr stone insisted that mr golisano was not just a spoiler we think this can be developed into a viable threeway race , he said tom golisano is not in the race to help another candidate or hurt another candidate mr stone said that while mr golisano would hammer mr pataki for what he considered his failure to pull upstate new york out of the economic doldrums , he would also broaden his message mr golisano , mr stone said , is expected to address the corrupting influence of specialinterest money in albany , the lack of ethics in state government and even mr mccall s record as state comptroller some of this may sound similar to the platform of andrew m cuomo , a democratic candidate who quit the race a week before the primary a number of his former aides at the department of housing and urban development work for mr golisano but mr golisano s supporters contend that mr cuomo , who worked several years as an adviser to his father , former gov mario m cuomo , was not a credible messenger tom comes in as a legitimate outsider , said gordon black , mr golisano s campaign manager in 1994 and now an independent pollster he can posture himself as an honest broker even if mr golisano does not see himself as a spoiler , mr mccall does his aides say privately that they expect mr golisano s advertisements to take pressure off mr mccall to broadcast negative commercials about mr pataki a twoway advantage to mr mccall , who two weeks ago had just 25 million left to spend on his own ads the main focus for mr mccall , who plans to resume campaigning today , remains mr pataki , who the mccall campaign believes is vulnerable on the upstate economy and education over and over , mr mccall has assailed the governor for appealing a lawsuit that could have forced the state to spend more money on urban school districts mr mccall , in an interview tuesday , also suggested he was worried that mr pataki s aggressive courting of hispanic voters may be paying off although his advisers declined to say when mr mccall would begin broadcasting commercials again , he said that at some point the ads would include prominent hispanics such as fernando ferrer , the former bronx borough president , and representatives nydia m vel zquez and jos e serrano meanwhile , the primary results revealed another political twist , created by election board officials in new york city unlike in the rest of the state , working families candidates were not on the ballot in voting machines in the city the city board of elections said there simply was not room for the line as a result , every working families voter in the five boroughs had to cast a paper ballot , none of which will be counted until tomorrow dan cantor , executive director of the party , an ally of the democrats , did not seem fazed we will have a unified statewide ticket with the democrats , guaranteed , mr cantor said he said it might be possible to exploit quirks in the election laws that would allow for the removal of candidates from the ballot this would help ensure that mr mccall could run with his chosen running mate , dennis mehiel , and that alan hevesi would be his party s comptroller candidate
geneva when the colombian peace talks collapsed on feb 20 , local authorities in towns and villages around the former peace zone had less than three hours' warning before president andres pastrana sent planes and helicopters to bomb their territory they had no time to organize protection for civilians georgina and adam , who feared that divulging their full names would be unsafe , were two people i met in the village of los pozos their small plot abutted the government s negotiation site none of the negotiators from the government or the revolutionary armed forces of colombia , known as farc , ever dropped by to greet them they are very poor , and the poor in colombia are invisible georgina is 70 adam is 84 in the photograph on my desk , they stand side by side outside the oneroom wooden shack that has been their home for 30 years georgina , short and sturdy , barely reaches to adam s chest her strong face is deeply lined , but despite the harshness of her life , her expression is warm and gentle adam is thin and rather frail he holds himself very straight and looks sternly at the camera the day i took their picture , georgina insisted i share their lunch a slice of plantain , a slice of yucca and a fish the size of a sardine , taken from the nearby river we met on a saturday in january the peace process was in crisis ten days earlier , president pastrana had broken off talks and given the farc 48 hours to abandon its governmentsanctioned safe haven representatives of the united nations , the international community and the catholic church were working around the clock to avert war on that saturday they had not yet achieved an agreement , and the colombian army was waiting for the expiration of the midnight deadline on sunday to attack adam yearned for peace , a clean peace , he said , that lets us work when i asked him what would happen if the talks should collapse , he made a sudden , wordless gesture that meant , we 'll be off how \? where to \? he did n't know he only knew that after three years of involuntary cohabitation with the farc , he and georgina would be marked people the war between the guerrillas and the government is not their war , but that would not matter to either side president bush has been right in refusing to become more deeply involved in this war and in refusing to expand american assistance from counternarcotics to counterinsurgency less than two weeks ago he said , we are providing advice to the colombian government as to drug eradication , and we will keep it that way but the political pressure to change is growing the pentagon and officials from other parts of the bush administration , as well as president pastrana , are trying to tie the war between the colombian government and the farc to the global war against terrorism last week the house passed a nonbinding resolution backing colombia in its efforts against united statesdesignated foreign terrorist organizations , which would include the farc and mr powell stated that the new situation in colombia may require the united states to readjust its policies such a shift in policy would be fundamentally wrong and must be resisted at all costs sad as it is to report , there are no good guys in the colombian war picture the guerrilla insurgency is not the cause of colombia s distress it is a symptom of a national sickness deeply rooted in a corrupted political system that system is imploding there is no legitimate partner in this conflict for the united states this does not mean the united states has no role to play colombia urgently needs washington s help the tragedy for both countries is that historically , the united states has used its influence to strengthen many of the worst elements of a byzantine society whose complexities washington has never succeeded in deciphering what makes colombia so difficult to understand is its political system formally a civilian democracy , the government is an unequal partnership between two forces one civilian and democratic , the other military over the last 25 years , the military partner has increased its power and the war has escalated every attempt by the civilians to bring peace has been shot down by the military s dirty war throughout these long and bloody years , the civilian partner has skillfully concealed its complicity in the dominance of its military partner , thus perpetuating the fiction of civilian and democratic governance the resulting state is one in which democracy and barbarism coexist and the military which practices dirty warfare against the system s democratic opponents has failed to develop a professional army capable of fighting the guerrillas effectively the state and the army are now collapsing president bush confronts an enormous challenge can the united states devise a fresh strategy , focused on strengthening the independent democratic forces on the fringes of the colombian political establishment \? their survival now depends on american help to stop the war and make possible a return to negotiations under minimal conditions a bilateral ceasefire , rigorously monitored by an independent third force the release of all the farc s hostages and the inclusion of an international mediator and representatives of civil society at the negotiations such an outcome is not unrealistic with washington on board it would protect and give a say to those civil society forces that are america s true colombian friends it would help lay the basis for the construction of a democratic and stable society after three years of a tense calm , people in the former peace zone have been engulfed in this ferocious war thousands are fleeing one image from my recent visit haunts me georgina and adam set out stools beside the dirt road leading to the negotiation site , and there they sat gazing up the hill to where the mediators were working two old people , in the falling dusk , waiting for someone to tell them whether they would need to flee their home i wonder what happened to them one month later were they sleeping when the army bombed the zone \?
new yorkers give gov george e pataki high marks over all , especially on his response to the world trade center attack and its aftermath , despite some misgivings about his handling of the economy , a new york times poll shows in his bid for a third term , mr pataki is running strongly across geographic , ethnic and ideological lines , with less than three weeks until election day while he is not faring quite as well as a republican usually would upstate and among conservatives , he more than compensates with serious inroads into traditional democratic voting blocs , like new york city voters , hispanics and liberals all of which spells serious trouble for h carl mccall , his democratic opponent the poll shows mr pataki leading mr mccall , the state comptroller , by 11 percentage points among likely voters the times surveyed 860 registered voters in new york , with a sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points of those judged likely to vote , the sampling error is plus or minus five percentage points on each candidate among registered voters , 64 percent approve of the governor s performance in office , against 27 percent who disapprove a rating that is near his alltime high he wins his best grades , by far , for his handling of the world trade center attack approval of his response is 83 percent , and on his handling of the recovery , 71 percent approve voters rate him moderately well on areas like the environment , education and cutting taxes , though no more than a small fraction say he has made a lot of progress in any of those areas but new yorkers take a lukewarm view of mr pataki s economic record an area that weighs heavily on their minds , with 55 percent rating new york s economy as fairly bad or very bad when asked what the next governor should focus on , two out of five voters said the economy or unemployment twice as many people named the economy or unemployment as a priority for the next governor to focus on as named education , the highest priority four years ago only 47 percent of voters approve of mr pataki s handling of economic development , against 39 percent who disapprove on creating jobs and taming the state s large debt , nearly half the voters surveyed say mr pataki has made not much progress or none at all perhaps most striking , more than half of all voters say they believe that their taxes will be raised , whether mr pataki or mr mccall wins on nov 5 in one warning sign for the governor , by a small margin , 49 percent to 42 percent , more voters say they think mr pataki will be more interested in helping special interests than ordinary people , while the opposite is true of mr mccall thirtyseven percent say they think mr mccall will favor special interests , while 46 percent think he will favor ordinary people among likely voters , 39 percent say they would vote for mr pataki , to 28 percent for mr mccall and 16 percent for tom golisano , the independence party nominee when undecided voters are pressed to say which way they are leaning and are added to the totals , mr pataki receives 42 percent , mr mccall 31 percent and mr golisano 17 percent , while 8 percent remain undecided mr golisano does best among voters upstate , where the concerns about the economy are strongest upstate , 40 percent favor mr pataki , 17 percent are for mr mccall and 21 percent are for mr golisano but the governor is at 50 percent in the new york city suburbs , and only 26 percent in the city itself this poll , like every other public poll , demonstrated again that governor pataki has strong , broad support and will be elected in november , said michael mckeon , a spokesman for the pataki campaign but steven greenberg , a mccall campaign spokesman , said the survey was cause for optimism in his camp this shows that there s an incredible amount of room for growth in carl s numbers , he said what we have to do is bring democrats home , and i think they will come home in droves , because people are just starting to focus on this race ernest c baynard , a spokesman for mr golisano , said the poll did not accurately reflect mr golisano s strength upstate and the candidate s gains among new york city residents , particularly latinos and africanamericans the times poll draws with unforgiving clarity the weaknesses of mr mccall , who has been badly outspent on two sides , and has often seemed slow and unfocused in responding to the governor s attacks most important , he has yet to establish his identity in voters' minds by a 2to1 ratio , voters who know of him have a favorable opinion of him but tellingly , after he has spent nine years in statewide office and more than a year running for governor , half of all voters say they either do not have a firm opinion of mr mccall or do not know enough about him to establish one when his supporters are asked what they like best about mr mccall , by far the most common response , at 28 percent , is his party affiliation a sign of just how unfocused he remains in the public eye only 6 percent of mr pataki s supporters say party is what they like best about him
with the publication of memoirs \( random house \) in october , david rockefeller has beaten his wouldbe biographers to the punch the grandson of the oil magnate john d rockefeller and one of five brothers who grew up to oversee the family s financial and philanthropic interests , mr rockefeller has had a substantial role in 20thcentury events given his family s general reticence , he had much to tell david rockefeller was born in 1915 , the youngest child of john d rockefeller jr and abby aldrich rockefeller after graduating from harvard and receiving a doctorate in economics from the university of chicago , mr rockefeller married margaret mcgrath , a mount kisco native , and then served in world war ii as an army intelligence officer his entire business career was spent at chase manhattan bank , where he rose to become chief executive officer and chairman mr rockefeller grew up in one of the several homes on his family s pocantico hills estate , and he still lives on the estate , but in a different house memoirs , which took 10 years to complete , provides an intimate portrait of his family there at one time the rockefellers owned close to 4 , 000 acres now all but 500 acres has been given to the state mr rockefeller s wife died in 1996 he is close to his six children and 10 grandchildren , many of whom were surprised by the book s candor , he said occupying his time these days is a project that will convert part of his working cattle farm , hudson pines , into an educational center he recently sat for an interview in his manhattan office , answering questions in his trademark polite and humble manner q what has kept the rockefeller family in westchester for more than 100 years \? a the most important thing was that grandfather was able to find a sizable piece of beautiful property overlooking the hudson , near where his brother william already lived then he developed the property , had carriage roads and a golf course built , and made it attractive to us it continues to give us all a great deal of pleasure of course , it s extraordinarily convenient to new york city q has the county s allure changed much over the years \? a no the more i visit friends on long island and in connecticut , the happier i am that the family settled in westchester it has preserved a simplicity and lack of formality , and i find that appealing q what do you remember most about your grandfather \? a i used to see him a lot i was 21 when he died he spent a lot of time during the spring and fall at kykuit , and he encouraged me , and his other grandchildren as well , to come and see him he was a loving and fun grandfather he told amusing stories and sang little ditties he gave us dimes since my other three grandparents all died about the year i was born , he was the only grandparent i knew q you collect beetles what spurred your interest in entomology \? a i got interested one summer in maine through a class in nature studies given by a professor of biology from tufts university she had a course for young children , and henry ford ii and i were two of her pupils i continued my interest in it for years while i was at school , and often i 'd go to the museum of natural history and work with the head beetle specialist there i was able to spend two summers at an insect study station in tuxedo park , collecting insects and studying their habits one experiment we set up tried to determine whether bees had a memory q how many different species of beetles have you collected on your family s westchester property \? a i 've been working on this lately and i 'll soon be able to give you a specific answer i probably have collected around 150 , 000 specimens of about 10 , 000 species , and even discovered some q of the thousands of acres your family has owned in westchester , which places do you like the most \? a rockwood hall , which belonged to my brother laurance and was given to the state , is certainly a beautiful place buttermilk hill would be another one of my favorite places the carriage roads there , the earliest ones , were built by grandfather q whatever happened to the house you grew up in on the pocantico estate , abeyton lodge \? a it was torn down after world war ii grandfather died in 1937 , and not long before the war began mother and father moved to kykuit after the war it became apparent that none of the children wanted to live in abeyton lodge it was very big and comfortable , but required a pretty big staff to run all of us had our own homes , in tarrytown and elsewhere , and we really would n't have wanted nonfamily members living inside the fence , so it seemed more logical to tear it down than just leave it there empty i have happy memories of the house , but i do n't believe in having places that lack utility and are expensive to maintain it was n't a great architectural monument and there was no reason to keep it that i could see q in thinking about the future of westchester , is overdevelopment a threat \? a i'm concerned to the degree with which westchester has just become a place for people who are working in new york city to spend the night if you fly over the county in a helicopter , which i do quite frequently , you see there is very little land left that is still wooded it s either dense clusters of houses and , of course , yonkers is a city or just spotted with places where there s nothing but homes that s one reason why the property in pocantico hills is so important part of it is already a park and more of it will be hopefully development is slowing down in westchester it 'll be interesting to see what happens with the general motors property in sleepy hollow q should the nuclear power plant at indian point be closed \? a france depends almost entirely on nuclear energy , and as far as i know they 've never had a problem with it the bogey of this being a threat is not impressive it s there , it s operating successfully and i do n't see any reason to do away with it not all of my family agrees with me , however photo david rockefeller , a grandson of john d rockefeller , who lives on his family s pocantico hills estate \( thomas staudter for the new york times \)
the giant accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers is in the midst of its annual audit on tyco international what inquiring minds want to know is whether the accountants , who missed some of the recent shenanigans at the company , will go easy on tyco this year or will they try tough love in their audit \? asking the questions is more than just an intellectual exercise depending upon how pricewaterhouse assesses the company s enormous amount of good will and other intangible assets on its balance sheet , tyco could be in violation of a covenant on some recently negotiated bank debt last february , a few months before l dennis kozlowski went from esteemed to indicted , tyco negotiated two bank loans totaling about 58 billion one , for 38 billion , is due in four months , the other in 2006 j p morgan chase was the lead bank on both a covenant on both loans dictates that tyco s consolidated debt cannot exceed 525 percent of its total capitalization on june 30 , tyco s debt was 49 percent that cushion could vanish fast if pricewaterhouse finds that tyco s good will is seriously impaired and that some deserves to be written off given dealaday dennis s record of overpaying for acquisitions , which results in ballooning good will , and given that profit margins in all four of the company s businesses have dropped the last four quarters , a hefty writedown is a distinct possibility such a writedown would reduce tyco s total capitalization tyco s balance sheet groaned under good will and other intangible assets of 336 billion in june that figure has more than doubled since 2000 and has more than quadrupled since 1998 amazingly , in june , good will equaled tyco s shareholder equity , or net worth , and accounts for 48 percent of total assets at the company good will is spread among tyco s operations the electronics business has 85 billion , before a 25 billion writedown it has announced in its telecom unit health care has 72 billion fire and security has 82 billion and engineered products , 31 billion other intangible assets amount to 65 billion so how big a writedown of good will or intangibles would put tyco in violation of the debttototal capitalization covenant \? roughly 48 billion , or about 15 percent , of its current intangibles to be sure , the company has more than 5 billion in cash , and tyco could use some of this to reduce the debt assuming that tyco used 3 billion for that , a writedown of 74 billion would put the company in violation of the debt covenant there is a wild card in this debt , however because all of tyco s lenders have equal status none is senior to another if certain debt starts to be repaid , other lenders could become nervous about their loans and demand repayments , too almost all of tyco s debt is unsecured not backed by assets unsecured lenders typically become nervous more easily than those whose loans are secured which brings us back to pricewaterhouse and its audit it is possible that the firm will decide that none of tyco s good will is impaired , require no writedowns and keep the company well within its loan covenants but pricewaterhouse might also think it wise to be a wee bit conservative in its tyco audit this year after all , the recent indictment of mr kozlowski by robert m morgenthau , the manhattan district attorney , indicated that pricewaterhouse missed some highly questionable transactions at tyco people at pricewaterhouse are under investigation for their tyco work there s no telling what pricewaterhouse will do , of course the firm would not comment , but a spokesman said that it always scrutinizes good will of a material nature in audits but shareholders may not have to wait too long for the news last year s annual report shows that pricewaterhouse signed off on tyco s books on oct 18 chart close to its limit the percentage of tyco international s assets that are made up of good will and other intangible items graph shows the percentage of tyco international s assets that are made up of good will and other intangible items , with fiscal years ending in september from 1998 to june 2002

jack b grubman , the former star telecommunications analyst who resigned on thursday from salomon smith barney , wants your sympathy sure , he made 20 million a year urging investors to buy untested telecom stocks even as they nosedived and yes , he is walking away with almost 32 million in cash and stock even after most of the companies he followed are in tatters still , mr grubman wants you to know that he , too , is a victim if investors need any more evidence that many folks in high places on wall street still do n't get it and may never , they need read no further than mr grubman s resignation letter it contains just one parenthetical reference to his woeful record in stockpicking , which was his job to get right , not wrong the rest of the letter was a whinefest worthy of a 6yearold the current climate of criticism , mr grubman wrote , has made it impossible for him to perform to his high standards apparently , mr grubman is effective only when stock prices are rising the relentless series of negative statements about my work , all of which i believe unfairly single me out , has begun to undermine my efforts to analyze telecommunications companies , he added never mind that most of the companies he touted are either in bankruptcy or trade for pennies a share , which could easily undermine anyone s analytic efforts and while he said he did n't like being singled out now , mr grubman had no trouble being in the spotlight as the topranked analyst or one of the highestpaid researchers on wall street during the boom this constant barrage of unsubstantiated , negative reports , mr grubman continued , has caused my family great pain this is surely true but what about the families across america whose retirement or collegefund portfolios have been devastated by staying too long at the telecom party at mr grubman s urging \? for instance , what about the people who bought or held on to worldcom in the fall of 2000 when the stock was 25 because mr grubman said it would hit 87 \? worldcom shares closed on friday at 12 cents because mr grubman tried to take much of the glory for the telecom boom he was featured on magazine covers and sat alongside telecom executives as they announced big acquisitions he became the perfect fall guy when telecom went bust but mr grubman was by no means alone in pumping up the telecom bubble he had much help from his colleagues in salomon s investment banking group so far , these people have escaped much attention some have departed salomon for other firms , but all made enormous money helping to finance the sector , perhaps even bigger money than mr grubman pocketed they were the guys behind the curtain while mr grubman was taking his bows but they are every bit as culpable as mr grubman for the 2 trillion in losses that investors and lenders have incurred in the telecom sector in recent years they were the ones who advised telecom companies to load up on debt , creating a capital structure for many of them that was bound to fail these bankers include tony whittemore and david diwik , who left salomon for deutsche bank in november 2000 , and tom jones and christopher lawrence , former salomon bankers now at credit suisse first boston others still at salomon are john otto , steve winningham , eduardo mestre and thomas king mr mestre , mr king and mr whittemore were among those cementing the worldcom relationship at the bank none of the bankers would come to the phone to discuss their roles in the telecom debacle or their views on mr grubman s departure from salomon they may want to avoid the spotlight but they belong in it , too right next to mr grubman graph telecom s tumble shows telecom s nasdaq index since 2000
gay men are accustomed to keeping secrets about themselves it s something we learn early on in the game so shame on me , perhaps , but for a long time i told no one about what i did weeknights between 11 and 12 it may not have been dirty , but it was my little secret and true to my cultural conditioning , i kept it then one evening a few months back in the locker room at a gym on west 14th street , an especially macho latino bodybuilder asked if i had any plans actually , what he said was , so , whaddya up to later \? maybe it was the rush of endorphins from working out , or maybe i just wanted to see the expression on his chiseled face , but for whatever reason i looked straight into his bedroom eyes and said , same as usual going home , having dinner and watching 'the golden girls suddenly , a couple of lockers away , a pumpedup young puerto rican who goes by the curious nickname of coogi boy stopped changing and started singing though his accent was thick , i recognized the little song he sang the moment the first words were out of his mouth thank you for being a friend it was the theme song to the golden girls , of course , and while coogi boy was n't a particularly gifted singer , to my ear his a cappella rendition of it was not only beautiful , but also inspiring thank you for being a friend , indeed never again , i thought , will i be anything less than out , loud and proud about tuning in to lifetime television to watch backtoback reruns of a syndicated sitcom about four postmenopausal women with hair that does n't move , who share a fourbedroom , pastelcolored , concreteblock suburban house in a part of miami beach where they do not have an ian schrager hotel or a david barton gym or a particularly sweaty stretch of beach that locals like to refer to as speedo lido as every gay man knows from coming out , once you finally realize that you are not alone , you quickly realize just how not alone you are in the days and weeks following my lockerroom epiphany , i did a bit of random polling , which led me to deduce that monday through thursday from 11 to midnight , legions of gay men were doing precisely what i was doing from coogi boy , who lives up in the bronx , to many of my exceedingly fashionable neighbors downtown you know , the kind of men who tend to live in duplexes and receive regular deliveries from gucci , prada and yohji yamamoto it became reassuringly clear that many members of my tribe were comparably well acquainted with the better part of the 180 halfhour episodes of the golden girls that originally aired on nbc between 1985 and 1992 in fact , if new york city is any measure , the producers of lifetime , like the publishers of playgirl , might consider expanding their target demographic this was also happy news , because it meant that i could stop chalking up my affection for the show to neurotic nostalgia , to some twisted , lateblooming desire to revisit the notabit halcyon days of my childhood in florida after all , i know this pastel concreteblock house in miami as well as i know my apartment in manhattan i know the clumps of palms and the beds of ferns and the spongy saint augustine grass in the yard i know the driveway leading directly to the garage that opens onto the street , signaling that this is a middleclass neighborhood , as opposed to an uppermiddleclass neighborhood , where the garage never opens onto the street i know the butcherblock island and the metal baker s rack and the little round breakfast table in the kitchen and i know the plush walltowall carpeting and the colorcoordinated art on the wallpapered walls in the dustruffled bedrooms i even know the department store where the bamboo furniture with the loose coral cushions in the living room was purchased , en suite along with the framed print of monet waterlilies in other words , this is exactly the kind of generic suburban house , filled with exactly the kind of generic suburban stuff , that boys like me find so difficult to live in it is the place where we tend to be so awkwardly lodged at that moment when we first sense that there is something about us that is not at all generic something , our instincts tell us , that means this kind of house will never be our home but what is not familiar from my childhood memory of this house , and what i suspect is the thing that draws me to it now on television , is that this time around , four samesex adults live in it , and they use the word family to describe themselves it does n't matter that the four women who call this house their home are heterosexual \( and no , none of them , despite what a cynical friend speculated , reminds me of my mother \) what matters is that these women have succeeded in answering the question , what do you do when the princecharminghappilyeverafter fantasy ends \? the question is one that gay men grapple with from the moment it dawns on us that the odds of our mating for life are not in our favor the fact that we are not typically invited to share this particular fantasy is somehow beside the point as most of us now know , of course , fate tends to turn a blind eye to sexual orientation or as a particularly militant gay friend once quipped , breeders do n't have it much better though there was a decidedly uncharitable edge to the statement , the golden girls suggests he had a point

aboard uss john c stennis , in the arabian sea , march 14 the united states and its allies have intensified their search for taliban and qaeda leaders in the waters off pakistan and iran , convinced that an americanled offensive in eastern afghanistan has eliminated a major terrorist haven and forced the taliban and qaeda commanders to flee in the northern arabian sea , the allies have assembled the largest naval force since world war ii more than 100 warships from a dozen nations , along with helicopters , reconnaissance planes and fighter jets , are combing the ocean for signs of senior qaeda and taliban leaders each day , the allied forces track hundreds of vessels , from lumbering oil tankers to tiny fishing boats , questioning their captains and sometimes dispatching heavily armed boarding parties to check cargo holds and photograph crews on a few occasions , teams of navy seals have been sent to investigate suspicious ships despite the size of the armada , however , not a single taliban or qaeda commander has been found it is a testament , navy officials acknowledge , to the difficulty of trying to locate a few dozen fugitives inside a watery box stretching from eastern pakistan to the gulf of oman an 80 , 000squaremile region roughly the size of kansas the allied armada includes ships from britain , germany , australia , france , the netherlands , canada , italy and japan the united states provides the most ships , about 35 it can be like searching for a needle in a haystack , said lt kelly hinderer , the mission commander on a p3 orion surveillance plane assisting the interdiction operation but senior navy commanders contend that the huge manhunt has pressured qaeda commanders to stay in afghanistan or to try to flee over the rugged mountains into pakistan , where government troops are watching the border as the remaining qaeda and taliban havens are destroyed in afghanistan , some commanders will probably try to escape by boat , navy officials say there is a deterrent effect that is hard to measure , said rear adm james m zortman , commander of the john c stennis carrier battle group , which is overseeing the interdiction operation if we can disrupt their travel routes and force them into lesseasy , lessdeveloped lanes , that may aid us in flushing them to the surface the coalition s task has been complicated by the abundance of wily smugglers who have plied these waters for centuries allied commanders recently became aware of a pakistanbased peoplesmuggling ring that , for less than 100 a person , has been transporting impoverished workers from pakistan and afghanistan across iran and the strait of hormuz to fill menial jobs in oman and the united arab emirates on tuesday , a canadian frigate that was patrolling the gulf of oman rescued 45 pakistani and afghan men who had been left adrift by the smugglers on a small ship without food or water for six days the men told the canadians they had started their journey in karachi six weeks before and had been within 50 miles of their destination , oman , when one of the ships in their party capsized , killing 34 men cmdr jim heath , captain of the canadian frigate hmcs vancouver , said investigators were convinced that none of the men were connected to al qaeda or the taliban but he said the rescue underscored the relative ease with which smugglers operate in the region since november , the allied coalition has been closely watching about two dozen merchant ships that have ties to al qaeda this year , the allies expanded their operation to include questioning every merchant vessel in the past few weeks , the coalition has become more aggressive about boarding the small fishing boats , known as dhows , that crowd the coastline and that are popular vehicles for smugglers since february , the coalition has also expanded its presence in the gulf of oman , which smugglers from iran can cross in less than a day american officials say this could become an escape route for leaders of al qaeda coalition ships also patrol as far south as the horn of africa , on the lookout for qaeda fighters who might be trying to reach somalia or yemen by ship the allied armada , though it has been likened to a blockade , is more like a traffic checkpoint on the lookout for drunken drivers allied ships hail passing merchant vessels by radio and ask them about their cargo , destination and registry the answers are transmitted to a command center on the stennis , where they are checked against a database incomplete or incorrect answers could lead to a search so could refusal to answer , though navy officials say virtually all of the 3 , 500 ships queried to date have cooperated but even cooperative ships can be randomly boarded it s like a cop on the beat , said capt james p wisecup , commander of destroyer squadron 21 , who is managing the interdiction program after a while , you figure out who belongs in the neighborhood and who does n't the decatur , an arleigh burkeclass destroyer , is one of those beat cops from his captain s chair , cmdr victorino g mercado can view radar tracks from across the arabian sea that show every ship and aircraft in the region infrared and night vision scopes also allow his crew to monitor distant ships in the dark he has 24 sailors trained to board ships armed with shotguns and 9millimeter pistols if you just talk and do n't board , there s not a deterrent , captain mercado said on board the p3 planes that help guide the coalition ships , each mission commander carries a thick threering binder marked secret that contains photographs and descriptions of the more than two dozen merchant vessels that have been linked to al qaeda but not many of those ships have made recent appearances in the arabian sea when we look back in 5 to 10 years , we 'll know if we succeeded , captain wisecup said all we can do now is try our best to keep the pressure on
david wells had more trouble in a diner last weekend than the meek baltimore orioles gave him at yankee stadium last night against a team that swung frequently at first pitches , wells pitched eight innings in a 73 victory it was the fifth consecutive victory and ninth in 10 games for the yankees , and it reduced their magic number to eight to clinch the american league east division over the secondplace boston red sox the yankees are 40 games over 500 , their best mark of the season , with 16 games remaining that s rarefied air , yankees manager joe torre said wells \( 177 \) has the most victories among yankees pitchers , winning last night despite the injuries he sustained when he was assaulted in a diner early last saturday two of his teeth were broken the loser was sean douglass \( 03 \) , who was betrayed by his outfielders before a crowd of 33 , 263 the orioles have lost their last eight games and 18 of their last 19 nick johnson led the yankees with a threerun homer in the first inning , and juan rivera had three hits wells gave up two runs \( both on home runs \) , struck out six and walked none sterling hitchcock pitched the ninth inning and gave up a home run the yankees played some of the game without designated hitter jason giambi , who was replaced in the bottom of the fifth inning by john vander wal giambi s right wrist was bruised when he was hit by a pitch from douglass in the first inning , and it was well wrapped as he left the clubhouse after the game the yankees announced that xrays were negative and that giambi s availability would be day to day i 'll probably give him tomorrow off , torre said , referring to the first of a threegame series against the chicago white sox giambi batted in the second inning and struck out swinging it kind of pained me , he said of the stiffening wrist i 'll show up every day and see how it feels in his last six starts , wells is 51 his previous start was an 81 victory over detroit last friday night at the stadium but a few hours after that game , wells was in an altercation at a diner on manhattan s upper east side after last night s game , he said , i have no comment whatsoever about the incident but he answered questions in vague terms whatever happens in life is something i ca n't get distracted by , wells said i 've dealt with a lot of controversy in my career i 've still gone out and met the challenge i do n't want to walk around here with bad feelings and bad thoughts torre had joked the previous day that wells has been fine lately at least when he s in uniform , and yesterday he discussed the history of nonbaseball issues that have surrounded wells one distraction after the other , torre said , citing wells s weight problems , his playing loud music in the locker room and his use of an illegal hat that umpires made him remove there s always something that surrounds him douglass should have carried a 20 lead into the seventh inning on solo home runs by jeff conine in the first inning and melvin mora in the third instead , the yankees led , 52 , because they scored five times in the first after the orioles' poor fielding extended the inning with two outs and the bases loaded and the yankees without a run , rondell white lofted a fly ball into rightcenter field mora , in center field , and luis matos , in right , moved toward the ball , but both stopped and it fell between them for a double that scored two runs johnson , the next batter , hit a threerun homer to rightcenter field , his 15th home run of the season got a hanging curveball , i think , johnson said hit it pretty well douglass left in the seventh inning after giving up three singles the yankees scored two of those runners on an error by left fielder jose leon and a wild pitch by reliever travis driskill inside pitch yankees closer mariano rivera will return to the team today from rehabilitation in tampa , fla , manager joe torre said rivera is trying to recover from a shoulder strain mariano was very good today , torre said tomorrow he 'll be here and we 'll get firsthand knowledge torre said rivera threw 35 pitches from a mound yesterday in new york , he will pitch in a simulated game , perhaps as early as tomorrow he still has a long way to go , torre said , adding that rivera had yet to turn it loose the way he would in a game photos david wells continued his strong pitching of late , allowing two runs , seven hits and striking out six in eight innings of work \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg d1 \) first baseman nick johnson after hitting a threerun home run in the first inning against the orioles \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg d3 \)
moscow , may 22 with president bush barely a day away from moscow , it began to appear today that he would not be bringing with him economic proposals to transform his first kremlin meeting with president vladimir v putin into anything more than a funeral service for the cold war in moscow , that was a clear disappointment for those who have held out hope that mr bush might use such proposals to signal that talk of a new russianamerican alliance will yield tangible riches soon the russian government said today that negotiators for both sides had put the final flourishes on the centerpiece of the meeting , an agreement to reduce each side s nuclear stockpiles by twothirds or more the two presidents are also to sign a nonbinding agreement setting out a new framework for bilateral relations and the kremlin indicated that it would sign three other agreements dealing with cooperation against terrorism , stabilizing world energy supplies and expanding cultural and governmental contacts but none of the announcements mentioned what some russians were seeking as much as any armscontrol accord an increase in investments , economic incentives or other policy changes that would help stimulate the russian economy a spokesman for commerce secretary donald l evans , who is in moscow for the threeday meeting , said he knew of no plans to sign any such economic agreements more galling to some officials though expected was the word that mr bush would not bring promises of action on the two economic issues of greatest concern to them the repeal of the jacksonvanik amendment and american certification of russia as a market economy the jacksonvanik amendment , aimed squarely at cold war restrictions on the movement of soviet jews , bars the president from giving favorable tariff treatment to nations that restrict free emigration congress has routinely waived the ban for russia during the last decade , but russian officials see its permanent abolition as a symbol that the united states recognizes russia s transition toward democracy mr bush supports lifting the ban , but legislation to do so sits today in a committee of the republicancontrolled house of representatives , with no clear date for further action in sight one congressional official said that the amendment was snarled in an unrelated legislative dispute over american textiles there were some missteps on the administration s part , the official said they just could n't get it through the house , and they thought they had a tough road in the senate the united states has also held out hope of russia s gaining the legal status of a freemarket economy , which would entitle it to an array of benefits in trade with the united states but a commerce department officer said today that the quasijudicial process leading to that decision was only now completing the period of public debate , with the united states import administration still to conduct deliberations of unknown length russia must meet six standards to win marketeconomy status , and on some like the degree to which the government controls the allocation of natural resources the country s compliance may be an open question officially , the russian government has played down the delays in both procedures , saying that the white house s commitment is a clear signal of american trust even if real benefits have not yet materialized and , stymied economic hopes aside , there are the week s negotiated accomplishments , of which the socalled framework agreement for bilateral relations is the most important it makes what the kremlin called a politically binding declaration that the two nations will not aim military actions at each other and will seek to cooperate on foreign policy and economic issues a senior american official said tonight that the agreement would also take the first steps toward americanrussian cooperation on a limited defense against ballistic missiles the united states announced in december that it was withdrawing from the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty , the foundation of most armscontrol accords , so that it could begin developing such a defense russia continues to argue that the withdrawal is a serious mistake the senior official said the framework agreement would commit both sides to set up a longdiscussed center to exchange data on missile launchings and tests
public intellectuals a study of decline by richard a posner 408 pp cambridge , mass harvard university press 2995 i'm not sure i'm qualified to review this book starting on page 209 , there is a chart of the top 100 public intellectuals for the years 19952000 i'm all the way down at no 85 , whereas richard a posner , the man whose work i'm supposed to be evaluating , is up at no 70 it s true that on paper i should be able to satisfy reader demand better than those poor saps who are mired in the 90 s \( noam chomsky , james q wilson , david frum , william butler yeats and lani guinier \) but there s just no way i'm going to be able to offer the kind of intellectual firepower you would get from , say , the big brains at rankings 72 through 76 \( aleksandr solzhenitsyn , lillian hellman , ann coulter , david horowitz and albert camus \) if the editors of the times book review are going to maintain any credibility , i do think the reviewer they choose should outrank the author \( the rankings are based on media mentions , by the way \) they should start by asking the national champion public intellectual , henry kissinger , to review books , and then work their way through the rest of the chart toppers larry summers , george will , salman rushdie , alan dershowitz and so on an outlet with the prestige of the times should n't have to settle for a reviewer not in the top 50 then again , i'm not sure anybody is qualified to review public intellectuals posner who , aside from being a judge on the united states court of appeals and a senior lecturer at the university of chicago law school , publishes a new book more or less after every meal got the idea for it while surveying the work of public intellectuals on issues as diverse as the clinton impeachment and the microsoft controversy he noticed something we stink our logic is flawed our use of evidence is shoddy our ratiocination is crude not content simply to accept a world in which others are not as intelligent as he is , he set out to explain this surprising incompetence a founder of the theory of law and economics , posner conceives the world of the commentariat as a market and tries to uncover what economic flaw explains our lousy product he constructs a supplyanddemand chart as it applies to intellectuals , and helpfully explains line s represents the supply of that work it slopes upward to indicate that the cost of supplying publicintellectual services increases with the quantity supplied the intersection of d and s determines the quantity of publicintellectual services produced \( q \) and the 'price' \( p \) in money and other \( call it psychic \) income that the producers receive this allows him to point out the reduction in the cost of supplying publicintellectual services could be shown in figure 21 by rotating s downward from its intersection with the vertical axis when this is done , s intersects d at a lower point , implying a lower market price and a greater output i confess that my first reaction was that this must be a parody of law and economics reasoning but this book is no parody and so watching posner try to apply economic laws to public debate is a bit like watching a martian trying to use statistics to explain a senior prom he is able to detect a few crude patterns , but he s missing the fraught complexity of the thing just consider the serial posturings of your average panel discussion the sycophantic introductions , the flattering references by the panelists to one another s work , the showtime vehemence of the professional radical , the slowtalking gravity of the emeritus thumbsucker , the pompous pose of cogitation that symposiasts adopt as they pretend to listen to the other speakers none of this is reducible to supply and demand cornel west cannot be captured in a chart with his homo economicus mentality , posner is at once too idealistic and too cynical he s too idealistic because he misses all the little vanities of intellectual life but he s too cynical because he is too quick to presume that intellectuals will respond like companies to the laws of supply and demand if leftleaning intellectuals accrued greater benefits than rightleaning intellectuals , he posits , there would then be a tendency for public intellectuals to reposition themselves politically until an equilibrium was restored his attempt to reduce debate to economics leaves him disturbed that even though robert bellah s habits of the heart was gloomily wrong about the health of american culture , it still ranked a respectable 6 , 188th on the amazoncom list as of oct 5 , 2000 why does n't the market punish failure \? he wonders posner s explanation is that public intellectuals are n't very good because nobody cares idea consumers do n't care enough about what intellectuals say to monitor rigorously the quality of what gets said , and intellectuals , knowing that they can get away with anything , lazily spout whatever comes into their heads absent , then , from this market are the conditions \( such as an informed consuming public or expert consumer intermediaries , legally enforceable warranties of product quality and high costs of exit for sellers detected selling products of poor quality \) that discipline other markets in credence goods , posner writes fortunately , he argues , public intellectuals do n't have any influence on debate , so it does n't matter
leadership by rudolph w giuliani with ken kurson 407 pp new york miramax books hyperion 2595 rudolph giuliani does n't quite insist that divine intervention prepared him to guide new york city through the most traumatic event in its history but he comes awfully close he had been at work on this book for months before terrorists attacked the world trade center it had become almost a seminar for me , a selfimposed program on how to run an organization , he says it was as if god had provided an opportunity to design a course in leadership just when i needed it most it will be left to others to decide how much god is in giuliani s reflections on what it took to be in charge but it seems safe to say that virtually all new yorkers except rabid rudyphobes were grateful he was the mayor on sept 11 , 2001 , with or without help from above his majestic stewardship that day and in the weeks to follow is by now amply known inevitably , the attack on new york is the thread that binds this book while no blockbuster revelations leap off the pages , giuliani can tell a compelling story the horror that he saw and his own proximity to death are sobering some details are touching a few very few are even light it is hard to resist a faint smile when a city hall driver points to abandoned cars that he could hotwire to help the giuliani entourage get away from devastated lower manhattan we have here , in the main , a softer rudy than the mayor new yorkers knew for eight years , a man eternally in search of enemies and at war with inner demons it was a struggle for him to stay focused on sept 11 , he admits , but so much was at stake that there was no time to spend actually experiencing an emotion two nights later was when he hit a low point he felt tremendous pain down his back it crossed my mind that i might be having a heart attack , he says i thought , 'it could n't be god would n't let that happen now' as might be imagined , no man with this pattonlike belief in his destiny was about to succumb to the doubt and soulsearching that giuliani acknowledges even he endures sometimes when faced with tough decisions a walk along the east river that night eased the pain , in both body and soul this , he reassured himself , is what i was trained to do to take charge , and make sound , sensible decisions leadership is the first of two books that giuliani agreed to do for a 3 million advance the second is to be a memoir this one gives barely a nod to messier parts of his private life , notably his bitter divorce from donna hanover \( who is fleetingly mentioned but then denied a reference in the index \) even so , the book does not lack personal details giuliani is candid , at times graphic , about his painful fight with prostate cancer , though he makes a virtue of it by calling it basic training for sept 11 on one level , this is a howtomanage manual from a man who says he has spent his entire life thinking about being a leader but it is also a vehicle for replaying rudy s greatest hits they are here in abundance how he lowered the welfare rolls , tamed the mob , banished the squeegee men , gave foreign diplomats what for over parking tickets , protected abused children and , for good measure , kicked an uninvited yasir arafat out of lincoln center the list goes on at the top is a spectacular drop in crime that proved new york was not , as many had insisted for so long , ungovernable the key , giuliani says , was holding people accountable , from the police commissioner down to the precinct commander the managerial silver bullet was compstat , a system of computerized statistics that tracked in real time whether crime was down or up , and where hard numbers stripped commanders of their old whaddaya gonna do shrugs as an accountability tool , compstat was true culture shock , the former mayor says , and it was soon replicated in other city agencies so what makes a leader \? for giuliani , a morning meeting with top aides was indispensable to keep everyone focused , himself included other admonitions include appointing the best people , mastering details , remaining true to your core values and promising only what you can deliver \( or , better yet , underpromising and then overdelivering \) not every thought is particularly novel how many successful executives believe in putting dummies in important jobs , making crucial decisions off the top of their heads and promising the unattainable \? and while this is only a guess , not every manager is likely to find the inspiration giuliani does in his beloved yankees and the godfather films for him , don corleone s sitdown with the drugdealing sollozzo becomes a lesson in how to run a meeting only giuliani loyalists ready to drink the koolaid and there are plenty could overlook the many times giuliani ignored his own counsel here are a few of many possible examples do n't be a bully , he says yet many feel that s exactly what he was when he waged war on street vendors and protesting cabbies , labeled taxi terrorists by his administration he even bullied the dead , smearing an unarmed man who was shot and killed by an undercover cop

to the editor since iraq so consumes the attention of president bush at this time \( editorial , aug 11 \) , he should consult with israel on this obsession israel , one of the major military and nuclear powers in the world , is never shy about responding to perceived threats it is a close neighbor of iraq yet israel is not preparing to wage war on iraq , nor have i seen any report that it is planning to join us as a military ally if we attack iraq if none of iraq s neighbors in the middle east and europe perceive a threat requiring war , the problem must lie in our perceptions daniel c maguire milwaukee , aug 12 , 2002
unlike many other independent pharmacists , albert and maria gardini , the owners of a small drugstore in manhattan s theater district , foresaw the cataclysmic changes that were about to sweep through their industry and adapted to them they were prepared , for example , when the chain stores began spreading and when the reimbursements for medications bought with prescription cards started shrinking the gardinis responded to these challenges back in 1988 by refusing to take prescription cards at alps drugs , their corner store on ninth avenue and 42nd street , except from members of the screen actors guild and actors' equity the lifeblood of the neighborhood , as mrs gardini describes them the couple also shifted the emphasis at alps , making it more of a parfumerie and gift shop , and stocking it with thousands of items that were handpicked by the couple during their frequent trips abroad \( they almost always traveled separately so that they would not have to close the store \) you could still have a prescription filled and the petite and gregarious mrs gardini might actually deliver the medicine herself but you could also find portuguese perfume bottles , paper dolls , brushed aluminum pocket mirrors , scented drawerlining papers from england , crystalencrusted hair ornaments , more than 200 greeting cards , french postcards \( both naughty and nice , according to mrs gardini \) , a 3 handmade comb in the shape of a penguin , and , at christmas , panettone many items cost less than 5 and none cost more than 150 their strategy worked as many momandpop stores went under , the gardinis stayed in business but on wednesday , after more than half a century at the same location , the alps is closing the gardinis , who own the fourstory building where alps is located and where they raised their three daughters in a duplex apartment above the 1 , 000squarefoot store , agreed in august to sell it for an undisclosed price to the developer daniel brodsky the building will be demolished and the site will become part of a complex with 250 apartments that will stretch from 42nd street to 43rd street construction is expected to begin at the end of february , mr brodsky said had they chosen to stay , mr brodsky could have built around them , but the gardinis he is 62 and she is 61 say that they did not want to put up with 18 months of construction noise or start over in a new location with their three daughters working in the entertainment business , they had no one to take over alps when they retired i did not want to sell to another independent and not be able to maintain the quality of the store that my father and i realized , said mr gardini , a courtly man who inherited alps from his father , emilio we felt this was the best way to do it , to close word of the store s closing has saddened longtime customers who have relied on the gardinis for medical advice , a seemingly limitless supply of hostess gifts and birthday presents and the kind of neighborly cheer that is lacking in the chain stores they say that alps brought a welcome whiff of european elegance to hell s kitchen , a neighborhood once known more for its longshoremen than for lavender soap my heart is bleeding , said jeanclaude baker , the owner of chez josephine , a nearby restaurant we are losing an institution in the neighborhood not long ago , mr baker had mrs gardini put together an assortment of christmas gifts for his 95yearold grandmother , a cat fancier , that included a felineshaped hotwater bottle another customer , paula miksic , a chelsea resident , said she went out of her way to shop at alps because it carried a hardtofind german bath product that her husband likes i love their stuff , and i love their attitude , mrs miksic said it s very personal , and if you ask them about something , they give you good advice to some customers , the demise of alps suggests that a neighborhood prized by residents for its ethnic food shops and restaurants is well on its way to a bland form of gentrification the four long blocks of 42nd street west of eighth avenue , once dismissed by developers as a wasteland of warehouses , lumber yards and parking lots , have been undergoing striking change , with about half a dozen residential and commercial projects under way or recently completed but zoning restrictions brought about through community pressure are expected to prevent ninth avenue from turning into a highrise canyon like third avenue mr brodsky said the pet store and thai restaurant between 42nd street and 43rd street would remain on the block even after his building was finished he said he was more than willing to keep alps as a tenant that was the option we would have preferred , he said , but he wanted to get out alps opened at its current location in 1949 , but its history goes back even further when emilio gardini arrived in new york from parma , italy , in 1923 , he went to work for a friend who had opened three pharmacies , including one on 40th street and ninth avenue , in a neighborhood crowded with irish and italian immigrants ten years later , when his friend retired , mr gardini bought the alps store on ninth avenue that store was eventually displaced by the port authority bus terminal as a boy , albert gardini found himself boarding ocean liners to pick up prescriptions and delivering aerosol sprays and lozenges to singers from the metropolitan opera house , then on broadway and 40th street the contact with the opera world proved infectious for several years , the younger mr gardini studied to become an opera singer i was lucky enough to realize i had limited potential , he said when he was a music student , his accompanist was often the future mrs gardini , whom he had met at the welcoming party on their first night at the nowdefunct fordham university college of pharmacy i fell in love at the first dance , mrs gardini said after a nineyear courtship that was prolonged because of mr gardini s singing ambitions , the couple married in 1966 many tough years followed , as the spread of pornography shops and the worsening crime drove away customers nobody wanted to come to ninth avenue , mrs gardini said business improved in 1977 , when the huge manhattan plaza complex opened across the street from the store despite the hard times , the couple managed to send all three daughters to private schools , where , mrs gardini said , the parents of their classmates were often shocked to learn of the family s unfashionable home address today , the eldest , marisa kinosian , 34 , is a lawyer , and a business partner of isaac mizrahi gina , 32 , is a vice president for production at miramax films and carla , 26 , is an assistant to john goldwyn , the president of paramount motion pictures with the store closing only days away , the gardinis are not yet certain where they will live ms kinosian said she intended to hang onto the oak cabinets that line the walls of the shop , and the gardinis will keep some of their merchandise because they plan to start a corporate gift business that will allow them to keep traveling together , for a change the couple said they were looking forward to an easier pace that includes having sundays and holidays off but mrs gardini said there were no regrets i ca n't think of a richer way of living one s life , she said , than helping people and yet having fun photos maria and albert gardini , the owners of alps drugs , work the counter the gardinis sold their building to a developer alps has been a fixture at ninth avenue and 42nd street

layoff notices have started going out to 3 , 000 connecticut state employees as gov john g rowland makes good on a threat to bring his budget ax down on government workers whose unions have refused to make concessions that he says are needed to balance the state s finances mr rowland met yesterday in hartford with top state legislators to discuss connecticut s widening budget problems , but both administration and legislative officials said that preventing the layoffs was no longer part of the discussion union officials said they could only hope that future talks would reverse some of the layoffs , most of which take effect in january connecticut , like most states , is struggling in a weak economy , though not nearly as much as new york or new jersey since comfortably winning a third term last month , mr rowland , a republican , has had to face the prospect of filling a 500 million hole in this fiscal year s 132 billion budget as well as preparing to address a projected shortfall of 11 billion next year that is a fraction of the deficits in neighboring states , but in connecticut , one of the nation s wealthiest states , talks of cutbacks or of increased taxes are always unsavory things quickly turned ugly last month after the state employees' unions angrily rejected an early retirement program that mr rowland proposed as a costsaving measure the situation is likely to get uglier still officials say that the layoffs are at most a small portion of the needed cuts and that taxes will certainly have to rise mr rowland s budget director , marc s ryan , said yesterday that without quick action , connecticut could run out of cash by late april or early may , forcing emergency borrowing union officials said that mr rowland s early retirement plan was tied to more than 1 billion in added cuts to wages and benefits over the next three years the day after the unions rejected the plan , mr rowland tersely vowed to lay off 3 , 000 of the state s 50 , 000 employees unless the unions agreed to concessions so far , union officials have declined to return to the negotiating table and have suggested that the governor raise taxes on corporations and on the wealthy to generate revenue in the meantime , the layoff notices are on the way the administration has not disclosed which departments will be hardest hit , saying only that the layoffs are across the board things also quickly got personal , as james a amann , a democrat who is the majority leaderelect of the connecticut house , called on mr rowland to set the tone in budget talks by forgoing or postponing a 72 , 000 raise in the governor s salary set to take effect on jan 8 the governor is paid 78 , 000 a year now last week , mr rowland announced an additional 68 million in budget cuts that were already approved by the general assembly or that he had the authority to make on his own yesterday he said he would consider consolidating some agencies and even planned to lay off some deputy commissioners , who are his own political appointees none of these proposals come anywhere close to addressing the state s yawning budget gap , setting the stage for a showdown between the republican administration and the general assembly , which is controlled by democrats the next legislative session does not begin until january , but the governor could call a special session before christmas to force lawmakers to address the budget troubles mr rowland s aides insist that he needs the cooperation of unions and the general assembly , while critics accuse the governor of avoiding the unpalatable questions of how and when to raise taxes mr rowland s spokesman , christopher cooper , said the governor was pleased with yesterday s meeting with legislators the governor considers it a very encouraging sign that democrats and republicans and administration budget people are all sitting down at the table together but the meeting resulted in no concrete decisions on filling the budget gap , and mr amann renewed his criticism of the administration , calling on mr rowland to present a budget proposal instead of negotiating cuts piecemeal with legislators this governor should show the fortitude and the guts to be straightforward with the public and say , 'here s my plan , ' mr amann said dan livingston , the chief negotiator for a coalition of 31 bargaining units from the various state employees' unions , said mr rowland was asking for longterm concessions without offering a longterm budget plan the layoffs are an irresponsible act , he said they will not advance a solution one inch in fact , they will make things worse we 're willing to help with a genuine solution , mr livingston said what the governor wants us to be part of is a way to avoid asking the rich and powerful to pay their fair share , and we 're not willing to help with that mr ryan , the governor s budget chief , said the unions' refusal to negotiate had forced mr rowland s hand there is little solace , he said , in connecticut s being better off than its neighbors it s all relative , mr ryan said we have a pretty substantial fiscal crisis that we have to deal with the only rosy picture is that other states have it worse he added , we went from peak to trough so quickly photo to help balance the budget , gov john g rowland announced layoffs of union members yesterday in hartford his right hand is bandaged because he injured his thumb when he fell walking his dog on thursday \( associated press \) \( pg b6 \)
two people were killed yesterday afternoon when they were hit by an amtrak train near an elizabeth , nj , train station in an apparent double suicide , officials said the authorities did not immediately release the names of the victims , but an amtrak spokeswoman said a man , 27 , and a woman , 22 , had walked off a lower level platform into the path of the train , while holding hands all indications point to this being intentional on the part of the two people who walked right in front of the train , said the spokeswoman , karen dunn the train was delayed for more than 90 minutes while investigators from amtrak and the elizabeth police department examined the area new jersey transit also faced delays of 15 minutes on its northeast corridor and north jersey coast lines , and trains were ordered to bypass stops in elizabeth and north elizabeth , officials said the train , no 650 , also known as the keystone , was finishing its route from harrisburg , pa , through philadelphia to new york city about 4 15 pm when it struck the two not far from the north avenue train station , ms dunn said none of the 50 people aboard the keystone were injured , ms dunn said
it was designed to be cutting edge and thus deeply reassuring to a city that knew it was a target for terror a mayoral office of emergency management that would prepare for the worst and oversee the response when the worst hit the agency would help coordinate the police and fire departments and serve , when needed , as the chief commander millions of dollars were poured into it bioterrorism was studied and a plan of action was written the mayor , rudolph w giuliani , trumpeted the agency s vision and effectiveness officials called it a model for other cities but whatever its grand ambitions , the city s office of emergency management , when crisis struck , found itself marginalized and overwhelmed , and the destruction of its command center was only the most visible of its problems on the morning of sept 11 , the agency , while working to assist an emergency response that was valiant in spirit and that helped evacuate thousands from the twin towers , could do little as some police officers acted without orders and others found no strong leader it did not get commanders of the police and fire departments to talk to one another during the crisis it could not help coordinate the recall to duty of all firefighters across the city , in part because virtually none of the firefighters knew what to do in the event of such a recall in fact , it turned out the emergency agency had run just one joint drill for these and other groups in the 18 months before the attacks and it was a tabletop exercise , not field training and so a year after new york learned at a spectacularly painful price that it needed to scrutinize and improve its emergency response apparatus , many city and law enforcement officials believe fixing the office of emergency management is absolutely vital if it is not improved , they believe , any professions that new york is a safer and better prepared city lack great meaning the idea of such an emergency office , these officials say , is sound if it was beset with political infighting and perhaps publicly oversold , it can still be made to work indeed , they say , the dimensions of the threat to the city demand that it be revamped and fully legitimized considering the new realities that we have to face , oem is indispensable to our planning and preparations for all the things we hope will never occur , mayor michael r bloomberg said through a spokesman the new world requires responses that we never had before of course , establishing a capable emergency management agency is just one of the many challenges the city is facing as it tries to improve security , identify and eliminate threats and organize itself for what most officials expect will be future attacks the police department has hired a former central intelligence agency official to improve its access to critical information on terror groups , and it has assigned its own detectives to work with the police in several cities overseas armed officers are now stationed at airports and at bridges virtually full time the city s vast array of sensitive locations have received increased monitoring hospitals across the city are working on being ready for a major biological or chemical assault how well any of these initiatives succeed in helping to create a more secure city is an open question certainly , however , for many of the city s new initiatives to become reality , they will need more than the good intentions of the police and fire departments , the city s health officials and scores of other federal , state and local agencies do we really need a superagency and how should it function \? jerome h skolnick , a professor at the new york university school of law and codirector of the center for research in crime and justice there , said of the city s emergency management agency what are its goals \? what are its standards \? how are you going to evaluate its success or failure \? can you get the police and fire agencies to coordinate by defining what their mission and capacities are and to train them for those missions \? the questions are more than serious , for one of the truths of sept 11 was that however bad it was , it might have been worse the buildings could have fallen in different , even more destructive ways there might have been more planes slamming into more landmarks the attacks could have included bioterrorism coordination of efforts was a priority but was unrealized richard j sheirer , the former commissioner of the office of emergency management , who was in charge on sept 11 , defended the agency s performance that day and in subsequent days he said that 18 months before the attacks , he inherited an agency beset by problems caused by personality clashes , and that he had been working to fix them and he blasted the two recent reports by consultants on the city s emergency response that day because the firm had failed to talk to him or to mr giuliani that is unprofessional , he said one of the undisputed startling facts about the performance of the agency was that it had failed to fully establish the most basic aspect of emergency response determining who is in charge and when , and why in fact , that most fundamental part of the agency s mission having all city agencies abide by a formal system that lays out under what circumstances police , fire or other officials take control of an emergency to this day does not exist in the way it does in other cities one uniform , written set of rules that all agencies abide by
the national football league confirmed yesterday that the five players the giants made available for the houston texans' expansion draft were outside linebacker jessie armstead , defensive end kenny holmes , strong safety sam garnes and offensive guard glenn parker , all starters , and cornerback dave thomas , a starter a year ago earlier in the week , the jets exposed their starting cornerbacks , aaron glenn and marcus coleman , free safety chris hayes , offensive tackle ryan young and defensive tackle shane burton other players on the list released by the nfl included quarterbacks rob johnson of the buffalo bills , charlie batch of the detroit lions and chris chandler of the atlanta falcons offensive tackle tony boselli of the jacksonville jaguars offensive guard randall mcdaniel of the tampa bay buccaneers wide receiver rob moore of the arizona cardinals tight end ken dilger of the indianapolis colts outside linebackers jamie sharper of the baltimore ravens and bill romanowski of the denver broncos and return specialist jermaine lewis of the ravens because most of these players carry large salaries or bonuses or both , making for a high salarycap value , few are likely to be chosen in the feb 18 expansion draft that will help stock pro football s newest team each team had to offer five players , but none could be kickers or punters or unrestricted free agents a team can lose no more than two players when a veteran player is drafted by the texans , his former team can pull one man back if a second player is then selected from that team , his former team can pull back its two remaining players some of the exposed players are obscure or old , or carry high salaries or bonuses that might turn off the texans , who must fill a roster with expansion players , free agents and college draftees while staying under the anticipated salary cap of 72 million holmes , who signed a fiveyear , 203 million contract with the giants last march as an unrestricted free agent , was somewhat of a surprise on the list ernie accorsi , the giants' general manager , said the team did not want to lose him there is a very good chance he will be back for us , accorsi said picking players for the expansion draft is a blend of a lot of things , including cap considerations if you release a player , you get charged under the cap for everything you would owe him if you lose him in the expansion draft , you do n't have to face any of those charges johnson is among the players with salarycap considerations in his first three injuryplagued seasons with the bills , johnson faced constant competition with doug flutie for the starting job this season , with flutie gone , johnson became the starter but missed the last eight games with a broken collarbone because johnson had an injury or health problem , the bills had to submit his medical records a week ago the texans have the medical records for all such players on the expansion list johnson s salarycap figure , including bonuses , is reported to be 112 million , but tom donahoe , the bills' president and general manager , would not say how much of a consideration that was if you look at every team s list , you 'll probably see something similar experienced guys , guys with high cap numbers , guys with injury concerns , young guys who have n't established themselves , donahoe said
two octogenarian pianists who are among the last links to the lost world of 52nd street , the midtown area that served as an incubator for bebop , came to manhattan in february neither showed any sign of having been diminished by age but while hank jones , 83 , drew a roomful of heavyduty hipsters to birdland , george shearing , 82 , filled feinstein s at the regency with decorouslooking couples who , given half a chance , would doubtless have snapped their fingers on one and three why the discrepancy \? the reason is that mr jones is a pianist s pianist , esteemed by his colleagues but unknown to the public at large conversely , mr shearing , whose latest album , the rare delight of you , has just been released on telarc , is a people s pianist , loved by musically unsophisticated folk who 've never heard of art tatum , much less hank jones to be sure , musicians also admire mr shearing \( i 've never met another pianist who did n't speak well of him \) , but certain jazz critics take it for granted that to be popular is to be bad , and far too many have jumped to the conclusion that since he is successful , he must be a sellout in fact , mr shearing is something far more complicated and interesting than that he is a deeply serious jazz musician , but unlike many of the boppers with whom he worked on 52nd street , he warms to other kinds of music as well his smoothly tooled balladry helped define the genre known as elevator music , yet he is equally at home with hardcore jazz among the tunes he performed at feinstein s were eddie harris s freedom jazz dance and randy weston s hifly , neither of which is quite the sort of thing one expects to hear in a park avenue cabaret he can toss off eerily precise imitations of any number of fellow pianists , including tatum and erroll garner , and i once heard him play a flawless bach d minor concerto with the kansas city philharmonic for all of mr shearing s determined eclecticism , he is the most recognizable of artists his piano tone is so full and warm that you wish you could stroke it , and though he did not invent his trademark locked hands style , in which both hands play melodies in parallel octaves with a shifting cloud of chords in between , his use of the technique is dazzlingly deft a harmonic wizard , he is known for such stunts as slipping a couple of bars of john coltrane s giant steps into lulu s back in town , a bit of musical sleightofhand that is also typical of his puckish sense of humor none of these qualities can be heard in his earliest recordings , which he made in london at the age of 19 in 1939 , mr shearing was an accomplished but derivative pianist who sounded like teddy wilson with a little tatum mixed in the only unusual things about him were that he lived in england , not america , and that he was born blind it was n't until he visited new york in 1946 , and first heard the highwire solos and chromatically altered harmonies of bebop , that he started to develop a more personal style within months he had absorbed the new language , and by the end of 1948 he was ready to start the group that would make him famous unusual for its time , the george shearing quintet consisted of two white men \( mr shearing and the guitarist chuck wayne , a woody herman alumnus \) , two black men \( the bebop drummer denzil best and john levy , a swingera bassist who had previously worked with stuff smith and billie holiday \) and a white woman \( the vibraphonist marjorie hyams , also from the herman herd \) its repertory was no less varied pretty ballads , uptempo bop , tunes with a latin beat most important , the group had a distinctive sound , an expansion of the lockedhands style in which vibes and guitar played in shimmering unison at the octave while mr shearing filled in the gaps with elegantly voiced harmonies what came to be known as the shearing sound was an immediate hit , and september in the rain , recorded in 1949 at the quintet s first session for mgm , sold 900 , 000 copies right from the start , some critics dismissed the shearing quintet as unserious , and even those who praised it often did so in a backhanded way max harrison , for example , spoke of mr shearing s musicianly wateringdown of bop , a remark that is less illuminating than beside the point the quintet could and did play straight bop , a case in point being mr shearing s own conception , a knotty harmonic labyrinth that was later taken up by bud powell , bill evans and miles davis \( who paid mr shearing the compliment of writing deception , a clever variation on conception , which he recorded with his groundbreaking birth of the cool band in 1950 \) still , the group was never meant to be a pure bebop band , any more than its leader was a pure bebop pianist , and mr shearing s deliberately wideranging appeal was part of what helped to make his quintet the most popular jazz combo of the early 50 s the shearing quintet maintained this somethingforeverybody policy throughout its threedecade run mr shearing hired firstclass jazzmen like gary burton , vernel fournier and toots thielemans , with whom he made records ranging from hardswinging live albums to beautifully polished quintetplusstrings sessions aimed at the muzak market not until the 70 s did he decide that the format had lost its luster , at which point he recharged his creative batteries by playing duets with a series of virtuoso bassists , including neil swainson , brian torff and the prodigiously gifted multiinstrumentalist don thompson in addition , he began an offandon partnership with mel torm , and he also started featuring his own quirky but affecting vocals on offbeat tunes like matt dennis s blues for breakfast and mr torm s real thing in 1992 , mr shearing signed with telarc , for which he has since recorded an exceptionally consistent series of albums , some featuring an updated version of the classic quintet just out is the rare delight of you , an engaging collaboration between the guitaristsinger john pizzarelli , a longtime shearing fan , and the new quintet its appearance coincides with a flood of european reissues of the original quintet s recordings , serving as a reminder of the unfailing excellence with which mr shearing has made music throughout his sixdecade career bad habits die hard , but now that crossover is no longer a dirty word , the time has come for george shearing to be acknowledged not as a commercial purveyor of bopandwater , but as an exceptionally versatile artist who has given pleasure to countless listeners for whom such critical hairsplitting is irrelevant at 82 , he is still active , still witty and still playing piano with the same luminous touch that put him on the map back when 52nd street was lined with grubby little nightclubs instead of jumbo office towers may he never stop swinging birdland to birdland most of george shearing s recordings are available on compact disc ,

washington , sept 4 the onceoverwhelming influence of television advertising on political campaigns is declining , democratic and republican leaders say , leading them to embrace aggressively oldfashioned campaign tools like telephone calls and doorknocking in this year s congressional elections while candidates continue to devote most of their resources to television , they say the power of commercials to affect an election s outcome is being diluted by the glut of cable television stations , the popularity of such commercialfree premium networks as hbo and the anesthetizing frequency and similarity of political advertisements several campaign strategists said the effectiveness of tv spots had been blunted by the ability of voters to fastforward past annoying hardedged attacks they said they were worried that this would become only more problematic with the advent of a new digital recording technology that lets viewers filter out all advertising with a stroke on a keypad all this has stirred considerable unease among strategists struggling to adjust to what they describe as a potentially farreaching change in the way campaigns are fought , introduced by the same medium that revolutionized politics 40 years ago the evidence of that can be seen across the nation this fall , as both major parties increase their investments and emphasis on voter registration , identification and turnout we are moving into a new world , and i think the traditional model that we have gone on for 30 years , jamming millions of dollars into a television set and hope you drive enough folks to the polls on election day , is a passing method , said representative richard a gephardt , the missouri democrat who is the house minority leader the amount of television and the proliferation of television channels is lessening the importance of television advertising over time and there is the saturation factor people cycle after cycle see these ads and they are just tuning them out blaise hazelwood , the political director of the republican national committee , said that television would remain central to republican efforts , but that her party was now studying how to adjust to a diminishing of television advertisements' effectiveness , which she predicted would continue with the changing technology i'm not advocating that we do less tv , ms hazelwood said but we cannot get away any more without knocking on people s doors it is absolutely critical darrell west , a political scientist at brown university , contended that a sharp drop in viewers for network and affiliate stations in the past decade had further complicated matters for political strategists who rely on television there is a law of diminishing returns on television ads , mr west said it becomes difficult to break through the clutter , and at this point , there is a lot more clutter out there the development reflects a problem madison avenue has faced for nearly a decade the proliferation of new forms of media , like the internet and cable television , has forced commercial advertisers to find new ways to reach consumers advertisers have turned to email promotions and event marketing to try to make an impact for political parties and candidates , it has been a reversion to oldstyle forms of politics in the new highprofile third congressional district outside las vegas , union workers with palmtop computers will begin doortodoor canvassing this week , interviewing residents about the issues that could influence their votes , and taking note of the candidate they support each night , the information will be synched with a state aflcio central computer for use on election day , to get out the vote for the candidate the unions support , a hightechnology variation on one of the oldest organizing tricks in the book in just two years , the democratic congressional campaign committee has raised its spending on getoutthevote efforts by a third , said howard wolfson , the executive director of the committee he said the committee was responding in part to the success noted by both parties of the getoutthevote operations on behalf of al gore in the 2000 presidential election one of the lessons of the gore campaign is that an outstanding ground game can really make a difference , mr wolfson said tv is not as dominant as it once was josh wachs , the chief operating officer of the democratic national committee , said that this year democrats were handing out sample ballots in dozens of languages across the nation in an effort to draw new immigrant voters into their camp last december , in the houston mayor s race , the party provided 115 vans , each able to carry 15 passengers , to take voters to the polls , an operation the democrats expect to repeat this fall on the other side of the aisle , the republican national committee and the white house created a 72hour task force this year after examining the outcome of elections in which democrats had made a particular effort at turnout the task force concluded that the democrats had done a better job of motivating and turning out their voters and urged the adaptation of a program to pull republicans to the polls with mailings , telephone calls and home visits we underperformed in the last 72 hours final stages of the last two elections , the task force said in contending that television commercials were no longer enough
johannesburg , dec 27 in the village behind the green gate , little boys wheeze as they scramble through the grass sickly women murmur wistfully about forgotten dreams men with aching bones savor the morning sun more than 80 people live in this community of pink concrete houses , and they all share one bitter reality here , at the sparrow rainbow village , nearly everyone is dying of aids last week , nomcebo ndlovu sipped each breath from an oxygen machine jane vundla struggled to envision her son s face because meningitis had stolen her eyesight charmaine moss , a skeletal young woman of 21 , could no longer walk on her spindly legs or hold a glass in her bony fingers she still tells anyone who will listen that she will get well soon i'm strong , man , she whispers i wo n't die so easy but few people survive in this village of invalids near roodepoort , on the western outskirts of johannesburg the sparrow rainbow village hospice , which opened in february , has taken in about 200 indigent aids patients this year of those patients , more than 100 are already dead all across the continent , south africa is hailed as the promised land , the country of prosperity and plenty yet even as blacks seize the opportunities of the postapartheid era , the deadly aids virus continues spreading here , infecting and killing south africa is believed to have five million people infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids , more than any other nation in the world nearly a quarter of all adults are infected government officials have often closed their eyes to the devastating epidemic yet the grim statistics only hint at the heartbreaking realities of an aids hospice where dying is more common than living every day , bodies fail , memories fade and patients sink into deep depression about 30 adults and 50 children are spending their last days here none can afford the costly but lifesaving aids drugs commonly prescribed in the west this hospice , which relies on government financing and donations , offers free care but with only basic medicines about four patients die here each week the demand for hospice care has soared in recent years as the epidemic has spread and families have found themselves struggling to care for the sick in the province of gauteng , which includes johannesburg and pretoria , the number of aids hospice beds financed by the local government surged to 178 , from almost none , between 1998 and 2002 other hospices rely on private financing so many families come looking for help that sparrow , which started caring for small numbers of people 10 years ago , is often forced to turn patients away the patients who are accepted , and who sometimes arrive on stretchers , inherit the beds of the dead as their bodies wither , some pray feverishly for a miracle last week , ms ndlovu , who had not left her hospice bed for four months , gestured to her metal locker to explain why she needed to survive taped to the inside of her locker door was a color photograph of her two small children they are healthy , said ms ndlovu , 38 , speaking in small gasps i'm just praying to god to give me a second chance to live with my children she sank into silence , exhausted by the few whispered words , as the nurses bustled through the tiny house the house in which ms ndlovu resided had eight patients , a color television and a nursing station stocked with plastic gloves and blue diapers for the patients who are incontinent the nurses rub brittle limbs and bony backs with vaseline and spoon porridge and spaghetti through slack lips they brush teeth , change diapers and help the ailing women to take their antibiotics , which are often in short supply most of the women are bedridden some suffer from thrush , which makes it difficult to swallow some suffer from meningitis , tuberculosis or pneumonia other women simply shrivel up , losing so much weight that their arms and legs look like twigs they wince and moan as the nurses massage their aching bodies it s very difficult , said thabo dipudi , a nursing aide who has lost track of the exact number of patients who have died under his watch you see terrible things here the hospice admits only the poorest of the poor armandos pheto , 62 , was living in a concrete pipe when he collapsed and was carried to the hospice ms moss , who ran away from home at 16 , was living on the street she survived by begging for scraps and accepting charity mrs vundla , who was facing eviction , was living with her husband and children in a house without electricity or running water she contracted meningitis last month and it left her partly blind she can still walk and feed herself and her children , who live at the hospice with her but she feels weaker every day her eyesight is not improving , and she is battered by nightmares and dizzy spells sometimes i sing when i'm sleeping now , said mrs vundla , 40 , who used to sell doilies at the market before she got sick i worry that my brain is loose maybe it s because of this disease , she said i do n't know how to overcome this if we cannot afford these aids drugs , how will we survive \? ms moss interrupts from across the room miss jane , i wonder what food we are having today \? she asked mrs vundla laughed and responded , must i guess \? is it rice \? i do n't know but ms moss has stopped speaking she weighs 44 pounds now and she seems to focus mostly on breathing , sleeping and eating when she dreams , she says , she dreams about food saltandvinegar potato chips , purple grapes , orange sodas , kentucky fried chicken , the foods she craved while she was hungry on the streets , hospice officials say ms moss also reminisces about the time when she cared for cows and chickens on a farm hospice officials believe she agreed to have sex with the owner of the farm in exchange for food she said the man loved her , and he did come to visit when the hospice contacted him but the sight of the emaciated girl horrified him and he never returned in the morning , the chicken would go , 'cockadoodle doo , ' ms moss sang i said to myself , this chicken wakes me up and i want to sleep still everyone is struggling to hold on some patients say they feel death hovering over the house and they hide under their beds on another visit this week , some wondered whether ms ndlovu felt it coming , wondered whether she covered her face or pointed to the photograph of her children before she died on dec 21 the nurses came to wrap the body around breakfast time they removed the corpse and stripped the bed , leaving a plastic bag with ms ndlovu s clothes , her tiny red bible and a squeezed bottle of toothpaste a new patient , veronica felles , burst into tears she packed her clothes and announced that she was leaving i'm going to my home , she said fiercely as she walked out you wo n't see me again she died in here i'm afraid of being here the women left behind look at the empty bed and the empty locker mrs vundla s heart was pounding , and she made her own bed quietly as the women considered how many people had died in this room since they arrived two , mrs vundla said two , including nomcebo no , three , another patient interjected who is the third \? mrs vundla asked the one who was sleeping in your bed , the woman answered everyone is quiet mrs vundla turns to her bed and straightens the blankets and pillow this aids is going to finish everyone , she said finally we keep on praying that god will make the disease go away that is our only hope we just pray for a miracle photos armandos pheto , who gets free care and basic medicines , had been living with aids in a concrete pipe \( joao silva for the new york times \) \( pg a1 \) jane vundla , left , can

in the final weekend of one of the closest congressional campaigns in years , democratic candidates returned yesterday to the issues that they had once hoped would sweep them to victory , warning of a deterioriating economy and a republican threat to social security republicans , led by president bush , urged voters to elect a republican congress that would enact initiatives like a homeland security bill and tax cuts from a street walk in the suburbs of las vegas to a flyaround in south dakota , from smalltown coffee shops to a huge presidential rally at a minnesota hockey arena , democrats and republicans struggled to strike the right closing themes in a campaign that has been notable for its absence of any sharp divisions in this final weekend , democrats sounded themes they had been talking about since last summer an unsteady economy , prescription drug coverage for the elderly and the future of social security you know who the real important person is to me \? said jean carnahan , a democrat struggling to hold her senate seat in one of the season s closest election fights the man who told me he s cutting his pills in half every day he needs prescription drug benefits in medicare that will be one of the very first things when i return to the senate in arkansas , mark pryor , a democratic challenger fighting to unseat senator tim hutchinson , a republican , struck a similar theme last night in pine bluffs arkansans wants a senator in washington who will fight for them whether it is for prescription drugs , education , highways or the economy , mr pryor said to a burst of applause for republicans personified in three states yesterday by none other than mr bush , in the midst of an exhaustive campaign swing it was a domestic security bill , a push for making tax cuts permanent , and the frustration mr bush voiced at democrats in the senate who have blocked his judicial nominees i need someone to help me fulfill one of my most awesome responsibilities , which is to pick to pick good judges for our federal benches , mr bush said in springfield , ill , as he campaigned on behalf of candidates for governor , the senate and the house the current senate has done a lousy job on the judges we 've got a vacancy crisis in america , which means americans are n't getting justice it s so important to have members of congress who understand the role of government it s not to create wealth , but an environment in which the small business can grow to be a big business in which the entrepreneurial spirit of america can flourish , mr bush said this last sunday of campaigning came on the eve of an election in which voters will chose 435 voting members of the house , 34 members of the senate and 36 governors before the death of senator paul wellstone of minnesota , the democrats held a oneseat edge in the senate republicans hold a sixseat edge in the house there are 21 democratic governors and 27 republicans the other two are independents leaders in both parties said yesterday that as of now , it seemed likely that democrats would hold on to , or slightly expand , their edge in the senate , while republicans would at least keep control of the house but democrats seemed poised to make significant gains in governorships , notably in states that could prove pivotal in the 2004 presidential campaign , including pennsylvania , michigan and illinois beyond that , the election could reshuffle the gender makeup of the nation s class of governors 10 women are running for governor , from nine states there are now five female governors , though three are retiring a flood of final weekend polls underlined just how tight many of the races were , and why most predictions that were made yesterday were offered with at least a few tobesures in another of the more dramatic contests of the year , the race for senate in minnesota between walter f mondale and norm coleman , a poll published yesterday in the minneapolis star tribune showed mr mondale six points ahead of mr coleman in the contest to replace mr wellstone a poll in the st paul pioneer press published that same morning showed mr coleman six points ahead no matter how close the picture appeared over all , democrats seemed clearly frustrated at what several described as a lost opportunity in trying to take back the house some questioned whether they had succeeded in laying out a clear alternative democratic economic plan in particular , some democrats , in a private preview of what could turn out to be the public postmortems that will begin on wednesday , said the party should have risked running directly against the tax cuts that president bush pushed through the way to nationalize an election and make it a referendum on the bush economy was to talk about the billionpound elephant in the room the bush tax boon for the wealthy , said chris lehane , a democratic consultant it is the only domestic policy issue you ca n't talk about the economy with any credibility without addressing the issue it would have been an organizing principle for a consistent message , and it would have broken through the cacophony of dcspeak

the crimson petal and the white by michel faber 838 pp new york harcourt 26 michel faber s previous work a novel called under the skin and some rain must fall , a collection of short stories was certainly ambitious and accomplished , but nothing could have prepared his readers for the sweep and subtlety of the crimson petal and the white the tricks begin with the title , recalling a seduction song in tennyson s mock epic the princess now sleeps the crimson petal , now the white the princess records the overthrow of a feminist university by a group of threatened men , who first try open warfare but are crushed by the women , leaving the men with only the rottenest and surest tricks available in the male seduction game lying prone and whining , what will i do without you \? but i love you ! help me ! the crimson petal song comes late in the poem , as the hospitalized men try to persuade the women they should leave everything to the boys , a heavily ironic argument , considering its source , but effective nonetheless now folds the lily all her sweetness up , and slips into the bosom of the lake so fold thyself , my dearest , thou , and slip into my bosom and be lost in me in his novel , faber extends the irony by showing what happens when it s the men asking for a bosom to be lost in in this case , when the appeal to pity threatens to ruin the fine lives of able prostitutes faber s is an immensely difficult project , and to carry it off he returns to the selfconscious reforming zeal , the bracing ethical assurance , the heartbreaking generosity and the sly rhetorical tricks of the great victorian novelists like them , faber and his glorious teenage heroine , a young woman known as sugar , confront an empty and befouled world armed with nothing more than wit , determination and a good heart and , to our satisfaction , they win the novel is likely to be hawked as another retelling of jane eyre because it presents us with yet another madwoman and another attic , along with a host of tough and resilient women but it s not the shadows of bront or even dickens that are cast over this world instead , it s that of the later and darker victorians trollope , james , meredith , hardy and george eliot these are the realists who , as james said of trollope , helped the heart of man to know itself better to carry out that pedagogical work , faber needs some room or , rather , we do the story is very simple the events , though captivating , few and very far between we follow here , sometimes like stalkers , the lives of some unimportant people in the london of 1874 and 1875 the central character , 19yearold sugar , has been at her trade since she was 13 , when her mother , mrs castaway , roused the little girl from an uneasy sleep you need n't shiver anymore a kind gentleman has come to keep you warm into sugar s later life crawls a befuddled lost soul , william rackham , heir to a minor perfume and cosmetics fortune rackham is saddled with a mad wife and illusions that he has an artistic temperament these three along with rackham s little girl , sophie his brother , henry and henry s dogooding lady friend are about it as far as characters go there is an older prostitute , caroline , who tries to save henry from the world of piety and guilt \( and fails \) , and a few other choral figures , but none that count the action is even more barebones sugar quickly cures william of the notion that he is in any way special , while convincing him she is doing just the reverse she also masters the rules of commerce \( so simple , even an imbecile could understand them \) and sets her lover on course to become a successful , completely trivial businessman meanwhile , she struggles to find a secure place in william s life , and a way out of the world she has known a world of thin sheets layered between pads to soak up the ooze of customers , of sloppy douching with alum and sulfate of zinc , of streets filled with great gobs and trails of slush , like monstrous spills of semen but william is no rescuer , and sugar nearly dies trying to make him one as she progresses from being his mistress , set up in fancy digs , to being his child s governess , living in his home , she very nearly , as the poem says , folds up and gets lost herself her apparent deliverance lands her in a new hell , and she must spring herself from a trap far stronger than the one her cynical whore of a mother had set for her the astonishing thing is that we not only sympathize with sugar s ironic journey and watch as she goes , but are led on a parallel path slowly we find ourselves inside the heroine s head , led there by a rhetoric so skilled and daring that we hardly know it s operating like george eliot , faber teases us into making mistakes , almost forcing us to make easy judgments and indulge in stereotyping through nearly half of the novel his voice is omniscient , mocking the characters and us the opening words , watch your step , cast us as aliens , foreigners in a different land the narrator sets himself up as our guide , offering little lectures on the scenery and exploring the innermost thoughts of the characters , as if both were of equal interest and transparency this device , so reminiscent of the great victorian realists , allows us the space we need to exhaust our knowingness and move past satire and into that haven carved out by 19thcentury agnostics inescapable sympathy this sympathy is neither sentimental nor observed it is seeded and nurtured gradually , the novel s direct address disappears and we are allowed to make our own way , to find feelings and states of being we did n't know we possessed as sugar begins to see that she has landed herself in a house where men are unhappy and women driven mad , she reminds herself of the cynical wisdom of her mother one squirt of slime from the man , one fishy egg in the woman , and behold they shall call his name emmanuel facing that emptiness as directly as marlow faces kurtz \( god damn god ! she screams \) , sugar , unlike marlow , does not turn away from others but straight toward them as her mentor in whoring and life , caroline , has said to her there ai n't nuffink in this world but men and women , is there \? so you got to care about 'em , ai n't you , else what you got to care about \? so sugar determines to rescue not prostitutes but wives and daughters the women come together , united by straight thinking and unreasoning optimism marlow judges kurtz s fragile intended as incapable of handling the horror that surrounds us and lurks inside but faber knows better , and so does sugar out of their darkness comes grace
to the editor re facing the hormone dilemma \( letters , july 22 \) it is disappointing that many women who are taking hormones have been left with the impression that harm has been done or that they are in grave danger in fact , none of the individual risks in the women s health initiative study , other than blood clots , were distinguishable from chance alone in the ovarian cancer study , the increased risk was not statistically significant until after 20 years of estrogen use , and even then , the increased absolute risk for an individual woman was less than twotenths of 1 percent with women now living a third of their lives after menopause , the health and quality of that life cannot be ignored individual women still have individual symptoms , histories , priorities and risks there is no onesizefitsall response each woman is entitled to an evaluation of her personal risks and benefits by a knowledgeable doctor lila e nachtigall , md new york , july 22 , 2002 the writer is a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at new york university school of medicine

as a baby , hugh robinson was a happy , outgoing child he cooed and giggled and appeared to be developing normally but at about 18 months old he lost his language and socialization skills just before his second birthday , hugh was diagnosed with autism hugh s parents , paul and maura robinson , hired therapists to teach hugh in their westchester home he made good progress but when hugh reached age 5 , he would no longer be eligible for the private program in which he was enrolled the only appropriate specialneeds school in westchester was full then the robinsons heard about a newly established autism program on long island called ascent the robinsons sold their house and purchased a new one in manhasset , close to st hyacinth s church in glen head , where ascent rented space it s an incredible program , mrs robinson said it s extremely hard to find a good program at ascent , hugh thrived his socialization skills improved dramatically then st hyacinth decided to reopen its parochial school al eskanazy of bellmore , the founding board chairman and president of ascent , arranged for new space , and the robinsons and the parents of the other 17 children enrolled in ascent spent the summer painting , sanding and installing ceiling tiles our children were going to be in this program or out on the street , mr eskanazy said volunteer union crews and local companies contributed close to 1 million in time and materials to build walls and floors , create classrooms and install bathrooms and air conditioning , heating and sprinkler systems like an oldfashioned barnraising , a playground was raised one day last month on an empty lot next to the new school more than 175 volunteers helped out to get our kids the free and appropriate education , we 're sweating , said larry haber , whose son conor , 2 1 2 , is the youngest child at ascent by helping our kids we are helping everybody else on sept 5 , ascent started the school year in new 11 , 000squarefoot , stateoftheart quarters in the united way building on grand boulevard in deer park the new school has four large , airy classrooms , conference rooms , a kitchen and showers where the children practice domestic skills , and a room for bicycling , rollerblading and hockey on a padded floor the yearround program , chartered for 24 children ages 3 to 21 , has a studentteacher ratio of one to one sixty percent of expenses are covered by state funds the remainder , 700 , 000 , comes from golf outings and other fundraisers nancy shamow , executive director of the school , said teachers go to the children s home at 6 am and teach the parents how to teach a child to wash , dress , eat breakfast , say goodbye and get on a bus in the evenings , the teachers return to the homes to demonstrate bedtime procedures if a child has difficulty sitting in a barber s chair and ca n't get a haircut , dr shamow said , the teachers simulate it , then go with the parent to the barber shop the kids are only here for 5 1 2 hours a day , but autism is 24 hours , dr shamow said children with autism , which afflicts about one person in 500 , tend to engage in ritualistic behaviors like spinning , rocking or flapping their hands they may parrot words but have difficulty communicating even basic needs many are unable to interact with others , dr shamow said at the playground raising , mr robinson , a lawyer for the music division of aol time warner , mixed cement bill forman , the director of radiology at mercy medical center in rockville centre , drove 30inch spikes with a sledgehammer into the playground s border his son , robert , 8 , is a student at the school as a parent of a child with autism , you feel pretty alone and you struggle , dr forman said after robert was diagnosed with autism as a toddler , dr forman and his wife , laura carinci , an obstetriciangynecologist , sought out a program using a muchsoughtafter method called applied behavior analysis but the only schools on the island using the method had long waiting lists they enrolled robert in a suffolk boces program he regressed along with nine other families , the formans opened their own school they brought in mr eskanazy and hired dr shamow , a psychologist and expert in autism who had experience opening a similar school in levittown , to run it at first they met in private homes when you have an autistic child , the smallest thing they do is like a miracle , dr carinci said he s learning to do math he learned how to ride a bike and rollerblade and brush his teeth and communicate when the ascent group formed five years ago , brandon malone regularly ran around the house naked because he could not stand the feel of fabric on his skin he ate only pizza and bacon he punched himself in the face and urinated on the floor he threw tantrums and injured himself in frustration his father , brian malone , a partner in a shipping and brokerage business from glen cove , said that every aspect of family life was stressed it was a hardship to take him out of the house , mr malone said life was hell for him we were searching for help and there was none no proper programs were available mr malone credits ascent for brandon s progress at age 8 , brandon bathes and dresses himself he is learning to read he plays games on the computer he can ask for juice and to play game boy
cambridge , mass by title , they are economic advisers to the president by training , they are disciples of marty marty martin s feldstein may well be the most influential economist in washington , even though he has not worked there since 1984 , when he returned to the harvard faculty lawrence b lindsey , president bush s top economic official , once worked as mr feldstein s top teaching assistant , overseeing the logistics of his big economics lecture to harvard undergraduates r glenn hubbard , now chairman of the white house council of economic advisers , fed punch cards filled with data into an early computer to help mr feldstein with his research in one of mr hubbard s first classes as a graduate student at harvard taught , of course , by mr feldstein he sometimes sat with richard h clarida , who now runs the economic policy division of the treasury department add mr clarida s deputy and mr hubbard s chief of staff , among others , and the bush administration s economic team begins to look like a feldstein alumni club i do n't think it s chance , mr lindsey said i think it s marty almost two decades after the softspoken but harddriving mr feldstein ended a fractious stint in the reagan administration , he has built an empire of influence that is probably unmatched in his field aside from his administration ties , he holds sway over many fellow economists as president of the nation s premier economic research organization , and thousands of harvard students who have taken his , and only his , economics class during their harvard years have gone on to become policy makers and corporate executives mr feldstein s stature and his vigorous defense of mr bush s economic policies have won him frequent mention as a possible candidate to succeed alan greenspan eventually as chairman of the federal reserve known for his wideranging research on taxes and government spending that examines the ways public policy affects people s behavior , mr feldstein has helped shift the economic consensus to the right over the last three decades as an adviser to mr bush s 2000 campaign and a frequent contributor to oped pages , mr feldstein provided much of the intellectual rationale for the tax cut last year he continues to push for changes in the social security system that would include private investment accounts a slight , bookish man with a friendly manner , mr feldstein has become a mentor even to many economists who think he exaggerates the effect of taxes his work was on the one hand on the cutting edge of research theory and on the other hand directly relevant to the policy of the day , said lawrence h summers , the president of harvard , another student of mr feldstein and a treasury secretary in the clinton administration that s why he drew so many graduate students to him jonathan gruber , an economist at the massachusetts institute of technology who studied with mr feldstein and also worked in the clinton administration s treasury department , added , he has shown that taxes matter since 1977 , mr feldstein has wielded academic power as the president of the national bureau of economic research , an elite , nonpartisan group of about 500 economists best known as the body that decides when recessions begin and end more important , it publishes research papers long before any academic journal does , determining which work is likely to receive wide attention from his corner office at the bureau , above a cambridge furniture store , mr feldstein helps shape the public debate and determine the research priorities of other economists as he chooses the subjects of the bureau s books and conferences aside from traveling with his wife , kathleen , who is also an economist , and spending time at their homes in the boston suburbs , cape cod and vermont , mr feldstein is almost always at the bureau when he is at harvard , he shows a fondness for the classroom unusual for his rank he still teaches that introductory economics class , the college s largest lecture while the curriculum is by no means out of the mainstream , it does bear his conservative stamp i think that is quite a remarkable number , he said during a lecture one recent monday , using a laser pointer to direct attention to 4365 percent displayed on an enormous screen inside the steeply tiered sanders theater , just off harvard yard the percentage signified the portion of every additional dollar earned by somebody making 35 , 000 a year that goes to paying taxes i find it quite strange that somebody at this relatively low income is paying about half of his income in taxes , he said in his clear , dry speaking style what high marginal tax rates do is distort behavior except for a few beeps emanating from electronic devices , the class could have happened decades earlier mr feldstein himself took introductory economics in this theater as a freshman more than 40 years ago at the time , he planned to follow the career path of his father , a lawyer , but was seduced by economics
ten years after the federal government set out to clean up a mammography industry awash in scandal , many women are still getting inaccurate examinations at clinics bearing the federal seal of approval the federal mammography standards have eliminated many of the most egregious abuses and have made the breast xrays much easier to read but an examination by the new york times has found that they have largely failed to remedy what many experts say is the biggest problem of all the skill of the doctors who interpret those xray films for the last year or so , scientists have been engaged in a highly technical , and highprofile , debate about how many lives mammography screening can save but the times found that many doctors , and their clinics , are compromising whatever precise value mammography has new and littlenoticed research is revealing that radiologists miss far more tumors than previously assumed many of them simply lack the ability to discern the elusive signs of breast cancer in the shadows and swirls of a mammogram , widely regarded as the hardest task in all of radiology yet the government , by its own admission , holds the doctors to only minimum standards little specialized training is required while studies indicate that doctors need to read at least 2 , 500 films each year to stay sharp , the government mandates a mere 480 , a number many experts say is so low as to be virtually meaningless most important , the government does not monitor the doctors' performance even those who miss far more than their share of cancers tend to remain unidentified and beyond regulatory reach in fact , the doctors themselves rarely know with any precision whether they are doing a good job or not and the women are often left to fend for themselves it s what i call radiologist roulette , says trisha edgerton , a physicist who used to run the mammography oversight program in california in a sense , that is simply the way most of medicine works except for the clearest cases of criminality or gross incompetence , doctors have always pretty much policed themselves but mammography was supposed to be different it was , after all , the great publichealth hope of the politically charged war on breast cancer so , in the early 90 s , the government embarked on an extraordinary experiment a system of national standards to ensure accurate screening for the more than 30 million women who had mammograms each year at a time of rising furor about doctor competency and medical errors , many people believed that the experiment might become a template for other precincts of medicine as well today , at governmentcertified clinics all over the country , women can pick up official pamphlets assuring them that your mammogram will be safe and of high quality congress is about to extend the program for five more years but the inside story of that regulatory experiment based on hundreds of interviews with doctors , experts and regulators over the course of a year is a chronicle of opportunities lost far from ensuring highquality mammography for all , many experts acknowledge , the system has promoted mediocre care for all but an elite , or just plain lucky , few ms edgerton , the former california official , still likes to talk to women about the danger of walking into a clinic and simply trusting that the radiologist will be a specialist at mammography that was what she did 10 years ago , and the doctor , a specialist in diagnosing brain cancers , missed an obvious tumor in her breast we fixed a lot of loopholes , and now we can fix the next one , she says it s the radiologist it is not that the federal officials who wrote the rules were unconcerned about doctor competency in fact , they were so worried that they considered ordering a twostep system of oversight regular skills tests and a mechanism to track doctors and identify those who did not measure up but they abandoned those proposals amid fierce resistance from doctors and their allies in the end , the rules dealt primarily with the xray machines and images the 20 , 000 doctors who read mammograms could go on regulating themselves now the precise contours of the problem are beginning to emerge , as a small but growing number of researchers and state officials start doing what the federal government declined to do keep track of the doctors women have long been told that mammography is an imperfect tool , that even the best doctors , under ideal conditions , will miss as many as 1 in 10 potentially visible cancers but new studies in north carolina and new hampshire have found that doctors' skills vary widely some clinics miss nearly 4 tumors in 10 in new york , health officials analyzing data from a government program for poor women stumbled across a bronx radiologist , fully qualified under federal rules , who they say missed 25 cancers over two years while catching only 7 these findings come at a particularly sensitive time for mammography even among radiologists , mammography has always been something of a lowstatus medical specialty , struggling to attract topflight doctors that problem has been compounded of late , as shrinking reimbursements and soaring malpractice rates push some radiologists toward easier , and more lucrative , work at the same time , the innate value of mammography screening itself has become the subject of a roiling scientific debate

in their embarrassment at losing yet another game they were expected to win , the jets are again looking for excuses instead of looking in the mirror as if nothing else had happened in the 149 loss to the buffalo bills until only 13 seconds remained , quarterback vinny testaverde and paul hackett , the offensive coordinator , blamed each other for the pass that curtis martin took to the 17yard line while chewing up too much time to call an organized final play testaverde blamed hackett for calling a pass that , if completed , would take too much time off the clock hackett blamed testaverde for not changing the call instead , both testaverde and hackett should have taken the blame for what happened in the first 59 minutes 47 seconds the jets' not being able to generate a touchdown against the bills , a team with a 212 record and a pass defense that had been pierced for 431 yards and 2 touchdowns the week before by atlanta quarterback chris chandler and now the jets will miss the super bowl xxxvi playoffs if they lose sunday in oakland and the seahawks defeat kansas city in seattle but in their recent history , looking for excuses after losing games they were expected to win has been the jets' fatal flaw after the jets lost their last three games last season to miss the playoffs , some players griped that coach al groh had worked them too hard in practice , that they were too weary during those three losses , especially in a 107 defeat to the detroit lions when a victory would have clinched a playoff berth when groh departed to the university of virginia and the new coach , herman edwards , kept his promise of gentler practices , these jets supposedly had fresh legs to carry them through the race to the playoffs but on sunday , those fresh legs did n't matter against the bills , the jets had the same plodding offense they 've had all season and when they did n't , or could n't , score a touchdown , the jets did what they did last season looked for somebody else to blame last season it was groh now it is hackett in contrast , did you notice how the giants reacted to the embarrassment of not making the playoffs after having gone to the super bowl a year ago \? nobody beat us but us , tight end howard cross , the giants' elder statesman in his 13th season , said we had a lot of bad plays and we did n't make blocks when we needed to we had a lot of dumb penalties and a lot of mistakes , and we did it to ourselves in philadelphia on sunday , the giants' defense could n't hold a 2114 lead that dissolved into a 2421 loss we 're supposed to make plays and we did n't make them , defensive tackle keith hamilton said it starts with the pass rush i'm not going to put it on the defensive backs it s all of us it s all of us nobody beat us but us but with the jets , it s never us it s always somebody else or it s their usual december doldrums except in 1998 , when bill parcells was the coach that season the jets swept their four december games , clinching the american football conference east title with a 1710 victory in buffalo , then jolted jacksonville , 3424 , in the playoffs before losing the afc championship game in denver , 2310 none of those jets dared to blame parcells s hard practices maybe they also realized they had lost to a better broncos team in what would be john elway s last hurrah in denver but losing to a bills team they were expected to beat is embarrassing , just as beating a better team is exhilarating in what is really the jets' only moment in their 42season history , their 167 upset of the baltimore colts in super bowl iii , they were a 17point underdog before they proved to be the better team as the reigning super bowl champions , the jets breezed to a 104 record in 1969 but lost to the chiefs , 136 , at shea in the american football league playoffs since then , the jets staggered through the 70 s , had some shaky success in the 80 s , then stumbled through the 90 s until parcells arrived more often than not , whenever the jets have been expected to win an important game , they have n't then again , without being expected to win in oakland on sunday , maybe the jets will win but if they miss the playoffs again , be assured that they will find somebody else to blame the jets do n't know how to pronounce us photo paul hackett \( ed betz for the new york times \)
washington , april 16 following are excerpts from opinions in the supreme court s ruling today in ashcroft v free speech coalition , which overturned provisions of the child pornography prevention act of 1996 from the decision by justice kennedy we consider in this case whether the child pornography prevention act of 1996 abridges the freedom of speech the cppa extends the federal prohibition against child pornography to sexually explicit images that appear to depict minors but were produced without using any real children the statute prohibits , in specific circumstances , possessing or distributing these images , which may be created by using adults who look like minors or by using computer imaging the new technology , according to congress , makes it possible to create realistic images of children who do not exist by prohibiting child pornography that does not depict an actual child , the statute goes beyond new york v ferber \( 1982 \) , which distinguished child pornography from other sexually explicit speech because of the state s interest in protecting the children exploited by the production process as a general rule , pornography can be banned only if obscene , but under ferber , pornography showing minors can be proscribed whether or not the images are obscene under the definition set forth in miller v california \( 1973 \) like the law in ferber , the cppa seeks to reach beyond obscenity , and it makes no attempt to conform to the miller standard for instance , the statute would reach visual depictions such as movies , even if they have redeeming social value the principal question to be resolved then is whether the cppa is constitutional where it proscribes a significant universe of speech that is neither obscene under miller nor child pornography under ferber before 1996 , congress defined child pornography as the type of depictions at issue in ferber , images made using actual minors the cppa retains that prohibition and adds three other prohibited categories of speech , of which the first , 2256 \( 8 \) \( b \) , and the third , 2256 \( 8 \) \( d \) , are at issue in this case section 2256 \( 8 \) \( b \) prohibits any visual depiction , including any photograph , film , video , picture or computer or computergenerated image or picture that is , or appears to be , of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct the prohibition on any visual depiction does not depend at all on how the image is produced the section captures a range of depictions , sometimes called virtual child pornography , which include computergenerated images , as well as images produced by more traditional means for instance , the literal terms of the statute embrace a renaissance painting depicting a scene from classical mythology , a picture that appears to be , of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct the statute also prohibits hollywood movies , filmed without any child actors , if a jury believes an actor appears to be a minor engaging in actual or simulated sexual intercourse these images do not involve , let alone harm , any children in the production process but congress decided the materials threaten children in other , less direct , ways pedophiles might use the materials to encourage children to participate in sexual activity furthermore , pedophiles might whet their own sexual appetites with the pornographic images , thereby increasing the creation and distribution of child pornography and the sexual abuse and exploitation of actual children under these rationales , harm flows from the content of the images , not from the means of their production the first amendment commands , congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech the government may violate this mandate in many ways , but a law imposing criminal penalties on protected speech is a stark example of speech suppression the cppa s penalties are indeed severe a first offender may be imprisoned for 15 years a repeat offender faces a prison sentence of not less than 5 years and not more than 30 years in prison while even minor punishments can chill protected speech , this case provides a textbook example of why we permit facial challenges to statutes that burden expression with these severe penalties in force , few legitimate movie producers or book publishers , or few other speakers in any capacity , would risk distributing images in or near the uncertain reach of this law the constitution gives significant protection from overbroad laws that chill speech within the first amendment s vast and privileged sphere under this principle , the cppa is unconstitutional on its face if it prohibits a substantial amount of protected expression the sexual abuse of a child is a most serious crime and an act repugnant to the moral instincts of a decent people in its legislative findings , congress recognized that there are subcultures of persons who harbor illicit desires for children and commit criminal acts to gratify the impulses congress also found that surrounding the serious offenders are those who flirt with these impulses and trade pictures and written accounts of sexual activity with young children
television viewers are besieged by lawyers nowadays whether in syndication or prime time , legal dramas seem to be on every channel , providing an alluring image of the legal system but it s not always a recognizable one in the plot lines of the practice , ed , ally mcbeal , law and order , 100 centre street , the court , philly , the guardian , family law and judging amy , the practice of law comes across as far more moral and emotionally complex than it is in real life tonight nbc will broadcast la law the movie , which reunites the cast of the longrunning , critically acclaimed program that arguably started this phenomenon back in the mid1980 s before la law , the models for television lawyers were limited to reruns of perry mason and first runs of matlock , criminal defense lawyers who never lost a case and whom , along with their clients , we never got to know we now live in a culture obsessed with lawyers and judges whether it s daytime courtroom programs featuring actual litigants , nighttime talk shows that discuss the legal events of the day , feature films and television dramas that focus on legal themes or bestselling courtroom mystery thrillers , the mass consumption of art in america is feeding on a steady diet of law but why is this so , given that most people have decidedly unfavorable opinions of the legal profession \? audiences are drawn to these legal shows because they provide insight into their own lives , said sidney lumet , the director of films like the verdict , daniel and 12 angry men and the creator of the much admired but recently canceled television series 100 centre street we 're all criminals at heart the only question is whether we get caught and how will the world respond to us will it be merciful or righteous , or will it be punitive \? but contemporary legal dramas go beyond using law merely as an arena for dramatic conflict what many of these shows do best is attack the legal system for being obsessed with achieving correct legal results even if the outcomes are morally wrong on television , lawyers are capable of exercising moral judgment and have a private conscience the system will invariably thwart them , and they know it , but they care about their clients , and that s why we root for them these lawyers play by complicated rules , but like laymen they also wonder why legal decisions are not subject to the more simple scrutiny of knowing the difference between right and wrong despite all the symbols and pretenses the robes and the gavels , the briefcases and the sidebars the law itself is often beside the point in these programs television dramas focus not on hard rules or cold facts , but on the complexity of life that takes place outside the courthouse , the moral dilemmas and emotional upheavals , the personal compromises and ethical sacrifices that the legal system brings to bear on those who come before it what makes these shows work is that it all comes down to a person s moral foundation , said steven bochco , the creator of la law and , most recently , philly that s what s interesting , not whether someone is guilty or innocent these shows create questions , they place lawyers in tough moral positions , finding cracks in our sense of the absolute on its own the law is n't all that compelling what s interesting is an individual s personal , internal compass writers as diverse as sophocles , shakespeare , dickens , dostoyevsky , melville , kafka , camus and doctorow have long represented the ways in which the law can crush souls and damage lives indeed , novelists are well aware of all that gets left out of legal opinions , the false closures of those presumably final judgments , the disregard for the inner lives of human beings , the grievances that turn ordinary citizens into relentless litigants today , this tradition of literary legal criticism is more likely to be found on television than in literature there is a natural enmity between the artist and the legal profession , and it s mostly because of the law s rigidness and need for codification , mr lumet said the artist sees that in applying rules strictly , there is too much lost humanity and no room for discretion or motive the lawyers on legal dramas are often not heroic characters in fact , lawyers on television come across as models of human imperfection overwhelmed by conflicts unrelated to law , addicted to harmful things and people , financially troubled and emotionally open and vulnerable legal dramas provide a far more humanized vision of lawyers than how we normally regard them , as being too narrowly focused , unable to see the big picture and unconcerned about what they see when they look in the mirror i suppose my characters are more alive emotionally than most lawyers really are , said david e kelley , a former lawyer and the creator and writer of the practice and ally mcbeal \( which ends after this , its fifth season \) i like to think that there are lawyers out there who engage in these conversations , for whom morality is part of their lives and practice but it s hard , because the arena itself does not lend itself to moral debates instead , you have two sides trying to win , with total dramatic license to be argumentative
detroit , feb 6 rangers right wing theo fleury and detroit defenseman chris chelios engaged in a shouting and shoving match on the ice during the third period of tonight s game , a 31 red wings victory chelios apparently taunted fleury , who has been beset by personal problems unrelated to his treatment for alcohol and substance abuse last year fleury missed the final 20 games of last season after he entered rehabilitation i 'll be giving mr campbell a call tomorrow , fleury said , referring to colin campbell , the national hockey league executive in charge of discipline there s no place in the game for that when asked what chelios had said , fleury repeatedly said , ask him fleury contended that what was said was very , very personal chelios , while telling a reporter it s none of your business what was said , did not dispute fleury s characterization i think theo s kind of bringing this upon himself , chelios said it s unfortunate with what has happened to him over the last couple of years but that s just the way it is on the ice , in the heat of the battle , what are you going to do \? a lot of things are said on the ice i think he overreacted i do n't care if he calls the league i did n't say anything wrong when someone takes a poke at your goalie , you have to say something he started yapping first , so i started yapping second it s no big deal
east rutherford , nj , feb 1 the hall of fame basketball coach pete carril answered his phone in sacramento last summer and was pleased to hear the voice on the other end but he could not offer much help eddie jordan , the nets' assistant coach , was on the line he said , 'coach , i'm going to use your offense , ' carril recalled earlier this season 'can we go over a few things \? ' carril said , i told him no , that was hard for me to do because i work for the enemy now instead , carril told jordan to run the plays he did when jordan was the kings coach jordan coached sacramento from 1997 to 1998 and posted a 3364 record carril , the sweatervested icon at princeton for 29 years , had come out retirement to be one of his assistants the two , friendly since jordan had played at rutgers and with the nets , used to enjoy long tutoring sessions in carril s office this summer , when the nets were picking up the pieces after a 2656 season , jordan thought the timing was right for the nets to borrow more than a page from the princeton offense the nets had just traded for jason kidd , drafted athletic and heady rookies and were counting on landing the freeagent center todd macculloch jordan presented his ideas to coach byron scott before the rookie summer league began scott , entering his second year as the nets' coach , was skeptical he had been a kings assistant coach with carril from 1998 to 2000 , though the kings did not run many of carril s plays how long is this going to take to teach \? scott asked jordan jordan said five minutes , which made scott more wary show me , scott said , adding he came out here and in five minutes they had it and these were rookies i thought if they could pick it up that quick , i know that s good the result was that the nets won the boston summer league the nets \( 3014 \) are leading the eastern conference their offense showed why they have been successful on thursday night against the milwaukee bucks the nets burst onto the court with a crisply choreographed first quarter , complete with fast cuts off silent cues , instinctive passes , 3point accuracy and a 727 fieldgoal percentage in the first 12 minutes the nets scored 43 points , equaling their season high for a quarter against the washington wizards on jan 16 granted it was against the milwaukee bucks , whose defense has been known to sponsor such offensive clinics , but none have been as bad this season as the 125100 drubbing the nets handed them on thursday night they tricked us all night , bucks point guard sam cassell said bucks coach george karl said they were playing at an incredibly good level right now , i think they play the right way they play basketball as a team , they play very fast , and it accentuates jason kidd s talents and skills on saturday , the nets will play host to the raptors , who punctured the nets' offensive rhythm two weeks ago in toronto with their physical play but when it is run correctly , the nets' offense is designed to alleviate pressure it may take five minutes to teach , but it takes more than five months to understand every play has variations that begin with a twoguard front and the forwards almost at the wings players read the defense and then read where a teammate makes a cut to the basket to know which option to choose the nets have a team policy that does not allow reporters to speak to assistant coaches but the players say jordan , who employed parts of this offense as a nets assistant coach in 1999 , drills them daily , repeating the principles of the system so their movements off the ball become instinctive during the game you see coach jordan , when we run it to perfection , he 'll pop up and raise his hands in the air smiling because it s his brainchild , the rookie jason collins said keith van horn said sometimes head coaches do n't like to take advice from assistant coaches but byron s done a great job of listening eddie told him to do something that he thought would be successful and byron agreed , and it s just turned out great for us scott realized that jordan had something good to offer when he and the other coaches mike o'koren , lawrence frank and the advance scout tom barisse tested it this summer i knew eddie could teach it , but we had to know it just as well , scott said i fell in love with it i was totally sold it was almost like a drug i told eddie , 'give me some more' now success has become addictive with kidd in control , sparking the offense with his visionary passes and cuts without the ball our offense is something you have to get used to , there are a lot of reads , kidd said it makes you play with one another rather than it just being a twoman show with pick and rolls the great mystery is who is going to go off first on thursday , kerry kittles scored 20 points the first quarter nine different players have led the team in scoring this season as the nets average 963 points , nearly 5 more points than last season but this season , all five starters average in double figures , with kenyon martin leading the way at 157 points a game you should n't have to call any plays , you should just come down the court and just pass the ball and cut and everyone knows what we 're into , kittles said it really suits the talent we have on our team the backdoor passes the nets complete now often become alleyoop dunks the princeton offense can put you to sleep , said the rookie richard jefferson but the nets' brand of halfcourt basketball is anything but deliberate heck , no , jefferson said we 've got a bunch of athletes carril said it is a mistake to think that his college offense is synonymous with ivy league ball because it actually originated at the professional level the boston celtics , with bob cousy in the 1960 s , first ran it the knicks , with bill bradley and walt frazier , used it in the 1970 s it s very difficult to teach and it takes time and you have to be patient , scott said the reward has been evident while jordan raises his arms in exultation , scott shakes his head in wonder every now and then you see ballerinas dancing and how fluid and graceful they are , scott said that s our offense when it s really working , it is to me like poetry in motion photo the nets say the assistant coach eddie jordan is largely responsible for installing the uptempo offense that has been so successful this season \( g paul burnett the new york times \)
the draft system put into place by george young , the former giants general manager , was designed to eliminate major mistakes reservoirs of information on each player are compiled and analyzed and reanalyzed , the theory being that a potentially significant flaw physical or mental will be caught , and each player who passes through this colander will have a successful career it does not always happen that way , of course the giants have made prescient selections in the last decade of nfl drafts , particularly in the middle and late rounds , but they have also made some major mistakes in the first round you 'd like 100 percent of your picks to work out , giants general manager ernie accorsi said , but 100 percent are n't going to make it the giants have gathered 40yard dash times and psychological testing and the like , and ultimately , unforeseen factors will determine whether a player is good , great or bad derek brown was supposed to be the tight end who would have the same impact as mark bavaro on his first practice in 1992 , he tried blocking lawrence taylor , had his helmet dented and never made an imprint , never mind an impact the giants chose receiver thomas lewis for his physical skills in 1994 , and he disappeared as a pro on the other hand , jessie armstead was an eighthround pick in 1993 and became a star through sheer determination if there had been a way to measure that intangible , armstead never would have lasted until the eighth round you 're talking about a sport where these guys have to go out there and get slugged in the mouth 40 times a game , accorsi said last month , and you never know how anyone is going to react to that the giants will probably select miami tight end jeremy shockey if he is available on saturday when their pick rolls around , at 15th over all scouts are fascinated by his physical tools , but they also have questions why was n't he heavily recruited out of high school \? why did it take so long for the coaching staff at miami to make shockey a major part of the hurricanes' offense \? will he improve as a blocker \? receiver ashley lelie of hawaii is extremely fast , and the giants may pick him if shockey has already been selected scouts wonder if he will crumple against bigger , stronger athletes at the highest level of competition an ageold question becomes more and more pertinent as nfl compensation increases everybody has tried to figure out how to answer this for a long time once somebody gets money , are they going to work as hard or harder than before \? said gil brandt , considered a pioneer in the draft process or will their signing bonus represent utopia for them \? none of the giants' firstround picks in the past decade have been impact players safety shaun williams \( '98 \) has probably been the best of them , and receiver ike hilliard \( '97 \) and right tackle luke petitgout \( '99 \) have been solid players but a roll call of players did not work out derek brown , dave brown \( '93 \) , lewis \( '94 \) , cedric jones \( '96 \) tyrone wheatley \( '95 \) established himself after he left the giants running back ron dayne , their top pick in 2000 , has yet to become an integral part of the offense the giants have fared better in the later rounds michael strahan \( '93 \) and jason sehorn \( '94 \) were secondround picks sam garnes \( '97 \) was a fifthround pick and keith hamilton \( '92 \) a fourthround pick if the giants do pick shockey , he will be only the fourth tight end taken by the giants since derek brown was drafted if the giants select a wide receiver , as expected , they will probably do so in the first four rounds they have taken only three wide receivers after the fourth round in the past decade about twothirds of the players selected after the fourth round have been defensive players the giants look for players capable of joining special teams the giants will also be looking for a left tackle \( arizona state s levi jones , perhaps \) , and a defensive end , with strahan s status beyond this year uncertain photo michael strahan was the giants' secondround pick in 1993 \( vincent laforet the new york times \)
a new york city fire official said yesterday that plans were going ahead for a bronze statue honoring the firefighters killed on sept 11 despite some complaints about a decision to make the statue ethnically and racially diverse the statue is to be based on a photograph taken at the collapsed world trade center of three firefighters raising an american flag it was commissioned by forest city ratner , the company that manages the building where the fire department headquarters is located in brooklyn , according to francis x gribbon , the deputy commissioner for public information the photograph , taken by thomas e franklin of the record of hackensack , shows three white firefighters but the statue will depict one white , one black and one hispanic and none will be based on the likeness of a real firefighter instead , the artists selected three professional models to pose for the piece , mr gribbon said this is an artistic representation we are not seeking to have an exact replica of the photograph , he said of the 343 firefighters killed on sept 11 , about a dozen were black and a dozen were hispanic , according to department estimates but ever since a clay model of the statue was completed last month , there have been grumblings among some firefighters that the department was sacrificing historical accuracy for political correctness though they are being paid by forest city ratner , the sculptors have consulted with department officials thomas manley , the sergeantatarms in the uniformed firefighters association , said the statue was discussed at a recent union meeting but no vote was taken speaking for himself , he said the photograph was a symbol of american patriotism and should not be tinkered with i would hope that the makers of the statue would understand that the politically correct thing to do would be to put the original three firefighters on the statue , he said lt paul washington , president of the vulcan society , an organization of black firefighters , said the group was more concerned about getting more black firefighters on the job than in statues nonetheless , he said he was pleased that the statue would be racially and ethnically representative we think it is a good idea that the fire department make the statue reflect everyone who sacrificed and everyone who gave their lives , lieutenant washington said
it was just a sleepy sunday morning on a street on long island , a block of modest homes , small lawns , swimming pools too big for the backyards and garage doors casually left open on weekends the sky was a soft watercolor blue , and there was no hint in the gentle setting of the surreal day to come in the twostory white colonialstyle house at 1122 lake shore drive in massapequa park , dennis musca was halfasleep his wife , dorothy , had gone out , but their daughters , dianna , 16 , and danielle , 10 , were still upstairs in their pajamas then , mr musca s 79yearold father walked in with a highpowered rifle , and a longstanding family feud erupted gunshots terrorized the family sliding glass doors were blown out the terrified girls hid in a bedroom closet for 20 minutes with a phone line open to 911 the grandfather set fire to the house , according to the nassau county police , the girls and father fled as the flames spread , and the neighborhood became an allday war zone , caught up in a siege of the grandfather by a cordon of police sharpshooters nearby homes were evacuated and the neighborhood was locked down as the police discovered cans of gasoline in the intruder s car and used a bomb squad robot to remove them by late yesterday afternoon , despite tons of water poured in by firefighters , the home had been destroyed and was verging on collapse with no signs of life inside , the police began searching the ruins for the grandfather , but said they believed he had perished in the fire it was just after 8 30 am , the police said , when a bluish fourdoor 1995 oldsmobile pulled up at the curb and rosario musca , a tall , grayhaired widower from lindenhurst , stepped out he had five red cans of gasoline in the trunk , the police said , but did not take them out instead , armed with a highpowered rifle , he strode to the house like a figure of judgment what had set off his anger was not immediately clear , investigators said , but a neighbor who asked not to be identified said that a feud between rosario musca and his son had been going on for years , and that dennis musca had even obtained an order of protection against his father because of threats and menacing actions the family lived in fear of him , the neighbor said inside , dennis and rosario musca began arguing loudly upstairs , dianna and danielle heard it , and then heard gunshots , one of which blew out sliding glass doors at the rear of the house , overlooking a backyard inground pool the girls hid in their bedroom closet with a phone and called 911 at 8 40 am to report an unknown intruder fighting with their father and firing a gun downstairs the police operator , henrietta williams , kept the girls on the line , trying to calm them while more than 40 officers , including teams of sharpshooters with highpowered rifles , were dispatched to surround the house meanwhile , dennis rosario tried to calm his father , and managed to get him out the front door but when rosario musca saw police officers arriving , he ran back inside , and the siege began houses on either side were evacuated , the residents of a dozen homes on the block were told to stay indoors , and traffic for blocks around was cut off it was shortly after the police arrived at 8 45 am that rosario musca is believed to have set fire to the house , using flames from an oven in the kitchen , said detective lt kevin smith , a nassau county police spokesman dennis musca , seeing the flames , tried to run back inside to get his daughters , but was held back by the officers , the lieutenant said smelling smoke , the cowering girls asked the 911 operator what to do and were told to try to get out if they saw a chance it was apparently as they ran downstairs that they recognized the intruder as their grandfather they fled through the shattered sliding glass doors into the backyard , where two emergency service officers , richard lester and christopher cooper , were waiting and helped them over a fence to the home of a neighbor on the way , dianna lost her shoe and , the neighbor said , kept repeating , how can grandpa do this to us \? six pieces of firefighting equipment and 120 firefighters responded to the fire , but were unable to get into the house because of the continuing siege as a result , the firefighters poured water through windows from a distance , but were not able to effectively attack the flames , which spread through the house crisis negotiators were brought in , but never succeeded in establishing contact with rosario musca the police said they fired no shots during the daylong siege , and said that the man inside apparently had fired none at the officers a neighbor reported hearing a loud bang from inside late in the morning , but it was unclear if it was a shot or some effect of the fire meanwhile , the police opened the trunk of rosario musca s car and discovered the cans of gasoline wrapped in plastic bags fearing they were linked to some trigger and might be a bomb , the police called in the arsonbomb squad , which brought a robot to the scene the robot removed the gasoline , and no bomb was found dennis musca and his daughters were not injured , but were taken to nassau university medical center in east meadow for precautionary examinations and were treated for trauma in lindenhurst , where rosario musca had owned a home on jefferson avenue for more than five years , neighbors said he had been married at least twice , and that his last wife , marie , had died in 1993 after 17 years of marriage they said he had converted an attached garage to an apartment that he rented out they called him an energetic , friendly man who mowed his own lawn and talked over the fence , but had few visitors by late afternoon , flames had gutted the musca house in massapequa park , the basement was full of water and the wrecked structure appeared to be in danger of collapse the police , having seen or heard nothing of rosario musca all day , circled the house with a sound detector a big microphone on a long pole but heard no sign of life later they began a search of the smoldering ruins for mr musca s body no remains were immediately found the search was called off last night and was expected to resume this morning , the police said during the afternoon , as the danger seemed to subside , neighbors set up tables of gatorade for the firefighters and police officers , and there was much for lake shore drive to talk about a family feud that had ended tragically , the perils of a quiet sunday in the suburbs photos the shell of massapequa park home where the owner s father walked in and fired off a rifle , according to the police he is believed to have died after setting the house on fire \( phil marino for the new york times \) \( pg b1 \) the police searched the trunk of a car driven by rosario musca officials later said it contained five cans of gasoline wrapped in plastic bags \( phil marino for the new york times \) \( pg b3 \)
it was close to midnight when the firefighters arrived on the scene of a grisly motorcycle accident in queens the other night in the dark , amid blinding flashes of red light , the rescue squad was one big blur of men in blackandyellow uniforms this was a fairly routine job for the firefighters at new york city s engine company 173 but it was a major call for another company that responded the volunteer firefighters of west hamilton beach , a cloistered waterfront enclave of howard beach , queens it was especially riveting for the department s many new members , including carlo demarco , a mechanic , who joined several months ago and had worked only a small brush fire and joanne karl , a homemaker who had volunteered for dispatch duty three days earlier and was still memorizing radio codes like 1060 \( major emergency \) and 1026 \( food on the stove \) the two new members are among dozens of men and women who have joined the city s obscure brigade of volunteer firefighters since sept 11 , driven , they say , by the desire to protect their neighborhoods , become parttime heroes and players , however minor , in the nation s fight against terrorism the west hamilton house , one of the 10 volunteer departments in the city , has enlisted 15 new members since the attack on the world trade center , compared with 2 or 3 or none in a typical year in the bronx , one volunteer fire department has so many new members 25 that the chief affectionately refers to them as the 9 11 crew the borough s other department has received so many new applications that it is considering turning volunteers away , a shocking prospect in the everdesperateforhelp world of the vollies , as the firefighters call themselves i felt compelled to see what i could do , said bruce stock , a postal service driver who joined the west hamilton volunteer department two weeks ago and already has a nickname in the house , stone cold , because of his resemblance to a certain professional wrestler god forbid anything else happens despite expectations that the events of sept 11 would pique interest in the thousands of volunteer fire departments across the country , the swelling volunteer ranks are almost entirely a new york story volunteer departments , overshadowed in new york city by the nation s largest paid fire department and tucked away in smalltown crevices of the city , are a staple of suburban and rural life in the rest of the country , often the sole protectors of their sprawling territories but sept 11 did nothing to reverse the steady decline nationwide in the numbers of volunteers , who account for 73 percent of all firefighters in the country , according to heather schafer , executive director of the national volunteer fire council , an advocacy group in washington in new york city , however , most of the 10 centuryold volunteer departments 5 in queens , 2 in the bronx , 2 in staten island and one in brooklyn say they have been inundated with new volunteers \( three fire departments , the roxbury and broad channel volunteer departments in queens and the richmond department in staten island , said they had not seen a notable increase in membership since sept 11 in brooklyn , the gerritsen beach volunteer fire department has seen an outpouring of cash and equipment donations since sept 11 \) officials at the new york fire department said they had not seen a change in applications since sept 11 , but would have more information in november when the next entrance exam is scheduled they have begun a 4 million to 5 million recruitment campaign to attract new and minority applicants to the department on sept 11 , the department , for the first time in memory , dispatched the volunteers to city firehouses left empty as everyone rushed to the scene of the terrorist attack usually , the volunteers monitor the city dispatch system and show up at fires in their neighborhoods to help out , or they receive calls from neighbors the volunteer houses also sent their ambulances and many of their members to ground zero one ambulance , belonging to the volunteer department in broad channel , queens , was crushed at ground zero , and the rig belonging to a bronx department , the aviation volunteer fire department , was heavily damaged there at the world trade center , the volunteers stretched hose lines and dug for days after the attack , the west hamilton beach department lent its rig , a 1978 pumper , to city companies that needed fire engines to be a part of the many funerals of the last nine months and the members of the edgewater park volunteer hose company no 1 in the bronx paid 300 each out of their own pockets this year for new dress blues to replace their mixandmatch handmedowns we went to so many funerals and we looked at ourselves and said , 'it s time , ' said the edgewater department s chief , john e steel the volunteer departments , which operate on meager budgets sometimes the members pitch in for gasoline and other basics and often find new yorkers surprised to learn that they exist , have begun to market and reinvent themselves
how is new york different from shanghai , s o paulo and mexico city \? for one thing , these cities are growing and new york is stalled shanghai s leaders , in fact , have resolved to make it the world s leading city by 2020 they are taking full advantage of their harbor and rail links to become a center of trade , finance and culture could shanghai really surpass new york \? yes , because they have a plan to do it and new york is resting on its laurels without a plan for growth , new york will not move beyond being a tourist attraction new york has about the same number of people and jobs as it had 50 years ago but the mix of jobs has changed , probably for the worse we 've lost our manufacturing base and concentrated our fortunes on the volatile financial services industry , which fluctuates more than the tides we added jobs in the 90 s , but those just made up for those lost in the late 80 s we 're going nowhere but sideways cities that want to grow do at least two things they foster businesses that expand their economic base , and they build an infrastructure to support physical growth new york s growth has come in waves , and each wave followed , or was accompanied by , a major expansion in its exports and transportation systems the two are related initially , new york was blessed with a harbor that let it surpass all other east coast cities as an economic power subsequently , the erie canal opened the productivity of america s heartland to the world , via new york later , the creation of the subway system enabled new york s population to grow fast enough to support its explosive economic growth none of those developments provide us with any significant advantage now , and we have nothing to replace them with in the 1950 s we lost our harbor norfolk , va , is now the top east coast port , largely because it has rail links to the entire continent and new york city does not as for the scenic erie canal , it now serves no transportation purpose and while the subway system grew rapidly in the first half of the 20th century , not a single new line was build in the second half any capacity gained through extending lines or adding tunnels failed to compensate for losses like the third avenue el our transportation system ca n't support significant growth it is maxed out so are the roads and bridges our airports are inadequate ferries are charming , but for new york to depend on them would be like shanghai depending on sampans if new york is to avoid becoming a secondtier city , it must take several steps first , it needs an economic development policy that diversifies and expands the types of businesses we can call our own thirty years ago it was obvious that computers were going to be a critical element of the economy today , the city has millions of computers how many were built here \? essentially zero we could have built an industry around just our own need second , we have to build major new transportation systems to make the city more livable and economically stronger a crossharbor tunnel from brooklyn to new jersey is essential , as is extending rail lines to the airports most critical is doubling the size of the subway system we need not only the second avenue line and the extension of the no 7 line down the west side , but also the addition of one new line each decade for the next 100 years we must also shift our priorities consider the williamsburg bridge , which was built for subways in the 1920 s it carried 500 , 000 people to manhattan daily then someone had the bright idea of using it mostly for cars the bridge currently is at full capacity , carrying 250 , 000 people per day by car and train over the last few hundred years , london , paris and madrid justifiably laid claim to being the world s leading city no longer can they make that claim one hundred years ago , new york s leaders invested in a series of public works like bridges , aqueducts and rail systems that kept new york a major city for decades after those investments stopped we cannot continue to rely on those old decisions for the next 100 years drawing \( justin lane \)
last week , thousands of westchester teenagers took the sat s , which purport to measure their verbal skills and math aptitude in a few weeks , thousands more will sit down to the sat ii s , formerly known as the achievement tests , to measure their mastery of specific subjects these tests have come under fire recently and some prestigious colleges have even proposed that they be dropped as admissions criteria as the parent of a teenager whose aptitude and knowledge base is being assessed at this time , i could n't agree more that the tests are biased and unfair i would like to offer my own version of the sat s , which would much more accurately measure teenage skills sample questions 1 finding a lost learner s driving permit in a teenager s room is like a finding a fragment of the peking man during an archeological dig b where s waldo \? c decoding the human genome d excuse me , who said you could come into my room \? 2 if my curfew is at 12 am , but i get in at 2 am , i am a on time b early c only five minutes late d it s irrelevant , because my parents are the only people in this town who give their kid a curfew e none of the above , because it s not my fault 3 when i am on the phone , i am also a online b online and instant messaging c online , instant messaging and on call waiting d online , instant messaging , on call waiting , and listening to music e all of the above while doing my homework and watching television 4 your parents ask you what happened in school today the correct response is a nothing b i do n't know c i ca n't remember d why are you always harassing me \? e can i use the car \? 5 to convey the following thought that news is quite surprising to me are you certain that it is accurate \? one would say a no way b ohmygod ! ohmygod ! c get out ! d that is like so freakish e like that really happened e nowayohmygodgetoutthatislikesofreakishlikethatreallyhappened i also have ideas for reforming the sat ii s instead of chemistry , math and foreign languages , i suggest sat ii s reflect what teenagers have studied most during high school partying ic and partying iic it is suggested that only the most advanced underclassman take partying iic mastery is expected in explaining to one s parents that of course the parents will be home , while at the same time finding the one home in town where the parents are away for the weekend all students should have basic fluency in telling parents that nobody they know , let alone any of their friends , drink or do drugs rationalization ic students are expected to show proficiency in explaining why a low grade is actually a good grade and must also be able to illustrate that certain teachers have always had it in for this student and everyone in the entire class did badly on the test and besides the teacher is an impossible grader and he does n't like believe in giving even b s rationalization iic advanced students will be expected to make compelling arguments that the more they study , the worse they do , so there is really no reason to do homework at all besides , with everything going on in the mideast and with terrorism all over the world , what could possibly be the point of studying for a physics test \? the beauty of my new system is that it will also do away with sat prep courses and expensive private tutoring , given that my tests truly assess the teenager s natural abilities i know there are a lot of scarsdale mothers out there who feel that standardized testing shortchanges their children surely there are other parents out there who share my sensibilities who s with me \? drawing \( nancy doniger \)
when it comes to saving for retirement , americans are not rational they know they do not put away enough , surveys show but ask them to save more in their 401 \( k \) plans and they balk a buck in hand is irresistibly spent try a different approach ask them to commit now to increasing their savings in the future , make the increase coincide with the next raise , and they cheerfully sign up various quirks embedded in human nature come into play saving more in the future seems much less of a sacrifice when the future arrives , opting out succumbs to inertia and timing the increase to coincide with a raise , so that one cancels out the other , is much more palatable than a cut in takehome pay in the human psyche , giving up a raise not yet in hand is easier for people to accept emotionally than a loss , even the illusion of a loss after all , the money lost is still there , in one s savings account standard economics allows for none of these quirks over a lifetime , people rationally save an optimal amount , mainstream economics holds confronted with the reality that people do not save enough , the mainstream has no solution , except to reiterate that people are rational , so whatever they save must be enough no wonder behavioral economics is making such a splash , becoming the in specialty of young economists from the best graduate schools you have to force savings and take the money away before people have it and ca n't resist spending it , said richard h thaler , a university of chicago economist mr thaler is a pioneer in the development of behavioral economics over the last 25 years , and now he is a leader in finally applying the insights to daily life so far the application focuses on persuading people to save more in 401 \( k \) plans but there are other potential uses fiscal policy is one allowing for human quirks , what is the most effective way to spend public money to promote jobs and economic growth \? if we invested six months in designing a stimulus package using insights from behavioral economics , there is good reason to think it might work , mr thaler said that is still off in the future medicine offers an immediate application some dentists , for example , are beginning to ask behavioral economists how to get patients to return every six months for teeth cleaning reminder postcards do n't often work people put them in a drawer and procrastinate another human quirk that messes up mainstream theory , with its faith in rationally taking good care of teeth most people delay , unless the dentist extracts a commitment , by persuading a patient , when he or she comes in for a cleaning , to make an appointment on the spot for the next cleaning , six months hence the postcard system only facilitates procrastination , said david i laibson , a behavioral economist at harvard , who gets calls from dentists the most promising application so far is retirement savings at a time when workers must save for their own retirement , they are in danger of inadequate income in old age unless they contribute 10 percent of their pay to 401 \( k \) plans , pension experts say and that does not count losses in 401 \( k \) money invested in hightechnology stocks or in the enron corporation such hearty contributions are certainly in the interest of the vanguard group , which administers 401 \( k \) plans for companies like philips electronics north america , a unit of royal philips electronics philips also has a stake under federal law , top executives cannot have retirement savings too out of line with those of ordinary employees so vanguard and philips turned to mr thaler and to shlomo benartzi , at the university of california at los angeles executives had read a paper they wrote , entitled save more tomorrow , reporting on the results at a midwestern company where 162 employees , more than half the staff , had agreed in advance to annual increases in their 401 \( k \) contributions , each increase coinciding with a raise over three years , the contributions rose to 116 percent of income from 35 percent most of the 16 , 000 philips employees enrolled in 401 \( k \) plans save 6 percent or less so philips is experimenting with vanguard administering the test and mr thaler and mr benartzi giving advice , the company will ask 2 , 000 workers next month to commit to annual increases in 401 \( k \) contributions of one , two or three percentage points the first increase would be in april , when philips gives annual raises , although this year , in a recession , a raise is not a sure thing , says lisa pyne , philips s benefits director still , she is counting on inertia to keep people from opting out even the 3 percenters who , absent a raise , might notice the slight decline in takehome pay behavioral economics seems to work , ms pyne said
with the emotional sweep of a verdi opera and the narrative density of a 19thcentury novel , luchino visconti s rocco and his brothers represents the artistic apotheosis of italian neorealism first released in 1960 , the film tells the story of the parondi family , migrants from southern italy who go to milan in search of a better life in five chapters one devoted to each brother visconti chronicles the family s changing fortunes , and in the process explores the transformation of italian society as the children of dispossessed peasants become soldiers , criminals , sports heroes and industrial workers visconti himself belonged to an ancient , aristocratic milanese family and dabbled in equestrianism and fascist politics before his encounter with jean renoir converted him to cinema and , at the same time , to marxism visconti s ideological predilections , which may strike the jaded modern viewer as quaint , are integral to his art , not because his films are propaganda , but because they are informed , like renoir s , by a deep and complex analysis of history , one that allows for irony , as well as earnestness and hope , alongside tragedy the parondi clan s gradual climb from grim poverty to workingclass normalcy coincides with a moral catastrophe their material circumstances improve visibly as they move from the desolate cold of milan s stazione centrale to a dank basement apartment and then to a statesubsidized flat with nicely painted walls , a modern kitchen and a courtyard full of friendly neighbors although they sometimes express nostalgia for their home region , none of them , least of all rosaria , the proud , volcanic matriarch \( katina paxinou \) , entertains the illusion that the life they left behind was a better one but urban life strains the bonds of family and erodes the sturdy , confining norms of loyalty and honor that have sustained the peasants through generations of oppression milan is full of cruelties and temptations as well as undreamedof opportunities those two poles are represented by the second and third brothers , simone \( renato salvatori \) and rocco himself \( alain delon \) they share an aptitude for boxing , and both fall in love with nadia , a prostitute played by annie girardot the fraternal competition , which unfolds with a bleak inevitability worthy of euripides , destroys both nadia and simone , who devolves before our eyes from charming fecklessness to monstrosity , consuming his own humanity in the absence of any moral guidance his descent is mirrored by rocco s rise at the end of the film , one is a murderer and the other a champion , his picture displayed on newspaper kiosks outside the factory where ciro , the next brother , works although the movie s central drama involves the triangle of rocco , simone and nadia , whose shifts of mood are the emotional pivot around which everything else revolves , the saga concludes not with them , but with ciro and luca , the youngest brother \( vincenzo , the eldest , played by spiros focas , has long since settled into the hectic routine of family life , thanks to a propitious marriage to the divine claudia cardinale \) rocco , like mr delon on the verge of international stardom at the picture s end , has vaulted beyond his family and class , just as simone has fallen beneath them but ciro \( max cartier \) , kissing his fianc e and tramping back to work at the alfa romeo plant , is the true embodiment of what they have become the completion of their destiny is left to luca , who , his brother ciro tells him , will be able to return to their abandoned home as a free and honest man , unencumbered by the ancestral burdens of exploitation and prejudice the magic of rocco and his brothers is that this moment of hope of revolutionary optimism , one might say arrives without sentimentality or dogma as he did in his great period dramas senso and the leopard , visconti embedded his schematic sense of history in sensual and emotional detail you do n't observe his characters so much as live alongside them rocco and his brothers , which begins a weeklong run today at film forum , lives on partly through the influence it has had on american filmmakers neither the neighborhood intimacy of mean streets nor the grandeur of the godfather movies is imaginable without visconti s example its richness , though , is inexhaustible , and well served by the spotless new 35millimeter print being shown at film forum , which allows you to hear every note of nino rota s eclectic score and to catch every nuance of giuseppe rotunno s blackandwhite cinematography rocco and his brothers opens today at film forum , 209 west houston street , south village tickets 975 5 for members box office \( 212 \) 7278110 photo annie girardot and alain delon in luchino visconti s rocco and his brothers \( 1960 \) , at film forum \( milestone films \)

mayor michael r bloomberg said yesterday that he believed that the number of homeless people on the city s streets was holding steady , and possibly declining the homeless on the street , all of the statistics that we have calls from the community boards , calls to the community assistance unit say that the numbers are no greater than last year , if anything maybe a little less , mr bloomberg said yesterday the mayor was responding to an article that appeared yesterday in the new york times , reporting that many new yorkers say they are seeing more homeless people across the city than they did a year ago mr bloomberg said residents may be noticing more homeless people because the police have increased efforts to secure the city s bridges and tunnels part of it may be that people are being moved around because the police , for security reasons , wo n't let people sleep in the traditional places , under overpasses and in subways , where they did before , mr bloomberg said neither the city nor groups that advocate on behalf of the homeless keep a tally of the number of transient homeless people on the city s streets , so it is difficult to say with certainty whether the population is rising , staying the same or falling city officials said they would begin conducting an annual census of homeless people this winter mayor bloomberg said that he would continue to focus on qualityoflife issues in the city , and that police commissioner raymond w kelly had the entire police department focusing on them there s absolutely no letup whatsoever , he said we do n't think it s a worse problem than it was before , but we are focusing on it more than ever , and we will continue to do that , he said it s very sad that anybody s on the street , and i have sympathy for the people , but everybody has a right to go about their business and none of us want to see people on the street society can do better and we have a commitment to do that
jerusalem , feb 13 after months of quiet consultations with a top palestinian leader , shimon peres , israel s relentless foreign minister , has drawn up a new peace plan it calls for a ceasefire , immediate recognition of an initial palestinian state on limited turf and a yearlong negotiation over what the final state would look like now mr peres is starting a solitary quest to sell the plan to his prime minister , who resisted his negotiating in the first place to his party , which is under new , more hawkish leadership and to israelis , most of whom , unlike mr peres , have given up on yasir arafat , the palestinian leader i begin , mr peres acknowledged , in an air of total skepticism indeed , as he discussed the plan today in his office here , israeli forces were conducting their most aggressive incursion in the gaza strip of the 16month conflict what mr peres is beginning , at the age of 78 , at what he called the lowest point in israel s impasse with the palestinians , is a fresh attempt to grasp the grail he envisioned at the start of the peace talks that led to the oslo agreement of 1993 after 55 years in public life in which he held every senior israeli office , founded his country s aircraft industry , made israel a reputed nuclear power and won a nobel peace prize mr peres has become an object not merely of skepticism but of ridicule leftist israelis attack him as a dangerous cynic for taking part in the unity government of prime minister ariel sharon rightists attack him as a dangerous dreamer for talking peace with palestinians but he says he has what none of his critics can offer a plan , an alternative to the worsening violence simply advocating it , he believes , will energize the search for a solution by forcing his critics to propose ideas of their own this is the weak point of all the skeptics , he said with magisterial condescension , he dismissed the ridicule , which he said he had heard in previous forays for peace the future always hangs on a minority , he said , and the past hangs on a majority whoever has a new idea is a priori suspected for it i am not impressed still , associates of mr peres predict that if mr sharon rejects the new initiative , the foreign minister will leave the government he refused to discuss the issue on the record but he called the pursuit of a diplomatic solution my reason for being in the government mr peres negotiated the new plan with ahmed qurei , the speaker of the palestinian parliament , who is also known as abu ala the plan does not spell out a division of jerusalem or the precise borders of a palestinian state mr peres is counting on its ambiguity to make it palatable look , it is based on what kissinger used to call 'constructive ambiguity , ' like any compromise , he said you know , romances and peace must be done in twilight you cannot do everything with the full sun but it is not certain that most palestinians have any interest in this twilight romance after a ceasefire , israel under the plan would recognize a palestinian state in roughly 42 percent of the west bank and gaza strip , land already under palestinian control according to the agreement , that is intended to permit negotiations on an equal standing while exacting greater responsibility on the part of the palestinian leadership they will no longer be able to voice the claim that 'the authority is not in our hands , ' he added the two sides would then begin negotiating the boundaries of the state , guided by united nations resolutions on the matter but mr qurei is seeking a letter from mr peres or perhaps from the united states or the european union explicitly stating that the borders would ultimately conform to those of june 4 , 1967 , before israel took the west bank and the gaza strip in a war if the recognition of the palestinian state will be meaningful , it has to include 'on the june 4 , 1967 lines with east jerusalem as its capital , ' said saeb erekat , the palestinians' chief negotiator and i do n't think shimon will accept this and the last thing we need now is someone to say , 'i know and you know and let s pretend we do n't know' but doing away with that pretense would probably doom the plan on the israeli side , mr peres acknowledged at the end of december , when the outlines of the plan mr peres was then still negotiating were leaked , the newspaper maariv polled israelis on the basic points , with no mention of 1967 sixtyone percent said they supported it mr peres wants the final agreement to be negotiated ahead of the next israeli elections , in october 2003 otherwise the election will be about personality , he said , and the subject will be who can bring an end to terror quicker and for that reason everybody will say shoot more , act more , ido n'tknowwhattodomore and it leads to nowhere the very existence of the plan conflicts with a basic position of mr sharon s the prime minister has repeatedly said he will not negotiate while violence continues to do so , he fears , would be to reward palestinians for israeli lives lost in the 16month conflict but many palestinians fear that to provide a ceasefire in the absence of negotiations would be to reward israelis for palestinian lives lost , with nothing to show for them
for dr rusty west , a physician at the nocona medical clinic in nocona , tex , the free golf balls , dinners and sports tickets he had received over the years from drug companies were a small price to pay for access to him and the other doctors in his practice but the trade group representing the pharmaceutical industry is now discouraging such gifts through a voluntary code of ethics that took effect in july though many other doctors seem to feel the same way as dr west , such guidelines from the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america should come as no surprise offering gifts unrelated to a physician s practice a common way to gain access to a physician was explicitly discouraged in 1991 by ethics guidelines of the american medical association , to which roughly 30 percent of physicians belong the texas medical association , to which dr west belongs , also denounces such gifts \( dr west says that he has not been offered any perks lately , but that he had no ethical qualms about accepting them before \) it s pretty hard to see how a round of golf entails a benefit to patients , said dr alan r nelson , a former president of the ama , who this year headed a group charged with educating its members about the ethics of accepting drugcompany gifts the pharmaceutical group s code is viewed by some people in the industry as a leveler , helping to ensure that companies compete for a physician s attention based solely on the merits of their products the guidelines , among other things , prohibit any gifts , even of modest value , that are not for the primary benefit of patients anatomical models for examination rooms are ok world series tickets for a doctor s family are not few pharmaceutical companies admit to engaging in the behavior that the guidelines reject quite frankly , complying with the phrma code is not going to require any changes on our part , said bradley t sheares , president of the us human health division of merck company but scott willoughby , assistant general counsel for the pharmaceutical group , said the industry was facing a growing perception problem our ceo s kept getting beat up in the paper over our marketing practices and wanted us to find a way to put a code together to keep bad press from happening , he said if people thought we were doing a bad thing , we wanted to change that perception perhaps not enough , however it is up to each pharmaceutical company to establish mechanisms to punish representatives who break the rules some consumer groups find the selfimposed call for better behavior disingenuous here is an industry that has created , funded and built its livelihood around these conflicts , said ronald f pollack , executive director of families usa in washington to expect effective policing of these practices when they 're the creator of these problems is a stretch of credibility some government officials feel that way , too in june , vermont became the first state in the country to enact a law requiring all pharmaceutical companies to report gifts for physicians if the gifts are worth more than 25 we think most physicians will not take anything over 25 if they know their names are going to be on the web associated with these pharmaceutical companies , said gov howard dean of vermont , who once was a practicing physician himself doctors , meanwhile , seem to be wrestling with their own ethics code earlier this year , the polyclinic , which runs three health care clinics in seattle , started charging the pharmaceutical representatives 30 to drop off samples howard springer , the practice s associate administrator , said that this did not violate the ama s policy prohibiting physicians from accepting cash payments , because we 're not guaranteeing them access to the physicians but dr leonard j morse , chairman of the ama s council on ethical and judicial affairs , disagreed it s inappropriate to the ama code , he said such payments should not be accepted it s a moot point for now polyclinic , which once had 15 to 20 visits a day from pharmaceutical representatives , now has none after imposing the fee , mr springer said for drug companies , the challenge goes beyond merely promulgating a new code of behavior the public will be watching for attempts to skirt the spirit of the guidelines doctors should refresh their memories about their own code and refuse the gifts they should have been refusing all along if they fail to comply , state governments may have to step in laws like vermont s will go a long way toward policing the ethical behavior of the companies and the physicians if they cannot police themselves drawing \( david g klein \)

for america elsa followed later he deserted her in sparta , ky , and headed for canada , where he became frederick philip grove , a novelist and a familyvalues man elsa made her way to manhattan and within a year married an expatriate german baron , leopold von freytagloringhoven , who in 1914 sailed to europe to fight in the war and took his own life a few years later , leaving her only his name elsa came into her own as part of the new york dada scene her sexual fieldwork continued , with many successes and a few notable disappointments she developed a crush on marcel duchamp , who responded with passive evasion \( marcel , marcel , i love you like hell , marcel was her cri de coeur \) william carlos williams initiated a casual flirtation only to learn that she was not a casual person she ambushed him at his home in rutherford , nj he retaliated by decking her on a manhattan street she started to make art painted portraits , witty , delicate sculptures of found materials and assemblagestyle costumes her beyondthefringe daring was a power of example for her male colleagues the wannabe dadaist ezra pound spoke approvingly of her principle of nonacquiescence and may have produced collaborative results ms gammel presents strong evidence that the baroness supplied duchamp with the urinal from which his groundbreaking fountain was made , and provided the prototype for his crossdressed rrose selavy if her contributions to art went unacknowledged , she was recognized for her poetry thanks to other women margaret anderson and jane heap , editors of the little review , published her experimental work , which mixed personal statement , fractured syntax and phonetic sounds djuna barnes , a devoted fan , commissioned elsa to write a memoir , which she planned to use as raw material for a biography none of this helped elsa in a material way she was too na ve to take care of herself economically what little money she had she spent on stray animals she took into her claptrap apartments in her mid40 s , she already looked derelict and she was very difficult she was antisemitic and homophobic , despite her jewish friends and her own bisexuality she became implacable in her demands for support and attention a few people , like barnes , heap and the photographer berenice abbott , stuck by her more or less to the end , though at an increasing , selfprotective distance the end was sad in 1923 , the baroness decided to return to europe after relinquishing her greenwich village apartment , she spent her last month in new york camping out in upper manhattan parks she arrived in berlin to learn her father had died and disinherited her destitute , she sold newspapers on the kurf rstendamm she thought paris might be the solution , but could n't get a visa turning up for an interview at the french consulate in berlin with a birthday cake on her head to demonstrate that she was an artist , a universal citizen did n't help she finally got to paris in 1926 , but nothing happened for her there she had been too poor and too tired for too long she died in her flat , asphyxiated by gas left on , deliberately or accidentally , by herself or someone else barnes claimed the body , but later forgot where her friend was buried , or if she had been buried at all the baroness could not have asked for a more thoughtful and engaged monument than gammel s book stylistically , it s a bit flatfooted as the title suggests , this is an interpretive biography , filtering a life through late20thcentury feminism and gender studies , making no attempt to streamline its theoretical mechanics what carries the day is the fact that gammel , a professor of english at the university of prince edward island in canada , is clearly for her subject all the baroness s faults and absurdities are noted in detail , but so is her role as a pathfinder in transgressive sexuality , and as an artist here , elsa is both exemplary and cautionary , valiant and pitiable , a pioneer and a victim , bigger than life but unprotected from life when barnes was struggling in the 1930 s to write her biography of the baroness she never finished it a friend advised her to think of elsa in as detached a way as you possibly can not as a saint or a madwoman , but as a woman of genius , alone in the world , frantic gammel has taken that advice to heart , and a dense , passionate book has come from it
the roundhouse right , thrown with malicious intent saturday night in chicago , did not come from a bruising power forward or an ornery point guard it came from none other than the nba s most imposing player the 7foot1 , 340pluspound shaquille o'neal o'neal , the los angeles lakers' allstar center , was suspended for three games and fined 15 , 000 yesterday by the nba for his violent outburst after chicago s brad miller and charles oakley committed flagrant fouls against him o'neal s punch barely missed the head of miller , the bulls' starting center , whose back was turned when o'neal lost control the two ended up in a heap by the bulls' bench as a melee ensued with less than three minutes left in a game the bulls won in overtime the nba also suspended miller for one game for committing the flagrant foul that led to the fight oakley was suspended for two games one for his flagrant foul against o'neal , simultaneous with miller s the other for accumulating too many flagrantfoul points whether it was an aberration or not , the incident illuminated one of the nba s worst fears when a funloving superstar from the league s defending champions turns into an angry headhunter , something is amiss there s only so much a person can take as far as physical abuse , kobe bryant , o'neal s teammate , said yesterday at the lakers' practice facility in el segundo , calif i'm not saying fighting is an option it s a last resort o'neal , miller and oakley became the third , fourth and fifth players suspended this season for flagrant fouls nets forward kenyon martin has already missed three games because of flagrant fouls and subsequent fights over the last few weeks o'neal s reaction was the second time a marquee player went after someone who he felt had been overly aggressive this season orlando s tracy mcgrady charged martin on jan 4 after martin came down hard across his head under the basket mcgrady was fined but not suspended saturday s incident also shed light on the effectiveness this season of nba referees , who have been routinely criticized by players and the outspoken owner of the dallas mavericks , mark cuban cuban was recently fined 500 , 000 by the league for his remarks the crew chief at the lakersbulls game on saturday night was danny crawford , one of the nba s most respected officials o'neal will lose nearly 800 , 000 in salary for going after miller he will be eligible to return next tuesday against denver oakley was fined 10 , 000 , and miller was fined 7 , 500 shaq feels embarrassed about it , i'm sure , lakers coach phil jackson said after o'neal left practice without speaking to the news media yesterday the nature of a man is to defend himself he told me he was sorry it happened and he would keep it under control i told him i do n't condone what he did , he hurt the team o'neal missed last night s game against memphis , and will miss games tomorrow against miami and saturday against san antonio , the first meeting of the season between last season s western conference finalists o'neal was also suspended early in the 199798 season , when he missed one game for slapping utah center greg ostertag after a morning shootaround on saturday night , o'neal was fouled hard as he received the ball in the low post with 2 minutes 44 seconds remaining o'neal immediately went after miller miller and oakley had already committed several hard fouls against o'neal in the game many of the lakers expressed surprise that o'neal would react to a hard foul in such a way shaq is not the type of person to snap , mark madsen , a forward , said he s always smiling , laughing but after years of absorbing and doling out physical abuse near the basket , the indomitable o'neal had grown frustrated with the regularity of roughhouse play down low his poor freethrow shooting over the years o'neal entered this season shooting 531 from the line has invited teams to design a defense named for him the hackashaq , in which players purposely foul o'neal to make him shoot free throws rather than allow him to take highpercentage shots around the rim in o'neal s eyes , the outburst was long overdue he had been warning of retaliation for several years and publicly campaigned for commissioner david stern to look into the matter in an interview nearly a year ago , o'neal said now that i have a championship ring , let me say this if i feel someone is trying to hurt me , i will take action foul me hard under the basket and i 've got something for you one day , somebody s going to foul me hard and i'm going to go crazy i do n't think the league knows that i do n't think they know that i will fight photo shaquille o'neal being restrained during the melee with chicago \( associated press \)
for cbs sports , the preseason national football league production seminar is a day to renew acquaintances , reflect on the 2001 season , listen to rules changes , chat with commissioner paul tagliabue and hear the boss s pep talk but there were no lessons in telestrating or , surprisingly , the art of parsing replays in 20 seconds or less producing good football games is not good enough anymore , sean mcmanus , president of cbs sports , told about 125 staffers yesterday in a conference room at the network s headquarters in midtown manhattan we have to produce memorable games it was also an opportunity to boast about cbs s primetime successes like csi and the need for game announcers to promote , without goading , nonfootball programs one of the reasons why we 're given 500 million a year for football , plus 60 million on production , mcmanus said , is to promote our entertainment programming of course , such sentiments are expected at such a gettogether but who knew about the fashion element \? here , the cbs wardrobe chieftain , rich valenza , told all commentators that they have graduated from wearing joseph abboud s menswear to the canadian designer arnold brant s and , valenza provided the crucial updates on ties , which generated as much talk as talk of the quarterback tuck rule big knots are back the news did not impress deion sanders , who is going into his first full season as an analyst for the nfl today program the fashionobsessed sanders said the tie news did n't make it to the 'hood this is cbs s fifth season back as an nfl broadcaster , after a fouryear hiatus while there has been stability at the games , chiefly with the no 1 team of phil simms and greg gumbel , mcmanus has juggled , with mixed results , the nfl today roster last year , he added sanders part time , and earlier this year , he added dan marino and boomer esiason after being given the goahead by leslie moonves , the cbs president , to hire both , not just one when he addressed the group , esiason said , dan is the looks deion is the outfits i am the substance esiason appeared to thrive on insulting the equally blond simms i'm the darker and betterlooking one , esiason said he s the one with a super bowl ring two , simms , the former giant , said from his seat but you did n't play in the second one , esiason said you did n't play in yours , either , simms said , pumping his fist , remembering esiason s loss they would later seek tagliabue s help in mediating who is the fairerskinned former quarterback sometimes , the only way to decide is to flip a coin , tagliabue said call it , boomer tagliabue flipped then told esiason you 're more fair skinned tagliabue discussed more pressing issues , none more important to cbs than the future of the league s television rights the nfl s deals with cbs , abc , fox and espn are in their fifth seasons , after which the league can exercise an option to negotiate a new deal or proceed with three more years our strong preference is to keep the contracts in place for the full eight years and extend them , he said but the timetable for making deals will be based on how the league crafts a satellite tvdigital cable strategy once its directv satellite contract expires after this season if more football shifts to cable , the broadcast networks may not want to pay as much as they are now the seminar s most timeconsuming presentation came from mike pereira , the league s director of officiating rules changes and interpretations abounded forget the pylon when it s touched by a player , he said , referring to the foam rubber markers at the ends of the goal lines if a ball bounces into a pylon , it s dead if a player touches it , keep on going looking at video of new england s adam vinatieri kicking the winning field goal in the super bowl , he noted that seven seconds remained on the clock before the kick after the kick , time expired a normal field goal attempt takes five seconds , he said there will be no more second second attempts he vowed that officials would forbid defensive players from lining up in the neutral zone we only called it when they went beyond it , he said now we 'll be diligent regarding the tuck rule which became the focus of controversy in the new englandoakland playoff game last january pereira said attempts were made to change it , to no avail in that game , with 1 minute 50 seconds left , new england quarterback tom brady appeared to pump fake , and when the ball was jarred loose , the official ruled it a fumble upon review , it was changed to an incomplete pass we tried to change the rule , that after a 45degree or 90degree angle , you said , 'yeah , that s a fumble , ' or 'yeah , that s an incomplete pass , ' he said like it or not , we stayed with the complete motion of the arm he seemed pleased
hempstead , ny , jan 7 by the time jets coach herman edwards , deprived of sleep , dropped off his wife at home and got back to his office at 5 30 this morning to begin looking at film , there were close to 30 messages of congratulations on his answering machine people are proud , edwards said this afternoon , his voice catching with emotion it s a good feeling , that people care about you because i care about people that s my job in life , to try to help them you feel all that on the day after the jets clinched a wildcard berth with a lastminute 2422 victory over the oakland raiders , there was little time to return calls or to celebrate the franchise s ninth trip to the postseason edwards gave the players today off after the late flight from oakland , but the coaches began preparing immediately for the first round of the playoffs the jets will face the raiders on saturday , for the second time in six days , because the baltimore ravens defeated the minnesota vikings , 193 , tonight in the final regularseason game of the nfl season had minnesota won , the jets would be playing the dolphins in miami next weekend in the first round the jets will travel to oakland on thursday , giving the players an extra day to adjust to the time difference that , edwards said , would be the best way to combat the danger of fatigue from three crosscountry flights in less than a week while the players played cards on the charter that robert wood johnson iv , the team owner , arranged for their overnight flight home all the starters sat in first class on the 767 , a plane often used for international flights , while the coaches were , appropriately , in coach edwards took a little time to reflect on the circuitous path the jets took to the playoffs today , looking blearyeyed , edwards said that the victory helped to legitimize the foundation he was trying to build for the jets he compared the hurdle the jets overcame sunday to taking training wheels off a bicycle he has long told the players about doing something to put their names in stone with this victory , he said , they are etched the 2001 jets are a playoff team when you win games , it sells it , edwards said the criticism stops obviously , this is a little different than the way it was done here before i felt it was the right way to do things players understand this is the bar now i just orchestrate the band it s my job to get people to believe in what we 're trying to do they bought into it it struggled at times there is a road you have to travel and sometimes the journey is not where you want to go it s been a nice ride so far they 've been embarrassed four games in a row , edwards said of the jets' threegame collapse last season and their failure to clinch a playoff spot against buffalo two weekends ago they had one more chance or they were going through another offseason of 'here comes casper and all of his buddies' i felt worse for them than anybody i felt about as sick as you could feel a week ago after that buffalo deal it s hard to get the good humor fairy down , edwards added , a reference to himself but the good humor fairy was down for about 30 minutes the jets will return to practice tuesday they were unperturbed that they would have to play on the road next weekend they are 71 on the road and 35 at home edwards said the jets were so comfortable playing on the road that when they were introduced in oakland on sunday , they threw barbs right back at the renowned and rowdy raiders fans heckling them edwards seemed comfortable with playing the raiders again when you know your opponent , players feel more comfortable playing them , edwards said they know your basic schemes it just boils down to execution you 're not going to go 360 degrees on somebody you can put in a few wrinkles that we talked about last week in practice this week , the jets will be more concerned with eliminating the errors that nearly cost them a playoff berth while the jets were pleased with the final result , they could not be thrilled with how difficult they made it for themselves they did everything they were not supposed to do they turned the ball over \( three turnovers to none for the raiders \) , they did not control the clock \( the raiders ran 15 more plays than the jets \) , they drew penalties \( 7 for 60 yards \) and they did not run well , rushing for only 94 yards , 46 of them on lamont jordan s touchdown run vinny testaverde threw two interceptions , and his final pass was tipped and incomplete but testaverde also threw some spectacular passes he threaded one over a defender and right to the shoulder of wayne chrebet for 24 yards chrebet also made a highlightreel reception on a ball that testaverde overthrew , tipping the ball to himself in full stretch for a 25yard reception and testaverde shrugged off the two interceptions and led the jets into fieldgoal territory on the winning drive , hitting kevin swayne for 15 yards on thirdand10 and laveranues coles for 10 yards on first down in addition , the jets , who had averaged just 38 percent on thirddown conversions this season , converted 46 percent of them against the raiders still , if raiders quarterback rich gannon had not overthrown a wideopen roland williams , who was already behind the jets' defense and would have gone untouched for a touchdown late in the fourth quarter , the jets would not have had the chance to kick a 53yard field goal to win the game the jets have held on by their fingertips so many times this season that they could do a nailpolish endorsement we won 10 games and we executed for miami and kansas city , chrebet said after the game we have n't played our best ball that s scary to think about if we put it together , we 'll be hard to beat plus , we 're a wildcard team nobody will take us seriously
my father was the greatest person in my life he was not a man of great financial means , but he was very spiritual and genuine he was in the manufacturing business , but he was n't really meant to be in business he was really a teacher he was learned , and he knew the bible by heart he taught sunday school and held services in churches and synagogues he was always strapped for cash , because people would ask for extended credit and then they would n't pay he struggled to make ends meet , but that never concerned him he said to me , when you go to bed at night , make sure the people who have touched you that day are richer for having known you i try to live by that , but i do n't do it nearly as well as he did i grew up in brookline , mass , three blocks from the old boston braves field i loved the braves the red sox always got the big attendance , but i 'd go to braves games there 'd only be 5 , 000 or 10 , 000 people there i got to know the players and when they moved from boston , in 1952 when i was 11 , i cried all night when the new england patriots came up for sale in 1994 and the owner was planning to move them to st louis , i thought of all the 11 and 12yearolds who would have their hearts broken i was determined to buy the team and keep it in new england the turning point in my business life came in 1972 i was 31 , and starting my own paper business i did n't have strong financial backing but i went to newfoundland to bid on a paper mill i was up against all the giant paper companies bidding , first , on the rights to market the paper and then to eventually own the mill none of the big players would give the government a guarantee to sell all the paper no matter what because it was such a cyclical market so i committed to selling at least 200 , 000 tons of paper a year for the mill if i could n't sell it , i 'd have to pay the mill for it it was incredibly risky , but i agreed to the deal and won the bid today , my company , the kraft group , sells paper products in 80 countries i felt the same way then that i felt the night in 1994 that i committed to buying the patriots it was , at the time , the most money ever paid for a sports franchise around the world i thought , am i nuts \? you have a lot of sleepless nights , but you have to do bold things if you want to fulfill your dreams you ca n't just play between the 40yard lines at some point , you 've got to get into the red zone and do the difficult things to help you score of course , winning the super bowl this year was the ultimate turning point within 36 hours , on the coldest day of the year , there were one and a half million people lined up on the streets of boston for our parade it was an overwhelming rush i only wish that my mother and father could have seen it when my father passed away on may 2 , 1975 , he left an ethical will that basically said i 've tried to leave you a good name each generation has to earn that on its own a good name is more important than oil or gold you have to earn it you ca n't buy it photo robert kraft owner and chief executive of the new england patriots \( associated press \)
newark the immigration clerk was standing behind thick glass , but she sounded as if she were speaking from the other side of the looking glass if i did know , i could n't tell you the people who know wo n't tell you this is a window into the immigration court system where excuse the metaphoric excess the drapes have been drawn as never before since sept 11 , when the wilted immigration enforcement apparatus sprang to life , secrecy has become the order of business the government has refused to release the names of people taken into detention for immigration violations and court proceedings for detainees labeled special interest have been closed to the public hence the clerk s artful dodge when asked if any were scheduled on a recent day the secrecy grows from the government s concern for security against terrorism but it appears to be keeping secrets about people with no known connection to terrorism , creating a sense of dark possibilities where none may exist the hushhush policy has become the story of the boy who whispered wolf one east coast immigration judge , who asked that his name remain secret , said the secret cases were just regular cases and that he had heard no evidence of terrorism at the hearings i'm sure there are plenty of terrorists , he said i have n't see any he said the people he had seen were at the wrong place at the wrong time malek zeidan was one of them a syrian who drives an ice cream truck , he was arrested feb 1 for overstaying his visa by 14 years his lawyer , regis fernandez , said immigration agents found mr zeidan while looking for a former roommate in a marriage fraud case overstaying a visa was not an offense aggressively enforced before sept 11 so when agents asked mr zeidan about his violation , according to a relative , he told them i came to the country i liked it like everyone else and i stayed he was held for about 40 days , and at his court hearings , his cousin , ali zidan , came to support him they told me i had to leave , ali zidan said they said it s a special case i said what s so special \? he sells ice cream , he works in a gas station at the hearing , according to mr fernandez , the judge cleared the court of everyone but the lawyers and mr zeidan the prosecutor told the judge that mr zeidan was the subject of an investigation related to sept 11 they say that about everyone , mr fernandez said that s a long way of saying he s arab ultimately , mr zeidan was freed on bail , and is facing deportation the immigration and naturalization service would n't comment but , as mr fernandez said , the secrecy creates a cloud of suspicion over him civil liberties groups are pressing the secrecy issues in court in new jersey , where hundreds of ins detainees are held in county jails here deborah jacobs , the executive director of the american civil liberties union of new jersey , said without knowing whom the government has detained , assuring that they are represented by lawyers is difficult , as is monitoring the judicial process she said it reflected the government s attitude that we 're going to do everything we can to prevent another attack and even things that wo n't prevent another attack the government has taken a less information the better approach the fear is that even seemingly innocuous information could one day , somehow , become important to either the united states , or its enemies a recent justice department regulation on controlling information about detainees said what may seem trivial to the uninformed , may appear of great moment to one who has a broad view of the scene it is the bureaucratic version of hey , you never know ronald k chen , an associate dean at rutgers school of law in newark , points out that there s a question of overprotection if the government hints that danger is everywhere at all times , how are we to know the real threats \? the threat of terrorism is an immediate issue at the immigration court here , which happens to be housed in a building named for peter w rodino , the former congressman who headed the house impeachment committee during watergate and he knows something about the enduring threat of government secrecy , which is why he once said , the real security of this nation lies in the integrity of its institutions and the informed confidence of its people
reflecting , as usual , the spirit of the monty python commendation to always look on the bright side of life , this column continues its review of what was good , bad and middling about the last year in business travel by congratulating american airlines for sticking with its more room in coach economyclass seating during 2002 among readers who sent in their own assessments of the year , jim baird agreed that the extra three or four inches of coachcabin legroom american carved out by eliminating two rows of seats without jacking up fares continued to be a real gift to travelers unfortunately , american has not reported any discernible ridership boost since the roomier coach cabins were introduced over two years ago that s perhaps because those who have n't actually sat in the seats do n't really know what a big difference that added legroom makes on a long flight delta air lines also gets a nod in the same category for expanding its fleet of 737800 s , formerly used on shuttle service , to many atlantabound flights they are much more comfortable , and would be welcomed by business travelers on all flights of less than three hours , mr baird said , adding that upgrades are not necessary if you 're not subjected to cattlecar conditions upgrades from the cheap seats are very close to the hearts of seasoned air travelers these days so while we 're handing out a very few compliments , let s commend continental airlines and northwest airlines , which by general consensus continued to lead the industry this year in providing easy upgrades to domestic firstclass seats for members of their elitelevel frequentflier programs ok , enough happy talk now for the more typical grim news , which was that the experience of business travel across the board deteriorated sharply in 2002 more and more , we flew in cramped little planes \( as overall fleets shrank , airlines also switched to many smaller planes \) , on which inflight service too often consisted of a halfounce bag of peanuts and a dreadful movie displayed on a tiny overhead screen with the video fidelity of a fluoroscope flying is now an experience best left to professional masochists and thirdstrike offenders , suggested a reader , seth shostak and for some inexplicable reason , as financial losses threatened to top 8 billion this year , largely because business travelers have fled to lower fares and cheaper carriers , major domestic airlines continued defending the indefensible late1990 svintage businessfare structures all corporate travel managers and most airline industry experts i know describe this with one word lunacy american and delta , to their partial credit , have been experimenting recently with businessfare reductions on selected routes , and northwest has continued offering its menu of less restricted and cheaper bizflex fares introduced in early 2000 but none have yet stepped up to the plate to do what most industry experts insist is absolutely necessary discard the hugely complicated businessfare structure , which is based on lastminute unrestricted fares priced as much as seven times higher than advancepurchase restricted fares it should be replaced with a new businessfare plan that is both cheaper and simpler to grasp industry experts shake their heads in wonder at the major airlines' evident paralysis in confronting this businessfare revenue crisis the testing of lower business fares was certainly a smart move by several airlines , said blake fleetwood , the president of planetarium travel in new york but at the same time , they made this terrible move of tightening up all the regulations on nonrefundable fares , he added , alluding to the airlines' new useitorloseit policies designed to penalize the millions of travelers who have fled high business fares for cheaper nonrefundable leisure fares travel agents who book corporate accounts have another concern , mr fleetwood said as cashdesperate airlines crank up promotion after promotion to fill empty seats , they are sometimes undercutting negotiated corporate rates , including those for international businessclass fares , he said corporations typically negotiate annual contracts with airlines that promise a certain amount of business in exchange for specified discounts a company might negotiate a 35 percent discount on air fares , for example , mr fleetwood said however , new promotions , available to anyone , now sometimes offer the same fares at 50 percent off the corporation can feel really taken advantage of , he said business travelers who have accumulated piles of miles also have growing concerns , as smaller planes reduce the overall number of seats available for upgrades and as carriers like united airlines and us airways struggle through bankruptcy reorganization with no guarantee that either or both will not ultimately disappear into liquidation anticipating trouble ahead , kyle mccarthy , the founder and editor of familytravelforumcom , a web portal for family travel , said that she and her husband , the film producer ron bozman , traded in a few hundred thousand miles they had accumulated on united to take a trip to china with their 10yearold son but they traded the united miles for tickets on singapore airlines , a united partner in star alliance that is widely admired for its comfort , service and stability that trip reminded us of why we travel , and why the airlines , despite themselves , will survive , she said in the meantime , let s hear a complaint from edward j jones , a circuit court judge in multnomah county , ore judge jones says he is still steaming about a 6165 charge for a single fourminute phone call to his son in los angeles , which he spotted on his bill last month at a new york city hotel half of those i tell about it express some sympathy the rest wonder how i ever could have been so stupid as to pick up a phone in a hotel , judge jones said he has since written a complaint to the hotel , which refunded him 50 of the charge but he remains ready to throw the book at hotels that slap high extra fees of any kind on unwary guests in fact , the judge says he will personally send a 5 candy bar to the respondent who writes in with the best example of an outrageous overcharge on any hotel bill during 2002 send nominations to the email address below , please i get to render the verdict , the judge says he sends the candy drawing \( chris gash \)
gaza , july 23 revenge , revenge ! cried tens of thousands of mourners streaming in a threemile procession today through gaza city s bleak streets for the funeral of the hamas military chieftain , sheik salah shehada , the flags of palestinian factions rippling in unity , the fevered emotion punctuated by bursts of gunfire in the air god is great ! an israeli f16 fighter jet dropped a oneton laserguided bomb into al daraj , a densely packed neighborhood here , just a few minutes after midnight , killing not only sheik shehada , whom israel blames for a string of deadly attacks , but 14 other people , among them nine children an area about half the size of a city block was leveled , and several buildings were damaged shifa hospital said more than 140 people had been injured , 15 of them seriously the procession for sheik shehada , whose body was wrapped in a green islamic banner , and most of the other victims drew 100 , 000 or more marchers in their midst as they headed toward al emari mosque , the political leader of hamas , sheik ahmed yassin , was pushed among the crowd in his wheelchair death to israel ! the mourners shouted death to america ! a man held aloft the tiny body of the youngest victim , 2monthold dina mattar , wrapped in a palestinian flag , her small face visible she was killed along with her mother and four siblings when upperstory rooms in their building collapsed prime minister ariel sharon , in a formal written statement issued by his office early in the day , described the airstrike as one of our major successes but as the day wore on and the extent of the civilian casualties became clear , worldwide condemnation began pouring in , including strong criticism from the european union and a rare rebuke from president bush israeli officials scrambled to put the best face on their actions we would n't have done it if we knew what the consequences would be , a senior military official told a gathering of reporters hastily summoned in jerusalem this afternoon the briefing for foreign and israeli reporters was conducted by maj gen dan harel , the army s chief of operations , and maj gen aharon farkash , the head of military intelligence under the rules , some of their remarks could be quoted directly , but others were attributable only to senior military officials late tonight another topranking general , whose identity could not be published under the rules , was calling foreign reporters with further explanations we launched a precision attack , general harel said at the briefing only this house was hit , the house collapsed and this mastermind terrorist died unfortunately , along with him died several civilians , apparently innocent , and we are very sorry for it later in the briefing , a senior military official told the journalists , none of whom had been in gaza during the day this was the only house that collapsed it s not clear to us right now where the other casualties were there was no intention of killing people in the area we did not estimate that houses in the area would be seriously damaged or collapse our assessment was that the damage to them would be minor but in gaza city there was a large flat area in the middle of a street of densely packed apartment houses neighbors said there had been three buildings on the spot , one of three stories , and two of two stories all that remained were chunks of cinder block , several stumps of what had been pillars , pulverized lumps of concrete with twisted snarls of what had been iron reinforcement bars poking out of them , remnants of plumbing pipes and scraps of clothing a halfdozen buildings in an arc around the hole were badly damaged , chunks of their sides ripped off and floors partly destroyed at the israeli

hundreds of civilians over the past two years the highranking general who called the new york times late tonight said the strike against sheik shehada had been purely preemptive , because he had been about to mount a number of major attacks the general said those included placing a truck bomb under a bridge used to speed settlers past a roadblock in the gaza strip , sending a boat filled with explosives to a bathing beach and dispatching suicide bombers to a shopping mall and gunmen to attack a gaza settlement the attack came just a day after sheik yassin had outlined , in several

like every unfolding national drama from watergate to enron , the sexual abuse scandal engulfing the roman catholic church in america is about to become the subject of at least a halfdozen new books but as they begin shipping the first new books to stores this week , publishers are proceeding with trepidation , worried that a story of bungling bishops and pedophilic priests , may , in fact , repel the core catholic audience it was a big debate within the company about whether people concerned about this subject will buy a book , said michael pietsch , publisher of little , brown the house is now releasing its book , betrayal , by the investigative team of the boston globe there were certain people in the room who felt that people are upset by the story but they want to turn away from it , they have heard enough , it is sad and depressing , mr pietsch said but we are betting that inside the anger there is a desire to understand even as news organizations trumpet new revelations of clergy sexual abuse , some catholics appear to believe that the media s focus on the problem is becoming overblown when catholic bookstores and publishers from around the country gathered last week in st charles , ill , for their annual convention , for example , the subject almost never came up in the proceedings , said several people who attended barbara k baker , a consultant to distributors in the catholic bookstore market , said there was only limited interest in books about the scandal , especially compared with popular subjects like the life of pope john paul ii if the current pope dies that would overshadow all of this , she said , the same way after sept 11 we all did not care about gary condit ms baker said she was screening new books on the scandal carefully because most catholics like herself had little patience for partisan assessments this is a crime within the family of the church , she said the other kinds of ancillary questions the church is in crisis , they need to start ordaining women or they need to stop ordaining homosexuals that is the stuff that makes catholics say , 'oh , go away' historically , the subject has had little allure for buyers of books several books addressing the issue have appeared over the last 10 years , including two from major trade publishers none have achieved significant sales , and the two books from the major publishers , one , lead us not into temptation , by the journalist jason berry from doubleday and the other , the gospel of shame , by frank bruni , the new york times reporter , and elinor burkett ,

joel fotinos , director of religious publishing for the penguin putnam division of pearson , said strong and divisive reactions were part of the reason the previous books about abuse did not sell well no matter how a book is written , it will appeal to one audience and anger another , he said mr fotinos and several other publishers said they had no plans to try another still , the accusations of complicity in sheltering pedophiles within the church have never reached as high or attracted such widespread attention other publishers are trying to capitalize on the current moment in a variety of ways little , brown , part of aol time warner , is taking an extremely journalistic approach the team of boston globe reporters that has led coverage of the scandal wrote a 260page manuscript in a month , and it was edited and manufactured in another month the globe is owned by the new york times mr pietsch , little , brown s publisher , said the house had printed 40 , 000 copies in response to bookstore orders and planned to update the book again with each reprinting as more news unfolds most of the other forthcoming books make a variety of arguments about the problem s roots and solutions , on one end of the spectrum , crown , part of random house , has acquired the rights to a book by the columnist and author jimmy breslin , a catholic who takes a critical view of the church the hierarchy has taken a very personal , close , strong thing and just thrown it in the gutter , mr breslin said on friday , calling the cardinals in rome 14 old , whitehaired men in dresses telling people over here how to live at the other end of the spectrum , the conservative publisher regnery is now releasing a previously selfpublished book by michael s rose , goodbye , good men , taking the opposite view it argues that the catholic church needs to be more catholic , not more protestant , said alfred regnery , president of regnery publishing , explaining the author s view that the crisis arose from a takeover of catholic seminaries in the 1960 s by liberals and gay men yesterday , it was the bestselling book about the catholic church on amazoncom other publishers are repackaging

catholic teachings on sexuality in general with a new introduction , cover and subtitle , the church , the priesthood and the question of sexuality , according to publishers weekly in contrast , houghton mifflin , part of vivendi universal , has moved up the publication date without changing the text of a previously written manuscript by the historian gary wills called why i am a catholic mr wills says he argues that the catholic faith has always survived past corruption or sin in the church , and omitting reference to the current scandal underscored the point the editors of basic books ,

paris , dec 20 after a 14year investigation , a french court today convicted the american financier george soros of insider trading and fined him 22 million euros \( 23 million \) , the amount prosecutors said he had profited from the trading mr soros , who was not present in the courtroom , called the verdict unfounded and said he would appeal mr soros , chairman and president of soros fund management , is one of the world s richest fund managers , and probably its most famous he is best known for making huge and very successful speculative bets in currency markets , and for his extensive philanthropy , most notably in countries of eastern europe prosecutors accused mr soros of buying stakes in four formerly stateowned companies in france , including one of the country s leading banks , soci t g n rale , for his quantum endowment fund in 1988 based on confidential information the stakes were worth a total of about 50 million at the time two other defendants in the case jeancharles naouri , 53 , a former senior official in the french finance ministry , and samir traboulsi , 64 , a french citizen of lebanese origin were acquitted at a hearing a month ago , prosecutors recommended fines for all three men , and suggested the 23 million figure for mr soros as a minimum penalty michael vachon , a spokesman for mr soros , said by phone from new york that mr soros is sort of taking it in it is a shock , he said the case drew extensive attention in the french news media , in part because of mr soros s image as the epitome of the freewheeling financier , but also because it illustrated some of the anomalies of financial oversight in france the roots of the case date back to 1987 , when the centerright government of the time privatized soci t g n rale , a major french banking company when the socialist party retook power in an election the next year , the new government sought to regain control of the bank seeing an opportunity to profit while helping their political allies , a group of investors connected with the french financier georges p bereau devised a plan to acquire control of soci t g n rale , sending its share price soaring according to testimony in the trial , an associate of mr p bereau told mr soros by telephone about the planned bid , hoping to enlist his support he declined to take part mr soros s lawyers argued that what mr soros was told was not specific enough or confidential enough to justify a charge of insider trading further , they argued , before 1990 the french law against insider trading applied only to employees trading in their own company s shares at no point was i in possession of inside information regarding soci t g n rale , said mr soros , who was in new york today , in a statement he called the charges against him without merit and said he would appeal the verdict to the highest level necessary his lawyers said the case could be appealed in france and to the european court of justice in luxembourg the extraordinary length of the case would seem to offer strong grounds european courts have overturned rulings on that basis in cases that lasted just five years prosecutors said the case lasted so long in part because it took years to get some needed documents from other countries , notably switzerland mr soros s lawyer , bernard du granrut , told reporters today that an entire range of quite particular issues that we raised were not even considered by the court mr soros had never before been convicted of financial misdeeds in 1979 , he signed a consent decree with the securities and exchange commission in a civil proceeding relating to his trading in the stock of an american computer manufacturer that was about to issue fresh shares commission officials contended that mr soros had sold shares to push down the price of the new shares mr soros acknowledged no wrongdoing , but agreed not to engage in similar practices in the future unlike american law , french law does not provide for civil enforcement actions in insider trading cases they may be pursued here only as criminal matters in an appearance before the court in november , mr soros said , i have been in business all my life , and i think i know what is insider trading , and what it is n't the unsuccessful bid for soci t g n rale by mr p bereau , whose brother michel p bereau is chairman of bnp paribas , formed part of a larger political intrigue involving fran ois mitterrand , who sought after winning reelection as president in 1988 to bring several large french companies under the sway of investors supporting his socialist party an early investigation into the events by the french stock market oversight agency , the commission des op rations de bourse , made little mention of mr soros not until after 1992 did prosecutors question him about his role in the affair none of the central participants in mr p bereau s plan to take over soci t g n rale , including the former chairman of the l'oreal cosmetics group , fran ois dalle , and the french founder of the perrier water group , gustave leven , were brought to trial photos george soros outside a paris courtroom in

it is apparently difficult to make good movies about foreign correspondents , especially war correspondents the latest entry , harrison s flowers , which stars david strathairn as a combat photographer and andie macdowell as his admiring wife , has many of the successes and failures of the genre like the year of living dangerously , it combines an unremarkable lovedriven plot with a riveting background scenes of an infamous atrocity that was perpetrated in croatia a decade ago are graphically reenacted correspondents who have covered foreign countries enjoy the year of living dangerously , a 1982 film , in part because it allows us to imagine that we find big stories by seducing gorgeous diplomats who turn out to be spies and tell us all their secrets in real life , none of us would dream of trying some of the stunts that mel gibson and his lover , played by sigourney weaver , get away with , like crashing through an army roadblock and laughing gaily as soldiers fire automatic rifles at them the same is true of harrison s flowers , in which photographers in the heat of combat take pictures standing up rather than lying on the ground the journalists do n't even know enough serbocroatian to yell novinar ! at the soldiers around them , presuming instead that press ! will do the trick harrison s flowers , which opens on march 15 , tells the story of a prizewinning photographer who wants to give up covering wars but agrees to go to the balkans for one last round of ethnic skirmishes he disappears in croatia and is presumed dead his wife refuses to accept the news she makes her way to the war zone and , with the help of another photographer , played by adrien brody , sets out to find him the plot produces some improbable moments ms macdowell s character , a clueless new jersey yuppie , outsmarts a sniper , survives murderous attacks and even dons military camouflage to make her way through the lines something war correspondents never do , since it makes us indistinguishable from combatants and thus fair game some scenes in harrison s flowers echo other films in one , ms macdowell s character witnesses an offhand execution moments after crossing into yugoslavia , just as the main character in oliver stone s salvador \( 1986 \) did upon entering el salvador in another , an angry young photographer confronts a more celebrated one in a men s room after an awards ceremony and accuses him of hypocrisy it s almost exactly what happened to the main character in the killing fields \( 1984 \) and the movie s warrescue plot line closely resembles that of saving private ryan , right down to the character who loses his grip at the height of combat showing harrison s flowers to a hall full of journalists with combat experience would surely elicit a few hoots of derision , but it has powerful moments its greatest success is its depiction of one of the first massscale crimes in the balkan wars , the sacking of the croatian town of vukovar by serbian forces in 1991 this savage attack , which the filmmakers recreated in the czech republic , foretold the tactics that would be used across the balkans for years to come it entailed the slaughter of civilians and culminated in the killing of scores of invalids in the local hospital the point was not just to capture vukovar but also to send a message that anyone who lived in a town claimed by serbs should flee or face death these horrors evoke various wars , including the current one in afghanistan , which the wall street journal reporter daniel pearl was covering from pakistan when he was kidnapped and killed nine other journalists have been killed covering the war restrictions on their work imposed by the united states and other parties mean that the outside world has little idea of how the war has actually been waged , but we can guess that it is as brutal as other civil wars in harrison s flowers , elie chouraqui , the film s french writer , director and producer , does a harrowing job of reconstructing the vukovar attack this is as close as we have come to seeing on screen the horror of the attacks on lightly defended towns across croatia and bosnia during the 1990 s harrison s flowers bears a welldeserved r rating for its violence , but it does not exaggerate what happened in vukovar mr chouraqui makes no attempt to explore the emotions or the politics that produced the balkan conflict , or the reasons the outside world waited so long to stop it but he does give viewers a real sense of what it was like many will be sobered , and some sickened , to see this shameful piece of history so explicitly replayed anyone who wonders why slobodan milosevic is in the dock at the hague today need only see harrison s flowers paradoxically , mr milosevic is using film clips , including several from a new documentary called yugoslavia the avoidable war , in an attempt to prove his innocence the filmmakers have expressed outrage at this tactic though the film shows the responsibility of outside powers for starting the balkan wars , they say , it is not intended to exculpate yugoslav leaders
barcelona , spain , july 4 wider application of measures known to stem the spread of aids would prevent 29 million people in the world from becoming infected by 2010 , according to two new studies reported today in concluding that there is overwhelming evidence that simple , relatively inexpensive steps can greatly reduce transmission of hiv , the aids virus , the reports said the number of adults infected each year would drop drastically if the measures were implemented some of those measures include improving the status of women , condom promotion and distribution , voluntary counseling and testing , and education programs for students and workers but if countries fail to adopt the measures , about 46 million people , most in subsaharan africa , china and india , would become infected by 2010 , the reports estimated the costs of a sustained aggressive program would be 10 billion a year , or 1 , 000 for each infection prevented , much less , prevention advocates argue , than the cost of treating people once they become ill the studies began after the united nations general assembly special session on aids last year set goals of reducing the number of infected young people by 25 percent by 2005 among young people in the hardesthit countries , and by 25 percent elsewhere by 2010 the goals can be met , said the authors of the reports , who are experienced aids workers from government health agencies , universities , advocacy groups and private foundations in all continents the reports were issued in advance of the 14th international aids conference , which begins here on sunday one report , by researchers from a variety of government and private groups , including the united nations , the world health organization and the united states census bureau , is being published on saturday in the lancet the researchers analyzed 86 published reports of prevention programs around the world and trends in new hiv infection in 126 countries to calculate what impact prevention programs would have in each country in slowing the spread of the virus the second report , sponsored by the bill and melinda gates foundation and the henry j kaiser family foundation , is a blueprint for reducing infections worldwide that report will be discussed at the conference next week among other things , this report calls for efforts to improve the status of women in poor countries , which it says is central to limiting the spread of aids though aids rivals history s worst epidemics , and many people have expressed a fatalistic attitude about its continued spread , none of this is inevitable , dr bernhard schwartlander , a who official and an author of the blueprint , said at a news conference we can very substantially alter the course of the epidemic if we scale up interventions rapidly and aggressively but , he added , there is no time to lose a more aggressive effort would focus on providing accurate information about how to prevent infection , because only one in five people at risk of acquiring the virus now has access to such information for example , in china , which is on the verge of an explosive epidemic , most people do not know what causes aids , dr peter piot , the director of the united nations aids program , said in an interview the blueprint is based on measures that a small number of countries have used to reduce transmission of the virus it outlines the main steps countries can adapt to fit their own needs we know what works , but we are not using it , said dr helene gayle , an epidemiologist from the united states centers for disease control and prevention although experts probably could have issued a similar blueprint five years ago , dr gayle said , there is a lot more evidence now for what works and what it takes to overcome obstacles to make prevention work a key to successful prevention efforts would be to increase the economic , legal , political and social empowerment of women to reduce their vulnerability to hiv , the blueprint said additional measures include drugs and other steps to help prevent transmission of the virus from mother to child education programs in the workplace and in schools , and elsewhere for dropouts treatment of sexually transmitted infections peer counseling for prostitutes and men who have sex with men and programs to make clean needles and syringes available to injecting drug users applying the measures would prevent a varying percentage of infections , ranging from a low of 40 percent in countries with stable or declining prevalence \( like senegal and thailand \) , to a high of 70 percent in countries with rapidly growing epidemics \( like cameroon and china \) nearly a third of the benefits from the prevention measures will accrue to two countries , india and china , with an additional 40 percent in subsaharan africa the reports emphasized that conquering aids requires combining prevention with treatment programs a more aggressive effort to prevent the spread of aids would be far less expensive than treating those infected in an epidemic money is only one obstacle to prevention , said dr david serwadda of makerere university institute of public health in kampala , uganda dr serwadda has worked on aids for 20 years and was cochairman of the group of more than 30 experts that wrote the blueprint for example , fewer than 5 percent of pregnant women in uganda are able to get a drug , nevirapine , that can prevent mothertochild transmission of hiv if mothers take it during labor the problem is not simply the drug s cost , he said , but rather the logistics of making it available to women who may not know that they are infected and most of whom deliver at home , as is the case in uganda these problems are greatest in rural areas promoting use of condoms and programs for voluntary testing and counseling programs has worked , but more such efforts are needed in rural areas , dr serwadda said photo in zambia , an aids victim was visited yesterday by a health worker reports that modest steps could greatly reduce global hiv were issued in advance of an aids conference opening on sunday in barcelona ,

the giant accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers is in the midst of its annual audit on tyco international what inquiring minds want to know is whether the accountants , who missed some of the recent shenanigans at the company , will go easy on tyco this year or will they try tough love in their audit \? asking the questions is more than just an intellectual exercise depending upon how pricewaterhouse assesses the company s enormous amount of good will and other intangible assets on its balance sheet , tyco could be in violation of a covenant on some recently negotiated bank debt last february , a few months before l dennis kozlowski went from esteemed to indicted , tyco negotiated two bank loans totaling about 58 billion one , for 38 billion , is due in four months , the other in 2006 j p morgan chase was the lead bank on both a covenant on both loans dictates that tyco s consolidated debt cannot exceed 525 percent of its total capitalization on june 30 , tyco s debt was 49 percent that cushion could vanish fast if pricewaterhouse finds that tyco s good will is seriously impaired and that some deserves to be written off given dealaday dennis s record of overpaying for acquisitions , which results in ballooning good will , and given that profit margins in all four of the company s businesses have dropped the last four quarters , a hefty writedown is a distinct possibility such a writedown would reduce tyco s total capitalization tyco s balance sheet groaned under good will and other intangible assets of 336 billion in june that figure has more than doubled since 2000 and has more than quadrupled since 1998 amazingly , in june , good will equaled tyco s shareholder equity , or net worth , and accounts for 48 percent of total assets at the company good will is spread among tyco s operations the electronics business has 85 billion , before a 25 billion writedown it has announced in its telecom unit health care has 72 billion fire and security has 82 billion and engineered products , 31 billion other intangible assets amount to 65 billion so how big a writedown of good will or intangibles would put tyco in violation of the debttototal capitalization covenant \? roughly 48 billion , or about 15 percent , of its current intangibles to be sure , the company has more than 5 billion in cash , and tyco could use some of this to reduce the debt assuming that tyco used 3 billion for that , a writedown of 74 billion would put the company in violation of the debt covenant there is a wild card in this debt , however because all of tyco s lenders have equal status none is senior to another if certain debt starts to be repaid , other lenders could become nervous about their loans and demand repayments , too almost all of tyco s debt is unsecured not backed by assets unsecured lenders typically become nervous more easily than those whose loans are secured which brings us back to pricewaterhouse and its audit it is possible that the firm will decide that none of tyco s good will is impaired , require no writedowns and keep the company well within its loan covenants but pricewaterhouse might also think it wise to be a wee bit conservative in its tyco audit this year after all , the recent indictment of mr kozlowski by robert m morgenthau , the manhattan district attorney , indicated that pricewaterhouse missed some highly questionable transactions at tyco people at pricewaterhouse are under investigation for their tyco work there s no telling what pricewaterhouse will do , of course the firm would not comment , but a spokesman said that it always scrutinizes good will of a material nature in audits but shareholders may not have to wait too long for the news last year s annual report shows that pricewaterhouse signed off on tyco s books on oct 18 chart close to its limit the percentage of tyco international s assets that are made up of good will and other intangible items graph shows the percentage of tyco international s assets that are made up of good will and other intangible items , with fiscal years ending in september from 1998 to june 2002
indianapolis the former chairman of sotheby s , a alfred taubman , now inmate no 50444054 at the federal medical center in rochester , minn , is not permitted to conduct business during the 10 minutes a day he is allowed to make calls on his monitored prison phone so when taubman centers , the real estate empire of upscale shopping malls he founded in 1950 with a 5 , 000 loan , received a 148 billion hostile takeover bid two weeks ago from his thriftier rivals , the simon family , he had to read about it in the newspapers as he expected , his son robert , the chairman of taubman centers , flatly rejected the bid citing the taubman family s trump card it controls nearly a third of the votes and its opposition to selling , the board said the offer from the simon family s company , the simon property group , based here , was dead on arrival given the family s position , any efforts to purchase taubman centers would not be productive , it said about an hour after the bid crossed the ticker it was only then that the real surprises began for the older mr taubman , who is serving a year and a day in federal prison for leading a pricefixing scheme with his rival christies that swindled auctionhouse customers out of more than 100 million simon property , the nation s largest owner of malls , including the biggest in the country , the mall of america near minneapolis , has decided to play hardball it is challenging the taubman family s control over taubman centers , arguing in news releases that the family surreptitiously took control of the shopping mall business in 1998 by creating a permanent corporate governance defect embedded in the company s structure and it has a chance of winning or , at least , making it a fight taubman centers dismisses accusations of impropriety as utterly baseless , saying that it issued special shares to taubman family members that year to better align the financial interests of all stakeholders in its many businesses nonetheless , this week the simons are expected to go to the shareholders to seek their shares in taubman , probably with a new , higher offer , and to file lawsuits seeking to overturn the taubmans' voting control over the company the fight pits two of the nation s most storied real estate families against each other and has created a rift in the clubby world of real estate investors some of taubman centers' longtime investors , many of whom consider themselves friends of the family , are outraged by the taubmans' unwillingness to consider selling others are dismissive of the way the simons are going about their bid in our little world , this situation is a bit how would you say it \? uncouth , said one investor in both companies who spoke only on condition of anonymity for fear of alienating the families couth has indeed yielded to cudgels the taubmans have gone on the offensive , accusing the simons of being hypocritical about their own corporate governance structure , which has its own set of mechanisms to block a hostile acquisition unlike the taubman family s voting rights , which are in exact proportion to the family s significant economic interest in taubman centers , the simon family has an extraordinary veto power to block any sale or merger transaction of simon property group , taubman centers said in a news release in midnovember the simons volleyed fast unlike the taubman family , the simon family has no veto power or other control mechanism that could block a sale or merger transaction as the company claims , they said in a release later , the simons' deal team acknowledged that , strictly speaking , this statement was a mistake it said that the family apparently can block a merger , just not in the same way that the taubmans can david simon , the chief executive of simon property and the son of the company s cofounder , melvin simon , shrugs off the criticism as far as i know , no one s made an offer for us , ok \? he said so i do n't feel like we have to defend our position still , the simons' only chance of success lies in challenging the taubmans' control over the company that bears their name and that goes back to the way the taubman empire is put together the publicly traded company , taubman centers , based in bloomfield hills , mich , is a real estate investment trust that owns a stake in an operating partnership , the taubman realty group the partnership owns the properties , which include two dozen malls like the beverly center in los angeles and the new 12 millionsquarefoot mall at millenia in orlando , fla \( most real estate companies have complicated structures to reduce taxes owed by founding families \) until 1998 , the taubman family did not have voting control of the publicly traded company the family s economic interest and voting rights were tied up in the operating partnership on aug 18 , 1998 , however , another major investor in the partnership , the general motors pension trust , said it wanted to swap its investment for direct control of 10 malls that prompted a restructuring of the partnership that significantly affected the publicly traded company , though many investors say that was anything but clear at the time in a news release , taubman centers announced its restructuring , which it said would simplify its governance structure to reflect increased public ownership
after last sunday s matinee performance of lobby hero by kenneth lonergan at theaterworks in hartford , one woman , entranced by the play , exited exclaiming who wrote this \? and how come i never heard of it before \? as if she were doling out kudos , not asking questions why she did not know of this play is for her to figure out , but the fact that she came to see it anyway proves what some lucky people already know there s usually a payoff in store for the venturesome and trusting audiences who are drawn to this enterprising theater and now that woman can join the circle of shared exclusivity that regards mr lonergan as its own discovery championing mr lonergan s work is much like having a favorite outoftheway restaurant that you want to tell special people about , as long as they do n't tell everybody it s not that mr lonergan is little known he is just not that well known he has won success on his own terms for example , the original screenplay you can count on me , which was nominated for an oscar last year , was entirely , inimitably his that s because it was a lowbudget independent film , not a megamilliondollar hollywood product \( mr lonergan disavowed one such screenplay , analyze this , when his work was compromised by committee no matter that it starred robert deniro and turned out to be a huge hit \) and none of his plays have been produced on broadway small is better for mr lonergan , who reveals character through simple dialogue , minute detail and understated moments as for theaterworks , it does n't want to get bigger , as long as 200 seats are filled , which is evidently no problem the perfect match between a playhouse and a playwright , between a cast and a director , is reflected by rob ruggiero s truly pitchperfect staging of lobby hero here is one of those dream times when everything goes right mr lonegan is writing about the frailties of people trapped by a terminally flawed system within human limits , four characters are trying to abide by their own sense of what is just within a society that thrives on injustice remarkably , mr lonergan finds affirmation , by turns absurdly funny and unutterably tender , within the conspiracy of compromise and corruption that forces good people to do bad things bill , a master of betrayal , cannot believe he could ever be betrayed he is a smarmy supercop and a bully with an obsessive sexual disorder david paluck s evershifting portrayal of a shifty character makes it clear that he is not a villain , that we cannot hate him jeff , easily dismissable as a hopeless loser and a generic joker , is trying to hold down a job for the first time he is a security officer , maybe even a security specialist , in a manhattan high rise but , he protests i am not a doorman yet he is the hero of the title from the sidelines of life , the forlorn jeff observes and listens , desperate to participate sometimes i feel i was worn out the minute i was born , he laments lacking impulse control , he blurts out the truth nobody ever wants to hear , the right thing invariably at the wrong time andrew benator s thoroughly winning performance as jeff sounds a fanfare for the common young man and catches the seed of childlike wonder in us all william , jeff s supervisor , is so caring , so driven by moral purpose and a need to be objective , he could come off as pompous he is not , and certainly not in a purposefully ambiguous performance by the actor keskhemnu , who enables us to perceive the torment of a man in irreconcilable conflict dawn , a rookie cop on probation does mean , retaliatory things there is no doubt that dawn , as played by nicole alifante , can handle herself she mouths off , she is fearsomely tough and defiant she knows how to get even how then does the actress convince us that dawn is a lost soul and why should we want to protect her when she s up on charges for having slugged a very large man \? mr lonergan does not contrive hope and contact for sentimental reasons nothing seems calculated we sense that the playwright finds goodness because it is there , and he helps us to see it his four plain , very complicated people are most helpless when they try to help , most doubtridden after a moment of decisiveness their hearts are open and , what s more , they have charm it is easy to view lobby hero as a play about sex and lies , a story of urban crime , coverups and all manner of duplicity and , after a crafty buildup , the first scene in the second act boils over with theatrical tension somehow , all that dramatic thunder seems like a generous bonus , the literalization of everyone s moral crisis , the inevitable consequence of the intricacies of human behavior one hopes that the sweet scent of mr lonergan s success will waft through the theater and screen worlds , inspiring truth and art , defying pretension and ostentation and in the best of all possible worlds , he would be the resident playwright at theaterworks lobby hero by kenneth lonergan theaterworks , 233 pearl street , hartford performances through may 19 box office \( 860 \) 5277838 photo andrew benator , left , and david paluck in lobby hero , a play by kenneth lonergan at theaterworks \( lanny nagler \)
stockholm , monday , sept 16 prime minister goran persson and his social democrats beat back a concerted attempt by four conservative parties to unseat them on sunday and won voters' endorsement to run sweden for another four years with nearly all of the votes tabulated , the social democrats were improving upon their vote percentage in the last election , in 1998 with 40 percent of the vote compared with 364 percent four years ago the numbers will permit them to reestablish the same loose governing alliance they have had with the left party , formerly sweden s communists , and the greens their victory broke a recent pattern of defeats for centerleft parties across europe in which conservatives have won elections in denmark , france , italy , the netherlands and portugal in germany , gerhard schr der , a social democrat , is fighting to withstand a strong challenge from edmund stoiber , a christian democrat we social democrats in europe have had some sad days recently , mr persson said at a news conference early this morning maybe sweden is the exception , but keep your eye on germany and if we win there , maybe germany and sweden will be a measure of the future the result testified to the resilience of the socalled swedish model , which combines high levels of welfare with a free market economy in the name of striking a middle way between doctrinaire socialism and unfettered capitalism swedes pay the highest taxes of any country in europe , and they chose on sunday to continue doing so the one party promoting tax cuts , the moderates , suffered the greatest losses of any of the seven parties in the contest for the 349 seats in parliament their leader , bo lundgren , told his supporters that the four conservative parties had worked closely together and that he was greatly disappointed at the outcome but he pledged to continue to work to end the rule of the social democrats , who have been in power for all but nine years of the past seven decades while the fourparty conservative bloc attracted enough support during the campaign to rise above the social democrats in polls at the beginning of this month , they lacked a central figure to give their cause any personal focus in opposition to the familiar mr persson they were never able to settle on which one of the party leaders would become prime minister if they succeeded in getting a parliamentary majority , and this may have raised doubts among voters about what kind of future they promised the logical choice , mr lundgren , 55 , ran an uninspiring campaign , and none of the others lars leijonborg , 52 , of the liberals alf svensson , 64 , of the christian democrats and maud olofsson , 45 , of the rural center party made any move to seize command immigration , a potent issue in many other european elections and particularly so for sweden s nordic neighbors , played little role in the vote here mr leijonborg s liberals parlayed a proposal to insist that foreigners applying for citizenship be obliged to speak swedish into the biggest rise in fortunes of any party but the party is a promoter of increased immigration , not an opponent of it , and mr leijonborg said his plan was aimed at aiding integration and ending the marginalization of newcomers mr persson , a former finance minister whose brusque and ponderous manner in the 1990 s earned him the nickname of the buffalo , has in recent years physically slimmed down and stylistically refined his approach to become more appealing he became prime minister in 1996 when his fellow social democrat , ingvar carlsson , resigned , and was elected to the post in 1998 running on a record of economic competence , he was able to point to sweden s average 32 percent annual growth over the past four years , compared with 26 percent elsewhere on the continent inflation is a low 22 percent , and unemployment has fallen to 43 percent in the past two years , he has attracted favorable mention for his successful administration of the rotating sixmonth presidency of the european union , for regaining sweden its lapsed place as an international leader in social issues and for being one of the first world leaders to give unconditional backing to president bush s campaign against terrorism he pleased washington by making a speech saying he felt europeans underestimated the new american president the biggest decision facing sweden is whether to join the european monetary union and trade in its national currency for the euro , and sunday s result was seen as a strong signal that it will the issue did not come up during the campaign since there are divisions within most of the parties over it , but mr persson is eager to get sweden on the euro , and he said this morning that he planned to call a referendum by next fall sweden joined britain and denmark in deciding not to sign up for the euro during the first wave of monetary union in 1999 , but since then the country has become more comfortable with the idea of european integration toivo sjoren , director of the sifo survey firm , said in his newest polls , only 38 percent of swedes asked said they oppose joining the euro that is a dramatic shift from four years ago , when he reported that swedes said they had turned against the country s original decision in 1994 to join the european union itself photo prime minister goran persson in stockholm last night after his party rebuffed a conservative challenge \( associated press \)
trying to account for a drastic rise in childhood autism in recent years , a california study has found that it cannot be explained away by statistical anomalies or by a growing public awareness that might have led more parents to report the disorder but the study s authors , who reported their findings yesterday to the california legislature , said they were at a loss to explain the reasons for what they called an epidemic of autism , the mysterious brain disorder that affects a person s ability to form relationships and to behave normally in everyday life autism is on the rise in the state , and we still do not know why , said the lead author , dr robert s byrd , an epidemiologist and pediatrician at the university of california at davis the results are , without a doubt , sobering as diagnoses of autism have increased throughout the nation , experts and parents have cast about for possible explanations , including genetics , birth injuries and childhood immunizations the california study found that none of these factors could explain an increase of the magnitude reported there more than triple from 1987 to 1998 dr catherine lord , a professor of psychology and psychiatry at the university of michigan who is a leading authority on autism , said it was unclear whether the california findings applied to other states the federal centers for disease control and prevention is working in 13 states to look at the apparent increase in autism cases , said dr frank destefano , an epidemiologist at the agency so far , there is no reliable count of autism cases nationwide , since criteria and reporting practices vary from state to state the california study was prompted by a 1999 report from the state s department of developmental services , which reported that the number of children with full spectrum , or profound , autism had increased by 273 percent , to 10 , 360 in 1998 from 2 , 778 in 1987 the study did not deal with milder forms of the disorder , like asperger syndrome the numbers were surprising , dr byrd said the traditional estimate was that 4 or 5 children out of 10 , 000 might develop autism instead , it appeared that 10 children in every 10 , 000 were seriously autistic , meaning they suffered from a brain disorder that left them unable to speak or compulsively performing repetitive motions like flapping their arms or rocking after the period studied , the number of autistic children continued to rise , to 18 , 460 cases as of july 2002 , according to the california department of developmental services in response to the study , the legislature directed the mind institute , an autism research center at the university of california at davis , to investigate we wondered if the increase was real , dr byrd said maybe we were doing a better job of finding cases maybe there was an increase in awareness of autism the movie 'rain man' was very popular california has a system of 21 regional centers that diagnose developmental disorders and provide services to children with them dr byrd and his team mined these centers for data researchers sent questionnaires to the parents of 684 children with fullspectrum autism or mental retardation about half were teenagers , born from 1983 to 1985 the others were ages 7 to 9 , born a decade later if the criteria for diagnosing autism had changed in those 10 years or if the definition had broadened , the mystery would be solved , dr byrd said but the standards used to diagnose fullspectrum autism were the same in both age groups , he said some people suggested that the centers might diagnose autism so families would receive more generous state assistance but the centers have no incentive to do so , dr byrd said , since they do not receive more state financing for identifying more children with disabilities the study also considered whether children in the older group were incorrectly classified as mentally retarded , when they were in fact autistic but the rate of misdiagnosis was about the same in both groups , dr byrd said still another possibility that large numbers of families with autistic children had moved into california was discarded when it turned out that most children in both groups were born in california a general increase in population accounted for about 10 percent of the rise in autism , dr byrd said the rest remains a mystery there also were no significant differences over time in sex , race or parental education parents of the older children were more likely to report mental retardation along with autism , but the finding did not explain the rising incidence about a third of parents in both groups reported that their children began to regress around the age of 18 months , dr byrd said they suddenly lost the ability to say words and stopped making eye contact many parents blame vaccinations thatare given around 18 months until recently some vaccines contained a mercurybased preservative that some people believe can cause brain damage in young children the study found no evidence that the vaccine was the culprit , dr byrd said nevertheless , more parents of younger children reported constipation and vomiting , which they attributed to complications from the measles vaccine wheat allergies were also more frequent but none of these differences fully explain the increase in autism cases in california , dr byrd said parents in the study were asked what might have caused their child s autism nearly half the parents in both groups said they did not know a third blamed genetics smaller numbers cited immunizations , birth injury or environmental factors you ca n't explain an increase of this magnitude on genetics , dr byrd said something else is happening we know autism has a strong genetic component , said portia iversen , a founder of cure autism now , a research and advocacy group in los angeles formed by parents of autistic children but we do n't know what in the environment is interacting with genes to contribute to this huge increase in cases graph adding it up autism in california researchers are trying to determine why california is experiencing a surge in autism graph

washington , nov 22 the house gaveled itself and the 107th congress to conclusion today , approving the details of a homeland security department in a final round of dispute over specialinterest provisions and assistance to the unemployed the bill to create the domestic security department had been approved by the house last week , and by the senate on tuesday but before it could be sent to president bush for his signature , a few technical discrepancies between the bills had to be corrected , like different names on section headings in the text and the bill number itself the required votes on those matters in the house today gave opponents of the bill from both sides of the aisle an opportunity for a final blast , and for a few minutes it seemed as if democrats might break a promise and refuse to send the bill to the white house many of those democrats were angry that house republican leaders refused to take up a senate bill that would extend unemployment benefits past dec 28 on that day , benefits will run out for 800 , 000 people , and 95 , 000 more people will lose their benefits each succeeding week the house and senate had each passed bills to extend the benefits , but the senate s was far more generous than the house s , and neither could be approved until the two houses agreed on the amount with each side trying to score points , no extension was possible , and today several senior democrats gathered on the house floor in a lastditch effort to take advantage of the absence of all but a handful of members representative david r obey of wisconsin , the ranking minority member of the appropriations committee , said he was considering blocking the security bill if republicans would not extend the jobless benefits republicans , mr obey noted , had no problem inserting a lastminute provision protecting drug companies from vaccine lawsuits in a way , this bill is a fitting end to a pitiful and neglectful congress , he said i find it outrageous that the congress is going to find room in its heart to help the poor downtrodden drug companies , but will not find room in their hearts to deal with the problems of the longterm unemployed had mr obey objected to the technical change in the bill s number , the department could not have been signed into law house leaders would have been faced with two unpalatable courses of action either delay approval of the department until next year or call all house members back mr obey would also have broken a promise by democratic leaders that none of their party colleagues would object to the change calling mr obey s bluff , representative dick armey , the house republican leader , said he could not authorize the approval of the jobless benefits without his members present that led to a few democratic comparisons of republicans with ebenezer scrooge , but ultimately mr obey and his colleagues decided to join the rest of the house in leaving washington without an unemployment benefits extension they could not , after all , have stopped the homeland security department for long , and the anger such a move would cause would make it certain that republicans would not agree to the jobless aid the other objection to the bill today came from an unlikely source representative dan burton of indiana , a conservative republican who heads the house government reform committee mr burton has a grandchild with autism that he believes was caused by a mercurybased preservative in vaccines , and he attacked a provision in the bill that would protect the makers of the preservative from legal damages i'm probably the last guy you 'd see up here talking about this , he said , but i want to tell you something , government has to have a heart as well as being a guardian of the pocketbook and with parents who have children who are autistic and suspect they 've been damaged by vaccines or mercury , they ought to have some recourse and right now they have virtually none in the end , however , mr burton , like the democrats , realized that his objection could not stop the homeland security department bill , which president bush is scheduled to sign into law on monday mr burton said he hoped that republican leaders would live up to a promise to change the vaccine provision in the next congress , and he took his autism charts and went home to indiana

initiatives , its pilot project scholarship program the program provides financial assistance to families in any ohio school district that is or has been under federal court order requiring supervision and operational management of the district by the state superintendent cleveland is the only ohio school district to fall within that category the program provides two basic kinds of

salt lake city of all the athletes competing in these winter games , only michael voudouris still has the acrid smoke from the world trade center in his lungs he also has the world trade center in his heart it is a shame the timid souls at the international bobsled federation do not have even a modest dose of compassion for what voudouris is trying to express solidarity with humankind , not a political statement the bureaucrats will not allow voudouris to display an image of the vanished buildings , or show any form of homage to those who died in the attack the images are on the bottom , not even visible during competition they would have been a mostly unseen gesture , but they are forbidden this morning , voudouris will pilot or attempt to pilot a substitute sled in the skeleton race at the winter games he is from the glendale section of queens , right on the brooklyn border , but he has dual citizenship because his father is from greece he does not expect to win that is not the point , and never was he was already an aspiring olympian on the morning of sept 11 , when he was at his home a few miles east of manhattan he is a freelance photographer who works as a technician for the emergency medical service to pay his bills that morning he had just gotten back from a shift at a water tunnel under construction under the east river \( a medical technician is on site as a precaution \) , when he got a phone call that the world trade center was burning i pulled my things together , five bags of flashlights and batteries and all that stuff , and started to head in , he said i tried to keep up the gallows humor that we all use to maintain our balance it was not easy , once the two buildings crumbled right out of the spectacular skyline his neighbor , jean guarino , offered him a ride to the long island expressway , but the police saw his uniform and waved them through one roadblock , and then another , until she found herself in lower manhattan \( her husband was an army colonel , so she understands this stuff , voudouris said \) she got them to the corner of chambers street , where the ghastly ash and smoke was still swirling , and voudouris set up a triage center once guarino had left , a nurse wandered by , hoping there would be live people to treat allison thompson from australia , he recalled she was out rollerblading in her shorts , and she tossed her blades in the bushes and somebody gave her flipflops , and i got her a surgeon s gown , and she went to work he stayed five days the horrors gave him a damaged cornea , toothgrinding nightmares and a cough that wo n't go away when he toted up the damage , he figured that nine emergency workers had been killed , none whom he knew directly , not that it mattered there are only a few thousand of us , so we 're like a family , just like the cops and the firemen , he said we come from a certain kind of culture that believes there is no better thing than giving up your life to save another life we believe in helping other people , new yorkers helping new yorkers it made me laugh when people said they did n't know there were people like us in new york who did they think makes the city work \? eventually , he went back to his sport he had picked up the skeleton in lake placid in upstate new york more than a decade ago , when he went to take photos of julie walker , a competitor she said no way he had to ride the thing first before she would pose so he did , and he was hooked he began competing in world events in 1999 , always finishing near last , but after recovering from his own trauma last fall , he qualified for the games by 001 of a second do n't even ask about money he scuffles he just barely had enough to accumulate a fourfoot sled that can go downhill on the bottom of the sled , he painted an image of the twin towers , and added the emblem of the medical technicians , along with the names of the nine who died then he added a no 30 for the greek nationals who died in the attacks , and then he added a no 32 , the number of deaths of people connected to his high school , archbishop molloy in briarwood , queens he was out here practicing a few days ago when he learned the federation considered his sled a political statement he was not about to quit , so he borrowed a more complicated sled from trevor christie , an american friend who did not qualify it was like going from a volkswagen to a maserati , voudouris has been telling everyone the sled is so sensitive that he can barely control it , but he plans to compete he takes it seriously he relates more to the fabled jamaican bobsledders , who were hardy athletes , than to eddie the eagle , who was a bumbling skier he may stick 30 small greek flags on the sled , since he is allowed to display the flag of the nation for which he competes if he finishes last , voudouris still finishes first photo michael voudouris will slide for greece today in the skeleton race \( reuters \)
in a department composed overwhelmingly of white men , few things are as rare as a black female new york firefighter there are six of them , or about 006 percent of the force the only thing rarer has been a black female fire officer there never had been one until yesterday now there is one her name is ella mcnair , and though 19 other names were called at the promotion ceremony at the fire department s headquarters in brooklyn , none drew louder whoops from the audience , and no lieutenant wore a bigger smile beneath a new navyblue cap lieutenant mcnair s ascension comes at a time when the department is struggling to hire more women and minority members and to fill some of the void left by the loss of 343 firefighters on sept 11 just before the lieutenants were sworn in , douglas h white , who is also black , took the oath as deputy commissioner for administration his job includes taking charge of recruiting , a task that will be made somewhat easier by lieutenant mcnair s presence i think she s a tremendous symbol , mr white said it would be a great face for posters firefighter mcnair , 5 feet 6 inches and 155 pounds of perseverance , was a member of the first class of firefighters to include women , in 1982 this job started off really good , and today i say the same thing , she said it s wonderful in between , though , and for that matter before she was hired , things were often tough it took a federal court order to get the department to hire women at all , and the first recruits were not warmly welcomed i remember stories she would tell when she first started , said her brother , william mcnair pornographic pictures being hung on her locker , derogatory comments one day early on , firefighter mcnair found a news clipping she considered derogatory to female firefighters on the firehouse wall , and when she started using a knife to remove it , a colleague tried to grab the knife away she ended up with a badly cut finger , and he was fined 15 , 000 , suspended and transferred at least five other members of her engine company were transferred involuntarily because of incidents involving her in 1988 , firefighter mcnair resigned all she would say about it yesterday was that she was overwhelmed with what was going on with the job but she came back two years later she has worked at engine company 283 in brownsville , brooklyn , since 1992 lieutenant mcnair , who grew up and still lives in bedfordstuyvesant and said she was in her mid40 s , turned to firefighting in her early 20 s , she said , because she felt bored saying there s no sense in being content with where i'm at , she said she was preparing to take the captain s exam photo firefighter ella mcnair became lieutenant mcnair yesterday in a ceremony at fire department headquarters in brooklyn \( andrea mohin the new york times \)

she said how can the public be certain that autopsies conducted by the police forensic institute in cases of extrajudicial killings are not modified to help the police \? dr pornthip is a selfmade specialist as well as a selfmade celebrity much of what she knows about her field she taught herself from books at the time she began , there were only a halfdozen forensic pathologists in thailand she found , in the tales told by the dead , a way to discomfit the privileged i did n't like powerful people to take advantage of others , she said i thought i could do something about that the relatives of one murdered man asked for her help when the police said , unconvincingly , that he had been killed by gangsters her autopsy found a bullet that provided evidence implicating the police themselves in the killing it is dramas like these that make her four books compulsive reading her tales of her medical detective work , interspersed with howto hints on dissection and bonecutting , are told in chapters with irresistible titles like my first corpse , death by tapeworm and i'm not scared of ghosts , i'm just scared of the smell on the cover of one book she is dressed in vestal white , cradling a skull on the cover of her latest , titled teaching with corpses and published this year , she appears with her husband and daughter , all three of them in bright red outfits dr pornthip is not , although she looks it , a person of the night rather , she is a person of the predawn , when it is always darkest she arrives most days at ramathibodi hospital by 5 am , and as the living world still sleeps , she is alone with her cold corpses , slicing , sawing and cracking bones from these swollen and discolored bodies she extracts the jewels of her craft , the liver , the heart , the kidney , the last dinner sliced and studied under an electron microscope , they reveal their secrets her own secrets , hidden under her gaudy exterior , are harder to dislodge her parents , both scientists and teachers , tried , in vain , to steer her toward conformity , insisting that she study medicine rather than architecture pathology attracted her , she said , because of the freedom and detective work involved and the chance to confront official hypocrisy her artistic side found other outlets drawing , cooking , homemaking , collecting popular music and the creation of her public image long black dresses , leopardskin tops , rainbow tunics , just about anything that no one else , not even rebellious kids , is wearing but she becomes suddenly colorless when asked the meaning of her visual statement it cheers me up , she says , as if she had never given it a thought or , i think it makes me look younger special occasions hardly affect her look perhaps a handful of glitter in her hair i do n't like going to parties , she said unexpectedly i do n't like a lot of people looking at me if this is irony , it is seamless her husband , wichai , the bank manager , is her straight man , dry and lowkey for the first years of their marriage , he claims , he had no idea his wife worked with cadavers i just thought she looked into a microscope and analyzed things when at last he visited her workplace , he said , i ran their 9yearold daughter , nong ten , seems to have a better idea of what her mother does than dr pornthip s husband did at first at school she has started drawing pictures of imaginary autopsy rooms and machines for extracting bones from bodies it is honorable work , her mother explains i tell her that i have a duty to work with dead bodies to find out the truth about their death , dr pornthip said and if we do good , good will come back to us for all her experience with cadavers , dr pornthip does not seem to have given a great deal of thought to the manner of her own death she has worked on a man who choked to death on a banana and a snakehandler who was strangled by one of his pets she has dealt with epidemics of suicide by jumping , hanging or swallowing rat poison none of that seems to have inspired her fertile imagination like just about everybody else , she said she would prefer to die in her sleep photo dr pornthip rojanasunand \( yvan cohen asiaworks , for the new york times \)
united nations , jan 2 while international criticism grows over the treatment of prisoners from afghanistan by the united states , sweden has raised a related , though less publicized , issue the rights of those whose bank accounts have been frozen in the war on terrorism sweden s concern is over the cases of three somaliborn swedish citizens whose names appeared on a list issued by the white house in september of people and organizations whose assets were to be frozen the list was duly transmitted to the united nations , where the security council obligated all member states to freeze the accounts so sweden froze the accounts of the three abdirisak aden , 33 abdulaziz abdi ali , 44 and yusaf ahmed ali , 27 making the men s cases a national cause they have also become exhibit a in a broader frenchled effort at the united nations to review the sanctions lists the united states opposes such a review , arguing that it would endanger intelligence gathering american officials said that they had held discussions with the swedes and other member countries on the issues raised by sweden , and that those talks would continue though the criticism in sweden and at the united nations is not directed openly at the united states , it comes at a time when the treatment of the prisoners by the united states is being sharply assailed in europe some european officials have expressed concern that a perceived lack of respect by the united states for international law could undermine support for the war on terrorism the problem is not that swedes are convinced of the innocence of the three men but that the swedish government and courts now have no way of finding out if they are guilty or not , and no way of appealing their inclusion on the list in the meantime , the men , who insist that all they did was transfer funds to their families in somalia , have been left with no money their lawyer said that about 100 , 000 was frozen the situation has generated widespread publicity and support for the men , bolstered by the fact that mr aden is a candidate of the governing social democratic party in elections next fall prominent swedes defied sanctions regulations by taking up a collection for their legal fees the leading swedish expert on international law , ove bring , criticized the united nations sanctions list as being in conflict with normal judicial decency one of sweden s most prominent lawyers , leif silbersky , took the men s case the editor of sweden s premier business daily gave mr aden a job , and sweden asked the sanctions committee of the united nations security council for a review i have no idea if they may be guilty of what they 're accused of , but what really upset me was this total infringement on civil rights , said johan hakelius , the chief editor of the business daily , finanstidningen first of all , the issue of decrees coming from outside sweden , from the un or the eu , and being implemented as law in sweden , that in itself is very questionable the second , more relevant part , is i cannot see in a country that is supposed to be governed by law , passing laws aimed at certain individuals without giving them a trial , without letting them see evidence , without any chance to appeal though the original american list does not explain why any organization or person is included , the three somali swedes were apparently implicated through their involvement in a somali banking network known as al barakaat the united states apparently suspects al barakaat of channeling money to terror groups but al barakaat also reportedly handled unofficial money transfers to somalia , a method used by many workers sending money back to relatives in poorly organized third world countries the chief prosecutor for the city of stockholm has opened an investigation of al barakaat for various financial machinations , though none related to terrorism in any case , the united states never disclosed its case against the three somali swedes when the list was presented to the sanctions committee of the security council , it was circulated only among the 15 members , which did not include sweden earlier this week , the swedish ambassador to the united nations , pierre schori , formally asked the committee to review the sanctions list these men are extremely well respected in the immigrant community , mr schori said they have no criminal background , and all three have been blacklisted without any proof in the sanctions committee , france has taken the lead in getting the security council to establish what one diplomat called some rules of the game the french say those rules should include specific criteria for imposing sanctions , namely a direct link with al qaeda or the taliban , and a mechanism for regularly reviewing the list france is determined to get clear procedures and criteria to monitor the list , said the french ambassador to the united nations , jeandavid levitte diplomats said the united states had resisted , contending that explaining the lists would endanger its ability to gather intelligence the chairman of the sanctions committee , ambassador alfonso valdivieso of colombia formerly the country s attorney general , and so an official familiar with the ways of terror noted that the entire challenge was new , because all previous sanctions had been against governments or groups in specific regions , and not against global networks he said the challenge was to ensure that innocent people were not swept up , but without forgetting the immediate danger posed by terrorists we are dealing with terrorism , mr valdivieso said it may be controversial , but all who have suggested alternatives are aware that we must not waste time on definitions , because the terrorists are acting the somali swedes may not have to wait for a revision of security council rules mr schori , the swedish ambassador , said officials at the united states mission to the united nations were being very helpful , and officials in washington were meeting with the legal director of the swedish foreign office to resolve the problem
first there was god , then came history , now there is the survival of the fittest i'm not prepared to argue that this sequence represents the ascent of man i am simply trying to tell you how architecture became the inspired mess it is today it is n't all philip johnson s fault he had helpers major historical influences were at work and you should know something about these unseen forces if you want to get the most out of the changing of the avantgarde , an important show of architectural drawings now on view at the museum of modern art s temporary headquarters in long island city , queens organized by terence riley , chief curator of the modern s department of architecture and design , the show focuses on conceptual projects from the 1960 s and 70 s , a period when architects were rapidly shedding the aesthetic restraints of the modernism movement much more was going on here than the challenge to an architectural aesthetic , however western architects were gradually waking up to a momentous possibility never before , it seemed , had they been less constrained by authority , by an ideological scaffolding strong enough to stabilize the meaning and value of their forms it s no wonder that the period is memorable more for paper fantasies than for buildings an architecture without authority risks becoming one without clients and we are only just now learning how hard it is to rebuild public support for architecture that takes risks the changing of the avantgarde honors the gift of the howard gilman collection of visionary architectural drawings , which was donated to the modern two years ago pierre apraxine , the collection s curator , has helped select work for the show , which is supplemented by drawings from the same period drawn from the modern s archives inevitably , this arrangement has produced a distorted view of the time the show is far from encyclopedic and it does not reckon with the modern s own role during a period that witnessed the decline of the values the museum was partly founded to promote nonetheless , it hits enough high spots to establish the period s importance what we see here are the roots of architecture s revival as an art of ideas chronologically organized , the show begins with a selection of drawings of the dymaxion house by buckminster fuller , the famed designer of the geodesic dome conceived in 1927 , the house predates the period in question , but fuller s influence did not become widespread until the emergence of the counterculture in the late 1960 s and early 70 s in 1969 , with the publication of the first whole earth catalog , the bucky dome became the counterculture s chief tribal totem fuller s technologically attuned work came to represent an impersonal vernacular , an idealized solution to every need for human shelter to a degree , his designs were an escape from architecture , and this urge to flee was one of the period s defining characteristics how much does your building weigh \? fuller would ask , as if the whole idea of architecture had become too weighty and cumbersome for spaceship earth yona friedman s spatial city , a project of 195859 , was even lighter than fuller s domes at least , it promised to release entire cities from gravitational force a kind of horizontal eiffel tower , suspended over existing urban development , the project was both superstructure and infrastructure it resembled a jungle gym on which temporary structures could disport themselves like gangly children power , water and other services would be contained inside the structural elements of the metal threedimensional grid , with housing and other buildings inserted into the open spaces between them a ludic dimension had taken hold the city came to be seen as a gigantic fun fair \( a vision coming to frightening fruition in the themepark styling that would grip urban planning decades later \) play and eroticism figured in many conceptual projects of the period , but none exercised greater influence than cedric price s fun palace , a project of 195961 the concept would find form eventually in 1977 , with the completion of the georges pompidou center in paris the idea for the fun palace was supposedly first hatched \( on 42nd street \) by mr price and the theater director joan littlewood on a visit the two made to america that year the design reflected the increasing whimsy of postimperial britain architecture \? fun \? this was a clear philosophical departure from the brutalist style associated with britain s welfare state part open university , part indoor amusement park , it was meant to be housed within an immense structure recognizably descended from paxton s crystal palace permanently affixed building cranes enabled walls and floors to be constantly rearranged , like tinkertoys one sees this as a metaphor for the situation in which architects then found themselves , with no sturdy ideological scaffold on which to build in contrast to the material dimension of structure and function , fun implied a psychic state the emotional content of buildings is one of several themes traced by the modern s exhibition images of solitude , pleasure , fear and aggression haunt the designers' imaginations , much as reason and objectivity had preoccupied their elders
for all its eyepopping revelations , the enron case presents an enormous challenge to government investigators , one that could require years of digging to unravel at this point , no one knows for sure whether the actions that led to the collapse of the company constituted financial crimes , and , if they did , which should be the focus of the investigation for that reason , legal experts said , the best things that happened for the criminal investigators in the case were the decisions by employees at enron and its auditor , arthur andersen company , to begin shredding documents unlike the financial investigations , which will require forensic accountants to unwind complex transactions , the document shredding gives investigators comparatively simple cases of possible obstruction of justice in such cases , witnesses are confronted , evidence is collected , the law is checked , and the decision whether to seek an indictment is made as a result , these experts said , the focus in the earliest days will be on pursuing possible criminal cases from those events the government s intent will be to use the leverage of potential indictments to push possible defendants into the role of witnesses to get evidence for the broader financial investigation the potential obstruction of justice is critical to the progress of this investigation , said efrem m grail , a former prosecutor who is a partner with the pittsburgh law firm of reed smith it is easier for the government to make an obstruction of justice case than it is to make a case that people violated criminal securities law or criminal fraud statutes it is critical to start with such limits , legal experts said , to make sure that the case does not go off track , especially in its earliest days it s essential that the government disciplines itself during the investigation and reins in the scope of the inquiry , said chris bebel , a former federal prosecutor and former lawyer with the securities and exchange commission otherwise , it is going to get bogged down in a sea of documents and conflicting statements about complex transactions according to people who have spoken with government officials involved in the case , there is strong pressure from senior justice department officials to show some quick results from the investigation that pressure will increase the attention focused on matters like document destruction , where the facts are relatively easy to establish until now , the most public investigations have been those conducted by a series of congressional committees but none of them have the power to bring charges in the case that responsibility falls instead to prosecutors working on a special justice department task force and to a group of agents with the federal bureau of investigation on the regulatory side , one investigation is being handled by the enforcement division at the sec the labor department is also reviewing whether enron violated any rules while the stock price was plunging when it told employees that they could not sell company shares from their retirement accounts for government investigators , the scandal presents a difficult challenge in contrast with other wellknown whitecollar investigations , this inquiry begins with the government s having little guidance on where it should be looking unlike the insider trading scandals on wall street in the 80 s which began with revelations from ivan f boesky , a stock trader the enron inquiry has no central witness to provide a map of criminal activity unlike the treasury market scandals that enveloped salomon brothers in the early 90 s , the enron investigation begins with no admission from the company that it did anything improper unlike the pricefixing cases at the archer daniels midland company , later in the 90 s , the enron case does not have years of incriminating tape recordings provided by a cooperating witness in this case , unlike in those in the past , said stephen meagher , a former federal prosecutor who handled whitecollar cases in san francisco , there are many dimensions , and you just do n't have a clear trail to a central theory of the prosecution as a result , the government begins the first major corporate scandal of the new millennium with no strong handle on whether the trouble was brought about by criminal activity or folly the distinction is critical experts say any criminal case stemming from the enron collapse would be related to some sort of fraud tax fraud , wire or mail fraud , securities fraud but to get such an indictment , prosecutors would have to prove that the people charged had criminal intent that they knew they were engaging in fraud when they were committing the acts in question in other words , if enron executives or advisers filed or disseminated information about the company that has since proved to be false , the government must be able to demonstrate that they knew about the falsehoods at the time in this case , establishing such proof could be challenging according to internal enron documents , every major transaction between the company and the series of partnerships that played a role in the collapse were supposed to have been reviewed by senior company managers and by arthur andersen , the company s auditor if information about such deals was presented to andersen truthfully , and the accountant rendering the opinion was clear of any undisclosed personal or financial conflicts , those rulings by the accountants will be some of the most important weapons in any defense lawyer s argument against indictment enron officials would effectively be left saying that they had relied on the professionals , and the professionals would maintain that they had offered unbiased judgments even if those judgments subsequently proved to be wrong but here again , legal experts said , the document destruction will probably prove to be critical in giving investigators a means of combating that challenge without document destruction , the auditors would have been explaining that they made judgment calls , said franklin b velie , a former federal prosecutor now with the law firm of salans hertzfeld heilbronn in new york , and the company would have been saying that they relied on the auditors it would be hard to know whether this was a horrible mistake or a crime with document destruction , the path for the investigators seems a lot clearer
who s to blame for much of our weed problems \? possibly jethro tull , the 18thcentury farmer and writer who advocated , and developed , implements for the thorough pulverization of the soil as we gardeners go out every spring to turn over our soil we have also been churning our ground and exposing the myriad weed seeds lurking in every soil to light and air , which is just what they need to sprout years ago , i decided to try to put an end to my weed problems , and began by dispensing with tilling my soil in fact , although it may seem contrary to what many gardeners take as gospel , i now try to avoid any disruption of the natural layering that develops over time in soil i set transplants in the ground by pushing the dirt aside just enough to snuggle the roots in place spent annual flower and vegetable plants are cleared from the garden by giving their stems a sharp twist or jerk , or else by first severing the largest roots with a knife small roots are left to rot and improve the soil i even avoid disrupting the natural layering when enriching the soil rainfall and earthworms and other soil life gradually work fertilizers and organic materials into the ground after i lay them on the surface organic materials also protect the surface from pelting rain and hot summer sun , a benefit that is largely lost when these materials are dug in furthermore , fertilizers and organic materials do most good near the surface , where plant roots naturally proliferate not all weeds come from seeds within the soil they also sprout from seeds carried by wind or dropped by birds most weeds that arrive in this manner can be dealt with by covering the ground with a thin , weedfree mulch , renewed yearly or as needed the kind of mulch depends on the look i want , the plants and the soil poorer soil or more demanding plants get the most nourishing mulch compost i slather it an inch thick each fall over all my vegetable beds buckwheat hulls are adequate and attractive in flower beds paths get wood chips , straw or some other lean material free of viable weed seeds i could not , of course , just banish such words as rototill and dig from my vocabulary , throw some mulch over the ground and carry on as usual most soils need to be aerated , which tillage does however , the reason most soils need to be aerated is because they have become compacted from being driven or walked upon i avoid this problem by not walking or driving where plants grow my garden is laid out with permanent areas for plants and permanent areas for traffic planted areas in my vegetable garden consist of rectangular beds my flower gardens are more free form ground covers almost never get walked on and trees are planted in islands of mulch that also are rarely trod upon ideally , it should be possible to reach into the center of any bed especially vegetable beds , which need frequent attention for planting and harvest with feet firmly planted in a path thirtysix inches is a good width for a vegetable bed , although gardeners with longer reaches than mine could make do with 40inch wide beds flower beds can be wider , tolerating an occasional step garden paths range in width from a minimum of 18 inches for those between adjacent vegetable beds to 5 feet for a main path through the vegetable garden or a path for leisurely strolling among flower beds instead of mulch , paths could be nothing more than steppingstones among flowers , for example or even wellbehaved lawn there is little or no reason to go to the trouble of creating and maintaining raised beds except where drainage is a problem changing my watering technique was the final step i took on my road to weedless gardening not all plants need regular watering , but for those that do , i use drip irrigation drip irrigation pinpoints water right to plants , so none is wasted promoting weed growth between widely spaced plants or in paths the combination of all these techniques has brought benefits beyond fewer weeds the mulches also conserve water and keep roots cool minimal soil disturbance keeps humus levels high and maintains a network of permanent pores for draining excess water and moving capillary water around i no longer have the trouble of tilling and the delay of waiting for the soil to dry enough to till in spring and because there s no need to leave space between every row of plants for walking , more plants can be squeezed into the garden planted in beds and more vegetables and flowers reaped of course , in spite of my weedless gardening system , weeds do still appear , but weed problems do not what few weeds i find i yank out roots and all weeds with long taproots , like dandelion and burdock , may need to be coaxed out by thrusting a trowel alongside their taproot , then levering up just enough to free the root colonies of small weeds are quickly done in with a winged weeder , colinear hoe or some other hoe having a sharp blade that slides parallel to and just a fraction of an inch below the soil surface i pay special attention to the garden edges , where weeds and grasses attempt to sneak in very important in avoiding weed problems are regular weed forays young weeds not only are easiest to remove but have yet to spread by seed or creeping roots by planting in beds and not disturbing the soil , keeping the surface covered and using drip irrigation when regular watering is needed , my regular weed patrol has been pared down to a few pleasant minutes each week photos garden paths whether through vegetables , top , or flowers mean the

pushed open the door and soaked up the atmosphere for a while before he caught the singer s eye can we help you \? , ms akers asked from the keyboard , gracious behind the glasses she never wears in performance i have n't been in this room since i was a boy , the stranger answered dreamily we have good music in chicago but this is where it s at and as silently as he had emerged from the shadows , he disappeared when love speaks to you , ms akers' new program , opening on tuesday for a fourweek run , promises the sort of sophisticated , subtly perfumed bouquet of which memories are born the selections run from stephen schwartz , cy coleman , marvin hamlisch , stephen sondheim and rodgers and hart to signature renditions of her beloved jacques brel and edith piaf in a way , though , ms akers' performances and her seven solo albums have always seemed steeped in memory from the beginning of her career , ms akers , now 56 , has possessed a look , bearing and demeanor that have seemed neither contemporary nor even retro , but classic having style of her own , she has never needed to follow fashion stephen holden of the new york times has called ms akers regal and elegantly demure she exudes the emotional control of someone who measures by the teaspoon how much to let go and how much to hold back , he wrote in 1994 if the descriptions fail to conjure up an enigma , they have failed a born new yorker , ms akers is forever impressing americans as somehow european with her cleopatra bangs , sharp cheekbones , narrow eyes and feline jaw line , she bestrides the stage like a sphinx and then compounds the mystery by delivering interpretations so smooth , so unitalicized \( even impassive \) as to seem the messages of someone not actually in the room or so it may seem at first the flow of song is even the diction keeps the text in crystal focus the range keeps within an octave of middle c , on either side , yet the selfconscious note of smoky melodrama commonly associated with lower voices is absent the timbre is consistently light and mellow some singers achieve intimacy by luring listeners into the confessional some , conversely , take refuge in irony ms akers goes a different way she trusts melody but above all words to reveal the heart as she works on a new song , she writes the lyrics out when she has them by heart , she writes them in calligraphy her singing has an equally polished quality , but as a listener gradually discovers , poise does not preclude passion an artist s choice of material is a personal act now and then , as ms akers sings , a private , fleeting smile mirrors pure surrender no need to ask why she is so drawn to love songs her latest act is not the first to put love up front and center , but sometimes there are surprises in 1997 , at the rainbow and stars \( which has since closed \) , in her show time for a love song \( recorded on the drg label as karen akers live \) , she stepped out of character , as it seemed , with a song of social commentary called laughing matters acknowledging the applause , she appeared almost giddy with delight it lets me share my feelings with you , which i could n't do , to be honest , since the good old days , when i carried a guitar everywhere i went and sang protest songs , she told the audience those were good times , and good songs but i went in another direction what happened \? i wanted to sing things that were more demanding , more sophisticated , more theatrical , she said at the oak room after she and mr rebic had wrapped up for the afternoon i started singing sondheim and kurt weill , long before i 'd earned the right i did n't have the life for better or worse , i read the newspaper every day , she continued so i know enough about what s going on in the world to be depressed a lot of the time she has never said no to an aids benefit she has sung to raise funds for the victims of the sept attacks11 and for manhattanville college , her alma mater but she recognizes how limited the repercussions of such efforts usually are sometimes the right singer with the right song can change the world a bit ms akers has yet to find such a song at some point , she said , i decided to go with human communication to sing songs that might touch a chord that would allow the people who hear them to say things they have n't said before , to remember things they have n't been able to touch before those are things i can affect , make better a bit of therapy , a bit of theater \? people often tell ms akers that what she does is theatrical in fact , though her training as an actress has been slight , she scored a triumph two decades ago in the tony awardwinning musical nine , adapted from federico fellini s autobiographical phantasmagoria 8 1 2 her role was luisa , the wife of the egomaniacal film director guido contini , played by ra l juli maury yeston , the show s composer and lyricist , remembers the first time he heard ms akers we knew we would need to find someone special who could radiate not just the kind of quiet beauty that anouk aim e provided in the film , but also her essential intelligence and dignity , mr yeston said we had heard of a cult legend playing cabaret in , of all places , washington , but none of us were prepared for karen she stood with a statuesque stillness onstage at her audition , singing a french song with a voice like a cello and instantaneously cast a spell that simply made time stop her skills in interpretation made it obvious to us that she could act the role despite a second broadway appearance , in grand hotel , and film roles for woody allen \( in purple rose of cairo \) and mike nichols \( heartburn \) , ms akers hesitates to call herself an actress it s a title you have to earn , she said you need to be working as an actress to stay alive to the possibilities but in my singing , i 've been acting all along telling stories , talking to a number of different people a song can be pretty , and i can love the melody , but it has to go with something it has to relate to the person i'm talking to i have to find a good reason to sing a song at a particular moment karen akers the oak room in the algonquin hotel , 59 west 44th street tuesday through may 25 photos karen akers rehearsing with the pianist don rebic at the oak room at the algonquin hotel last month \( ozier muhammad the new york times \) \( pg 29 \) karen akers in my singing , i 've been acting all along , she says \( paul greco \) \( pg 39 \)
on july 31 , pope john paul ii is scheduled to declare juan diego cuauhtlahtoatzin , a humble aztec better known simply as juan diego , to be a saint it is juan diego to whom the virgin of guadalupe is said to have appeared in december 1531 , and , when the local spanish bishop demanded proof of the apparition , it was on juan diego s rough cloak that the heavenly lady miraculously imprinted her image , an image still displayed and revered in its basilica in mexico city and now reproduced almost everywhere one might expect that the rev stafford poole , an american priest and author of our lady of guadalupe the origins and sources of a mexican national symbol \( university of arizona press , 1995 \) , would be looking forward to july 31 he is not he is one of a number of scholars who do not question juan diego s holiness they question whether he ever existed juan diego , father poole says , is a pious fiction david a brading , a cambridge professor , author of mexican phoenix \( cambridge , 2001 \) , a highly sympathetic study of the guadalupe devotion , has said , there s no historical evidence whatsoever that such a person actually existed none of these scholars deny the power of the guadalupe story and devotion father poole calls it one of history s outstanding examples of the fusion of religious devotion and national identity over the centuries , guadalupe has been equally seized by the creole spaniards born in mexico , by indigenous peoples , by royalists and by revolutionaries as a divine affirmation of their dignity in recent years , moreover , the virgin of guadalupe has been named by the pope and welcomed by catholics as patron of all the americas the problem for historians like father poole or professor brading is that though the guadalupe portrait and devotions surrounding it clearly date to the mid1500 s , it was not until 1648 that miguel sanchez , a creole priest , published the elaborate account of apparitions , juan diego and his miraculously transformed cloak the same story , told more simply and movingly in nahuatl , the native tongue , appeared a year later in a book produced by a friend of sanchez ever since then , mexican churchmen have been trying fill this gap in the record if these 164849 accounts were based , as some claimed , on oral traditions , why had not a single trace of them showed up in the huge mass of religious material , both in spanish and in native languages , that had appeared in the intervening century \? missing documents , especially earlier versions of the nahuatl text , were hypothesized various explanations were offered for their absence in 1666 , depositions were taken from elderly indians and spaniards \( the ages of four indian witnesses were given as 100 , 100 , 110 , and between 112 and 115 \) many people argued that the image , which unlike the shroud of turin has never been scientifically examined , could not have been created by human hands and therefore was itself proof of the 1648 account still , the questions and the controversies have persisted writing in commonweal , a biweekly edited by catholic laity , father poole stated , more than forty documents are said to attest to the reality of juan diego , yet not one of them can withstand serious historical criticism obviously the vatican officials conducting investigations for the congregation for the causes of saints do not agree but father poole considers their procedures onesided , slanted and bordering on the dishonest no recognized scholars questioning the traditional accounts about juan diego were consulted , he wrote he found out that his own book had been criticized but he was not given a chance to reply other critics have been demonized , he said in an interview , and accused of racism or heresy in a book he is completing he calls the canonization a sad and tawdry spectacle that does little service to the church s mission and credibility professor brading is on a somewhat different wavelength in mexican phoenix , he praises father poole and declares that the american priest with two other scholars has demonstrated that the 1649 nahuatl account was based on sanchez s 1648 spanish text a devastating criticism , professor brading writes , of all theories about some earlier indianlanguage source still , professor brading is ambivalent about the battle over historicity he is enamored of the theological creativity of thinkers like sanchez , who conceived of juan diego as another moses and the image of guadalupe as the mexican ark of the covenant , showing that god s own mother had founded christian mexico the guadalupe tradition has a theological truth , he says , that cannot be discerned by illjudged questions about historicity , but only by thinking of the image the way eastern orthodox christians think of icons and thinking of the story the way that catholic theologians now regard many of the miraculous gospel stories about jesus' birth so professor brading , in a letter to the london tablet , a catholic weekly , ended up , on the one hand , calling the story of the virgin and juan diego a sublime parable and , on the other hand , concluding , to canonize juan diego makes as much sense , and as little , as to canonize the good samaritan that leaves some important questions first , can what father poole calls a pious fiction be transmuted by centuries of devotion into what professor brading calls a sublime parable \? second , can the church really sidestep the problem of historical fact \? christianity , after all , is notorious for considering itself a historybased religion
i am a local television talk show host not local as in fox five or news 12 local as in channel 26pctv , pleasantville public access not that i am totally unknown the seniors in my village call me the tv girl once a woman standing in line at the ap said to me , you 're that person on tv she paused for a moment then added , your hair looks good today on a recent visit to my gynecologist , my doctor looked up at me and said , by the way , i love your show what are the qualifications for a talk show host on local access \?

the plan was to make a simple film about an indian wedding , a home movie , really , in 30 days during new delhi s glorious , sensuous monsoon it was going against the idea of needing millions of rupees and special effects and manipulations , said mira nair , the 44year old director it was going back to the essence of drama , good acting , urgency and seeing what you could make out of that selfimposed leanness but of course it was a circus when we were doing it i mean , a punjab wedding who was i kidding \? this was like a hymn to ostentation that hymn , monsoon wedding , has turned out to be looser and richer than ms nair s previous work , even the highly praised mississippi masala \( 1991 \) or salaam bombay , a 1988 feature about indian street children that was nominated for an academy award for best foreign language film neither had an eye trained directly on ms nair s own world , a comic , chaotic punjabi family of new delhi during one hot month in the summer of 2001 it s all very , very close to life , ms nair said it was n't like we had to check some authenticity barometer , because we were living in it shot by handheld camera , with a 68member ensemble cast laced with delhi socialites and ms nair s own family , monsoon wedding promptly won the golden lion , the top prize , at the venice international film festival in september and has filled theaters in india ever since it is to open on friday in new york basically , they 're punjabi relatives , ms nair said of the cast you know , all my relatives , and their jewelry and their saris everyone connoisseurs of indian fashion may find the saris alone worth the price of admission stunning saris , ms nair readily agreed my mother did n't know what to wear to venice when we won the golden lion , because all the saris were on screen she laughed as if they 'd remember ms nair held forth on a recent winter evening in a spacious columbia university faculty apartment on riverside drive , overlooking the hudson river and a cold , plumcolored sunset there was an animist totem of the indian god krishna on a swing in one corner , a display of lego contraptions created by ms nair s 10yearold son , zohran , in another just like the indians in monsoon wedding , ms nair is a charming , takecharge mix of several worlds , with glamorous looks that do little to hide the toughness underneath sabrina dhawan , ms nair s screenwriter for monsoon wedding , has seen her deal with american distribution companies there s absolutely no apology about being indian or being female , she says that whole colonial hangup that we 've all grown up with , mira has none of that or if she has , she s worked her way far beyond it shashi tharoor , a senior united nations official and an indian novelist who played marc antony to ms nair s cleopatra in a production during their college days , agreed there s no question that she was going to define her m tier , whether it was acting in films or directing them , he said as for ms nair s portrayal of cleopatra , he said , she had sort of a passing resemblance to elizabeth taylor , and she did well like many women of india s privileged classes , ms nair was not raised to take her place at the back of the stage as the daughter of an officer in the indian administrative service , the country s elite civil service , ms nair grew up in the eastern indian city of bhubaneshwar , known for its 600 temples she was educated at delhi university s women s college , miranda house , and then at harvard now she divides her time with her family between new york city , new delhi and kampala , uganda , the home of her husband , mahmood mamdani , an east african academic of indian heritage who teaches at columbia i used to have a joke when people asked where i live , ms nair said in an interview a decade ago i 'd say , 'i live on air india' but the other side is that you live between your ears you carry your home within yourself that s a nicesounding cerebral concept , but the truth is that you 're torn perhaps for that reason , monsoon wedding is a loving look at ms nair s roots , a comedy of manners that pokes fun at the striving materialism of 21stcentury upperclass indian culture but is at heart a celebration of modern indian family life ms nair recoils at the word sweet to describe the film , but it has an undeniable sunny disposition you know , it s different now , being a parent , ms nair acknowledged i 've always been committed to family , but being in this time of life , it makes such a difference in how i feel i feel very much cushioned by my family still , ms nair has also called her film an homage to major vulgarity that romps all over the punjabis , the northern indians from the prosperous region of punjab who poured into new delhi after the 1947 partition of the british empire into india and pakistan since then , punjabis have come to dominate the capital economically , culturally and socially when i lived in new delhi for three and a half years in the mid1980 s , punjabis were the ruling entrepreneurial class , and liked to call themselves puppies instead of yuppies they made fun of their nouveau riche ways , but no one laughed at their ability to make money
the same day that jeff bewkes moved up to become the chief operating officer and chairman of the newly formed entertainment group at aol time warner , hbo , the division that he formerly ran , was putting an exclamation point on its recent domination of television entertainment by racking up an industryhigh 93 nominations for the emmy awards the juxtaposition of the events was not planned , but they were certainly related of the accomplishments that mr bewkes brings to his new senior management duties at aol time warner , none matter more than the results he produced at hbo , results measured not only in terms of profits , an area where hbo has done extremely well , but also in such intangible factors as prestige , cultural influence and public awareness financially , hbo s impact on the overall aol time warner budget has been small , about 6 percent of its earnings but in terms of cash flow , the pay cable channel , which derives its revenue mainly from subscription fees from viewers , has been more successful of late than such larger areas as the film and television studio and the music division for 2001 , hbo generated about 725 million in operating profits , up over 30 percent from the previous year , on revenue of about 26 billion the average over the last five years has been about 19 to 20 percent , mr bewkes said the 725 million would eclipse that of any broadcast network hbo s revenue base also includes income from home video sales , which has grown in recent years with the popularity of dvd boxed sets of hbo s hits like the sopranos and band of brothers but the channel also has great expectations for the coming technology of video on demand , which will allow viewers to pay a fee to see specific episodes of their favorite series in areas like cincinnati and columbia , sc , hbo has proved to be a driver of video on demand we expect to move that penetration just as we moved cable penetration , said chris albrecht , the channel s entertainment programming chief , who will succeed mr bewkes as chairman of hbo mr bewkes also pointed out that unlike most other networks , hbo owns the creative rights to its shows that will allow it to offer video on demand when other networks might not be able to because of ancillary rights controlled by studios hbo is accustomed to eclipsing the broadcast networks , as it proved again in this week s emmy nominations in the last four years , no institution across the range of the entertainment industry in films , television , music or books has been more talked about , written about , imitated and emulated than hbo other areas of the company have been doing well , a senior time warner executive said yesterday but hbo is unassailable nobody can question it in a big department store where some items are moving well and others are n't , hbo has been the boutique where everybody wants to shop the elevation of mr albrecht , the former entertainment chief , reflects how directly the channel s programming is tied to its brand marketing though assailed by its competitors for what they call unfair advantages in the kind of money hbo can pay creative talent as well as the kind of freedom in language and explicitness it can allow , hbo is now the gold standard of television programming , mentioned by innumerable producers and even network programmers as what they would like to aspire to indeed , the fx cable channel calls itself the hbo of basic cable , promoting such shows as its police series , the shield , as the closest thing on nonpay television to an hbo series network producers routinely try to associate their shows with hbo s , chiefly sex and the city and the sopranos nbc s top programmer , jeff zucker , called leap of faith , one of its comedies last season , our version of sex and the city' a coming nbc drama series , kingpin , which has a druglord as its main character , is unapologetically patterned after the sopranos , which made it possible for a television show to have a badguy hero i'm jealous , mr zucker said of hbo s success , while emphasizing that the channel has many fewer hours of shows on the air and much more in resources to lavish on them mr albecht acknowledged that the springboard for hbo s surge over the last four years was the decision to commit to the sopranos , a series that each of the broadcast networks had already passed on after hbo had made the pilot , mr albrecht said , it commissioned audience research into the show it was not particularly promising , mr albrecht said for all the reasons of social responsibility jeff and i looked at each other and said 'what do you think \? ' jeff said , 'can all the episodes be this good \? ' i said i think they can he said 'let s try it' there were no flashing lights or lightning but that was the moment when it all really started for us photos chris albrecht was named chairman and chief executive of hbo , succeeding jeff bewkes \( hbo , via bloomberg news \) \( pg c2 \) james gandolfini and edie falco , top , are stars on the hbo television show the sopranos , while cynthia nixon , kim cattrall , kristin davis and sarah jessica parker appear on sex and the city \( pg c1 \)
pausing from her wednesday morning commute , claire mifflin straddled her mountain bike at the entrance to the manhattan bridge and eyed the sevenfoothigh chainlink fence that lines both sides of the bridge s bicycle and pedestrian path it s ugly and feels like you 're contained too much , she said she pointed to a fourfoot iron railing that also lines the path the regular barrier is adequate , she said as the department of transportation overhauls the manhattan , williamsburg and queensboro bridges , it has been installing seven and eightfoothigh chainlink fences along the paths in the case of the queensboro bridge , which , like the brooklyn bridge , is a city landmark , it has not even sought permission from the landmarks preservation commission preservationists , alternativetransportation advocates and other bridge users say the endtoend fences are unnecessary and a blot on the grand historic structures we 've asked the city to take off the fences and not add any new ones , said noah budnick , a spokesman for transportation alternatives , a bicycle and pedestrian advocacy group it s demoralizing for people to feel jailed while they 're crossing these bridges but tom cocola , a spokesman for the city s department of transportation , said the fences are there to stay they are needed , he said , to prevent people from jumping or falling off the bridges and from dropping objects onto people and vehicles below he said that the department did not apply for permission , as required by law , to the landmarks preservation commission before it added chainlink fences last year to the bicycle and pedestrian path of the queensboro bridge where it crosses over land in queens , manhattan and roosevelt island and though the department plans to extend the fence for the entire length of the bridge , it still has not asked for permission they should be coming to us , said mark silberman , a lawyer for the commission , adding that his agency expects to negotiate with transportation officials if there s a real safety issue , we try to be sensitive to it but maybe there s a better answer than a chainlink fence one that does n't impede the view as much getting a classic view of lower manhattan prompted jorge anjos , a tourist from portugal , to set out on foot across the brooklyn bridge last week as the department of transportation s web site recommends , he had stopped to contemplate the skyline as seen through the bridge s delicate lattice of steelwire cables like more than a dozen other pedestrians who were interviewed on the bridge s wooden promenade , he opposed altering that scene i 'd be really disappointed if i had to look at this view through chain link , he said but someday he might have to do just that mr cocola said that when renovations are inevitably done to the brooklyn bridge promenade none are scheduled at the moment chainlink fencing would be installed you try your best not to sacrifice aesthetics , he said but if you do , you might as well sacrifice them over safety mr cocola said that is why the department is using chainlink fence on two pedestrian and bicycle paths that it is building in the middle of the williamsburg bridge the paths , which are scheduled to open this fall , will be enclosed by an eightfoothigh chainlink fence on both sides as for seeking approval from the landmarks preservation commission , mr cocola said , if we have to talk to them , we 'll talk to them john kaehny , the executive director of transportation alternatives , said the fences will make users of the paths feel claustrophobic and he disputed that high fences make bridges safer there is no chronic history of people either throwing themselves or things off the bridges , he said go look at the george washington bridge and look for the sevenfoothigh fences they 're not there because they 're not needed mr cocola countered that the department is following state department of transportation guidelines that call for bridges over railroads or highways to have fences at least seven feet tall but mr kaehny referred to guidelines , too he said a manual from the american association of state and highway transportation officials , a group of experts who help set federal highway standards , sets a minimum height of three and a half feet for fences on bridges the bridges already have barriers that high , he said scott demel , an architect who lives in bay ridge , brooklyn , and works in tribeca , said he was alarmed to read in the transportation alternatives newsletter that chainlink fencing was coming to the brooklyn bridge , where he rides a bicycle several times a week it will fundamentally change an iconic experience of the city , he said a bridge is about the views it gives while crossing i question these fences photos the sevenfoothigh chainlink fences lining the manhattan bridge have preservationists balking similar protective barriers are being installed along other city bridges' paths \( photographs by don hogan charles the new york times \)

technology printed circuitry , computer parts and disposable cameras provide structural support for shrinelike arrangements , as in portals , with its triumphal arch of silvered cameras that looks like a monument to the unknown tourist green water , an amalgam of glass bricks , sheet metal and computer connectors , includes a poem that conjures ripples and waves from these static elements ms kandel s work reflects nostalgia for increasingly threatened natural phenomena mr galbraith is devoted to the built environment and the photographic technology that allows him to interpret it with a rotating camera , fisheye lens and other manipulative techniques , he extends the visual field beyond the naked eye s range , suspends motion in lengthened or shortened perspectives , and generally reinvents the city as a panoramic sensory experience his color panoramas like a dramatic , 180degree sweep of the brooklyn bridge and motion studies complete with explanations of the processes behind them , are fascinating examples of this sophisticated use of specialized equipment ms donovan is a competent young photographer who has yet to arrive at a personalized aesthetic she is working her way

miami , jan 1 in the days after the sept 11 terrorist attacks , dorothy slaughter was reluctant to fly from her home here to visit family in new york like she had done regularly for years it was not that ms slaughter had been overcome by the fear of flying that had gripped so many americans , or even that she minded the extra security but ms slaughter uses a wheelchair and depends on family members to get her to the gate and while she appreciated the new security measures 'please check under my cushion , ' i tell them makes me feel better , she said the rules prohibited anyone without a ticket from going beyond the security checkpoint because of the hardship on passengers who use wheelchairs , advocates for disabled travelers successfully lobbied for the airlines and the federal aviation administration to change the restriction so on a recent trip home , ms slaughter s cousin , mel fischer of brooklyn , could accompany her to the gate at la guardia airport with a pass from delta air lines the airline industry is eager to make such concessions because customers like ms slaughter represent a fastgrowing market that the carriers say they are competing to serve better their effort to cater to the growing numbers of passengers who use wheelchairs , though , has caused some difficulties and occasionally taxes the entire system even before the new security procedures , one airline was 20 minutes late in boarding a flight here several months ago because 17 elderly passengers arriving for a caribbean cruise requested wheelchairs , sending the few workers at the gate scrambling to try to comply such chaos is an extreme example of the increasing logistical challenges the airlines say they face as they try to care for these passengers with sensitivity without causing major flight disruptions this is a very good market frankly , said andrea rader , a spokeswoman for american airlines , said of disabled passengers even with the decline in travel since the terrorist attacks , the number of american airlines customers who requested wheelchairs when they made reservations rose to 765 , 721 this past year from 748 , 153 in the previous year , ms rader said she added that the number of wheelchair requests was as much as 40 percent higher when combined with requests from people who ask for wheelchairs once they arrive at airports the airline gets about 500 requests a day for wheelchairs at hubs like the miami airport , she said the main reason for the surge is that , more than a decade after passage of the americans with disabilities act brought about wider access to public buildings , people with debilitating conditions have much more mobility to travel for business and leisure , airlines and advocacy groups say improved technology has also made wheelchairs and medical equipment lighter and more portable , giving the growing population of elderly americans more freedom to fly , advocates for disabled people say at the same time , the airlines say they expect an even greater demand for services geared toward passengers with limited mobility as more graying baby boomers begin to request wheelchairs at airports certainly the travel industry understands that this is a growing market , ms rader said that does not mean that every company does it right 100 percent of the time joni green knows that well and says the most recent flight she took was such an ordeal that it will probably be her last when mrs green , who is 72 , took an american airlines flight in august from miami to london for a 14day scandinavian cruise with her husband , she got stuck in the recline position in her firstclass seat and then found her wheelchair broken in baggage claim on the return flight it was , mrs green says , a reminder of the disability that she has worked hard not to make the focal point of her life since surgery four years ago for hip and pelvic cancer i am so active and think of myself as being very strong and healthy , mrs green said it frustrated me terribly , the whole airline business ms rader , the american airlines spokeswoman , said that she was not familiar with mrs green s case , but that such an incident should not have happened and that despite the airline s best efforts passengers occasionally have problems with wheelchairs or baggage three months ago the transportation department charged northwest airlines with discriminating against passengers with disabilities after customer complaints about wheelchair service and other assistance northwest would not comment directly on the case because the airline is in settlement negotiations , but a spokeswoman said the company was seeking ways to improve its service to what it considers an important customer base not only is it the right thing to do but it also is smart business , said kathy peach , a spokeswoman for northwest , which says the number of requests for wheelchairs the airline receives increased to 15 million last year from 12 million five years ago by law , airlines must reasonably accommodate passengers with disabilities since congress passed the air carrier access act in 1986 , for example , the carriers must train all personnel who deal with travelers on rights and accommodations for people with disabilities , help with delivering those passengers to connecting flights and equip newer jets with movable armrest for easier transport from a wheelchair to a seat yet for an industry trying to adjust to the new demands , the terrorist attacks only confounded the problem , some passengers say one woman who is in a wheelchair and was recently traveling home to houston from o'hare airport said she fretted in the days after the terrorist attacks about how she would handle a restriction on curbside passenger dropoffs i could n't fly without curb side , said the woman , susan mancil , 63 , who was waiting to take a continental flight after having visited her daughter it s one of the most important things for us how would i get myself and my bags to the counter \? i could n't do it in general , passengers who use wheelchairs , like most other travelers , give the airlines and airport workers a mixed service rating alan troop , a hardware wholesaler in miami who broke his neck in a surfing accident 24 years ago , said that , like any other frequent flyer , he had his share of horror stories mr troop says he has had his shirt ripped by a worker assisting him , has been nearly dropped by airline personnel lifting him in and out seats and has had to wait to be helped off planes until after the cleaning crew finished it makes me feel devalued , mr troop said it makes me feel more disabled actually because i have to rely on people who are not reliable still , mr troop says the airlines have come a long way since he first lost the ability to walk back then , none of the airlines had any procedures written down , he said , recalling the days when some airlines asked disabled customers to sit in separate sections of the terminal to keep them all in one place before boarding i mean travel with a disability is now a million times better than it used to be photo airlines at the busiest airports get about 500 requests a day for wheelchairs a skycap , james stephens , retrieved a chair at miami international \( andrew itkoff for the new york times \)
two of the three companies that advertise on cbs s broadcasts of the masters are distancing themselves from a campaign to open the augusta national golf club s membership to women before next april s tournament by saying they do not sponsor the club the three sponsors , cocacola , ibm and citigroup , are limited to four minutes of advertising an hour during the masters so that a maximum amount of golf can be shown it would be inappropriate for us to comment on the policies of a private organization , said dwight williams , a spokesman for cocacola our sponsorship is with the masters golf tournament , a oneweek professional event that is viewed and enjoyed by millions of sports fans in every corner of the globe deb gotheimer , an ibm spokeswoman , said the masters and augusta are separate and we 're a sponsor of the masters , which is open and public we 're not a sponsor of augusta citigroup declined to comment a spokesman for cadillac , the official car for the masters , made a similar distinction we 're the official car for the masters , not for augusta , said jeff kuhlman , a spokesman for cadillac , the luxury car company that is a division of general motors women have played at augusta , as guests of members , but none are among the club s estimated 300 members fewer than 10 members are africanamericans earlier this month , william \( hootie \) johnson , augusta s chairman , said that women might one day be invited to be members , but that timetable will be ours and not at the point of a bayonet his comments came in response to pressure from the national council of women s organizations , which has pressured the club to begin accepting women martha burk , the chairwoman of the council , which encompasses 160 women s groups , said she disagreed with sponsors who created a dividing line between the club and the tournament it s a distinction without a difference , burk said , adding that their kind of reasoning is not acceptable

few disappearing acts have been as astonishing as the evaporation of hundreds of thousands of people from new york city s welfare rolls in march 1996 , 116 million people got cash income assistance in the city roughly one in every seven residents or one out of 12 cases nationwide as of august , 420 , 000 people were still on the rolls the fate of the 740 , 000 people mostly women who left is a subject of fierce debate supporters of the giuliani administration s welfaretowork policy say that most have jobs or are being supported by someone else advocates for the poor argue that while many got jobs in the economic boom of the late 1990 s , half were pushed off the rolls by stringent policies and are now just scraping by with lowwage jobs or none at all recent interviews with several dozen women who have left the rolls found that their material wellbeing is more clouded than either side of the debate usually allows the good news is that most say they are better off without public assistance and are pleased with their decision to move toward independence even in these trying economic times perhaps not surprising , since the welfare bureaucracy is widely despised by its clients but while it was easy enough to find women whose postwelfare careers read like horatio alger tales , almost as many working women rely on a patchwork of support from relatives , lovers and supplemental government benefits there were also former recipients without jobs whose lives had taken decided turns for the worse a study released in april by the nonpartisan rockefeller institute of government found that 18 percent of former recipients in the city said they sometimes went hungry still , most had been spared from sleeping on the sidewalk or starvation by a safety net of food kitchens , housing shelters and subsidies and supplemental government benefits together , the stories of these former and present welfare recipients show a system still very much in transition , still better at demanding work and supporting the unemployed than at providing backup for those who are working jasmin agosto , 33 , says that she is much better off without welfare but adds that she would not be able to support her two children if she was not getting help from her fianc during the nine years she was on public assistance , ms agosto always thought she could do better for herself , and there were times when she tried from 1993 to 1994 , she worked off the books as an assistant manager of a clothing store but , she recalls , the hours were hard and the father of her two children , who she never married , charged her for babysitting ms agosto says that when in 1999 the city demanded that she go to a r sum program to learn how to write one to receive her check , she finally decided that she had had enough a high school graduate with a quick , warm smile , ms agosto got some help from mcif works , a local nonprofit education and training program , and was employed by ace , a head start program in bushwick , brooklyn three years later , ms agosto makes about 16 , 000 a year her family is insured through hip and she receives several thousand additional dollars through the state and federal earned income tax credit it is not enough , she says with a salary near the federal poverty level , ms agosto could get food stamps and child care subsidies , but she is precluded from those benefits because she holds money for her mother , who is undergoing an ugly divorce , under her name ms agosto s circumstances are singular , but the underuse of programs meant to bridge the income gap for women who have left welfare is a persistent problem a study released this week by the community service society of new york , based on interviews of 106 parents who had left welfare , found that of 81 parents who were eligible for child care subsidies only 24 ended up with benefits the 57 others either did not know of the benefits or had applied but been inappropriately turned down , the society said while child care spending is way up over the last five years and food stamp use started to rise this summer , the city acknowledges that transitional benefits are underused city officials say they are committed to changing that but add that because women leaving welfare are not required to tell the city of their whereabouts , they often do not learn what they are due ms agosto is engaged to a man who works as a mechanic and helps her pay bills , even though he has children of his own if the relationship does not work out , ms agosto said , she will not ask the city for aid i 'll get a second job before i go back , she says they treat you like absolute trash training brings dividends the city s welfaretowork policies seem to have achieved the most unambiguous results for women who were trained to rise beyond scrubbing floors or scraping griddles deshauna vining , 26 , who learned computer skills through a city contractor , shows how the transition from welfare can be dazzling
casablanca , morocco , april 8 secretary of state colin l powell began his middle east peace mission in this moderate arab nation today with frank pleas to two arab leaders for more help in stopping palestinian violence after meeting king mohammed vi of morocco this morning and crown prince abdullah of saudi arabia for more than two hours tonight , secretary powell made it plain that he was seeking much greater involvement by friendly arab nations to help israel and the palestinians move back toward peace negotiations we have to move forward in this together , secretary powell told reporters at his hotel here it is n't going to be enough to say the united states needs to get in the middle and solve the problem we 're there , we 're here , i'm here and now i need the help of the international community , i need the help of all of our arab friends in order to move forward but a senior arab official who participated in the meetings here said arab states could help in that effort only if israel withdrew from the palestinian areas it had recently occupied , allowed american monitors on the ground to help implement a truce and worked with the united states to rebuild palestinian infrastructure destroyed in israel s military campaign adel aljubeir , the foreign policy adviser to crown prince abdullah , said tonight that the prince had told secretary powell that the us must restrain sharon , and that american prestige and credibility are collapsing very quickly , and it is incumbent on the us to act as quickly and as strongly as possible in his own way , secretary powell made quite similar points tonight , he said he hoped that israel s initial withdrawals from palestinian areas would be the beginning of a full withdrawal and this morning , he said , the strategic problems that are created by this continuing operation are rather significant and severe when you see what is happening through the rest of the middle east indeed , perhaps halfamillion demonstrators , most of them peaceful , took to the streets of rabat , morocco s capital , on sunday to protest the israeli occupation in what moroccan officials said was one of the largest such demonstrations here in years today , the palace announced that the king had canceled the public celebration of his recent wedding , planned for next weekend , because of the plight of the palestinians secretary powell had no sooner arrived at a ceremonial photo session before a private meeting at king mohammed s seaside palace in the southern coastal city of agadir this morning than he faced a blunt question about his itinerary , which will also take him to egypt , spain and jordan before he arrives in israel at week s end do n't you think it would be more important to go to jerusalem first \? king mohammed asked just as television cameras began rolling the king wore a large button on the breast pocket of his suit , picturing the dome of the rock , the muslim shrine in jerusalem that is at the heart of ancient disputes over control of the city but speaking to reporters after the meeting , secretary powell replied that it was important to consult with arab allies , and with european union officials at a meeting in madrid on wednesday and thursday , to prepare for negotiations it was no coincidence that secretary powell began his trip here in morocco , a longtime american ally with a history of sympathetic dealings with israel it was the first stop on secretary of state henry a kissinger s shuttle diplomacy at the end of the 1973 arabisraeli war , and a way station for james a baker iii at the beginning of the persian gulf war tonight , after meeting the saudi crown prince , who has a vacation home here , secretary powell again praised the prince s recent proposal for a broad arab peace with israel in exchange for its withdrawal from lands occupied in the 1967 war he acknowledged that the united states would need even more arab support to help make that vision come true if we reach a point where we have a ceasefire and we can engage again with the palestinian leadership in a productive way , i need their help to take the message to all of the palestinians , to the palestinian people , and to the arab street , that violence is not the way to achieve the mutually desired goal of a palestinian state and that i will need help with this but an official written communiqu issued by king mohammed s aides offered a mixed message it said he had expressed his readiness to reactivate , without any prior conditions the israelipalestinian peace process , but went on to say he would only do so subsequent to the withdrawal of the israeli forces from the palestinian territories and the lifting of the siege against both the palestinian people and its leadership and another senior arab official said tonight that in that kind of an environment , it s much more likely to have a political process in which people can cooperate secretary powell took some pains to defend the pace and order of his itinerary on what is to be at least a weeklong trip i hope that people watch what i am doing , and understand it is important for me to prepare for such a trip to israel by consulting with arab leaders and asking for their help , he said after the meeting with king mohammed , secretary powell said that he had spoken to the king about the kinds of messages that should be going back and forth between arab leaders and yasir arafat about stopping terrorist activity tonight , secretary powell said he did not think it would be wise just to show up in jerusalem without a concept in mind and without having coordinated all the various parties he said he hoped that by the time he arrived in the middle east , he would be in a position to meet both prime minister ariel sharon , and as the president has requested , hopefully i will have a chance and am looking forward to seeing chairman arafat both american and saudi officials said that none of the various other tensions in saudiamerican relations , including saudi government support for schools that preach extremism , were addressed at the dinner and meeting tonight , but that secretary powell had focused solely on the prospects for peace in the middle east photo secretary of state colin l powell met with crown prince abdullah of saudi arabia in morocco yesterday \( associated press \)
tell me 30 stories by mary robison 240 pp new york counterpoint paper , 14 in the 1939 howard hawks movie only angels have wings , jean arthur plays a nightclub singer traveling through south america who falls in with a company of raffish courier pilots led by cary grant the airmen , quintessential hawks characters , hang out at the local honkytonk and fly their cargo in propeller planes through treacherous andean passes their work is exciting but perilous , as arthur finds out when she joins a group listening in as grant , on the radio , tries to talk joe , a popular member of the group , through a landing in a thick fog joe does n't make it , and arthur is shocked when , after a brief silence , the men head back to the bar , playing cards , joking and hollering for drinks what about joe \? she shouts who s joe \? grant fires back arthur realizes that these guys ca n't afford to dwell on their losses even for the amount of time it takes to acknowledge them , and soon she s back in their midst , jauntily pounding out a tune on the bar piano and cracking wise the people in mary robison s stories often sound like hawks characters their lives may be pocked with grief , but they mention it in passing at most they 're funny , in an oldfashioned , unshowy american way , and their conversations with the other characters , who are usually their relatives , are brisk and full of ribbing they say things like aw , daph and can it and sounds like your sort of poison , and they call each other kiddo and sis you half expect someone to say something s swell in the course of reading the 30 stories in tell me , though in the end , none of robison s characters suburban and midwestern for the most part is quite that retro still , the predominant voice here is lean and slangy , with a hawksian masculine reserve hinting at struggles and despair deep , deep below robison has also written three novels , but she s best known for her short fiction , much of which has been published in the new yorker the stories in tell me are mostly selected from her previous collections \( there are three new ones \) and cover the past 25 years of a career that has generated more enthusiasm among critics and other writers than among the larger reading public it s easy to see why fiction writers admire robison s technique she is a master at eliminating every last speck of the extraneous beneath the breezy , artless veneer of her prose is a comprehensive artfulness in which her meaning is conveyed with a minimum of words or at least of straightforward exposition \( it s not surprising that robison titled one of her novels subtraction \) typically , a robison story catches its characters in an unguarded , throwaway moment and ditches them before anything overtly significant happens no epiphanies here , thanks all the same the idea is that these random chips of time reveal a great deal about the lives they belong to , but only if scrutinized carefully , as we , the acutely sensitive readers of this species of fiction , are expected to do in a way , a robison story is a highend game , like a detective yarn , in which we collect clues offhand remarks , halfconscious gestures that betray the occulted wounds in her characters' lives in daughters , for example , a young woman , dell , is waiting at a bus stop in the rain with her daughter , charlotte , when pierce and nicholas a gay couple who rented rooms to dell when her marriage broke up stop to give them a ride to her father s house , where she and charlotte now live pierce accepts her father s invitation to come in for a drink dell puts the little girl to bed later , nicholas comes back to pick pierce up , and the story ends in the course of this evening , we learn that charlotte has been stealing things , that her grandfather is given to boozy speechifying and that dell has been out of touch with the couple because she still owes them rent one of the things charlotte has stolen and broken is her grandfather s watch , and he makes a show of reprimanding the girl without discussing it with her mother beforehand we can deduce that her divorce has left dell nearly broke , that \( as the story s title suggests \) she finds her dependency on her father infantilizing and that charlotte s petty thievery acts out their shared distress and rebellion marital breakup causes the barely articulated pain that many of robison s characters suffer occasionally it s death , usually that of a parent even the characters who are undergoing divorces of their own \( rather than the splitting of their parents \) get thrust back into childish roles , as dell is class or a lack of money keeps some of them under the thumbs of their elders others , like the young sometime model and actor regrouping with his midwestern family after spectacular unsuccess in los angeles in while home , or the failed psychology student sent by his mother to take care of his pregnant sister in smart , have slipped into a kind of eddy on the way to adulthood and linger there , spinning idly a remarkable number of the conversations in tell me take place between people lounging on sofas and porch swings or goofing off at kitchen tables robison has a particular liking for sibling relationships , their irritable affection and nagging banter twins , or twinlike pairs of siblings or friends , turn up a lot , apparently because they suggest to robison the kind of primal attachment that keeps her characters from growing up , whether they want to or not

washington , june 8 when andrew d morton was preparing to testify before a congressional panel this year on the treatment of immigrant children who enter the country without adult relatives or guardians , he had a place to turn for examples he emailed a call for help to lawyers at the many offices of his law firm , latham watkins , which has made refugee children the centerpiece of its pro bono , or donated , legal work latham watkins has internet links with advocacy groups , immigration and legal organizations , and lawyers who represent some of the nearly 5 , 000 unaccompanied children detained by the immigration and naturalization service each year some children have fled human rights abuses , including forced recruitment as soldiers , laborers or prostitutes others were brought to the united states by smugglers more than 100 lawyers have worked on the project , representing dozens of immigrant children in deportation and asylum cases , providing legal advice on bills in congress and advocacy on the issue this week , the head of the american bar association , robert e hirshon , in remarks to immigration judges , cited latham watkins s leadership in designing a national project to serve detained children the immigration agency says it works with nonprofit organizations and public agencies to place children in the least restrictive setting , but many spend months in jails without access to important services senator edward m kennedy , democrat of massachusetts and chairman of the immigration subcommittee of the judiciary committee , says more than 30 percent of children in custody are in juvenile jails many others , he says , are kept at shelters for months without translators , education or medical care many unaccompanied juveniles appear in court without lawyers or guardians , legal advocates say immigration laws do not provide governmentpaid lawyers for immigrants the bar association in the district of columbia honored mr morton this week as the pro bono lawyer of the year for the more than 1 , 400 hours he has spent on the project he said his firm treated pro bono clients the same way as commercial clients , with a coordinated team approach across practice areas and across office locations sharing information and work among the dozens of the child immigration cases in the united states has enabled the firm s lawyers to learn quickly about the issues involved , mr morton said latham watkins has more than 1 , 000 lawyers in its 21 offices around the world the average pro bono work per lawyer was 80 hours last year , up from about 60 in 2000 and 40 in 1999 the firm devoted more than 90 , 000 hours to pro bono work in 2001 time worth about 24 million in fees , said steven h schulman , who oversees the work from the firm s washington office when the publication the american lawyer ranked the nation s 100 highestgrossing firms by their pro bono commitment last year , latham watkins was 10th in february 2001 , a colleague at the american bar association told mr schulman , who spends half his time coordinating pro bono work and the other half working for paying clients , about the plight of children seeking asylum mr schulman said he sensed that the firm could make the cause a signature project at the time , the senate was considering a bill governing procedures for keeping immigrant children in custody because detention centers are scattered around the country , the project had the potential for national scope , mr schulman said the effort was attractive because we already had a core of expertise in asylum and human rights work , he said we could build on our strengths and geographic breadth and add to our legislative work organizations around the nation refer immigration cases involving unaccompanied children to the firm they include public counsel in los angeles , the volunteer legal services program in san francisco and the midwest immigrant and human rights center in chicago many children have grounds for seeking asylum , lawyers say , and need advice during removal proceedings before immigration judges the lawyers also help make living arrangements for the children , who they contend are often placed in overly restrictive settings in the last year , lawyers at latham watkins have won the release or transfer of about a dozen children from adult jails and juvenile detention centers to foster care and to relatives in the united states lawyers from the firm s offices in los angeles , san francisco , chicago , new york and washington have visited detention centers and reported on conditions and services mr morton , who works in the washington office , went on a 10day tour of detention centers last year before testifying on capitol hill about the need for a better system to deal with the children he worked with senator dianne feinstein , democrat of california , who has introduced a bill to transfer responsibility for the children from the immigration service to another agency in the justice department , which would set standards for detention , release and legal representation esther f lardent , the president of the pro bono institute here , said other firms have also developed signature projects , but none have the national reach that latham watkins has achieved the firm has created a global picture , she said , by translating what it learns on the ground to look for systemic reforms most projects are more local , ms lardent said for , example , leonard , street deinard of minneapolis has set up a free legalservices clinic in a poor neighborhood there mintz , levin , cohn , ferris , glovsky popeo of boston has dedicated resources to assisting women who have been physically abused amnesty international , the american civil liberties union ,

they deal with unaccompanied children wendy young , the director of government relations at the women s commission , said the firm s efforts are starting to pay off it has helped heighten attention to the issue to the point that we think we could have significant legislative reform this year , ms young said the immigration agency announced restructuring last month that included creating an office to handle child immigrants ms feinstein s measure , which has bipartisan support on capitol hill , has been included in recent proposals to reorganize the agency benoit jacqmotte , another lawyer at latham watkins in washington , said the firm s work with child immigrants showed that a big firm can wrap itself around a big project and make a difference photo steven h schulman , left , andrew d

marsh mclennan companies , the insurance brokerage firm that lost 295 employees on sept 11 , has agreed to contribute millions of dollars more to its own charity to provide extended health benefits to the families of its dead employees the move comes in response to criticism from several surviving spouses when the company , the world s largest insurance brokerage firm , initially planned to offer them one year of health benefits other world trade center companies have offered survivors 5 , 10 or unlimited years of health coverage the company later agreed to extend the coverage for three years , yet that decision stirred still more anger that was because marsh mclennan said that the costs , projected at 2 million , would be paid by the mmc victims relief fund , a charity set up by the company as a result , families stood to collect thousands of dollars less in cash from the 13 million fund also , some spouses argued , company employees and friends who donated almost 3 million to the fund would surely object now , the company announced in a letter to the 295 families , the insurance costs will be borne fully by additional marsh mclennan contributions to the charity fund none of the money given to the fund by colleagues , friends and clients and none of the 10 million already contributed by the company will be used to pay for extended health insurance , the company said , adding that it had tried to be open and sensitive in considering the needs of our colleagues' families
they would sit together in a manhattan kitchen over cups of milky tea , the impossible little boy and his everpatient nanny , louise brown her calming presence amid his tantrums was one of the boy s earliest memories often , his parents recall , she held him until he quieted , talking in rhythms passed down through the generations from african slaves in the rural north carolina of her birth the boy , barak bassman , was too emotionally disturbed and his learning too disabled for mainstream schools , yet he was so bright that he lashed out against the world in sheer frustration eventually , mental health professionals helped him succeed as a student but it was louise brown s undaunted daily love that saved barak , his parents say , and that in turn , beyond all expectation , allowed barak to help ms brown save her own family years had passed ms brown cared for other troubled children , none dearer than her own greatnephews , joshua and anthony , who were drugexposed babies when she first became their kinship foster mother she planned to adopt them , but in 1997 , court records show , child welfare caseworkers abruptly removed the boys , placing them with strangers deemed more suitable what you all doing is wrong , ms brown said she cried when caseworkers , accompanied by the police , wrested joshua , who was then 5 , from her arms , as he screamed that he wanted to stay with his mommy battling to reclaim the boys , ms brown reached a new york state court hearing in 1998 with no right to a lawyer and no money to hire one against her were caseworkers who considered her accent a speech defect , and lawyers who had argued that she had no right to speak in court at all yet in the kind of twist rarely seen outside fiction , a champion she had not seen for years was waiting in the courtroom barak bassman unable to read until he was 8 , mr bassman was by then a 20yearold firstyear law student and when he saw the lopsided legal power against his former nanny , he grew angry she was n't going to get a fair hearing , he recalled recently she was going to get steamrolled that ms brown did not get steamrolled , everyone agrees , is above all a tribute to her own determination but it also took three more years of litigation , and all the legal ingenuity that mr bassman could muster he recruited his law professors and fellow students at new york university school of law , devoted his nights and weekends to the case and discovered a crucial legal precedent at a time when kinship foster parents nationwide have no right to counsel , and legal representation for poor parents is widely in disarray , ms brown s case underscores the overwhelming odds that confront such families , often across a racial divide but it also illustrates how bonds of love can endure and overcome ms brown s adoption of her greatnephews was completed last spring now the state itself is financing her training as an advocate for other families mr bassman , 24 , is a corporate litigator in philadelphia on the side , he represents children in foster care at no cost his proud father , myron bassman , credits ms brown , 59 her tenacity and basic goodness not only resulted in her winning a fouryear battle , he said , but allowed barak to return the love and caring that was given to him the outcome looked very different on a january day in 1998 , when four lawyers stood up in state supreme court in manhattan against ms brown one for the city , one for the state and two for st joseph services for children and families , a foster care agency based in brooklyn that had custody of joshua and anthony at that stage , petitions like ms brown s were typically dismissed a family court judge and administrative hearing officers had already approved the decision to move the boys from ms brown s small apartment in harlem to a twoparent family in queens but at ms brown s request , myron bassman , her former employer , had come to vouch for her as exhibit a , he had taken along barak , the problem child she nurtured from birth to age 12 the presence of father and son seemed to pique the judge s curiosity barak bassman remembers being vividly struck by the fact that everyone in the court , down to the bailiff , the social workers and the judge , were all white except louise , her daughter and her pastor the judge asked , 'who are you people \? ' she said , 'it s unusual to see such community support in these cases , ' he recalled the lawyers insisted that the bassmans had no legal standing , but the judge invited everyone into her chambers it s really important to find out the whole story , the judge , alice schlesinger , said recently the story that unfolded that day was eventually detailed in affidavits and bolstered by an extraordinary battery of expertise provided by a psychiatrist , a psychologist , a linguist , and scholars of constitutional and family law but at heart , it was a story about parallels between barak and joshua that pitted the bassmans' description of louise brown as an exemplary nanny against the judgment of professionals who barely knew her
washington , may 14 the classified memorandum written by an fbi agent in phoenix last summer urging bureau headquarters to investigate middle eastern men enrolled in american flight schools also cited osama bin laden by name and suggested that his followers could use the schools to train for terror operations , government officials said for the first time today the memorandum said terrorist groups like mr bin laden s might be sending students to the schools as the first step in what could be a concerted effort to place islamic militants in the civil aviation industry around the world as pilots , security guards or aircraftmaintenance workers the memorandum s existence has been known for months , but few details were available until recent weeks , when some lawmakers and congressional staff members were allowed to read it before today government officials had not revealed that the memorandum included direct references to mr bin laden robert s mueller iii , who did not become director until two weeks before the attacks , has acknowledged that the bureau gave the memo too little attention mr mueller has said the bureau lacked adequate analytical capabilities to evaluate it , a failing that he has tried to correct by establishing new analytical units within the fbi and staffing them with new personnel one such unit is the office of intelligence within the bureau , formed as a direct result of this memorandum the purpose of the office is assemble and evaluate information related to terrorist threats and to disseminate this information within the bureau or to other federal agencies the memorandum was written by an fbi agent in arizona conducting terrorism investigations of several middle eastern men who were attending flight school in the area people who have read the memorandum said it did not identify anyone by name as a qaeda follower , did not specify which flight schools should be investigated or explicitly predict the sept 11 attacks but several lawmakers who have read the phoenix memorandum described it as the most significant document to emerge in congressional inquiries into whether the government might have been warned about possible hijackings several senators said the letter represented a warning that went unheeded the memorandum may not be the only internal document embarrassing to the bureau in august , an agent speculated in notes , made when investigators sought to explain why zacarias moussaoui was enrolled in a minnesota flight school , that mr moussaoui might be planning to fly a plane into the world trade center mr moussaoui , a french citizen , who was soon arrested on immigration charges , was believed by the united states government to be the intended 20th hijacker on sept 11 fbi officials have said no information available to investigators before sept 11 could have prevented the attacks even though the phoenix memorandum referred to mr bin laden s possible use of flight schools , nothing in the letter forecast the sept 11 plot none of the middle eastern men who were under investigation in phoenix had any connection to al qaeda or to the sept 11 attacks , the officials added the bureau explanations have not satisfied some lawmakers today , senator patrick j leahy , democrat of vermont and chairman of the senate judiciary committee , wrote to mr mueller , the bureau s director , asking for more information law enforcement officials said today that when the memorandum was received electronically at bureau headquarters in late july , counterterrorism agents reviewed it but they took no action on its central recommendation , which was to urge the bureau to compile information on the visa applications filled out by foreign students seeking admission to aviation schools several of the sept 11 hijackers had studied at flight schools in states like florida and california one was mohamed atta , who the authorities have concluded was the ringleader of the plot several lawmakers have expressed disbelief that the memorandum failed to set off alarms at fbi headquarters today , however , law enforcement officials said the bureau agents who handled the memorandum were not analysts but investigators who were deeply involved in other high priority cases at the time , including a terror plot uncovered in france and the hunt for a suspect in the october 2000 suicide attack on the navy destroyer cole in yemen the officials said these agents believed they had little time left to investigate what was regarded at the time as a speculative memorandum from phoenix with hundreds of foreigners in flight schools around the country , officials at bureau headquarters regarded the proposed investigative plan as a sizable undertaking , one official said they decided to defer action until they had more time to consider the recommendation instead , bureau officials in washington referred the memorandum to two field offices one was the new york office , where al qaeda cases had been investigated but no action was taken before sept 11 in addition , bureau officials have said the phoenix memorandum had other problems it was not turned over to an agent in minneapolis who in august began an investigation of mr moussaoui mr moussaoui , who was later charged with conspiring with mr bin laden in the sept 11 attacks , represented a puzzling case bureau agents believed mr moussaoui might be preparing for a terrorist action but had no evidence that he had broken the law mr moussaoui had told the school s instructors that he wanted to train on a flight simulator trip from heathrow airport in london to kennedy airport in new york based on that information , one agent speculated in an internal meeting last august that mr moussaoui might have intended to crash a plane into the trade center , officials said , confirming a report first published in this week s issue of newsweek other agents had different theories , involving 747 aircraft , which mr moussaoui wanted to pilot in simulation flights in a final interview with mr moussaoui , the minneapolis agent confronted him with the bureau s suspicion that he was preparing for a terrorist operation , but did not ask whether he meant to fly into the trade center towers mr moussaoui insisted he had no plans to break the law
when tom hennessey and mike book saw the results of the regents exams in physics that their students took in june , they thought something was wrong we knew that the kids were well prepared for the test and were shocked to find out that only 77 percent of our students passed , when last year the passing rate was 94 percent , said mr book , one of three physics teachers at south side high school in rockville centre these regents scores did n't make sense mr hennessy added , there was no question that if the scoring was different , many more kids would have easily passed rockville centre soon learned that it was not alone the passing rate on the physics regents exam in other highperforming districts on long island had also plummeted for syosset , from 92 percent in 2001 to 66 percent this year and for hewlettwoodmere , from 93 percent in 2001 to 66 percent this year statewide , the passing rate dropped from 88 percent to 67 percent when rockville centre administrators challenged the state on the scores , they were told that there were no problems with the test or its scoring but after comparable failure rates also showed up on the exam administered in august , the district took a drastic step the rockville centre school board voted unanimously not to give the regents exam in physics , becoming the first school district in the state to boycott the test we believe very strongly in regents exams , said william johnson , the superintendent of rockville centre schools but there has to be some accountability the state holds school districts accountable for everything , but they take no responsibility for their flawed scoring process they have shifted the blame to the teachers and the kids , but the truth is that our kids were well prepared and in terms of raw scores they did better than last year , up from 66 percent with scores of 65 or higher , to 79 percent the june regents exam was the first to be scored by a process known as scaling , and correct answers to hard questions counted more than correct answers to easy questions since some questions counted more than others , a student who got 65 percent of the questions right did not necessarily get a passing grade of 65 tom dunn , a spokesman for the state education department , said that a review of the scoring had turned up no problems people were unhappy with the results , so they were looking for an excuse , he said but dr johnson was having none of that how could so many kids do so well on their advanced placement and college credit physics exams , and then fail the physics regents \? he said take amy eckelmann , for example a senior , ms eckelmann scored an outstanding 5 out of 7 on her international baccalaureate exam for college credit in physics , but she got a 78 , a mediocre score , on the physics regents in june that s not at all normal for me , she said it was a hard test , but i thought i did much better than that through a freedom of information request , rockville centre , along with a number of other districts throughout the state , requested detailed information about the conversion process from raw scores to scaled scores , but they have not yet received a response from the state education department the physics regents is symbolic of a larger issue , said charles fowler , the superintendent of the hewlettwoodmere schools it represents the state s failure to communicate effectively with local school districts with regard to the issue of assessment with the lack of information we receive , many of us do n't feel comfortable calling these reasonable measures of state standards this is an especially important issue , because in many districts , the exam drives instruction the state education department does not require that school districts give regents exams , and the regents exam in physics is not required to earn a regents diploma in rockville centre , the school board voted to develop its own physics exam to replace the regents , and to offer the regents only to students who specifically request it but that decision comes too late for many seniors sure , i'm worried that this will affect my college applications , said elizabeth piselli , who got a 72 on the regents exam and is about to apply to several ivy league colleges this score sticks out like a sore thumb michael ambort , who got a 64 on the physics regents , failing by one point , said i'm sorry the district did n't decide to boycott the exam last year i'm looking to get a baseball scholarship and some colleges have told me that this score may hurt my chances rockville centre and syosset will send a letter with every transcript and college application , giving their side of the test scoring we feel strongly that our kids should not be penalized , dr johnson said but we should n't have to be on the defensive , offering an explanation when we are not to blame in helwettwoodmere , the district has taken a further step and will not include the physics regents scores on students' transcripts regents exams mean nothing to most colleges and universities , since they are just a new york exam , dr fowler said our district will also be discussing whether to join rockville centre in challenging the state education department steve kerge , the executive dean for enrollment services at hofstra university , said that the regents scores were just one measure of a student most colleges look at students from all over the country , and while regents are a good measuring mark within new york , there are many other assessments , he said photos mike book , above , who teaches physics at south side high school in rockville centre , was surprised when only 77 percent of our students passed the regents exam superintendent william johnson favored dropping the physics test elizabeth piselli , who got a 72 , said , i'm worried that this will affect my college applications \( photographs by ed betz for the new york times \)
most editorial decisions at blender , the irreverent music magazine that has thrown a scare into rolling stone and won a launch of the year award from advertising age , are conjured in a tiny conference room dominated by an armless punching bag dummy just like mariah carey s the dummy was acquired under the auspices of journalistic research , an accessory to an article the magazine ran on the diva s reinvention , and it has been customized by the staff to the point where it has a new identity dummy as editorial muse unlike ms carey s punching bag , the blender version wears a black fright wig with heavymetal osbourne overtones , green horns , a jim beam basketball jersey \( love thy advertisers \) and a gigantic crucifix that could have been pilfered from a rapper s jewelry box though he enjoys them , none of the sartorial embellishments were the idea of blender s relentlessly savvy editor in chief , andy pemberton , a budding boxer and bassstrumming member of blender s house band tragically , no , i ca n't take credit for dressing up the punching bag , says mr pemberton , himself a study in understated gray woolens he usually wears jeans and sweatshirts to his midtown office but glammed it up in honor of being interviewed i dress like a tramp no one is less venerable than me , adds the editor , a skeletal , porcelainpale british import with a typically british knack for eloquent enunciation just for kicks , mr pemberton , 33 , gives the dummy a poke in the chest he boxes three times a week at a downtown crunch gym and recently put up his dukes against a chase vice president at a tournament in brooklyn did he win \?

few people have heard of the office of management and budget s statistical policy directive no 3 , but it affects the way economic news is discussed and is a cornerstone for trust in federal statistics like the unemployment rate and consumer price index among other things , the directive prevents political appointees from publicly commenting on sensitive economic indicators until at least an hour after the professionals who produce the data have had a chance to explain the findings it also restricts those within the government who can receive sensitive data early the directive was initially put in place in the early 1970 s , after the nixon administration commented that a drop of twotenths of a percentage point in the unemployment rate was significant , only to be contradicted by a career employee of the bureau of labor statistics , who pointed out that the drop did not cross the threshold for statistical significance the goals of the directive are laudable to strike a balance between timeliness and accuracy , prevent early access to information that may affect financial and commodity markets , and preserve the distinction between the policyneutral release of data by statistical agencies and their interpretation by policy officials the practices it establishes prevent political meddling some officials have found that the directive makes it difficult to spin the numbers for political advantage exactly as intended president bill clinton occasionally found it hard to resist commenting on the numbers before an hour had lapsed last year , the labor secretary , elaine l chao , sent a memo to the white house budget director , mitchell e daniels jr , openly requesting a change in policy to address the contemporary political climate the advent of the 24hour news cycle , known as the 'cnn effect , ' she argued , has rendered this policy obsolete reporters from each network cover the announcement live at 8 30 am , and pundits begin to offer their interpretations immediately after the data has been made public she added preventing the executive branch from presenting its point of view in the first hour has become a distinct disadvantage , as the tone of the analysis and debate is often already determined by the time an hour has passed ms chao requested that senior administration officials be permitted to comment on federal data immediately after their release to clarify the issues , and that they be given access to data a day early to formulate a coherent policy \( ordinarily , the labor secretary is briefed on the unemployment rate by the bureau of labor statistics half an hour before the data are released , but ms chao has opted not to participate in such briefings \) the budget office wisely decided not to change directive no 3 the issue of who gets what when is of critical importance for economic statistics , as well as central intelligence the procedures specify that the council of economic advisers receives principal economic indicators as soon as they are available the council passes the information on to the president the federal reserve board chairman , alan greenspan and the treasury secretary , paul h o'neill mr greenspan also has an agreement with the bureau of labor statistics to receive monthly employment data for manufacturing , mining and public utilities two or three days early , ostensibly so the fed can produce its industrial production statistics on a timely basis , though those figures are not released until 10 to 17 days later surely , the chairman s reason for wanting the data early is a ruse he wants an advanced hint at where the economy is headed it is an interesting question whether it makes sense for the fed chairman and treasury secretary to receive the information before everyone else providing prerelease data may make the chairman seem omniscient and help the fed and treasury outfox the markets , but it is unclear whether these advantages increase or decrease market volatility and raise economic growth in a paper presented at the fed s symposium in jackson hole , wyo , last summer , michael woodford , a princeton macroeconomist , argued that monetary policy can be even more effective when information is more rapidly disseminated to the private sector in addition , privileged access raises the level of cynicism by market participants with hundreds of billions of dollars of government spending and tax receipts directly tied to federal statistics , the hurdle to persuade the public that the numbers are free from political meddling is high the statistical agencies take many precautions to inspire confidence in government data virtually all the agencies' work is done by career employees protected by the civil service system the bureau of labor statistics has only one political appointee the census bureau , four and the bureau of economic analysis , none nevertheless , trust in federal statistics is low robert shiller of yale found in a 1996 public opinion survey that slightly more americans agreed than disagreed with this statement an important reason not to trust contracts indexed to inflation is that someone in the government might deliberately falsify the inflation numbers to take advantage of people like me although such concerns are ludicrous to anyone who has observed the dedication , nonpartisanship and professionalism of the employees of federal statistical agencies , public cynicism toward government statistics runs deep the word statistics originally meant state arithmetic objective , credible statistics are essential for government , business and personal decisions and for the operation of democracy itself it is important that strong safeguards be maintained to prevent even the appearance of political meddling with the data , and that senior government officials appreciate the justification for such safeguards photo the fed chairman , alan greenspan , receives some economic data early , and the labor secretary , elaine l chao , has asked to see it and be allowed to comment on it sooner \( reuters \)

the city council and the bloomberg administration remained at an impasse yesterday over the mayor s antismoking legislation , as council officials hastily scheduled a second hearing on the measure for tomorrow from the beginning , mayor michael r bloomberg has made it clear that extending the city s antismoking law to small restaurants , bars and bar areas was a personal policy goal , but it has faced opposition in the council from members worried about the economic impact on establishments in their neighborhoods speaker gifford miller has remained noncommittal on the smoking bill , and officials signaled that he would not support it unless the mayor backed mr miller s own pet measure a bill to guarantee certain workers a socalled living wage , which the administration has opposed officials have insisted that the two measures were being considered separately and on the merits alone , but mr miller had suggested to mr bloomberg that if he could provide a version of the living wage bill that he could live with , the council would try to accommodate him in the same fashion on the smoking legislation , according to someone who was involved in the negotiations council officials had hoped to reach such an agreement on the living wage bill before yesterday s committee vote in exchange , they would schedule a speedy hearing on the smoking bill , at which they could present a compromise acceptable to the bloomberg administration it appeared yesterday that none of those goals had been met after a day of frantic negotiations , a council committee passed a version of the living wage bill that mr bloomberg had not yet decided whether to sign , said edward skyler , a spokesman for the mayor and although the council had scheduled a hearing for tomorrow on the smoking bill , officials said they could always cancel it the living wage bill approved by the committee is scaled back from its original draft and would set minimum wages that some city contractors pay to home health aides , day care workers and workers with agencies dealing with cerebral palsy but the council agreed to delete provisions that required a higher wage for employees at companies that received city subsidies to operate or renovate office buildings , including several investment banks the council also deleted provisions setting a minimum wage for employees of business improvement districts and office buildings in which city agencies rent several floors
chicago , dec 4 having focused attention in recent weeks on the gamble that united airlines could somehow obtain loan guarantees from a skeptical federal board , glenn f tilton , the chief executive , appears certain to lose an even bigger bet keeping his carrier out of bankruptcy court despite vows by united and its unions to pull together with whatever resources they can amass to keep the airline afloat , bankruptcy experts and united s competitors maintain that a bankruptcy filing is inevitable and will come within days and although united , a unit of the ual corporation , has been working with its lawyers for months on a reorganization plan , mr tilton s todo list has several tasks that have yet to be completed mr tilton failed to obtain concessions from united s mechanics , who were the only holdouts in the airline s bid for employee backing of its recovery plan they rejected the airline s first request for wage and benefit cuts and canceled a second vote planned for thursday after the loanguarantee board s decision because all the employees' concessions were linked to approval of its loan application , united must now craft new deals with all its unions in its restructuring drive though discussions with lenders have been under way for weeks , the airline has not lined up the 2 billion in debtorinpossession financing that it will need to run its daytoday operations , although many bankruptcy experts see a financing agreement as a foregone conclusion while most leases on united s jets have been renegotiated , some holdouts remain , raising the possibility , albeit remote , that some could march into court and demand their planes back and mr tilton does not have the prospect of any kind of partner that could swoop in and rescue united none of its fellow players in the star alliance air canada , the brazilian carrier varig or lufthansa of germany have the resources to do the job , despite their expressions of moral support the rejection by the federal air board makes a bankruptcy filing for united all but inevitable , bankruptcy lawyers and analysts said james j white , a professor at the university of michigan school of law , predicted the airline would be in court by early next week one motivating factor is a looming 375 million payment on debt backed by aircraft , which the airline missed this week a grace period on that payment ends dec 16 philip baggaley , a credit analyst with standard poor s , said united would file for chapter 11 as soon as it secures debtorinpossession financing , which professor white expects to be arranged quickly now that the application for federal loan guarantees has been rejected professor white said the size of the financing , which united will use to pay for its immediate needs , was less important than its symbolism to its vendors , like fuel suppliers the real significance of it is not for someone to lend you a lot of money but to appear to be willing to do so , he said and therefore the guy pumping gas for you in omaha will keep doing it because he s more confident that he will be paid one immediate concern for the airline would be the location of a bankruptcy filing probable places include delaware , where it is incorporated , or chicago , which is close to united s headquarters in the suburbs and also home to kirkland ellis , the law firm that has been exploring a reorganization for the airline that effort is being headed by james sprayregen , a partner in the firm , who could not be reached for comment tonight while a chicago filing could be most convenient , it is also probable that united employees would fill the courtroom , creating a potentially contentious atmosphere a bankruptcy filing is not easy even for the most prepared airlines i 've seen a lot of chapter 11 s , and no one is the same , douglas steenland , the president of northwest airlines , said in an interview this afternoon a lot depends on individualized decisions by the team that is running the airline mr steenland , who is a lawyer , had roles in several airline bankruptcies over the last 15 years as proof , he said the industry need only consider the experience of us airways , which filed for chapter 11 two months ago in a prepackaged bankruptcy with the help of texas pacific group us airways had an advantage that united did not have , the conditional approval of 900 million in federal loan guarantees despite that , it has sliced spending even deeper than it originally anticipated , eliminated routes , closed maintenance operations and gone back to its unions for more concessions , only to have its employees dig in their heels labor issues would be a focal point in a united bankruptcy , posing the ultimate test of mr tilton s belief in employee ownership united is 55 percent owned by its employees , which have three representatives on its board in seeking an initial round of concessions , the airline promised that it would not seek to void its contracts in bankruptcy court unless faced with dire circumstances that threatened its existence it did not spell out what those circumstances would be , and the guarantee hinged on united s ability to win approval for the loan guarantees now , given its inability thus far to tie up all its loose ends , that issue could be raised as soon as its lawyers walk into court a request by united to cancel its labor agreements , for which it would have to spell out specific reasons , would be exquisitely ironic given its governance structure , said david gregory , professor of labor law at st john s university in queens it would be a basic repudiation of the concept of the employee enterprise , he said in bankruptcy , he added , united would face a real obligation now to moderate labor costs , and layoffs alone will not take care of that even with that question looming , united would face more mundane tasks as it arrives in court on the first day , united would ask the judge to issue orders that allow crucial vendors , like fuel suppliers , caterers and travel agents to be paid , mr steenland said the airline would pledge to honor all tickets that had been issued for future flights and also create a trust fund so that tax revenues due to local airport authorities and governments would be paid such minutiae helps explain in part why united s management may have preferred to focus on winning approval for loan guarantees rather than on a bankruptcy filing now , however , that decision could complicate united s efforts to reorganize speedily , said one person briefed on the company s financial strategy the ceo appears to have been putting all his eggs in one basket , he said chart photo united may join other airlines in bankruptcy airlines are vulnerable to bankruptcy because profit margins are small , competition is fierce and they have high fixed costs as a result , when customers cut back on travel during slower economic times , the most vulnerable airlines often run out of cash here are the biggest passenger airline bankruptcies since 1989 and how united would compare the size of the circles represents prebankruptcy assets uniteds assets are based on thirdquarter figures airlines that are still operating independently are in bold chart shows the biggest passenger airline bankruptcies since 1989 in comparison to united \( sources

following are excerpts from the house debate yesterday on the use of force against iraq , as recorded by the new york times speakers included representatives pete stark , democrat of california michael n castle , republican of delaware silvestre reyes , democrat of texas earl pomeroy , democrat of north dakota gerald d kleczka , democrat of wisconsin john e sununu , republican of new hampshire and robert w goodlatte , republican of virginia representative stark i rise in opposition to this resolution i'm deeply troubled that lives may be lost without a meaningful attempt to bring iraq into compliance with un resolutions through careful and cautious diplomacy the bottom line is i do n't trust the president and his advisers make no mistake , we are voting on a resolution that grants total authority to a president who wants to invade a sovereign nation without any specific act of provocation this would authorize the united states to act as the aggressor for the first time in our history and it sets a precedent for our nation or any nation to exercise brute force anywhere in the world without regard to international law or international consensus congress must not walk in lock step behind a president who has been so callous to proceed without reservation as if the war was of no real consequence you know , three years ago , in december , molly ivins , an observer of texas politics wrote , i quote , for an upperclass white boy , bush comes on way too hard , at a guess to make up for being an upperclass white boy somebody , she wrote , should be worrying about how all this could affect his handling of future encounters with some saddam hussein pretty prophetic , ms ivins let s not forget that our president , our commander in chief , has no experience with or knowledge of war in fact , he admits that he was at best ambivalent about the vietnam war , he skirted his own military service and then failed to serve out his time in the national guard and he reported years later that at the height of the conflict in 1968 he did n't notice any heavy stuff going on so we have a president who thinks foreign territory is the opponent s dugout and kashmir is a sweater what is most unconscionably is that there s not a shred of evidence to justify the certain loss of life do the generalized threats and halftruths of this administration give any one of us in congress the confidence to tell a mother or father or family that the loss of their child or loved one was in the name of a just cause \? is the president s need for revenge for the threat once posed to his father enough to justify the death of any american \? i submit the answer to these questions is no aside from the wisdom of going to war as bush wants , i am troubled by who pays for his capricious adventure into world domination the administration admits to a cost of around 200 billion now , wealthy individuals wo n't pay they 've got big tax cuts already corporations wo n't pay they 'll just continue to cook the books and move overseas , and send their contributions to the republicans rich kids wo n't pay their daddies will get them deferments as big george did for george w well , then who will pay \? school kids will pay there 'll be no money to keep them from being left behind way behind seniors will pay , they 'll pay bigtime as the republicans privatize social security and continue to rob the trust fund to pay for this capricious war medicare will be curtailed and drugs will be more unaffordable and there wo n't be any money for a drug benefit because bush will spend it all on a war working folks will pay through loss of jobs , job security and bargaining rights and our grandchildren will pay through the degradation of our air and water quality and the entire nation will pay as bush continues to destroy civil rights , women s rights and religious freedom in a rush to phony patriotism and to courting the messianic pharisees of the religious right representative castle for the past several months i have participated in intelligence hearings on the sept 11 terrorist attacks and studied the hatred some nations and groups have toward america saddam hussein is encouraging and promoting this hatred by openly praising the attacks on the united states the director of central intelligence recently published an unclassified summary of the evidence against saddam hussein and it is substantial we know that iraq has continued buildings weapons of mass destruction , energized its missile program and is investing in biological weapons saddam hussein is determined to get weaponsgrade material to develop nuclear weapons its biological weapons program is larger and more advanced that before the gulf war iraq also is attempting to build unmanned vehicles , uav s , to possibly deliver biological warfare agents all of this has been done in flagrant violation of the un security council resolutions some may react to this evidence saying that in the past other countries have had similar arsenals and the united states did not get involved but as president bush has told us and as secretary rumsfeld reiterated yesterday in a meeting , saddam hussein s iraq is different this is a ruthless dictator whose record is despicable he has waged war against his neighbors and on his own people he has brutalized and tortured his own citizens , harbored terrorist networks , engaged in terrorist acts , violated international commitments , lied , cheated and defied the will of the international community i have examined this information in some of the more specific classified reports the bottom line is we do n't want to be caught off guard we must take all precautions to prevent a catastrophic event similar to sept 11
tabiawan , the philippines emergency ! the men shouted as they jumped from a jeep outside the little clinic a young nurse named reina malonzo hurried out to help , but they pushed by her in the rain and darkness and began smashing windows with their rifle butts they fired into the air their hostages , filthy and wet , stumbled into the little building and began taking showers and looking for fresh clothes the hospital workers huddled on the floor in fear and bewilderment we covered our faces , said miss malonzo , who is 23 we did n't want to look it was a moment , she said later , that ruined the life she had known sitting in a military camp here on the island of basilan , smiling in embarrassment , she said , i really do n't know where to start again when the gunmen left the hospital 18 hours later , they took miss malonzo with them , along with three other hospital workers and the eight hostages they had seized at a beach resort four days earlier it would be five months before miss malonzo saw her family again , and by that time , she was a convert to islam , in love with one of her captors and unsure whether she really wanted to be free at first you are frightened , she said , describing her transformation then you are getting sympathy from them then you are giving sympathy to them the kidnappers who seized her are not a very sympathetic bunch they are members of the most brutal and aggressive armed movement in the philippines a muslim separatist group called abu sayyaf , which is terrorizing this small jungled island in the far south of the philippines as the united states scours the world for terrorists who might be linked to osama bin laden s qaeda network or might provide its members with refuge and support abu sayyaf has come under increasing suspicion there s no question that we believe that if they could clear the abu sayyaf out of basilan island , that would be a small blow against the extended al qaeda network , deputy secretary of defense paul d wolfowitz said recently , emphasizing that any military action would be carried out by philippine troops armed american military advisers are now helping the philippine army in its efforts to find and crush the group and free its last three hostages martin and gracia burnham of wichita , kan , an american missionary couple , and deborah yap , a philippine nurse some philippine officials say abu sayyaf is already linked with al qaeda , though the evidence for that is sketchy in its early years , the group was visited by a brotherinlaw of mr bin laden in the early 1990 s it seemed to have some contact with ramzi ahmed yousef , a terrorist who is now imprisoned in the united states for the bombing of the world trade center in 1993 but at its core , abu sayyaf seems to be a bandit group in the pirate tradition of the southern philippines and part of the region s long history of muslim separatism in this largely roman catholic country since its formation in the early 1990 s , the abu sayyaf movement , now numbering about 500 armed men , has carried out massacres , bombings and beheadings on the islands of basilan and jolo its members are known for rape and for forced marriages with women they take hostage their specialty , however , is kidnapping in the past 18 months they have earned millions of dollars in ransom after seizing scores of hostages , including a dozen foreigners they treat the burnhams harshly , but with respect for their religious beliefs , said three former hostages interviewed at a military base here the hostages were released or fled their captors and are back in their homes near the base mr burnham , 43 , is led through the jungle by a leash as the rebels prod their hostages down muddy trails , shouting , drop ! crawl ! and run ! when military patrols come close at night , said joel guillo , 26 , who was seized at the hospital along with miss malonzo , he is chained to a tree , like a dog and sometimes his wife , too mrs burnham , 44 , is always crying because she misses her children and family , said mr guillo , and her husband hugs and comforts her burnham is strong , he said just guts the filipino hostages were forced , through threats and persuasion , to convert to islam they said my family would be safe if i became a muslim , mr guillo said they took me to the river they put me under the water and said some things i did n't understand and then they said we were brothers and they would not cut off my head it was not an idle threat on june 11 the kidnappers beheaded a third american hostage , guillermo sobero of corona , calif they said , 'come with us , ' miss malonzo recalled and he said , 'where are you taking me \? ' then we heard him yell miss malonzo insisted that the group s leader , khadaffy janjalani , 26 , had played no part in this killing but her judgment about mr janjalani had become far from objective she had become his lover indeed , none of the three former hostages had a bad word to say about mr janjalani , whose nickname is daf softspoken and kind to his men , as they described him a nice guy , just a nice guy , mr guillo said many girls admire him because he is very handsome , more handsome than me , very white , a very nice guy it was mr janjalani s older brother , abdurajak , who founded abu sayyaf which means bearer of the sword after studying in saudi arabia and libya and fighting in afghanistan a powerful speaker , the older brother brought to his group a religious fervor and fundamentalist principles that went beyond those of other , longestablished muslim separatist movements when he was killed in a firefight in 1998 , the younger of his two brothers , khadaffy , took command , although a faction on the island of jolo broke away along with its religious fervor , abu sayyaf made its mark from the start as a particularly violent gang , introducing itself with a series of bombings , massacres and kidnappings for ransom its most ambitous exploit came in april 2000 , when abu sayyaf gunmen raided a nearby malaysian diving resort , sipadan , and seized 10 western tourists and 11 asian resort workers libya is reported to have paid 25 million in what it called development aid in return for their release according to the hostages , the five top leaders of the group took their pick of the female hostages as what they called the spoils of war at first they were forced , mr guillo said after a while for some of them the feelings developed miss malonzo said she asked mr janjalani , why me \? he just smiled , she said he told me he loved me he said , 'i want to marry you' mr guillo , describing the two , said together they were very loving they put food in their spoons and fed each other they took baths together in the river miss malonzo made no secret of her feelings it s patty hearst , she said they 've been telling me that in the mountains since her release on nov 1 , philippine officers say , miss malonzo has reunited with the boyfriend she left behind but the romance of the jungle still tugs at her asked if she thought mr janjalani might find a way to come for her again , miss malonzo blushed i do n't know , she said , torn , it seemed , between fear and hope photos reina malonzo , above , was taken hostage by muslim separatists led by khadaffy janjalani , center at left , in a july 2000 photograph \( seth mydans the new york times \) \( raffy tima asiapix \) map of the philippines highlighting tabiawan philippine soldiers in tabiawan keep an eye on muslim guerrillas
in its efforts to be a ubiquitous part of the sports world , espn has few media rivals the flagship channel is available in 87 million homes and has 97 percent awareness among american adults , according to espn executives , who say that certain truly fanatical parents have even given their children the network s brand name now , espn plans to celebrate the facepainter in us all with a campaign that makes the nonetoosubtle point to both viewers and advertisers that the cable network is synonymous with sports the effort from espn , a division of the walt disney company , is called without sports , and will begin monday it is espn s first comprehensive brand campaign , as opposed to ads for specific programming like its sports news show , sportscenter neither espn nor its agency , wieden kennedy in new york , would disclose the budget but lee ann daly , senior vice president for marketing at espn , said the network would spend more on this campaign than any other in its history in recent years , the biggest espn spending came in 2000 , with expenditures on major media advertising totaling 305 million , according to cmr , a division of taylor nelson sofres known mainly for zany commercials featuring bigname athletes rampaging through its studios in bristol , conn , espn is adopting a slightly different though still humorous tone for without sports in one commercial , gathering , a group of spanish relatives are in a small living room , watching a soccer match between the traditional rivals real madrid and barcelona half the relatives support real madrid , the other half barcelona one player takes a dive and a penalty is called , leading to a huge argument among the relatives the tagline is , without sports , what would bring a family together \? the print and outdoor ads , including ones tailored for new york , chicago , los angeles and other cities , offer philosophical musings as without sports , would you know how to spell jets \? and without sports , weekends would be weekdays it s like holding up a mirror to all of us , ms daly said the idea is that sports are n't a metaphor for life , sports are life sports really do forge connections between people they shape how we interact with each other ty montague , cocreative director at wieden kennedy , added the goal for the campaign is to reenergize sports fans' relationship with sports there has been an inevitable decline in people s ability to pay attention to sports as the number of entertainment outlets has grown in the culture this campaign is designed to put people back in touch with the elements of sports that are positive and uplifting the campaign could also help woo prospective advertisers for the various espn networks , said chris dixon , a media analyst at ubs warburg the campaign catches those magic moments , but rather than catching the moment , it catches the people watching it , he said and by the way , advertisers , if you want to reach these people , you 'd better come to us espn is ultimately planning to run up to 30 executions of the campaign espn and wieden used seven production houses and that many directors , including the documentary filmmaker errol morris tv ads will appear during the major college bowl games and also during the super bowl , which belongs to a fellow disney property , abc it is unlikely , but not impossible , that any of the ads will appear during the nfl playoffs cbs and nbc wo n't broadcast espn s ads , and fox remains a question mark , said ms daly we might opportunistically buy local time at fox , she said the campaign comes at a time when espn s hegemony over the sports programming world is just about complete fox sports net , a collection of 21 regional cable networks , has retreated from competing with espn on national news shows , and aol time warner earlier this year closed cnn si espn is the first network to have contracts for all four major sports football , basketball , baseball and hockey simultaneously espn s ratings in 2002 have jumped 14 percent in the 24hour time period and 16 percent during prime time , the president , george bodenheimer , told analysts recently the company is projected to produce 212 billion in revenue this year , up 15 percent from 2001 , according to broadcasting and cable magazine photo one of the print ads in espn s new comprehensive brand campaign
they were among the corporate elite , three chief executives who made millions and were the leading citizens of their communities now they find themselves out of work and hundreds of millions of dollars in debt all because they were wrongly confident that their companies would never falter perhaps they should be known as the borrowing believers yesterday john j rigas , who appears to have incurred by far the largest debt of any of them well above a billion dollars was forced to step down as chief executive of adelphia communications , a cable television company that is mired in a scandal set off by the belated disclosure of the loans to mr rigas and his family entities owned by the rigas family borrowed 23 billion from banks with the loans guaranteed by adelphia some of that money went to buy cable systems , but it appears that most of it was used to buy adelphia stock for the family mr rigas joined two other chief executives who were forced out of the companies they built and who now owe huge sums because their companies either lent them money or guaranteed other loans that were backed by the executives' stock bernard j ebbers , the founder of worldcom , was forced to step down last month and has been given five years to repay his loans yesterday , worldcom disclosed that he now owes 4082 million after it consolidated a number of loans , some from banks and some from the company with worldcom s share value down 98 percent from its peak and mr ebbers s having sold some shares recently to pay down loans , his stake in the company is worth just 198 million stephen c hilbert , the man who built conseco into a large insurance company , allowed the loans to be spread more broadly before he was ousted in the spring of 2000 other senior executives and even outside directors borrowed tens of millions to buy shares whose price has since collapsed the loans came from bank of america , but were arranged and guaranteed by conseco , which is paying interest on them those former corporate bosses may be the only ones who took such risks at least no others have been disclosed they certainly stand in stark contrast to other top executives of companies whose prices have fallen sharply since the stock market peaked in 2000 such executives as gary winnick of global crossing , joseph p nacchio of qwest and kenneth l lay of enron took out hundreds of millions of dollars by selling shares while their companies were popular with investors but while faith in a company would seem to be a virtue for a chief executive , few voices of sympathy have been raised for the borrowing believers critics say that the boards of the companies should never have approved such large loans and that the bosses were allowed to borrow on terms that would never have been available to ordinary speculators they were often required to put down no money to buy stock and got interest rates far lower than ordinary stock investors would have paid the board should be extremely reluctant , at best , to extend loans to executives , said kenneth bertsch , director of corporate governance for tiaacref , the money management firm these people should be able to borrow on their own there is a certain paradox in that while the executives got better terms on their loans , they are left in far worse financial position than would be any ordinary speculator in their stocks such a speculator would have been forced to put up half the price of the stock when the investment was made as the stock fell , the lender would have forced the speculator to come up with more cash or sell the stock before the price fell further there were no such rules for the chief executives so the value of their stock has fallen far below the amounts they owe they got into the difficulties by differing means mr hilbert , who owed 1625 million plus interest when he left conseco in 2000 , used most of the loans to buy conseco stock with no money down in the 1990 s , he was paid 119 million in cash by the company , but much of that seems to have gone for a lavish lifestyle and for philanthropy in indianapolis , where the local symphony plays at the hilbert circle theater meanwhile , the stock he owned when he left conseco is now worth just 37 million mr hilbert has made some loan payments 1 million last year and 6 million last month he has promised to pay 10 million next year and has put up collateral said to be worth 20 million , including a mortgage on his home and some art , according to a conseco spokesman but interest on the loan is accruing at a rate of about 8 million a year , so the amount he owes is growing mr hilbert , who now runs a consulting company , could not be reached for comment mr ebbers , a former high school coach who built a tiny longdistance company into worldcom through acquisitions , became a hero in clinton , miss , where the company is still based he bought some stock in the open market , but those purchases cannot explain his financial distress it appears that he also used his worldcom wealth at one point he was a billionaire to support other investments along with his own spending in excess of the millions he was paid by the company mr ebbers has said that he has other investments that he can sell to pay off his debt worldcom said yesterday that he has promised to pay 25 million next april , a similar amount the next year , 75 million in april 2005 , 100 million a year later and the rest in 2007 one break for him is that worldcom is charging him just 23 percent interest mr rigas and his family , including three sons who are also top officers of adelphia and who have not resigned , used an unusual coborrowing agreement that allowed partnerships controlled by the family to borrow from banks using adelphia s credit it appears that most of the 23 billion that was borrowed by the end of last year an amount that may have increased this year went to support the family s purchases of adelphia securities the paper loss on those purchases now exceeds 1 billion when they were buying , the rigas family was hailed on wall street for showing faith in the company they became by far the most famous citizens of coudersport , pa , a small town in the western part of the state mr rigas would not be interviewed yesterday at least theoretically , all these executives should face a debt crisis as a result of the loans but none have yet suffered by being forced to come up with the cash or file for bankruptcy , and some doubt they ever will be the company is traditionally going to be a lot less tough than a bank , said charles elson , director of the center for corporate governance at the university of delaware he said that executives who took out such loans might be assuming that they would never be forced to repay if things went wrong now things have gone badly wrong for all three men , and their successors at the helm face the decision of when , or whether , to demand that

growing concern over how the roman catholic church has handled allegations of sexual abuse by its clergy has cost a priest his job in the diocese of trenton the priest , not named , was removed late last month from an administrative post by bishop john m smith and ordered to abstain from wearing a collar or other vestments following a review of personnel files of more than 500 priests dating back 50 years allegations were also made against 12 other priests , none of whom are still active in the diocese , bishop smith said the bishop said he ordered the review to ensure that the diocese s 750 , 000 catholics in mercer , monmouth , burlington and ocean counties remained confident in their clergy the newark archdiocese is conducting a similar review bishop smith said the allegations against the fired priest were brought to the monmouth prosecutor s office 12 years ago , after a boy s family reported them to church officials but , the bishop said , prosecutors did not charge the priest because of insufficient evidence , though diocese barred him from liturgical duties or contact with young worshipers steve strunsky
two months ago , nbc became the first broadcast network to accept commercials for hard liquor like vodka , rum or whiskey but an outcry from members of congress and advocacy organizations opposed to expanding ads for distilled spirits may scuttle the effort the complaints could lead to congressional hearings aimed at producing a bill banning broadcast spots for hard liquor , but it may not stop there the opponents lined up against nbc may seek to roll back a decision in 1996 by the trade organization for liquor marketers , the distilled spirits council of the united states , to lift a voluntary ban against such commercials the council s aboutface enabled makers of hard liquor to join marketers of beer , wine , maltbased coolers and other alcoholic beverages in using television to sell their wares since then , liquor spots have run tens of thousands of times on hundreds of local tv stations and cable systems , as well as on national cable networks but none had appeared on broadcast tv networks until dec 15 , when a spot promoting designated drivers on behalf of the smirnoff vodka brand sold by guinness udv ran on saturday night live on nbc one factor that may determine whether other liquor companies follow guinness onto broadcast network tv is a timetable set by nbc before nbc accepts commercials that sell specific brands , the liquor sponsor must run four months of spots centered on social responsibility issues like drinking moderately that s why the guinness udv spot appearing on nbc since dec 15 mentions smirnoff only in passing and promotes designating a driver before going out to drink when the four months are over , and nbc starts running the product spots , the opponents may pounce the jump to broadcast television is opposed by people who are upset at what they say is the widening exposure of liquor commercials to children , and they were galvanized into action they include some members of both parties in the house of representatives and federal regulators , the incoming chairman of the american medical association and the heads of advocacy groups like the center for science in the public interest we anticipated that something bad was going to happen soon , said george hacker , director of the alcohol policies project at the science center in washington as nbc becomes the subject of mounting public criticism and pressure , the potential for hearings is good , he said reflecting the extent of the anger , the popular culture began weighing in , too the comic strip doonesbury showed a child watching an episode of the nbc sitcom frasier sponsored by wild turkey bourbon an editorial cartoonist , mike thompson , suggested that nbc was hittin' the hard stuff to defray the cost of the new contract for the today host katie couric on the tonight show with jay leno , a show on which nbc has run the smirnoff commercial , jay leno even bit the hands that feed him , asserting that the network s initials would now stand for nothing but cocktails the complaints seem to have encouraged the other national broadcasters abc , cbs and fox to keep intact , at least for now , their policies against accepting pitches for hard liquor at the same time , no other liquor company has followed guinness udv onto nbc , though network executives say they are in discussions with other companies the complaints appear to have convinced nbc and guinness udv a division of diageo that also sells johnnie walker scotch whiskey and captain morgan rum to restrict the initial commercial s appearance the spot , created by two agencies , the glover park group and westhill partners , has run only after 11 30 pm though under guidelines for liquor ads nbc adopted last month it could also appear from 9 to 11 pm we 've taken a measured and steady approach to increasing our presence on television , said ted hissey , senior vice president for marketing at guinness udv in stamford , conn we want to do this in the right way , a responsible way , with pretty strict guidelines the nbc executives responsible for formulating the guidelines 19 points meant to limit the exposure to and appeal of liquor commercials to children and teenagers are even signaling they may be amenable to tightening the rules in response to the complaints of critics we recognized there would not be universal agreement , said randy falco , president at the nbc television network division of nbc in new york , part of the general electric company the goal is to put together a winwin situation we 're not pretending we have all the answers , he added the standards are a living , breathing document if something is out of context , we change it in another sign that nbc is proceeding cautiously , alan wurtzel , president for research at the network , said that it would take the content of even latenight shows into account when considering whether to run liquor commercials for instance , mr wurtzel said , if an episode of saturday night live is to have a host like the singer britney spears we would n't approve the spot in that show because presumably the viewers would be younger than usual
tampa , fla , jan 6 a teenage pilot s fatal flight into a downtown skyscraper here was a deliberate gesture of support for osama bin laden and the hijackers who brought down the world trade center , the city s police chief said today chief bennie r holder said investigators found a suicide note in the pocket of charles j bishop , the 15yearold who crashed a light plane into the 28th floor of the bank of america plaza on saturday evening the young man , charles bishop , can best be described as a young man with very few friends , and was very much a loner , chief holder said at a news conference today with this action , we assume he was a very troubled young man no one else was injured chief holder did not release the contents of the short , handwritten note although it expressed support for the terrorists , he said the note also made it clear that the youth had acted alone , and there are no apparent links to any terrorist organizations neighbors and schoolmates described him as bright but quiet and expressed mystification at his act a white house spokesman said last night that the fbi was investigating and that the incident did not appear linked to terrorism the incident , however , raised concern about the security of thousands of small planes at airports around the country , which many aviation officials say are vulnerable to the same threat the pilot was a student at a flight school based at st petersburgclearwater international airport , and shortly before 5 pm on saturday , when an instructor thought he was performing a preflight check of the singleengine cessna 172r , the youth jumped in and took off without permission he flew east across old tampa bay , ignoring a coast guard helicopter pilot frantically gesturing for him to stop , and headed for a bank of office buildings lining the hillsborough river downtown butch wilson , an investigator for the national transportation safety board , said the youth was in full control of the fourseat plane and appeared to know exactly what he was doing he refused to make radio contact during the 9 to 12minute flight the note did not say whether mr bishop had chosen the 42story bank of america building in advance , chief holder said the plane once edged south into the airspace of macdill air force base , headquarters of the united states central command , which directs the combat in afghanistan after making several turns , the plane struck the edge of the tower chief holder said investigators had no doubt the action was deliberate the plane s wings , which contained its fuel , were sheared off , and there was no fire in the unoccupied law office that was struck videotape taken by firefighters showed the fuselage amid a mass of crumpled walls , furniture , glass and pink insulation the plane hung above the sidewalk all night , but this morning workers pulled it inside with steel cables , then cut it up and removed it the building had no structural damage , and city officials said it would be open on monday to all but the most directly affected tenants while jetliner passengers get their shoes swabbed for explosives , the ease with which a determined 15yearold could crash a plane highlighted the very different security standards applied to the nation s general aviation system , as light planes and charter jets are known hanspeter tschupp , who owns a flight school a few doors from the national aviation school where the youth stole the plane , said almost all such schools allowed students to perform preflight checks on the tarmac without an instructor present of course , we wo n't be allowing that anymore , mr tschupp said from now on , our instructors stay with the students the whole time beyond the flight schools , however , most private planes are kept behind fences that are not secure at small airports they are easy to break into mr tschupp said many manufacturers make only a few different keys for all models and a terrorist would have little difficulty using a private plane as a weapon they 're easy to steal , and i have n't seen much increased security since sept 11 , said robert baron , an aviation safety instructor who runs a consulting firm in fort lauderdale , fla people really have no idea how vulnerable general aviation is right now the government clearly recognizes the potential threat , having shut down general aviation around large airports for three months after sept 11 , lifting the restrictions last month \( private flights near reagan national airport near washington are still banned \) but there have been few changes in security surrounding general aviation , and industry officials say none are necessary warren morningstar , vice president of the aircraft owners and pilots association , the nation s largest civil aviation organization , noted that the damage done by the light plane was small and said there had never been a case of such a plane used for a terrorist act in most general aviation accidents , you do n't even get a fire , he said of course there s a chance someone could do some damage , but you could say the same thing about a distraught individual who steals a bus or a truck he said smaller airports were already keeping a more watchful eye on people who fly and said many owners had begun securing their planes with items like propeller chains and throttle locks nonetheless , most small planes are not secured in any way , and the teenager s ability to penetrate the airspace of one of the nation s most critical military bases dramatized the damage that a terrorist with explosives might have inflicted on macdill the air force sent two f15 fighters from homestead air reserve base near miami about six minutes into the flight , but they arrived after the crash lt col rich mcclain , a spokesman for macdill , said he could not discuss why the fighters were sent from homestead instead of macdill he said the base had been informed by air traffic control of the bishop flight almost immediately , and did not consider it a threat if he had made some kind of threatening maneuver , we might have considered him a threat , he said law enforcement officials had no explanation of why the youth developed sympathy for osama bin laden , and they spent the day interviewing the youth s mother , julia bishop , at her apartment in palm harbor , north of st petersburg neighbors and school acquaintances in florida and massachusetts called charles bishop an only child who had lived most of his life with his mother and sometimes with his maternal grandmother , karen johnson , in the suburbs of boston and st petersburg none could recall a father schoolmates described him as an a student who made the honor rolls , liked his classes and was perhaps something of a teacher s pet he was interested in journalism and talked animatedly about airplanes , some classmates said some neighbors in norwell and winchester , mass , where the mother and son lived in the early 1990 s , remembered charles as a typical boy who rode a bicycle and had two dogs others recalled a sensitive boy impressed with a neighbor s garden he was quiet , polite , well spoken , even eloquent in expressing his feelings , some said others remembered him as sullen and introverted he did n't talk to anybody , said brit schunther , 15 , a neighbor in palm harbor he was a loner officials at national aviation said he had studied there since march , and had logged about six hours of flight time , occasionally doing chores like washing planes in exchange for more time in the air photos the

salt lake city , feb 21 four years are a very long time to wait particularly if you are 17 , as michelle kwan was in nagano in 1998 she cried when tara lipinski dashed out and took the gold , but kwan soon decided to try again in 2002 , and the next four years began last night it went bad all over again for kwan sixteenyearold sarah hughes , skating with joy and maturity and a nearly perfect arsenal of jumps , rushed confidently from fourth place and took the hearts of the crowd and forever claimed the title of goldmedal champion in the biggest single event of any winter games irina slutskaya of russia held on to second place while kwan , subdued but gracious afterward , took the bronze the evening was much like the one in nagano , four years ago in 1998 , kwan was the favorite going into the long program , but she came out lethargically , and spindly young lipinski came out jumping hughes appeared a bit too calm in the short program on tuesday , but last night she was radiant from the moment she took the ice , second in the final group of six nothing she did caused her to lose that glow she jumped and she spun and she stepped and she spiraled , and when it was over she smiled with a mixture of disbelief and pride oh , my gosh , it was amazing , hughes said just a roar i could n't hear my music you had to be here to believe it it was electric actually , around 16 , 000 people were there , but none of them was on the ice , and in that wonderful zone , the way sarah hughes was i skated for pure enjoyment , she said that s how i wanted my olympic moment to be she is a poised highschool junior from a solid family with five siblings from great neck , ny she lives at home and studies in the long car rides going across to her training site in new jersey and she reads the papers and she generally has a grip , as well as a sly urban sense of humor on the biggest night of her life , at least so far , she was bursting with good energy to go along with her athletic skill she comes by the moves from her father , john , now a tax lawyer , who was a hockey star at cornell and was later cut from the toronto maple leafs in his native canada the daughter had the competitiveness to skate hard , even though she started the night in fourth place i did n't think it was possible , after being fourth in the short , hughes said after kwan had stalled and slutskaya had skated an admirable program that would have won her the gold if the 16yearold long islander had not already seized the evening it is not mathematically easy for somebody in fourth place to move to first through the long program , but hughes was overpowering a few people with russian jackets clapped in the press section when kwan fell during her program , totally bad form the predominately american crowd cheered loudly for kwan , and cheered more than politely for slutskaya , but the fans knew they had seen a goldmedal level performance by the youngster the competition was under the specter of a lateafternoon threat from russia to pull its athletes out in protest over various perceived injustices in the judging and testing of athletes maybe the russian olympic officials were merely verbally banging their shoes on the table , a la nikita khrushchev at the united nations in 1960 , but as word spread last night , there could have been distractions for skating judges there could be issues for officials in the big usrussia semifinal men s hockey game scheduled for today there was also the threat of a south korean legal action over a controversial decision in speedskating wednesday night all this tumult came after the decision to award duplicate gold medals in the pairs of figure skating last week the olympics have gone litigious , big time kwan was ahead going into last night s long program but there were no guarantees , no ironclad prenuptial kind of deal that said she would automatically take first place just by skating serenely sometimes figure skating is akin to totally competitive sports things got more perilous for kwan in salt lake city with the crabby little squabble involving the canadian pair of jamie sal and david pelletier , and the latterday scheherezade , the woman who told a new story every day , now known forever as the french judge once that whole thing blew up , the judges gave signs of thinking for themselves , which made it highly dangerous for kwan , who skates smoothly but has trouble nailing two triple jumps in a row the judges were hearing about the proposed plan to go to a new scoring system that rewards jumps and plays down the scripted look any instability threatened kwan going into last night , but the judges' acknowledgment of hughes was a nobrainer it s not that there are not upsets in figure skating in 1988 , katarina witt was the favorite , and debi thomas showed up with something else on her mind love she crashed and burned within seconds and liz manley of canada whirled into the silver , and might even have taken the gold if the judges had not already chosen witt in their minds in 1992 , kristi yamaguchi just flatout won the gold in 1994 , nancy kerrigan of the united states skated beautifully , but then oksana baiul of ukraine skated with imperfect passion , and threw in some jumps at the end and won the gold baiul s triumph has been seen as a victory for spontaneity , but it may have reflected regional tastes in skating , if not outright geopolitical leanings these are still kicking around , as we can see four years ago , a youngster outperformed kwan when it mattered most kwan has insisted she did not come back merely to claim what was rightly hers she knew better than to make that statement but competitive skating was her life , and she continued on with it for another four years i heard the audience try to lift my spirits when they started clapping in the middle of the program , kwan said last night i made a few mistakes but i kept on going strong it just was n't meant to be tonight in some sports , tonight means just one night in the olympics , tonight really means four years , and that is a very long time to wait , and have another young skater take the prize away photos sarah hughes skated the cleanest and most technically difficult free program , jumping from fourth place to win the gold medal \( photographs by ruth fremson the new york times

prodigiously , prowled the british literary landscape in the last third of the 20th century , establishing a reputation for brutal criticism and elegiac , if minimalist , poetry he founded two influential literary journals and was an editor of the times literary supplement , among other publications but it was his pursuit of mr salinger that drew the most attention indeed , after a federal appellate court reversed a lower court and barred publication of j d salinger a writing life , mr hamilton reversed field and wrote another book with himself as a main character called in search of j d salinger \( random house , 1988 \) , it described his thwarted chase as a young man , mr hamilton had been deeply influenced by mr salinger s catcher in the rye and decided to follow his own highly praised 1982 biography of robert lowell jr with one on the reclusive mr salinger , who refused to cooperate , having long insisted that nobody should write his biography until he was dead mr hamilton nonetheless visited mr salinger s old neighborhoods , spoke with his old friends and found some unpublished letters from the author , many of which mr salinger had donated to university libraries those letters , quoted in the original manuscript without authorization , moved mr salinger to sue upon hearing that the letters were to be used in a biography , mr salinger copyrighted them but a judge in federal district court in manhattan , pierre n leval , ruled that mr hamilton s use of the letters was minimal and insubstantial calling the book a serious , wellresearched history of a man who through his own literary accomplishments has become a figure of enormous public interest , judge leval ruled that it could be distributed but an appeals court reversed the judge s ruling in 1987 , questioning whether mr hamilton s use of mr salinger s unpublished letters violated the spirit of the fair use standard a year later , the revised salinger book landed on the desk of jason epstein , mr hamilton s editor at random house mr hamilton called it a literary adventure story and proclaimed it better than the first it has a stronger plot and certainly a more riveting denouement , he said , and at the same time it raises key questions about the whole business of 'biography' what is it for , why do we write it , why do people want to read it and so on also , it tells you just as much

soho s legendary seaminess , that mr hamilton honed his welllubricated , sardonic humor one of his famous lines came after a young poet declined an alcoholic drink on the grounds that it tasted bad and made him feel bad well , none of us likes it , mr hamilton said he seldom published his own poems , but when he did , they were generally well received each individual poem is pruned back to an austere and beautiful knot of pain , michael hoffmann wrote in the london review of books in his review of mr hamilton s fifty poems \( faber faber , 1988 \) his poem awakening , from his book the

their community was created by cataclysm , then bound together by a vocabulary of grief and the stamp of history but a year later , the families of sept 11 a small city s worth of widows , parents and other kin touched by terror say that what defines them most is their sense of separation from other americans as a nation that wept together resumes its hectic , distracted course , family members and outsiders say , september s bereaved have become a lost legion , left to find their own way for joan parker , whose husband , philip , was working on the 99th floor at the world trade center on the morning of the attacks , the realization of that growing fissure began with a telephone call last fall the voice on the other end was one she had not heard in 25 years , since high school over the following weeks , mrs parker and her friend reconnected amid the sorrow and horror but then a different tone began to creep in the friend began to ask about money she started getting into questions about what kind of house i lived in and what kind of job my husband had , mrs parker said how much would the parkers collect from the charities and compensation funds \? was paying the families of the victims really a good idea \? mrs parker gradually became uncomfortable and stopped calling back then the calls themselves stopped and so , by increments , the gap widened who are the families , anyway \?

history provides only a flimsy guide like holocaust survivors , scholars say , many of the families bear intimate witness to evil like vietnam war veterans , they have clung to one another through the crisis , forging an identity but no one , least of all the family members themselves , knows where their road leads some experts in social movements compare them to canaries in a coal mine or messengers from the front vanguards of an emerging national conscience that will nag , wheedle and shame the nation on issues of terrorism and memory for generations to come or they could become just another special interest group carping for attention and money , their moral capital squandered the closest thing that i 've been able to think of and some people might feel it s an odd word is that they 've been blessed , in the old testament ecclesiastical sense , said kai erikson , a sociologist at yale university being blessed has sugary connotations now , professor erikson said , but to the ancient hebrews , it was a deeply ambivalent gift for better or worse , he said of the families , they 've been made different by this very peculiar thing that s happened to them generalizing about 10 , 000 to 15 , 000 turbulent souls and even more if extended relations and friends are counted is a dangerous thing some family members have forsaken contact , retreating into isolation some who leaped into action last fall have withdrawn , while others have begun to reach out in the last few months only a small vanguard is directly involved with political issues like a manhattan memorial most families have been silent , their stories still untold on many issues they are deeply divided , as are all americans but through more than 100 interviews over the last two months with family members , therapists , academics and politicians focusing on the relatives of the office workers , who constituted the vast majority of those killed some signposts to their journey have emerged women , responding differently than men to the maelstrom of media , politics and grief , stepped forward to lead , creating networks that solidified into a community backbone the internet became crucial , connecting people and allowing a virtual community to become real the myriad organizations that arose from lobbying groups to living room kaffeeklatsches of intimates who say they have bonded for life became vehicles for change , altering the participants by the very chemistry of bringing them together the rest of the nation has , of course , been down its own rocky road economic uncertainty , war and other echoes of terror , from anthrax to shoe bombs , have haunted american life , creating the sense for many people , social critics say , that sept 11 was a jinx , a triggering event for so many other things that have gone wrong moving on with life , head down , eyes forward in a real way , whistling past the graveyard has become , those experts say , an understandable and very human choice many family members , on the other hand , say they have been completely transformed some describe being seized and swept away , changed whether they wanted to be or not , by the very effort of trying to make sense of what had happened where mainstream america became unwilling to look back , the families could not look away maria ragonese thought last fall that she might drown in the pool of pain that surrounded her after the death of her sisterinlaw and friend , laura marie ragonesesnik
washington , jan 11 the white house office of homeland security has set off a storm inside the bush administration with a broad proposal to create an agency that would consolidate border security efforts now spread across the federal government according to a border security white paper produced late last month by aides to tom ridge , the director of homeland security , such an agency would be called a federal border administration it would take control of the coast guard , the customs service , the border enforcement functions of the immigration and naturalization service and the department of agriculture s agricultural quarantine inspection program our borders today are porous and highly vulnerable to penetration by foreign terrorists , says the paper proposing the government overhaul it goes on to note that almost a dozen federal agencies now bear responsibility for controlling the borders all of these agencies have other missions besides border security , so none has security as its core institutional purpose , the paper says , recommending a single accountable agency the proposal has sparked a fierce debate inside the bush administration and drawn resistance from an array of cabinet agencies , causing mr ridge to back off from an initial effort to get the agency consolidation into the president s new budget , officials said susan neely , a spokeswoman for mr ridge , the former governor of pennsylvania , said the governor is on record indicating that where there are more effective and efficient ways to secure our borders , it s something that we would be looking at we are definitely reviewing all the options but she said there was consensus that the white house needed more time to consider various ideas several officials said the proposal was still under consideration and could be submitted to congress this year an administration official opposed to the plan , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said ridge tried to push the plan through a group of cabinet agencies objected the official said the opponents represented a wide range of agencies , including the state , treasury , agriculture , justice and defense departments an array of similar proposals have been made in the past to reorganize border security more than 13 million people , 340 , 000 vehicles and 58 , 000 shipments are estimated to come into the united states each day but the efforts died because of inertia or bureaucratic resistance officials said that mr ridge began pushing the overhaul late last month the white paper produced by his staff argues that a consolidated agency would produce more unity and could mobilize rapidly the record of coordination and cooperation among the separate agencies with border security responsibilities has been problematic for years and remains mixed , the paper says but officials from a wide spectrum of cabinet agencies argued that the change would be too disruptive at the customs service , which is a part of the treasury department , reports of the proposal have circulated for weeks officials there are quick to point out that the agency was established in 1789 by the fifth act of the first congress the immigration and naturalization service falls under the purview of the justice department since sept 11 we have had very strong cooperation among border agencies and law enforcement generally , said susan dryden , a spokeswoman for the justice department , and we have found that working closely together in this shared responsibility is proving very effective in november , attorney general john ashcroft announced an overhaul of the immigration agency that would split into separate bureaus the agency s law enforcement operations and its services for immigrants the change was prompted by concerns that the agency was badly equipped to fight terrorism under the ridge proposal , the border enforcement work of the immigration and naturalization service , including the border patrol , would be moved into the new federal border administration the reorganization also has proponents representative william m thornberry , republican of texas , has introduced similar legislation under his plan the federal emergency management agency would be brought under the same roof as the coast guard , customs service and border patrol these agencies are a key part of homeland security , mr thornberry said i'm hopeful that the president will at least move in this direction in the new budget ivo h daalder of the brookings institution who served at the national security council under president bill clinton , said , it s good to have the different functions in different departments consolidated in a single agency he added , the real question is whether it s the right time to reorganize as you 're still thinking about the larger picture

rockville , md , jan 23 an independent panel of experts said today that there was insufficient evidence to show that mammograms prevented breast cancer deaths the group , which meets regularly to assess evidence on cancer and provide that information to doctors and to the public , said that while it was possible that mammograms were beneficial , it was also possible that they were not the group , called the pdq screening and prevention editorial board , agreed here today that seven large studies of mammography had serious flaws , weakening or casting doubt on the studies' validity the group , which writes information for the national cancer institute s online database , said that it would rewrite previous statements to reflect its new view previously , the group , which does not make specific recommendations for medical practices , had said that the evidence showed that mammograms prevented breast cancer deaths starting at age 40 the decision by this group clouds a continuing debate over whether women should have regular mammograms since 1997 , the national cancer institute has also recommended that women have regular mammograms , starting in their 40 s for now , the cancer institute , whose new director , dr andrew c von eschenbach , was sworn in on tuesday , has not announced any plans to revisit the issue , raising the question of whether the institute will end up with conflicting information on its web site , with one statement saying that the screening is beneficial and another saying that those benefits have not been proved the institute s web site , www cancer gov , says that women in their 40 s and older should have the test and that it reduces the breast cancer death rate by as much as 30 percent members of the pdq board said they knew that it was not going to be easy for women and doctors to decide what to do at the meeting , the members wrestled with the question of how much benefit , if any , mammograms confer some , like the board chairman , donald a berry , chairman of the department of biostatistics at m d anderson cancer center in houston , said they thought it was unlikely that there were benefits that could make the test worthwhile but others said that they were uncertain and that they were having a hard time coming to terms with the profound flaws they now saw in studies they had thought put mammograms on solid ground what this new material has contributed is a softening , at least in my mind , of what i thought was true , said dr isra levy of the canadian medical association i still think that for women aged 50 to 69 there might be something there but we 've had our confidence shaken in the end , the group decided not to deal with age , saying doubts persisted for women of all ages the group focused on flaws in the studies that were recently uncovered by two scientists in denmark the report , published in october by dr peter c gotzsche and ole olsen of the nordic cochrane center in copenhagen , concluded that the case for the screening was unproven the studies were so poorly designed and carried out that they might have found benefits when there were none or exaggerated what benefits there were , the researchers said none of the studies found that mammography prolonged life , and even when the studies were analyzed as a group , women who had the test lived no longer , dying of diseases other than breast cancer some experts have taken issue with dr gotzsche and mr olsen s analysis but today , the pdq board said it believed that the scientists had found serious problems the board s assessment of mammography is expected to be posted on the cancer institute s web site in april the pdq board said it would like to see others take on a detailed and independent analysis of the mammography studies and that some of the data that might settle questions about the quality of the studies could be obtained with difficulty some may be in medical records of women in a united states study decades ago others are held by swedish scientists who , the board and others said , have refused to divulge them the issue of whether women should have mammograms has been controversial for some time in january 1997 , when an independent panel convened by the national institutes of health took on the question of mammograms for women in their 40 s , congress got involved that panel said then that there was no evidence that the test prevented breast cancer deaths in women under 50 and suggested that those women discuss mammograms with their doctors before deciding to have one before the week was over , the panel s chairman , dr leon gordis of the johns hopkins university , had been summoned by senator arlen specter to testify before congress later , going against the conclusions of the panel convened at its behest , the cancer institute said women in their 40 s should have mammograms the pdq board , which issues its statements independently , has also said over the last several years that mammograms prevent breast cancer deaths for women in their 40 s today , the pdq board emphasized that mammograms have drawbacks , leading at times to excessive treatments for tumors that would not have threatened a woman s life the group agreed that doctors should respect a woman s decision , adding that it was rational to decide to have mammograms and that it was rational to decide not to whatever they decided , dr berry said in a telephone interview on tuesday that he was acutely aware of the difficulty in questioning an enormous mammography business screening programs bring in patients , dr berry said it is n't just the mammography , but it s the biopsies , the surgeries and the like we know that screening is exquisitely fine at finding cancers therefore it brings in patients and they demand treatment the problem , he said , is if the women who have mammograms fare no better , or do even worse because of excessive treatment , than women who are not screened
auckland , new zealand , nov 30 of all the hardworking america s cup team members here , none is as important to his syndicate as the 33yearold top gun luis saenz drawing on a lifetime of sailing experience , saenz puts in 18hour days , clawing for any advantage he can find over the other guys saenz , though , does n't grind winches , call tactics or helm a boat in fact , he hardly ever leaves shore he is dennis conner s lawyer as litigious sporting events go , nothing tops the america s cup that was made clear again this week when team dennis conner , routed on the water by a 40 loss to its american rival oneworld , filed a protest to have oneworld thrown out of the competition for stealing other teams' design secrets the case will be heard by an arbitration panel next weekend , and there is a chance , though slim , that oneworld will be tossed , and conner reinstated in the meantime , saenz , with occasional help from richard f scruggs , the wellknown mississippi tobacco lawyer , is studiously honing witness lists , filing briefs and sending the occasional threatening letter in hopes of scaring the competition back into its boatshed think of the florida elections scrum played out at a marina as saenz says , the america s cup is a legal battle that happens to be sailed on the water at least one of the moguls behind a cup team had no idea that this was what he was getting into craig mccaw , the cellular phone entrepreneur , who backs oneworld along with the microsoft cofounder paul allen , actually thought he was entering a friendly regatta he started his campaign in the name of the oceans and helping children with cancer mccaw is now financing a team of lawyers to go to war with saenz , who also happens to be the author of a 762page manual on using the rules to win sailboat races i was hopelessly na ve , mccaw said from seattle i was warned that this would happen , and i did n't believe it this is so much tougher there is so much more biting and scratching than anything i 've dealt with in business , that i 've been really stunned had i known that we 'd have had this , clearly i 'd not have become part of it told of mccaw s regrets , saenz could n't stifle a belly laugh i am glad , he said one of the reasons the america s cup is so great is because of the difficulty of the exercise you have to excel in all areas , from the technology , to the sailing , to the legal if you do n't , it s byebye whether the constant legal wrangling is the america s cup s saving grace or its achilles' heel , though , is an open question one of the basic requirements of any largescale spectator sport is that the fans should be able to understand it with more than 600 pages of regulations dating to the twopage , 151yearold deed of gift to the new york yacht club that established the competition the average america s cup syndicate needs four lawyers to interpret them the lawyers scurry around viaduct harbor here with all those rules in their palm pilots for easy access , one hand on the stylus , the other ready with a protest flag but , given the event s limitations , the legal brawls over the years have provided the only reliable source of tension the cup is usually a blowout the last two finals were won , 50 , and in fact only three have ever been close , the last in 1983 , when conner lost to the australians , 43 the racing takes place miles offshore , and to anyone who has watched so much as a dirt track race on espn , even the wrecks seem to be in slow motion larry ellison has said that if his oraclebmw team wins , he wants to bring the cup to san francisco bay , where spectators could watch from the golden gate bridge but ellison might want to talk to his four highsalaried rules advisers about that one according to the deed of gift , the race is to be sailed on ocean courses , free from headlands bruno troubl , the french sailor who started the louis vuitton cup challenger series 20 years ago , thinks all the lawyering does the america s cup no good it s bad for the newcomers , he said we have fully employed crews , fully employed lawyers why is the sport of sailing not ready to cope with professionalism \? for saenz , such questions are irrelevant i do n't know whether it s bad or good , he said it s inevitable the inevitability is due to the absence of a governing body for the america s cup there is no disinterested commissioner to put out fires whoever holds the cup calls the shots , and the challengers are left to fight among themselves , which they are happy to do the designers are always looking for a tiny advantage the sailors do the same on the water , said iain thain , a new zealand lawyer who works for oneworld the guys who check on the rules are doing the same any ambiguity is going to be challenged with 600 pages of rules , there is no shortage of ambiguity the protest against oneworld is a case in point the team is accused of using design secrets from the 2000 cup winner , new zealand , that it came upon after hiring laurie davidson , new zealand s former designer after a lengthy hospital stay for knee surgery , davidson showed up at oneworld a few weeks later with an armful of fresh hull designs , months of work dashed off in record time from memory , he says conner s team believes davidson had blueprints all along if not , the team argues , he may still have run afoul of the rule that says , in effect , no stealing from the other guy even if the other guy , in this case , is davidson himself but if davidson did n't clear his mental hard drive when he left team new zealand and drew a few hulls that looked a lot like the old ones , is that stealing \? this is exactly the kind of openended question lawyers love to argue it was n't supposed to happen this way anymore in 1988 , when conner sailed his 60foot catamaran against new zealand s monster 132foot monohull , the teams ended up in the new york courts , which eventually awarded the cup to conner after that fiasco , interested parties got together and created an international arbitration panel to settle all disputes and to keep the regatta moving nowadays , by signing up for the cup , teams promise they will not go to court but the arbitration panel may have had an unintended effect encouraging the complicated protests it was set up to resolve with a fivejudge panel at the ready , why not take on the competition off the water \? in the past , teams may have needed a lawyer to deal with such disputes now they need a small firm you might have the fastest boat and the best crew , thain said but without lawyers , you 'll never have a chance to go on the water to prove it besides that panel , there is also a race jury , which hears onthewater disputes in its bid to get oneworld booted , conner has petitioned both the panel and the jury the jury said it would hear the case , but only after the arbitration panel issued its decision the two bodies could come to different conclusions figure that one out , and you might consider sending a r sum to craig mccaw it may be that what the america s cup needs is the yachting equivalent of a flat tax , one simple rule that applies to everyone bring boat race it either that , or engines but in the meantime , the lawyers hold sway and , for his 75 million , mccaw is getting if not the auld mug itself at least an education it s a very highstakes game , he said and when there are high stakes , people in competition try to win any way they can the lesson now is be honorable at your own peril photo team dennis conner , right , raced oneworld last week while filing a protest to have it thrown out of the america s cup challenger series \( reuters \) \( pg 12 \)
foreign investors , who once joined with confident americans in a wave of spectacular acquisitions and business spending that helped power the 1990 s economic boom , are now turning cautious about the united states economy that is compounding the current weakness and making it harder to achieve a robust recovery from last year s recession with fresh acquisitions almost nil , foreign direct investment in the united states the technical name for acquiring a company or establishing one plummeted last year to 124 billion and started out this year at an even slower pace , the commerce department reports that is down from a peak of 301 billion in 2000 companies from abroad , after a big expansion here in the last two decades , now have a large enough presence in the american corporate sector to strengthen or weaken the economy by their behavior the hope among economists was that they would renew their spending this year , given all the expectations of a rapid recovery and the bargain prices at which many companies , particularly in the high technology sector , could be purchased but it has not happened foreigners were on the verge of investing again , until their confidence was upended by the corporate scandals and the slide in the stock market , said mark m zandi , the chief economist at economycom , a research firm and now they cannot get financing and their own economies back home are weakening the steep falloff in foreign direct investment to set up shop in the united states contributed to an even more critical decline in capital investment by foreigners to expand or reequip their operations here that spending is off 15 to 20 percent , according to estimates by joseph p quinlan , a global economist at morgan stanley , from its peak of 136 billion in 1999 the europeans in particular came headlong into the american market with spectacular acquisitions and huge capital outlays for expansions that have not paid off , mr quinlan said after that experience they are going to tiptoe back foreign companies did not just seek out existing american enterprises to take over they also put up new factories and offices and spent constantly to expand their operations here , rapidly increasing their contribution to the nation s economic growth europeans led the charge in the 1990 s but the japanese , despite a long period of stagnation at home , were not far behind no aspect of the american economy is more vital for the recovery than capital investment , which is the spending for new factories , machinery , computers , offices and all the other tools of production that contribute to economic expansion capital spending generates jobs and income as these tools of production are made and used such investments by foreigners have nearly doubled since 1986 as a percentage of total capital spending in the united states but now instead of bucking the tide , as the japanese often did in the 1980 s by outspending their american rivals most foreign companies are pulling back in step with their hosts and foreign companies seem even less likely these days to take chances than american companies battered by the collapse of the technology boom and the corporate scandals that makes the recovery tentative at best , mr zandi , the economist , said the random house division of bertelsmann , the german media giant , is entering a noinvestment mode it has spent 300 million on a headquarters building at broadway and west 56th street in manhattan that will be ready for occupancy in the fall , and 100 million on information technology and distribution center expansion and upgrades , including turning a warehouse in crawfordsville , ind , into a distribution center for children s books but once that is done , capital spending plans will be on hold we have what we need , said stuart applebaum , a random house spokesman the sony corporation , whose acquisitions of columbia pictures and cbs records in the 1980 s helped to stir a furor over what some american commentators described as the imperial ambitions of japan inc , is far less aggressive today with its home economy in recession , sony has slashed capital spending by 40 percent worldwide in the last two years and has closed 15 factories , two of them in the united states we are investing less here , greg dvorken , a sony official , said , adding hopefully , but more strategically to be sure , foreign companies are not simply pulling up stakes in the united states many are continuing to look for opportunities to invest in what they see as the most promising industries in kentucky , for example , where the state s economic development officials have been particularly successful in attracting new operations , foreign investment has fallen off less than that of american companies in 1999 , a peak year , 68 companies agreed to put manufacturing operations in kentucky , 10 of them foreign , mainly japanese and european in the last two years , kentucky has managed to attract fewer than 40 projects annually but the shrunken number still included seven or eight from abroad each year gene strong , a top official of the state s economic development agency , attributes that achievement in part to kentucky s strong role in carmaking
each year , the patent and trademark office publishes a report detailing how many patents it has awarded , tallying which countries earned the most and naming the corporations that made its top 10 but a series of the office s annual statistical reports , put together by its technology assessment and forecast branch , reveal some quirkier numbers , too last week , the agency updated those reports to include statistics through the end of 2001 , and made them available online at www uspto gov web offices ac ido oeip taf reportshtm a breakdown is offered of 2001 patents awarded in the 50 states , plus 73 granted to residents of the district of columbia , 12 in puerto rico , 3 in the united states virgin islands , 5 in guam , and a patent said to have no state indicated in the database inventors in 106 foreign countries and selfgoverning territories from estonia to french polynesia won patents as well none were in afghanistan california led the states with the most patents awarded to residents last year , followed by new york , texas , new jersey , illinois and michigan looking at metropolitan areas , the latest figures available are for 1999 , and not surprisingly , they show the highest concentrations of patents in the silicon valley area surrounding san jose \( 5 , 664 patents \) and in the technology corridor around boston \( 3 , 806 \) laredo , tex , and gadsden , ala , close the list with zeroes \( laredo had three in 1998 gadsden , one \) those figures refer to geography , not citizenship foreignborn , noncitizen residents of the united states earned nearly half of all patents awarded to applicants listing an american address last year most of them japanese , german or taiwanese inventors the report also shows that among the 10 most prolific individual inventors from 1988 to 1997 \( the most recent data available the patent office says it is updated irregularly \) , two are americans \( one in illinois and one in new jersey \) , two are japanese and six are germans turning to the types of patents awarded , the report found geographic patterns , many reflecting the concentration of industries in specific areas in metropolitan washington , for example , hundreds of patents were awarded from 1995 to 1999 for telecommunications , biotechnology , optics and digital processing inventions , reflecting the large number of research and technology companies there the proximity of the pentagon probably explains the region s 23 patents for ordnance , 32 for ammunition and explosives and 16 for firearms but other trends are less obvious over the same five years , 76 patents were awarded for distillation processes in rural montana curiously , two categories of patents seem to pop up in almost every state and in urban and rural areas alike class 043 , for fishing , trapping and vermin destroying inventions , and class 473 , games using tangible projectiles only three universities held more than 1 , 000 patents at the end of 1999 the university of california \( 2 , 768 \) , the massachusetts institute of technology \( 2 , 151 \) and the university of texas \( 1 , 007 \) a handful of others had from 500 to 1 , 000 a chart of patent statistics since 1790 lists only 3 patents issued that first year , but then a leap to 33 in 1791 the annual figure did not exceed 100 until 1807 , but by 1809 it was more than 200 no one overseas was awarded an american patent until 1836 , when 702 went to united states residents and 8 to others not until 1840 did the government begin keeping tallies of applications as well as awards that year , there were 735 patent applications , 458 of them granted the number of applications surpassed 1 , 000 for the first time in 1854 just two years later , there were more than 2 , 000 the new report also includes the more usual results of the agency s work that it publishes every year last week s update includes figures for 2001 the patent and trademark office awarded 183 , 981 patents last year slightly more than half went to united states resident applicants \( 98 , 594 , or 54 percent \) and the rest to foreigners \( 85 , 387 , or 46 percent \) those totals include plant , design , and utility patents the ones that cover chemical , electrical and mechanical inventions awarded to corporations , governments and individuals as in every recent year , the great majority of last year s patents were awarded to corporations and organizations americans won 74 , 327 of these , or 45 percent of the total awarded , and 15 , 205 individual patents , of 9 percent , also went to americans some 957 patents , 1 percent of the total , were awarded to the federal government itself foreign corporations won 68 , 942 patents \( 42 percent of the total \) and foreign individual inventors received 6 , 516 \( 4 percent \) foreign governments were awarded 92 patents japan was by far the leading country of residence for foreign patent winners , with 34 , 891 , onefifth of all patents awarded germany was a distant second with 11 , 894 and taiwan third with 6 , 544 rounding out the top 10 in descending order were france , britain , canada , south korea , italy , sweden and switzerland and the report would not be complete without the agency s annual list of companies winning the most utility patents japanese companies dominated again in 2001 , with seven of the top 10

atlanta it s baseball s enduring embarrassment turner field s empty seats here again are the atlanta braves , kings of all they survey in whatever division they 've been in for 11 seasons , swaying to the chant of the tomahawk chop in october , but here again are all those empty blue seats on the far slopes of turner field more than 8 , 000 seats were empty during wednesday s matinee opener of the braves' national league division series with the san francisco giants that resumed last night with another nonsellout , with nearly 3 , 000 empty seats as the braves won , 73 backtoback homers by javy lopez and vinny castilla in the second inning triggered the braves' victory that evened the threeoffivegame series at 11 the series moves to san francisco for games tomorrow and sunday great tickets are available for game 5 , the message board blinked , alluding to monday s possible showdown contact the braves box office turner field has 50 , 091 seats , but through wednesday s matinee , of the 24 postseason games there since it opened in 1997 , only six were sellouts , including the first two games of the 1999 world series that the yankees swept the situation is embarrassing enough for the atlanta journalconstitution to ask in a frontpage headline wednesday does atlanta care about the braves \? one answer seems to be that while many atlantans surely care , some do n't care enough to buy tickets for a division series , the first tier of the playoffs they 're saving their money until the braves advance to the more meaningful nl championship series or the world series another answer seems to be that some atlantans have lost faith in the braves to reach the world series , much less win it and those atlantans are not about to buy tickets to see a team that might disappoint them again for all their 11 consecutive division titles , the braves have gone on to win only one of their five world series , in 1995 against the cleveland indians they lost to the minnesota twins in 1991 , the toronto blue jays in 1992 , the yankees in 1996 after returning to atlanta with a 20 lead , and the yankees again in 1999 in that fourgame sweep that adds up to only one world series appearance in the last five seasons , and none in the last two the braves have also lost eight consecutive series games , all to the yankees , including the first two at turner field in 1999 and the middle three at the nowleveled atlantafulton county stadium in 1996 no wonder some atlantans have lost faith if atlanta had won more than just one world series or was n't on an eightgame series losing streak , maybe all those empty seats in turner field would be filled for every postseason game , as they are in yankee stadium at yankee stadium , recent history is compelling four world series victories in five seasons before last year s sudden series loss in the ninth inning of game 7 that history fosters faith for every division , league championship or world series game , the stadium is assured of being stuffed with a soldout gathering of the faithful those sellouts also generate the electricity that so often surges through a yankee comeback in the late innings as it did in tuesday night s 85 victory over anaheim in their division series opener although the braves have always had sellout crowds for their world series games , those empty seats in the league playoffs raise another question do they deflate what should be the braves' homefield advantage \? john schuerholz , the braves' general manager , has conceded that the level of excitement is n't as high as it was a decade ago when tom glavine , john smoltz and the tomahawk chop were young those chanting sellout crowds at atlantafulton county stadium sometimes spooked opposing teams but the chant and the waving of red foamrubber tomahawks is old stuff now and with all those empty blue seats up there in the terrace and pavilion levels in right field and left field , the atmosphere is just not as intimidating as the braves cruised to the nl east title by 19 games , they drew only 26 million \( a drop of 220 , 010 \) , eighth among the nl s 16 teams and 13th among the majors' 30 teams regarding this week s empty seats , the braves like to think they 've been too good for their own good but maybe it s really that lately , they just have n't been good enough photo atlanta crowds have been less intimidating \( associated press \)
tulia , tex the table at the church of the holy spirit is lined with casseroles and bowls of fresh fruit as the new priest , the rev scott raef , loads his plate under watchful eyes his arrival has brought joy and relief , and also a little teasing from his new parishioners , who are eager to fatten up his slender frame more than two months earlier , in a potluck supper in this same hall , some people had little appetite as they bid an abrupt and unexpected farewell to the previous pastor , the rev john salazarjimenez only later did they learn that father salazarjimenez had once been in a california prison for sexually abusing two altar boys his secret had lasted 11 years nor was father salazarjimenez alone if boston is the fault line of the child sexualabuse scandal that has convulsed the roman catholic church , then few places have felt the aftershocks more deeply than the diocese of amarillo eight priests in the diocese have retired or resigned in recent months because of past incidents that diocesan officials say violated the new zero tolerance policy for priests who have sexually abused minors a ninth is leaving the priesthood for personal reasons the sudden loss of so many priests has devastated this diocese in the texas panhandle parishioners are shocked and angry , but also conflicted , since the priests committed their offenses years ago , in other dioceses , and apparently never acted out again the bishop and his predecessor , meanwhile , are trying to justify why the diocese had recruited and maintained so many priests with troubled histories , including at least five who were hired directly from a treatment center for sexual abusers the most immediate problem , though , is a practical one there are no longer enough priests we are pretty hard hit here in amarillo , said bishop john w yanta , who in august instituted a sweeping reassignment of priests and deacons in response to the manpower shortage it has affected us greatly because of the small number of priests that we have at full strength , the diocese has only about 41 active priests father raef , for one , has four jobs now he is the pastor in tulia and in an affiliated church in nearby kress he has kept his previous job as pastor of the catholic student center at west texas am university in canyon , about 30 miles away he is also head of youth services for the diocese , with an office in amarillo , about 70 miles away earlier this summer he filled in at so many parishes that he lost his bearings for a minute , i could n't remember where i was , he recalled of one particular june evening i thought , 'what town am i in \? ' i thought , 'oh my goodness , this is the rest of my life , riding the circuit' father raef now celebrates fives masses every weekend in three towns and , as he puts it , in three languages english , spanish and college on a recent 188mile , 14hour day , he spent two hours in canyon preparing for the arrival of west texas am students , returned to tulia for a service with bishop yanta , ate a chicken wrap sandwich in his car as he drove to amarillo to finish paperwork in the diocese youth office , then returned to tulia for an evening mass and the potluck supper the night before father raef had attended his first meeting with his parish council , the advisory board of lay members for the tulia church one of the first questions asked , how much will you be around \? he answered , that s a good question that i have no answer for my head is spinning on a lot of things , so i ask for your generosity of spirit , he told the parish council even before the current scandal and controversy , it was never easy to be a catholic in this overwhelmingly protestant region of ranching and farming newcomers to small farming towns in the area are often first asked their names , then their church affiliations the amarillo diocese , which covers about 26 , 000 square miles , is geographically large but actually ranks among the smallest in the country in numbers of parishioners , with about 56 , 000 what you have to understand about the catholic church here is we are very much a minority and we know it every day of our lives , father raef said he recently became so frustrated with what he viewed as the anticatholic tone of a local talk radio host that he called the show , only to be told that the public considered anyone wearing a collar to be a possible child molester he decided not to call again in the panhandle , it is hard enough to put this on and wear it every day , he said , tugging at his collar , as he drove from tulia to the student center in canyon now , it s excruciating but i'm more convinced than ever that i need to put my collar on every day the first inkling that the abuse scandal would resonate here came in late may , when father salazarjimenez announced his resignation he was a beloved figure , credited with transforming the church of the holy spirit by overseeing construction of a new church building , rectory and teaching center at least one lay member named him as godfather to his son
shea stadium , the aging home of the mets , requires at least 11 million in structural , electrical , mechanical and plumbing repairs , according to a city engineering report the report , which was prepared in march for the city s department of design and construction , said that a wide range of repairs needed to be made in time for safe occupancy by the public for the 2002 baseball season , which began in april the 38yearold concrete and steel ballpark is in generally good condition , the report said , but it is showing its age , with corroding and cracked concrete walls and ramps , leaks , loose wiring , sagging ceilings , overloaded electrical systems , rusted centerfield bleacher supports and dim exterior lighting of particular concern is the extensive cracking of the supports for the field seats , and the rusting in the reinforcements for those supports noting the corrosion of supports to thirdbase seating , the report said , the steel under both sets of fixed seats has in all probability never been painted since the time of construction , in 1964 the lighting and field seat repairs are expected to begin in july the report , which was first detailed yesterday by the daily news , is issued as part of the annual inspections at shea and yankee stadiums they are owned by the city , which is responsible for repairs and capital improvements the effort to fix problems before conditions become dangerous took on greater urgency four years ago , when a 500pound slab of steel crashed into the empty upper deck at yankee stadium mayor michael r bloomberg said yesterday that none of the conditions were dangerous you have to remember just how many people go through shea stadium in the course of a year , he said it s a phenomenally wellused facility and it has its normal wear and tear according to the report , some repairs scheduled for past years have been deferred and not all the repairs called for in the report will be budgeted for the 2003 fiscal year , which begins in july the city s need to keep shea and yankee stadiums safe and functional has become even more important since mayor bloomberg chose not to embrace a plan to build new stadiums negotiated by the man he succeeded , rudolph w giuliani dave howard , a senior vice president of the mets , said naturally , we 're the tenant and we want things done immediately we have an ongoing dialogue with the parks department because they are responsible for maintenance and capital repairs we have to make sure the stadium is up to the standards of the lease he said there were no hazardous conditions at the stadium , but he would not say which of the needed repairs were the most urgent stv inc , a manhattan engineering firm that prepared the report , cited 16 items that require immediate corrective action , including the poor lighting that rings the stadium and barely helps fans navigate in the evening , and buckling asphalt on the exterior of the stadium the installation of new supports under the field boxes and the replacement of the center field stands were listed as lesser priorities stv also said that when it inspected the stadium in november , nearly 100 uncovered carbon dioxide tanks that had been there since 1999 were found at street level the report did not say what the carbon dioxide was used for at shea , nor did it specify the danger the tanks posed stv also said the stadium needed to provide the handicapped with access to toilets , as federal law requires a memo by surtreat northeast , a company that treats corroded concrete , that was included in the report said , it was explained to us that shea stadium needed a program for extending the service life for another 10 to 15 years , this being the result of monetary spending shifts from stadiums to the ground zero rebuilding the memo also said , every ramp and every section of every ramp has evidence of corrosion it added that the field seats , where the supports showed huge cracks , needed repairs urgently patchwork done in the past did nothing to arrest the corrosion , according to the memo it recommended treating 268 , 545 square feet of rotted and corroded concrete throughout the stadium
the sign at the entrance to the upper east side parking garage says no bentleys , ferraris or rollsroyces but gov george e pataki s black suv would certainly be welcome the garage , at a luxury apartment building on york avenue , is one of a dozen commonly owned lots in manhattan that have donated money to the governor s reelection campaign that might seem strange parking garages supporting a political candidate but it is just one of many creative techniques devised by the highest rollers in the state s campaign finance game to legally circumvent laws that limit how much any person or corporation can give to , and presumably influence , governor pataki in the case of the parking garages in manhattan , the contributions to the governor were all sent from the same address 1200 union turnpike in new hyde park , the office of leonard litwin , principal at glenwood management corporation , which owns at least 15 manhattan highrise apartment buildings and garages state law prohibits corporations from contributing more than 5 , 000 a year , and it limits individuals to 40 , 500 in donations to mr pataki over the fouryear election cycle so mr litwin donated 5 , 000 through each of 12 different east side parking garages , adding up to a perfectly legal total of 75 , 000 over the last two years and that is just the start of a list of the checks to mr pataki s campaign sent from mr litwin s office all together , they total at least 143 , 000 a review of state campaign finance records turned up dozens of cases in which major donors to mr pataki used multiple corporate entities to give amounts far greater than the limits imposed by state law on corporations or individuals other donors legally surpassed such limits by giving tens of thousands of dollars to mr pataki in virginia , where the governor has set up two political action committees , one of which has no cap under that state s laws donations from just the top 20 of these creative givers total 24 million during the current election cycle , according to an examination of campaign finance records by the new york times the total does not include an additional 13 million that these same 20 donors have given to state and city republican parties that are also spending money to support the governor s campaign , the records show the 37 million is nearly twice the amount that mr pataki s democratic opponent , h carl mccall , had in the bank at the end of september the list of repeat givers includes names from the financial and real estate worlds douglas durst , who has a portolio of manhattan office buildings , has donated 306 , 500 to mr pataki personally and through 32 entities with names as varied as 733 properties inc , 675 associates llc and eastern pork products llc the top executive of another company , vornado realty trust , has sent mr pataki s campaign 145 , 700 from shopping malls he controls along the east coast , campaign finance records also show the general public might think there are limits and people are abiding by them , said sue o'connell , a spokeswoman for the national institute on money in state politics but in this case , the limits are essentially meaningless , when you can get around them like that mr litwin declined to comment on his donations , which generally were sent in batches of three or four on the same day but other repeat givers said that as long as the loopholes exist , they might as well take advantage of them it is a cost of doing business , said richard lefrak , president of the lefrak organization , which controls more than 60 , 000 apartments in the new york area and which sent at least 90 , 000 this year to mr pataki and his causes under a variety of different corporate names i would much rather have strict campaign limits and no soft money mr mccall , like the governor , has collected dual checks from a large number of husbandandwife supporters \( donating money in a spouse s name is a favorite technique to legally circumvent contribution limits \) mr mccall , who has served two terms as state comptroller , has also received batches of donations from multiple partners at law firms that handle shareholder suits for the state pension funds but the coordinated donations to mr mccall , in numbers and size , do not come close to those delivered to mr pataki , a review of the campaign finance records suggests michael mckeon , a spokesman for mr pataki , said he assumed the governor s campaign staff realized that it was getting repeated contributions from organizations with a common owner we are going to play by the rules , as they exist , he said those who give repeatedly to mr pataki through the loopholes fall into two basic groups extremely wealthy business executives , like henry r kravis , ronald o perelman and finn m w caspersen and people who run companies that have extremely valuable contracts or other business affairs with the state to be sure , the state s rules are complicated with the corporate limit at 5 , 000 a year and the individual cap at 40 , 500 during the fouryear election cycle , a chief executive of a corporation should be able to direct no more than 60 , 500 to a candidate for governor , assuming the company does not have its own political action committee through which it can give yet more that 60 , 500 already is many times more than the federal government or any of the other states that have campaign contribution limits allow

a scene that perfectly illustrated a gifford miller s approach to politics unfolded two years ago outside a brooklyn elementary school there he was , a councilman from manhattan s upper east side , handing out campaign literature for an entire morning for roger l green , an assemblyman from fort greene it was not immediately clear why the councilman from the city s most affluent section would travel a borough away to campaign for an assemblyman in a predominantly black , middleclass neighborhood so he was asked oh , i'm just here to support my friends , he said , smiling now , mr miller s friends have made him the allbutanointed successor to peter f vallone , the outgoing city council speaker , and the second most powerful person in city government his ascension capped several years in which he not only supported political friends but also traveled to every sector of new york city s five boroughs to acquire them the political network he assembled , many of his past and current colleagues in the council say , was the result of tireless and tenacious work mr miller , 32 , has developed a reputation as a nonstop worker with a razorsharp mind he is said to have wanted the post of speaker virtually since the day he came to the council in a special election in 1996 and to have worked diligently and widely , but always cordially , to get it gifford is a very serious young man , said kenneth k fisher , a former councilman who was pushed out by term limits at the end of december he has been working on this since it became apparent that term limits were not going away and it has worked out for him he has been catapulted out of upper east side politics to become a citywide player mr miller s hunt for political friends took many forms he established a political club called council 2001 and set out to meet , endorse and make financial contributions to candidates for various offices from woodside , queens , to east new york , brooklyn , and the north shore of staten island most of the candidates who were supported by mr miller won their races and , while none said that mr miller asked for votes in exchange , each conceded that mr miller s endorsement led to warm relationships and friendships in the end , the advantage mr miller had over other contenders for speaker , city council members say , was that he had so many friends in the council and few , if any , enemies mr miller s political travels through the city also helped him to overcome a major criticism that had been attached to him many people considered him to be too tied to manhattan , that his world view did n't extend beyond the upper east side , said a former city council member who worked with mr miller he was viewed largely as someone who had lived a sheltered life but the last two years of campaigning broadened him quite a bit it showed him that there were real people with real problems outside of manhattan mr miller acknowledges that he has wanted to be council speaker for some time the opportunity to serve as speaker provides a forum for making a significant contribution to this city , he said and i love this city alan gifford miller was born on nov 6 , 1969 , on the upper east side into a household where politics was often discussed at the dinner table his father , leigh m miller , retired as the president of the export credit division of american express in manhattan his mother , lynden b miller , is a public garden designer , who was the designer of the gardens in bryant park and oversaw the redesign of the conservatory garden in central park in 1982 he is known to talk incessantly about his wife of nearly three years , pamela , a lawyer at arnold porter , and their 15monthold son , addison after graduating from princeton in 1992 , mr miller went to work in the washington office of representative carolyn b maloney as a receptionist he started at the lowest level and moved up , representative maloney said within a three years , he was her chief of staff in her congressional office in manhattan when councilman charles millard , a republican , resigned , mr miller , a democrat , ran in a special election in 1996 he won with 57 percent of the vote in a race against an aide to mr millard and became , at 26 , one of the youngest people ever elected to the council on the council , mr miller became known as an ambitious colleague who was friendly , collegial and studious and , mr vallone said , he knows exactly what it takes to build a consensus

midway , utah , feb 15 the ice cracked , seismically shifting with each footstep a burly young man in bib overalls marched across the frozen lake to assure visitors that they would not fall through and die not this time , anyway now last year , when we was fishing , the thickest the ice got was three , four inches , jared pugh , the burly marcher , said as his cousin jake bateman nodded we 're both 260 pounds and when we started walking across it , the ice started to bow we got about 20 yards apart real quick i was nervous this winter , you got 12 inches of ice at least just be careful near the shore ice fishing requires a steady hand , patience , skill and hours of perseverance an extra layer of insulation around the midsection can help , too since the paleolithic era , dipping a pole into arcticcold water has been a winter pastime , which sort of raises the question if skeleton and ice dancing make the olympic cut , what about angling beneath a frozen lake \? not today , said pugh , who had gone almost four hours without a bite on deer creek lake bateman nodded a few hundred yards up the road , the bestconditioned winter games athletes waxed their crosscountry skis , cleaned their biathlon rifles and made sure their iridescent spandex fit snugly downstream , following the cold provo river into snowcovered deer creek lake , pugh and bateman had their own equipment a handoperated ice auger , rods and reels , goldplated lures , nightcrawlers , a 6pound test line and a black canvas shanty , in case the winds curled up something fierce if we had to choose between a biathlon ticket or a bunch of fish on the fish finder , we 'd probably still be here fishing , pugh said nothing against the olympics , this is just more important to us bateman nodded , yep deer creek lake is situated between two of the five major olympic competition sites , the soldier hollow ski area a quartermile away and the hockey arena in provo , about 20 miles south three miles west of the quaint mountain town of heber city , the lake is tucked beneath the nearly 12 , 000foot mount timpanogos in its resplendent , cloudy white majesty , the summit could pass for the himalayas when the cousins found out the olympic winter games were coming to their small corner of the world , they feared the worst an outdoorsmen s paradise overrun with security officers , pintrading tourists and , worse , the chichi park city crowd never mind the traffic jams and the salt lake olympic committee personnel rearranging their tackle boxes during a security check , pugh and bateman did not want their hometown , lehi \( population 16 , 878 \) , and the surrounding area invaded by developers eyeing land that s a pretty nice hill , bateman said , pointing to the snowcovered wasatch range behind him and we already got some people not from here complaining about deer and elk how they come down and eat their bushes and their plants they need to realize that s their home , too i was n't for the olympics when i first heard about it then something peculiar happened the crowds never made it past soldier hollow no one bothered pugh and bateman they heard about a sniper rifle found behind a ridge but other than the black hawk helicopters whirring above , that was it if you was n't within 5 or 10 miles of a venue , you would n't know what was going on unless you turn on the tv , pugh said he was asked what he thought of the latest figure skating news it s too bad they did n't give it to that canadian pair , he said told the canadians had been awarded a duplicate gold medal , pugh said , i have n't been near tv or anything today bateman grabbed a mealworm , threaded the hook of his golden kastmaster lure through its body and dipped his line in the water he jerked the line slowly this is called jigging and waited for a nibble nothing , unless you count pugh s 4monthold chocolate labrador retriever , kiko , jostling the tips of the rods as she licked the cousins it s her first fishing trip , pugh said today , the cousins are fishing for trout , perch or walleye if they are lucky , they will catch a beautiful fat and healthy rainbow between 15 and 18 inches , dust it with flour and lemon pepper and saut it bateman , 21 , is a diesel mechanic pugh , 22 , works for a boat dealership they both live with their parents , who the men say are happy to have them at home we 're going to live there until we 're dead , kicked out or married , bateman said isolated from much of the olympics , the cousins have found something in the winter games that they never thought was possible six months ago at first , they kept lecturing us on the news about being nice to people , do n't get road rage , that kind of stuff , pugh said it got old but he and bateman respect the athleticism of the crosscountry skiers bateman actually went to watch women s snowboarding on thursday i was n't crazy about the idea at first , but i had a great time , he said i'm thinking i 've got to get down to the medals plaza this week and see some more pugh saw the men s figure skating final on television thursday night , cheering for russia s aleksei yagudin , the gold medalist it was awesome , he said that gentleman that won it , oh , he deserved it the cousins make small talk about the fact that none of the televised outdoor shows dedicate segments to ice fishing those boys 'd freeze , pugh said they look across the eightmilelong frozen lake , marveling at the landscape a couple of hundred yards down from the soldier hollow course where the olympians compete their rods fail to budge usually , jake 'll catch the first fish , pugh said i'm a slow starter usually i end up catching more fish than he does it s just kind of a known fact , i guess bateman looked up , but he did n't nod photo jared

hanover , germany , sept 4 following are excerpts from an interview with chancellor gerhard schr der of germany , reflecting on events since sept 11 the interview was conducted in german and translated by the new york times q did sept 11 really change the world , or is that just an american way of looking at it \? a first of all , it is understandable that the reaction in america , which for the first time was attacked on its own territory , was more intense than in the rest of the world but it was also interesting for me to observe how much it affected the germans , for example , and others as well the large demonstration in berlin by 200 , 000 or 300 , 000 people was in fact a spontaneous expression of sympathy and solidarity and i also experienced it much closer to home if i may be permitted to say so since my wife had once lived not far away , on the upper west side i believe it not only changed america , but also the world , in two ways first , it was astounding how fast and how impressively this international coalition came into being one said that the offer of support was a selfevident duty as a friend and germany agreed to break with tradition in deploying military forces outside europe but that is only one side of it i think the other side is that changes have taken place because the analysis of the threat had to be changed that is to say , in the past , countries or alliances felt themselves threatened by other countries or alliances that was , after all , the classic confrontation in the cold war what happened in new york and washington this attack on the two cities and on the people in them has shown that there is a privatized form of war , waged by terrorist organizations , and that we have to defend ourselves against this using appropriate means , including military means so i believe two things have changed first there is the question who is threatening the civilized world \? not only countries , but also forms of privatized violence that never used to exist in this form and the second remarkable thing is the unity at the united nations , rallying an international coalition against terror it is important to keep the awareness of both alive i asked myself why the attack on new york affected so many people in the world in such a special way i think the answer has to do with the special importance that this city has always had for all those who were forced to or wanted to leave their own country new york is thus a symbol of asylum this was very much the case during the nazi period in germany q your new defense minister , peter struck , said there was no threat to germany from saddam hussein , and condi rice , of course , said the whole world was threatened a i think the truth lies somewhere in the middle there is no question that dictators represent a threat and the crucial question is what can they do and what would they like to do to realize their threats \? the problem with saddam is making up our minds what scope for political and military action he has politically , he has none , unless one forces the arab world into solidarity with him militarily , i believe it is hard to judge in my view , the threat may be overestimated by people like ms rice , and underestimated by others that is why i was one of those who were disappointed that a change of objectives took place as regards the treatment of saddam hussein i think that we all of us , together had isolated him politically , and that there was a real opportunity of using diplomatic and economic pressure to get the inspectors admitted to the country again the moment the debate in the united states put an end to the objective of exerting every possible kind of pressure to get the inspectors readmitted to the country so that we could discover what the real situation was , and not have to rely on surmises or intelligence reports the moment this objective was changed , the real problem began how can you exert pressure on someone by saying to them even if you accede to our demands , we will destroy you \? i think that was a change of strategy in the united states whatever the explanation may be a change that made things difficult for others , including ourselves that is one thing the other thing is consultations in the past it was always said before we do anything , we will consult with our principal allies at least with those who take an active , very active part in the fight against international terrorism but consultation cannot mean that i get a phone call two hours in advance only to be told , we 're going in consultation among grownup nations has to mean not just consultation about the how and the when , but also about the whether q do you believe that cheney speaks for president bush \? a i am not qualified to say the problem is that he has or seems to have committed himself so strongly that it is hard to imagine how he can climb down and that is the real problem , that not only i have , but that all of us in europe have i think that a mistake has been made it may be understandable in terms of domestic politics , but it has , of course , made things much more difficult for all those who were in agreement with the original objective of exerting pressure to have the inspectors admitted to the country
rome , april 20 pope john paul ii extensively addressed sex scandals involving priests today , ordering bishops to diligently investigate accusations against those who break their vows of celibacy and chiding any who might see the priesthood as an easy life the pope did not single out the american church in today s remarks , which were directed to a group of visiting nigerian bishops , who have also grappled with scandals involving sexual misconduct by priests but the remarks were his most direct on the subject since the sex abuse scandal began convulsing the church in the united states the comments amounted to a forceful affirmation of the vatican s call for renewed discipline and moral rigor in the priesthood , and were made just a day before american cardinals were to start arriving here for meetings on tuesday and wednesday to discuss clerical sex abuse cardinal roger m mahony of los angeles said this week that he planned to raise the issue of whether priests should be allowed to marry but the pope made clear today , as he has in the past , that celibacy is not up for discussion , either during the meetings or at any other time the value of celibacy as a complete gift of self to the lord and his church must be carefully safeguarded , he said the life of chastity , poverty and obedience willingly embraced and faithfully lived confutes the conventional wisdom of the world and challenges the commonly accepted vision of life several american cardinals have spoken out on the abuse issue in recent days , acknowledging that they are on a mission to restore their credibility and bolster their moral leadership , though none but cardinal mahony have addressed doctrinal issues page 30 on the eve of his departure for rome , cardinal edward m egan of new york issued a letter to be read this weekend in parishes throughout the archdiocese in it , he acknowledges for the first time that mistakes may have been made in the handling of sexual abuse cases in new york and in bridgeport , conn , when he served as bishop there page 31 some vatican officials have also said celibacy should be discussed at the meetings , but only in the sense that the reasons for and roots of clerical celibacy should be better communicated to seminarians as part of their training the pope also told bishops that they should address accusations of misconduct aggressively behavior which might give scandal must be carefully avoided , he said , and you yourselves must diligently investigate accusations of any such behavior , taking firm steps to correct it where it is found to exist in what apparently was an answer to criticism that the scandals have been worsened by the tendency of church leaders to keep problems quiet , the pope suggested today that the church should strive to be more open it is of the utmost importance that openness , honesty and transparency should always be the hallmark of everything that the church does , he said the pope indicated , too , that a new emphasis on seminary training was necessary in addressing problems seminary formation is very important , he said , for the convictions and practical training imparted to future priests are essential for the success of the church s mission as true fathers , then , the spiritual renewal and growth of your priests must be among your top priorities , he said in unusually direct language , the pope warned priests that their lives were not supposed to be easy the priesthood must never be seen as a means for improving one s lot in life or in terms of gaining prestige , he said many at the vatican see the sex abuse scandals as a result of morally lax attitudes , and say some priests need to be reminded that they are called to live in austerity the pope took up that theme when he said priests and candidates for the priesthood often live at a level both materially and educationally superior to that of their families and the members of their own age group it is therefore very easy for them to succumb to the temptation of thinking of themselves as better than others when this happens , he told the bishops , the ideal of priestly service and selfgiving dedication can fade , leaving the priest dissatisfied and disheartened he said priests must instead imitate christ s complete selfgiving for the sake of the flock and the advancement of the kingdom he weighed in far less directly on the sex abuse issue a month ago , in a preeaster letter to priests in which he said a dark shadow of suspicion had been cast over all priests by some of our brothers who have betrayed the grace of ordination and succumbed to evil a week later , he referred to the subject even more delicately , in a homily at st peter s we pray for those priestly brothers of ours who have not lived up to the commitments they made when they were ordained , or who are going through a period of difficulty and crisis george weigel , the pope s american biographer , saw today s remarks as part of an ongoing theme of this pontificate that has obviously reached a new level of urgency in light of the scandals in his speech to the bishops , the pope also addressed several problems facing the african church , telling the bishops to investigate ways of making the church s participation in the battle against aids ever more active and visible and to dialogue with the followers of african traditional religion and with islam he told nigerian catholics to stand up against islamic fundamentalists i must also raise an important issue which i know is a source of grave concern to you and your people , he said there are certain parts of the country where proponents of islam are acting with ever greater militancy , even to the point of imposing their understanding of islamic law on entire states within the nigerian federation and denying other believers the freedom of religious expression i strongly encourage and support your every effort to speak out courageously and forcefully in this regard

salt lake city forgive my lack of figure skating judging experience , compared with many of my colleagues here at the winter olympics , whose collective message yesterday to ottavio cinquanta , the suddenly besieged president of the international skating union , seemed to be how do you sleep at night \? with speculation now supported by the head of the french olympic team that the canadian pair was victimized by biased judging , if not collusion , i was reminded of the last figure skating controversy i walked into , which merely happened to be the most celebrated event in the history of the sport the experts , at least those from the west , could n't believe it when the judges gave oksana baiul the gold medal over our nancy kerrigan by the tiniest of margins at the lillehammer games of 1994 in norway kerrigan had skated a clean program baiul had not kerrigan had landed five triple jumps , two in combination baiul had landed four , none in combination after people like paul wylie , the american skater and a friend of kerrigan s , said things like , i ca n't explain it at all , the swedish referee , britta lindgren , explained it quite clearly the next day to randy harvey of the los angeles times nancy is quite slow and careful with her skating , lindgren said she is a little more cold how do you quantify the scoring when there is so much focused on the execution of the jumps , but where there is always room for a judge to say of a program , did n't quite do it for me i bring up the nancyoksana decision because many of the reactions to canada s david pelletier and jamie sal being edged by the russian pair sounded much like those in lillehammer the western whining commenced with the nbc announcers , who were practically hysterical frank carroll , michelle kwan s former coach , was quoted yesterday , you see the panel of judges and say 'why \? why \? why \? ' what i found in the archives yesterday was that carroll asked the same question after kerriganbaiul in 1994 yes , it s still a wildly subjective sport , and that s not going to change also unchanged , apparently , are the old geopolitical olympic battle lines , no matter how different the world actually is what , the olympics are supposed to be about men and women playing mere games \? the other day , someone said to me , can you believe nbc is putting on the usrussia men s hockey game so late on saturday night \? i thought is there some special significance to this event that i do n't know about \? naturally , all the speculation and allegations here are now on the french judge , the one who did not vote with her oldschool bloc but maybe it is less political these days and more cultural , or linguistic whatever , the story has taken over the olympics , the smoke is all over salt lake and , i might add , despite all the hand wringing regarding the credibility of the sport , figure skating has back its 1994 buzz forgive the cynicism , but i know there are people who hope this story has legs , and it probably will in announcing his support for an appeal skate canada will soon file , michael chambers of the canadian olympic association said , the appeal is to be based on a breach of isu regulations , that the judging be on the basis of good faith , not bad faith which sure sounded as if the charge will be that someone s vote was planned , or bought it s an allegation that need be investigated thoroughly , preferably by an agency independent of the isu , as skate canada , in conjunction with the canadian olympic association , is asking but while much of cinquanta s news conference was filled with overwrought suggestions that he do something now , yesterday , this minute send these judges to guant namo and have them interrogated he was right to defend isu procedure nothing can happen until it meets here monday there should be no rush on this , especially a public one to judgment , no pun intended i have an allegation and a denial , cinquanta said an hour into the conference , he coughed up the information that the allegation was made by the referee , ron pfenning of course , he is an american , and you can make of that what you will a russian television journalist , andrei kondrashov , who interviewed me yesterday , said , of course , most people in russia think our team won here in salt lake city and out there in quickpoll america , that obviously is n't the case frustrated over the continuous references that he must address public opinion , cinquanta wondered why no canadians or americans and , most significantly , russians complained when the same canadian pair won the world championship in vancouver , british columbia , last year over the same russian pair , under similar circumstances he was diplomatic when he doubted most americans were trained figureskating judges cinquanta , an italian , might have asked , excuse me , do n't you have a state that voted a professional wrestler to be governor \? in all sports \( see oakland at new england \) and especially ones that are judged , we often see what we wish to see could the warmup collision between sal and anton sikharulidze have made the crowd even more procanada than it already was \? it was a bit of a tonya moment , the russian standing over the fallen and shaken sal the 1994 crime against nancy kerrigan was n't committed by the judges if one here is found to have been influenced by another , it would not be a case of a 44 deadlock , as cinquanta s fuzzy math suggested it would be two judges who planned their votes the canadians would be entitled to the gold medal the head of the french olympic team , didier gailhaguet , said that was not the case , but that the french judge , marie reine le gougne , was pressured to vote for the russians it s all still vague until the french judge comes clean until then , let it play out under a fair investigative process and the olympics go on

built for the sake of salt , which needed to be moved from the upstate onondaga region to new york city the west indian slave trade \? underwritten by sales of salt , even more than by molasses and rum , as most history books have it the tangled network of roads across north america \? credit the trails animals plodded as they searched for salt licks if every history book had such a sharp focus and clear presentation , no schoolchild would ever be left wondering about the when and why of , say , the battle of bunker hill and we might actually have learned our lesson dependence on foreign salt , like dependence on foreign oil , can lead to trouble any reader who still looks at salt as a dietary demon will come away with a new understanding of the subject thanks to kurlansky s admirable evenhandedness on the health risks both of too much salt and too little he notes that salt is present in almost every part of the human body and the fluids it produces , from tears to semen to urine sodium is also needed to propel oxygen through the blood and move our muscles , including the heart humans simply cannot live without it the book is a natural outgrowth of kurlansky s previous exhaustive study of cod , which of course was preserved with salt and also affected world history but here he moves well beyond salt s culinary role in his introduction , he mentions a booklet produced in 1920 by the diamond crystal salt company of st clair , mich , that listed a mere 101 uses , from keeping the colors bright on boiled vegetables to making ice cream freeze , from removing rust to sealing cracks , from cleaning bamboo furniture to killing poison ivy and that s not to mention all the medicinal applications , like treating dyspepsia , sprains , sore throats and earaches today , kurlansky writes , the salt industry can tout 14 , 000 uses the author , who also has a short story collection to his credit , takes a few meandering side roads before steering back onto the salt expressway , but he demystifies so many foods \( and other topics \) that you ca n't begrudge him his detours he quotes an 18thcentury french naturalist who speculated that islamic proselytizing failed in china because the chinese adamantly resisted the idea of giving up pork and he repeatedly cites examples of religious corruption linked to salt \( in europe , fast days were manipulated to promote more eating of salted fish dispensations were sold to the rich \) he also uses salt as a cautionary tale , showing how greed produces environmental degradation the french village of collioure , for instance , once had 800 anchovy fishermen now it has none the anchovies were overfished after lamps were used to imitate the full moon that drew them to the surface what keeps salt from being just a dry recitation of factoids is the sense of wonder kurlansky communicates in every chapter like him , we 're delighted to discover what makes flamingos pink \( their shrimp and worm diet , in salt ponds \) and how a salt mine in poland doubled as a church he also breezes past the bestknown salt tidbits it is the root of the words for sauce , salad and salary , for instance to toss out more surprising insights salt is a primer in the production of soy sauce , roquefort cheese and , of course , cured fish , to name only a few foods the book also teaches how the saltcured , smoked fish called finnan haddie got its name \( from findon haddocks , the scottish town \) , why corned beef is called corned \( from the small bits of salt , or corns , used to cure it \) and how ketchup evolved from a salty anchovy sauce salt slyly puts today s hot food trends in perspective as well kurlansky points out that the newly discovered maldon salt , from essex in england , was a prized commodity more than a quartercentury ago and that choucroute garnie was originally made with fish instead of meat and those snobs who proudly put la baleine sea salt in the box on the table might be humbled to learn that since 1996 morton s , that good old supermarket standby , has owned the french producer after recounting thousands of years of blood and sweat over salt , kurlansky notes that most of what is mined today goes for deicing roads in wintertime a commodity that was once so valuable it was used as currency has become cheap enough to blanket highways and support the cult of the car that fact is meant to be the final shocker in the salt cellar what is much more disconcerting , though , is that americans today , with the freshest and broadest food supply in history , eat more than twice as much salt on average as europeans did at the height of their dependence on food salted for preservation in the centuries before refrigeration salt makes even sweet food taste better , as food processors know so well outside the pages of this book , maybe there can be too much of a good thing
touba , senegal a few years ago this west african nation s government built the first public school here in touba , a vaticanlike enclave that belongs to the sufi muslim brotherhood called the mourides but the school , financed by the world bank , never opened , because the mourides' grand caliph objected to secular education in french the caliph did not want strange habits to be imported here , explained abdoulahat mbacke , 27 , director of a koranic school that has taken over the unused public school at the school recently , dozens of boys and girls speaking wolof , senegal s main language , were learning the koran by rote , a practice followed by most koranic schools in this part of africa but unlike religious schools elsewhere , mr mbacke s is planning to add other subjects we saw that most of our graduates went into business , mr mbacke said we think that if they learn how to use computers , or if they learn another language , like english , it would help them in their business learning only the koran is not enough for business nowadays , although , of course , the koran contains everything the mourides have become known as smalltime international businessmen , conspicuous on the streets of paris , rome and especially new york , where they peddle fake rolexes or operate stores selling goods from a vast network of suppliers in west africa they are famous for their entrepreneurship as much as for their moderate , essentially african , vision of islam unlike most other muslim brotherhoods , which have their roots in northern africa or the arab world , the mourides trace their origins to sheik amadou bamba , a senegalese islamic cleric who resisted french colonialism and was forced into exile to central africa in 1895 he was later allowed to return and settle here in touba , in the country s hot , barren interior , which proved a prosperous spot for the movement he founded in 1887 touba became the mourides' holy city , an autonomous municipality considered the private home of the brotherhood s leader a place that still does not pay taxes or answer to the federal government every year , to mark sheik bamba s departure into exile , hundreds of thousands of mourides make the pilgrimage to touba , which to many is more significant than going to mecca this year the event begins on may 2 it lasts two days as the mourides have grown in population and power they now number about two million touba is said to have become the country s secondbiggest city , after the capital , dakar at first , touba looks like any other west african city close to the sahara brown and dusty but its great mosque , with its imposing minarets and domes , can be seen from miles away inside , european marble adorns its walls and archways , and thick new carpets cover the floors nigeria s oilrich government is the one other in west africa to have erected such lavish mosques , but touba s has been built on the money raised by individual mourides , who toiled for decades as peanut farmers and then began traveling outside senegal in search of business if an arab or an indonesian built us a mosque , he would force us to pray the same way he does , said atou diagne , an influential mouride businessman here our independence is important to us that is why we worship work indeed , through a work ethic that some of them describe as protestantlike , the mourides have retained their financial and religious independence here in touba , rules are set by the current grand caliph , serigne saliou mbacke , an old man with arthritic hands and a toothless smile who is one of sheik bamba s two surviving sons no alcohol , no smoking there is not even a hotel here women work , and they can be seen everywhere touba has none of the socially oppressive rules , for example , of northern nigeria , where a sometimes brutally strict interpretation of islamic law has filled the void left behind by years of military misrule just before friday prayers recently , the grand caliph was receiving guests at his modest house next to the mosque he sat in an armchair in an inner room and spoke , through a small window with bars , to the faithful who kneeled before him he spoke so softly that an aide had to repeat his utterances asked about the mourides' travels , the grand caliph said , some go to seek knowledge others go to seek material wealth as many clustered before the window and craned their necks to catch his words , he said , we go where we find generosity , pity and tolerance asked whether the attacks on sept 11 had changed the mourides' relationship with their favorite destination , the united states , he said , i have not reflected enough on that question like his predecessors , the grand caliph is politically cautious his father , sheik bamba , who is remembered for opposing colonial rule , established a pattern of collaboration with the french after returning from exile the french , benefiting from the stability that the mourides provided , allowed them to thrive after independence , senegal s presidents also relied on the mourides for political backing and gave them great autonomy in return in 2000 , the day after his election , president abdoulaye wade , himself a mouride , paid a highprofile visit to touba to receive the grand caliph s blessing mr wade , who said in an interview that the grand caliph had never asked him for any favors , comes here every few months in few places in west africa is islam so well organized and politically powerful as in senegal , a country at the same time considered the region s most open and westernoriented there are four sufi muslim brotherhoods in senegal , each led by a cleric called a grand marabout it is through the marabouts that the faithful most of senegal s 10 million people practice this mystical form of islam the brotherhoods have had friendly relations with the state and , as essentially moderate groups , have helped provide it with an unusual degree of political stability it is only in senegal that brotherhoods dominate to such a degree , where they are inseparable from islam , said khadim mbacke , a mouride who is a professor of islamic studies at the university of dakar perhaps more than other muslims in africa , mr mbacke said , the brotherhoods have adapted islam to african culture brotherhood members follow a strong leader , in keeping with african tradition , and leadership is passed down through sons among the mourides , because many of their early leaders were peanut farmers or traders , those practices became essential to their way of life yet the mourides engage in other practices denounced by traditional islamic scholars one of them is prayer facing the atlantic ocean , away from mecca , a practice that has its origins in sheik bamba s voyage into exile because he was said to have been denied the right to pray aboard the ship that took him away , the faithful developed the belief that he unfurled a carpet on the sea and prayed on the water many longtime mourides suspect that new members are attracted less to the faith than to its association with financial success for even though they rank second of the brotherhoods in size , the mourides are generally viewed as the most powerful economically and politically all over the country people name their shops and businesses after this city , whether or not they are mourides touba tire shop , touba travels many newcomers seem to have gravitated to touba because they do not have to pay taxes or water bills dame diakhate , 32 , who owns a small grocery , recalled that touba was once a small , quiet town he said he had lived here his entire life , except for four years spent working in new york city touba was better before , mr diakhate said now some people drink here some people smoke cigarettes some people become mourides because they want to do business , maybe 10 percent of them photos the interior of the touba mosque , where every year hundreds of thousands of mourides from all over the world go on pilgrimage the great mosque at touba is the landmark of a city that otherwise looks like many others near the sahara the mosque was built with contributions from individual mourides , many of whom are entrepreneurs \( photographs by seyllou diallo for the new york times \) map of senegal highlighting touba touba is the religious center of the mouride group of sufi muslims
the chief executive of the primary lender to us airways said yesterday that he would liquidate the airline if unions refused to provide 200 million in additional wage and benefit concessions in an interview , david g bronner , head of the retirement systems of alabama , said that he did not expect to have to follow through on his ultimatum and predicted that the discussions between the airline and its employees would result in an agreement by next week the concessions would be the second round in us airways' efforts to draft a reorganization plan under chapter 11 protection from its creditors us airways has said it hopes to submit its proposal to a federal bankruptcy court by dec 20 before that , it would like to receive final approval for 900 million in loan guarantees from the government , which gave it provisional approval last summer to do so , the airline has asked union members for further cuts in pay and benefits if they do not comply , mr bronner said in the interview , the airline would go out of business and be liquidated in bankruptcy court what s their alternative \? he asked rhetorically if they do n't want to do this , we 'll chapter 7 it referring to the debtorinpossession financing that the alabama pension system is providing the airline during its time under bankruptcy protection , mr bronner said that without concessions , we 'll pull the dip financing and they 're gone his stance with the us airways unions is an example of the tough approach that analysts expect airlines to begin taking with employees now that a united airlines bankruptcy filing seems highly likely indeed , mr bronner s comments came as donald j carty , the chairman and chief executive of american airlines , continued a series of meetings this week with groups of employees in the meetings , which began last week in chicago and are expected to continue through the end of the year , mr carty is emphasizing the financial crisis american is facing and its need for concessions , an american spokesman , tim doke , said the airline is telling employees that if united emerges from bankruptcy with labor cost reductions , american will have to become similarly lean , mr doke said at us airways , mr bronner s words carry extraordinary weight as the result of negotiations completed this week , mr bronner , who directs the 25 billion alabama fund , will in effect take control of the airline s board at the point us airways emerges from bankruptcy mr bronner and the airline agreed that he will have 7 of the 13 seats on the board , up from the 5 that he and the alabama pension fund originally gained when he came forward in september to bid for the airline mr bronner said the seven seats would be equivalent to 72 percent voting control of the airline , for which he initially agreed to provide 240 million in immediate financing as well as 500 million more in debtorinpossession financing , outbidding the texas pacific group us airways has drawn 300 million of that 500 million but cannot draw the remaining 200 million until it emerges from bankruptcy mr bronner said that he would occupy one of the seven board seats , but had not decided who would have the others as part of the agreement with the airline , mr bronner is cutting his fund s stake , originally 375 percent , to 36 percent , so that a larger share can be given to unsecured creditors management is also reducing its stake , to 8 percent from 10 percent whenever the company emerges from bankruptcy , which it hopes to do by march , mr bronner said he would give 2 percent of his stake to management to restore its lost holdings the negotiations came as us airways struggles to reduce its costs and complete its chapter 11 plan though workers cooperated in an initial round of concessions , some are opposed now only the pilots' union has agreed to consider further concessions the machinists' union has rejected the idea , while the flight attendants said they would participate only if other unions did so mr bronner asserted it was vital for the airline to obtain work rules from the unions that are in this century , and not in the last century yesterday , scotty ford , the president of the union chapter that represents mechanics , said he was willing to meet with us airways on the matter we 're just going to see what they 're going to say , mr ford said patricia friend , international president of the association of flight attendants , was critical of mr bronner he s acting as though he believes an airline can be saved on the back of the workers , she said it shows his lack of experience maybe he s looking for an easy way out because he made a mistake there s not going to be anything to govern if he liquidates under the restructuring plan , unions will have three representatives on us airways' board , one each for pilots and machinists , and the third to be shared by flight attendants and other employee groups but unlike their counterparts at united airlines , the union representatives do not receive veto power over company affairs , nor will the unions hold a stake in us airways
a secret history of the ira by ed moloney illustrated 600 pp new york w w norton company 2895 can the hope of the greenwhiteorange irish flag peace between catholic and protestant ever be realized \? when ed moloney , a respected journalist born in england and educated in northern ireland , finished a secret history of the ira earlier this year , the omens looked good the agreement signed on good friday , 1998 , with papal blessing and lowkey american support , continued a ceasefire by the mainstream irish republican army , and its political ally , sinn fein , had joined the powersharing assembly in belfast to which britain had transferred daytoday government but the ira is still holding huge stocks of arms , mostly from libya and the united states then , last month , a senior sinn fein official was charged with having information likely to be of use to terrorists , reportedly on possible targets for assassination britain suspended the northern ireland assembly to forestall a walkout by hardline protestants in the worst case , the killing and maiming of 35 years of guerrilla war and savage counterinsurgency resumes and ireland , north and south , is back at tragic square 1 moloney , a former northern editor of the irish times and the sunday tribune in dublin , begins his account in the 1960 s , when the bitter seeds of the current cycle of ireland s troubles were planted and the leadership still dominant on both sides emerged in his version \( which , having covered the same events for the sunday times of london , i commend \) , northern ireland s repressive stability was shattered , like that of many another unjust regime , by overtimid attempts at reform in 1965 , with a reasoning that still holds good , the patrician protestant northern irish prime minister , terence o'neill , met his dublin counterpart , sean lemass , a veteran of the 1916 easter rising , arguing that catholic acceptance of northern ireland was needed to revitalize its economy and that this meant giving catholics fairer access to jobs and houses a fiery protestant fundamentalist , the rev ian paisley , warned of a sellout to rome seeing their privileges threatened , workingclass protestants formed loyalist gangs in the summer of 1966 , loyalists shot a catholic , peter ward , 18 , caught in a protestant pub a catholic pedestrian was shot on the street and an elderly protestant woman died in a botched bar firebombing the first deaths of the present round inspired by the american civil rights movement , young students , mostly catholic , formed their own protest movement , people s democracy in 1969 , loyalists attacked a movement march , setting off escalating sectarian violence and a northern irish government request for british troops welcomed as peacemakers , they soon aroused ancestral memories of longago english invasions moloney notes that many of the regulars were veterans of counterinsurgency operations in malaya , aden and kenya and unthinkingly brought with them colonial perceptions of native treachery on aug 9 , 1971 , police officers and soldiers arrested 342 people , mostly catholics , who were interned without charge or trial , many on the strength of outdated intelligence , mistaken identity or village gossip some were tortured riots broke out all over northern ireland on jan 30 , 1972 , bloody sunday , in a bungled attempt to bring the ira to battle , british paratroopers in londonderry fatally shot 14 unarmed catholic civil rights demonstrators , none connected with the ira the british embassy in dublin was burned , and young catholics flocked to join the terrorists in 1972 , the most violent year of the troubles , 467 people died the internment of oldline ira fighters moloney estimates there were no more than 50 still active in belfast cleared the way for younger militants still unknown to the police the ablest of them , gerry adams , was 18 and working in a bar in 1966 when , according to moloney , he was sworn into company d of the ira s belfast brigade , in which his father had been wounded in an action on both sides the adamses have deep republican roots \( meaning , in irish terms , they favored the reunification of ireland at gunpoint if necessary \) adams was brought up in ballymurphy , an isolated catholic ghetto on the western edge of belfast in constant danger of loyalist violence adams , president of sinn fein since 1983 , has never admitted involvement with the ira , but with his family history this is hard to believe more surprising , moloney reports that adams has never personally fired a shot in anger against the british or their local allies still , he was briefly interned without trial in 1972 , again in 1973 , and then served three years for trying to escape in periods of freedom , according to moloney , adams rose to command the belfast brigade and is credited with introducing armalite rifles bought with contributions by irishamericans to the cause of northern aid adams shared his time in prison , moloney reports , with a group of internees devising a new strategy for the ira force was still favored to drive the british out but , to achieve something during our lifetimes , adams called for a long war that , to retain the essential support of catholics , meant open political activity as well in this , moloney says , lay the germ of the ira s acceptance of a ceasefire 20 years later most of moloney s book is devoted to the gradual evolution of this policy years of nonstop bloodshed , some 3 , 600 deaths to date , a slowmotion world trade center in an area scarcely bigger than connecticut of tragicomedy , like the racehorse held by the ira for ransom , shot while trying to escape and of stomachturning cruelty on both sides \( the shankill butchers , a protestant gang who sliced their catholic victims with cleavers , and the human bombs , beginning with a catholic working for the army who was forced by the ira to drive a car bomb into a base and was then blown up \) moloney names a selfeffacing hero , the rev alec reid , a redemptorist priest who acted as a tireless gobetween , and fills out the roles of other men of peace the northerndescended irish prime minister , charles haughey , and the nobel laureate john hume , who risked his catholic support to meet adams and convey plans for an end to ira terrorism through the many and devious policy shifts that led to the 1997 ira ceasefire , moloney traces what he calls the golden thread of consent implicit in the principles of nonviolence laid down by the mediator , and former united states senator , george j mitchell there are two traditions in ireland , as the flag acknowledges , and peaceful reunification can be achieved only by negotiation between them , meaning that a majority in northern ireland , as well as a majority in the irish republic , must first democratically agree but ireland also has two traditions of lawless violence , not one and the terrorists of the loyalist side have not disarmed either , any more than the ira has and neither is likely to give up its weapons while the other side keeps its a return to the sectarian battles of 1972 onward is still a possibility pessimistically , until the current generation of diehards passes on it takes two to make peace one side cannot unilaterally cancel the hatreds of 30 violent years freelance , unauthorized terrorism by unreconciled ira and loyalist splinter groups goes on , and while most catholics support an allparty government in belfast , the democratic unionist party of ian paisley , with his uncompromising watchword no surrender ! , emphatically does not paisley s unionist party is attracting more and more protestant votes , forcing the moderate ulster unionist party to harden its stance against sinn fein on a recent visit to northern ireland , i saw heartening economic progress that gives workingclass catholics and protestants alike a stake in reconciliation mortgages and machine guns seldom go together in a telling aside , moloney reports that gerry adams , usually clad these days in politician s suit and tie , dresses down to jeans and tshirt to meet his old workingclass ira comrades moloney throws much new light , though of necessity on only one side , on a far from finished conflict he s made an important contribution to our

domino by ross king 439 pp new york walker company 26 outlandish hats and hairstyles , towering wigs , genderblurring masquerades these are among the numerous excellent reasons to pick up ross king s novel domino frivolous though they may sound , they 're integral to this british author s intricate meditation on the nature of appearance and reality in late18thcentury europe an age , as one character reminds us , of tricksters and shapeshifters and chameleons domino comes to american readers on the heels of king s nonfiction best seller , brunelleschi s dome , and in company with a new study , michelangelo and the pope s ceiling it also follows one other novel , exlibris , a bibliophilic whodunit \( or whohasit , since its main concern is a missing manuscript \) set in 17thcentury london and prague domino , however , was king s first book , published in england in 1995 it is no mere beginner s effort with its elaborate plot and lavish period detail , it matches the sleightofhand technique of exlibris and in subject matter it presses deeper king s narrator , george cautley , alternates between two stories one focuses on the travails of an italian opera singer , tristano venanzio pieretti , a castrato on the run from venice and adrift in 1720 s london , where he hopes to continue his career the other concerns george himself , as he recalls his move at the age of 17 from rural shropshire to 1770 s london , where he aimed to become a painter of persons of quality we know from the outset that things wo n't work out for george , a selfconfessed murderer and debauched creature what we 're missing is the connection between his story and tristano s still more obscure are the agendas of the supporting players in tristano s and george s lives in george s case , these include sir endymion starker , an eminent artist who leads a surprising double life eleanora clitherow , sir endymion s tantrumprone model and mistress lord w , at whose parties george first makes contact with supposed persons of quality and , most important , lady petronella beauclair , a possible kinswoman of lord w , who commissions george to paint her portrait she is also the one who tells him the story of tristano george falls for lady beauclair , and as his infatuation persists he grows crazily jealous of her enigmatic and seemingly intimate friend , robert , whom he can never quite meet face to face he seems oddly oblivious of the fact that lady beauclair lives in a brothel , but one peculiarity does manage to catch his attention the canvas she supplies for him is n't fresh instead , it s painted over , and beneath its surface is someone else s attempt to depict her , an attempt that seems to have displeased her greatly king expertly toys with george s \( and the reader s \) curiosity about the paintedover portrait for almost 400 pages tristano s tale is more straightforward it begins with an impoverished boyhood in southern italy and the gift of a beautiful voice it proceeds with the sale of the boy by his father to the maestro of a scuola di canto in naples and the operation that will keep tristano s voice in the soprano range there follows a notable career in venice , brought to an abrupt halt by his need to flee the city after some romantic indiscretions the offer of refuge in london comes from none other than lord w thus the two stories start to connect at the novel s halfway point the complications that ensue may compel some readers to resort to a scorecard to keep track of the costumes , disguises and deceptions that george and tristano must decipher if they hope to keep body and soul intact which brings us back to those hats and wigs and masquerades the hats range from a surreal insectterrarium creation to a more conventional straw bonnet embellished with two prussian blue ostrich plumes the wigs include a great pinkpowdered alp of hair and george s own lowbudget peruke , which , when subjected to rainstorms , begins to smell like the beast from whose tail it had been cultivated as for the masquerades , they 're a regular occurrence in the circles tristano frequents as a rising opera star , offering him his best chance for arranging trysts that are n't to the liking of his patron \( lady beauclair s account of these suggests that castration does n't necessarily destroy the libido \) for the impecunious george , masquerades are a business opportunity , a chance to mingle with people who might hire him as a portraitist naturally , such occasions are riddled with anxiety is he wearing the right costume \? and would he recognize a real person of quality if one hit him over the head \? matters are not made easier by the prodigious amount of crossdressing going on and the degree of anonymity some costumes afford most anonymous of all is the domino , a white mask for the face with a hooded black cloak attached even if george had the masquerade equivalent of the enigma code , he would probably misread his surroundings he is overawed by the gaudy , unduly impressed by titles and display as sir endymion counsels him you are yet very young you see only the appearances , not the substance that lies beneath like tristano , he s an ambitious young man in danger of losing his way , thanks in part to his own inexperience and shortcomings and so , with singer and painter as flawed heroes viewed in tandem , domino weighs the trouble with which a na ve sensibility deciphers the tricky links between artifice and authenticity , art and life

crotononhudson waving purple socks and a fleece jacket , astrid vaughan tried to capture the attention of her drenched daughter , who refused to stop bouncing on her trampoline , despite the pelting rain keekee , sweetie , how about putting on your socks \? she pleaded , standing in a chilly downpour in front of their splitlevel home in crotononhudson would you like your jacket \? wah , he , he ! kristie squealed , flipping a full 360 degrees , landing on her bare feet , then flying high again mrs vaughan long ago gave up trying to limit kristie s bounces to appropriate weather kristie , who is 12 , has severe autism , a neurological disorder that encases her in an invisible shell , choking her off from normal communication and interaction for a decade , she started the day when she felt like it , often at 3 or 4 in the morning , breaking out of the house and onto her beloved trampoline like many families with autistic children , the vaughans installed locks on the insides of their doors , hiding the keys from kristie but she escaped by removing or cutting holes through the window screens when stuck inside she bounced on the beds until the beds broke , the boxspring coils collapsed kristie s behavior was erratic at one moment , mrs vaughan said , she was her sweetheart exuding unconditional love at another , she would bolt naked from the house and plunge into the neighbor s swimming pool her speech was limited to rote responses , interspersed with unintelligible noises as she grew older , she began to wander , disappearing into the woods , down faraway streets and along crowded mall corridors she has no inhibitions , does what she feels like doing , mrs vaughan said , her calm voice a contrast to her words when mrs vaughan first learned of kristie s diagnosis in 1992 , autism was considered a rare disorder but , during the last 10 years , the percentage of new york state preschoolers with a diagnosis of autism has quadrupled , from one in 2 , 000 children to one in 500 , according to a statewide study by the new york autism network doctors cannot completely account for this escalation , nor do they know autism s causes or cures , leaving parents like mrs vaughan and her husband , mark , a telecommunications salesman , experimenting with unproved treatments and blaming everything from the environment to themselves for their child s disability when a child is diagnosed with autism , it s not the child that is diagnosed , it s the entire family , said dr andrew baumann , a psychologist and chairman of the new york families for autistic children , a long islandbased group , and father of an 8yearold autistic son it changes dynamics in a whole strange way , placing a huge strain on the mother and father there s guilt , fear , shame , anger everyone wants to blame someone exhausted , seeing no medical remedy on the horizon and frightened for kristie , and by the impact of her behavior on their two other children , julia and kurt , the vaughans made an agonizing decision in late july , they placed kristie in the new england center for children in southboro , mass , a yearround residential school , the best they could find , nearly three hours from home as is true with many families grappling with autism , a cluster of complicated factors shaped the choice , and has left mrs vaughan with a swirl of feelings , part guilt , part apprehension , part hope could you imagine how you 'd feel if your daughter was n't going to be sleeping at home every night \? mrs vaughan asked but i know it s for the best i know it s best for her and julia when kristie was home , kurt , 14 , preoccupied with girls and his guitar , was rarely there he saw his sisters in the car when his mother took him and his friends to games and gettogethers meanwhile , julia , 10 , slight and strikingly shy , stayed away from the trampoline , and away from her sister she had been afraid of kristie for years , mr vaughan said afraid she might hurt her , afraid of her unpredictability the older kristie got , the more withdrawn julia became last winter , something in julia seemed to snap their pale delicate daughter began spending much of her time alone in her room , crying , smelling perfumes , winding strings into enormous balls with kristie vacuuming the family s attention , the vaughans struggled for time to focus on julia s crisis i 'd really like to see kristie get into a group situation so julia could have a house , mr vaughan said in early summer , his eyes glancing toward the bedroom where julia had hidden all day she s a child with the ability to be saved i do n't want her falling into the abyss daniel crimmins , the former director of the new york autism network at westchester medical center in valhalla , headed the study documenting the sharp rise in the percentage of new york state children with autism over the last decade during this period , the definition of autism was expanded to include more able children on one end and more mentally impaired on the other using the new definition , one in 250 children were labeled autistic despite the changing definition , dr crimmins said , when you compare apples to apples we 're now talking about one in 500 children having autism compared to one in 2 , 000 a decade ago his results , which have not yet been published , appear similar to the escalating rates noted in various studies across the country
on sunday night , the mets were cheered going off the field , carried by the euphoria of beating the yankees in two of three games the few boos they heard last weekend were mostly directed at the yankees' roger clemens the boos began early last night , and the yankees were far away a restless crowd at shea stadium waited for the big hits that never came good pitching was also absent from the mets the fans wanted solid fielding , and missed that as well they have been waiting all season for a turnaround the mets , who had four hits , did not have an answer for the minnesota twins , a deceptively solid team that outplayed them in nearly every fashion in a 61 victory there was a lot of emotion going on over the weekend , first baseman mo vaughn said it allowed us to take that series we have to get it back over the next couple of days the mets began a stretch of 20 games last night that will take them into the allstar game break by dropping below 500 , to 3435 there will be four games against the national league eastleading atlanta braves next week followed by another subway series with the yankees to end the month minnesota , which leads the american league central , began the stretch by showing the mets why it has been able to stay in first place despite having problems twins starter johan santana , who began the season in the minor leagues and was making his 12th major league start , limited the mets to a run in six innings , the longest outing of his career he struck out seven of the first 13 batters he faced none of the batters in the twins' lineup had faced the mets righthander jeff d'amico , but the lack of familiarity did not seem to bother them d'amico surrendered four runs in six innings , allowing home runs to dustan mohr and torii hunter and extending his june struggles since throwing seven shutout innings against the florida marlins on may 26 , d'amico is without a victory in four starts with an 810 earned run average his command improved from his last start , his worst as a met , but d'amico lacked his usual sharp curveball , mets catcher mike piazza said maybe they had a better report on me than i had on them , d'amico said a j pierzynski hit a tworun homer off satoru komiyama in the ninth inning , the second straight time komiyama had entered and allowed a tworun homer before retiring a batter robin ventura s 10thinning , tworun homer last friday helped the yankees win the game consecutive twoout doubles by mohr , pierzynski and luis rivas in the second inning fetched the twins' first two runs pierzynski ran to second when left fielder roger cede o slowly approached his hit and threw wide of second base mohr s leadoff home run in the fourth gave minnesota a 30 lead and hunter s drive hit the front of the leftfield bleachers in the sixth inning and bounced onto the field , causing the twins' hitter to think for a moment that he had a double , before the umpires waved him home the twins are in first place despite carrying brad radke and joe mays on the disabled list minnesota s pitching , its presumed strength , has struggled , with starters posting a 532 era before last night but the twins had four hitters in their lineup batting 300 or better and they had scored the second most runs in the american league they have a lot of guys that can do a lot of things , piazza said the mets thought they had that only two mets had faced santana before roberto alomar \( 3 for 6 before last night \) and vaughn \( 0 for 4 \) santana struck out the side in the first inning , getting cede o , edgardo alfonzo and alomar swinging when santana went through the order once without allowing a hit , fans grumbled the crowd booed when cede o struck out again to end the third inning and complained when alomar struck out in the fourth vaughn flew out to deep center in the fifth , hunter leaping on the warning track for the catch jay payton popped out to short center before jeromy burnitz singled to right center for the first mets hit burnitz tried stretching the hit into a double and hunter , a righthanded thrower , raced over from center , gloved the ball , turned and easily threw out burnitz at second base the mets finally scored in the sixth on alfonzo s looping twoout single to left cede o had singled and advanced on a wild pitch , a rare mistake by the twins mets manager bobby valentine had said before the game that the twins played strong defense and did not make mistakes he did not have to add that those traits have been missing from the mets most of this season alfonzo ended the sixth by being thrown out at second , trying to advance when the ball got away from catcher pierzynski with alomar batting the weekend s emotion , and level of play , seemed so far away hopefully that was going to get everything rolling , d'amico said they scored the early runs and then everything just died inside pitch grant roberts , on the disabled list with a strained rotator cuff in his right shoulder , threw off flat ground without pain roberts is scheduled to throw off a mound today , which he said would be his real test rick reed , scratched from his start last night because of a cut right thumb , received a pregame video tribute on the monitor in left field i really wanted to pitch , said reed , who was traded by the mets last july photos the mets' roger cede o

the autograph man a novel by zadie smith illustrated 347 pages random house 2495 zadie smith s first novel , white teeth \( 2000 \) , was one of the most remarkable debuts in recent years a riotous multicultural drama that spanned some 150 years of history and that proved to be as entertaining as it was ambitious a tale of two world war ii veterans \( an unassuming englishman and his best friend , a bengali muslim \) and their highly dysfunctional families , the novel began as a rollicking , often hilarious romp through the streets of london and opened out into provocative meditation on personal and public history , on immigration , exile , postcolonialism , roots and rootlessness , and the contradictory yearnings for freedom and connection in short , a stunning novel that attested to its 24yearold author s astonishing storytelling gifts and narrative reach ms smith s latest novel , the autograph man , is similarly ambitious in this case tackling such sprawling themes as the consequences of fame , the hunger for religious faith , the tension between the symbolic and the mundane but it s a flatfooted , grudging performance dour where white teeth was exuberant abstract and pompous where white teeth was brightly satiric tight and preachy where white teeth was expansive the plot , involving the halfchinese , halfjewish hero s quest for an elusive autograph , manages to be simultaneously schematic and messy , propelling its protagonist on willfully whimsical adventures , including encounters with a midget rabbi , a black hooker seemingly modeled on divine brown \( the call girl who achieved fleeting celebrity with the actor hugh grant \) and a teenage superstar who bears more than a passing resemblance to britney spears in white teeth ms smith discovered an idiosyncratic voice entirely her own that enabled her to satirize her characters' vanities and selfdelusions while at the same time sympathetically limning their inner lives this time around , however , she has opted for a more detached approach , and her characters feel papery thin there is nothing immediately palpable about the texture of their daytoday lives or the geography of their souls instead , they often seem like collections of attributes and eccentricities representative figures \( standing for things like faith , narcissism or family devotion \) rather than multifarious individuals mountjoy , the london suburb where they live , a place where people have based their lives on the principle of compromise , similarly suffers from a fuzzy , generic quality the book s hero , alexli tandem , lacks the charm , bravado and vulnerability of the people in white teeth , and he turns out to be too much of an annoying sourpuss to sustain this lengthy bildungsroman a 27yearold autograph man and perpetual adolescent , he has turned his teenage hobby of collecting celebrity signatures into a thriving business , but he lives in a limbo of selfabsorption he cheats on his longtime girlfriend , esther , fails to show up at the hospital when she is having an operation and exasperates his devoted friends not everything in the world has to turn into the tandem road show , his friend adam says you are not the world there are other people in this film we call life alex , however , thinks of himself as the greatest , most famous person you never heard of , a personage who must defend himself from both slander and obscurity since he was 13 , shortly after his father died prematurely , alex has been obsessed with obtaining the autograph of his idol , kitty alexander , an oldtime movie star , as beautiful and elusive as garbo for years he has been sending a weekly letter to her fan club in new york , but while he has never received a response , he persists in his quest for this , his holy grail then , miraculously , one day after a very bad acid trip , alex finds himself in possession of a kitty alexander autograph his friends suspect that he has forged the signature , that his obsession has turned to delusion they intend to deal with the situation with an extreme application of tough love , while alex , meantime , plans a trip to new york to try to meet kitty , a trip that succeeds beyond his wildest expectations and turns him briefly into a celebrity himself as in white teeth , the narrative of this novel depends heavily on the longterm interactions of the characters' friends and family members , but in this case alex and company fail to support the weight of ms smith s languorous story alex not only tries our patience with his selfishness and selfpity , but the people around him are too sketchily or too briefly drawn to provide emotional ballast his late and adored father clearly has left a hole in alex s heart , which he presumably has been trying to fill by collecting other people s signatures , but after an appearance in the book s splendid but all too short prologue , dad largely vanishes from the narrative and while alex s old friends , who are constantly goading him to grow up , are a potentially engaging crew , they are accorded little onstage time there s adam , a fat weird freak black jew kid who lurched from one illfitting 'identity' to another every summer going through hippiedom , grunge , gangsta lite , various rootsisms before finding god in the mysteries of the cabala there s joseph , who first turned alex onto autograph collecting and has a dreary job with an insurance firm and there s rubinfine , who became a rabbi , just as his father wanted , less out of a sense of religious calling than because he was simply , and honestly , a fan of the people he had come from as for the weighty ideas and themes that these characters and the rickety plot of the autograph man are supposed to support , they are delineated with none of the verve that the author displayed in white teeth religious debates take the form of alex s mechanically trying to divide the world into things goyish and things jewish \( he considers the stapler and the pen holder jewish , and the paper clip and the mouse pad goyish \) and dense , enigmatic exchanges in which people say things like beauty , real beauty , is the realization of the divine on earth or we fear each other as symbols of one thing or another the meditations on fame and its limitations are thoroughly clich d , and its ruminations about mortality and grief feel oddly secondhand perhaps the autograph man , with its insistent perusal of celebrity , was a kind of response by ms smith to the sudden renown she achieved with white teeth , a book that instantly put her on the literary map unfortunately this new novel is a pokey , pallid successor and a poor testament to its author s copious talents photo zadie smith \( roderick field random

in the cool breezes of summer , people open their windows to the music of summer the wind through trees , birds chirping , children shouting in the distance then the windows slam down again , as the ruckus kicks in music pounding in passing cars , corn cannons roaring through farmers' fields , jet skis roaring through lakes for some hartford residents , ice cream trucks jangling a loud tune , was the last straw it s not music , they complained it s cloying and annoying the residents took mister softee to court a judge crafted a compromise , and mister softee agreed to turn down the tune two months later , on july 6 , a mister softee driver was charged with whacking one of the antinoise advocates with a baseball bat after he spotted the man photographing his truck and recording the music a legal tussle had turned into a street fight over the sounds of summer connecticut municipalities have long seen their share of battles over noise in many cases , noise ordinances are spawned from complaints regarding a specific sound in portland , those noises were the clanging of garbage collectors at 4 am in southington , the pounding music from a nightclub drove some residents to town hall in south windsor , the grinding machinery of a diaper service in the early morning infuriated sleepdeprived residents south windsor s ordinance , in particular , was the result of one angry resident who called the police every morning for several months , claiming a diaper service was running its machines too early in the morning neighbors also complained that falling lint from the diapercleaning process was carpeting their lawns the number of complaints prompted the town to pass a noise ordinance in 1997 that set rules for lawn mowers , leaf blowers , snow blowers , tractors , chainsaws and other machinery powered by an internal combustion engine those machines are not permitted to be used between 8 pm and 8 am , unless a snowstorm or other weatherrelated emergency occurs but it is flawed , said sgt matthew reed of the south windsor police department it does n't cover things like the boomboom music coming from cars people call often about that this ordinance was really targeted toward one particular problem , which is n't really the way to enact legislation it does n't have a lot of bite to it , so often when we have a problem , we go with breach of peace or creating a public disturbance according to wethersfield s ordinance , ice cream trucks are not permitted to stand still to wait for a sale once they 've traded cones for cash , they must get moving the town does permit ice cream vendors to bid on a parking spot at each of the town s parks , where they can sit for hours if they please i just ca n't believe they are going after the mister softee man in hartford , said fred valente , the chief building official in wethersfield twentyfive percent of the world is at war , and people are complaining about noise coming from an ice cream truck \? in all , 48 towns and cities have adopted noise ordinances that are , in one way or another , more stringent than the rules of the state department of environmental protection , which regulates noise in connecticut for example , state regulations do n't apply to mobile sources such as trucks , said dennis demchak , acting assistant director for field operations for the bureau of air management , an arm of the dep the department of motor vehicles has regulations on mufflers and so on , but music from a truck \? he said i just do n't know one might think hartford s noise ordinance would address the sounds the state s regulations did n't cover , but hartford neglected to do the one thing state officials asks municipalities to do once a local noise ordinance has been passed send it to them for approval without the stamp of the state agency , a local noise ordinance is not considered valid southington found that out the hard way a noise ordinance had been passed in town in 1993 , when a quiet sports bar became a countrywestern bar with an outdoor deck residents were none too pleased with that , mark sciota , the town attorney , said the town passed a noise ordinance to quiet the bar seven years later , another group of residents complained about noise from an industrial plant mr sciota researched the origins of the existing ordinance and discovered that it had never been submitted to the dep for approval so technically , we do n't have a noise ordinance , he said town officials have been trying to rewrite the ordinance for the past eight months to accommodate noise from factories , but many of southington s factories butt up against residential areas we 're concerned it will put factories in a difficult situation , mr sciota said still , the state continues to encourage municipalities to enact their own ordinances , partly because the state s rules make so many allowances state noise regulations make exceptions for bells and chimes , for public emergency signals , for animals sounds created by mobile sources , such as aircraft , cars , trucks and boats , are also excluded looking at the list , one might make a case for a mister softee truck
hempstead , ny , july 26 for the jets , the offseason speculation about vinny testaverde and chad pennington can be compared to the cartoon monster who keeps regenerating limbs to wreak more havoc no matter how many ways gently or bluntly that coach herman edwards stated that testaverde was his starter , the questions about whether pennington could challenge for the job , and under what circumstances , never abated today , as the jets reported for training camp , which opens saturday , edwards attempted to quiet the chatter earlier in the week , he said testaverde would have to screw up to lose the job , and today he expanded on that notion testaverde , who is coming off surgery to remove a benign tumor from his foot , will not be evaluated on what he does in the preseason , edwards said and edwards seemed less certain of his offseason plan to have pennington play in regularseason games this year , saying he did not know if the jets would be able to get pennington onto the playing field testaverde , who said he was fully recovered from surgery , will take the first snap with the first team saturday and , barring injury , will take it when the jets open the season sept 9 at buffalo , no matter how well pennington performs in camp chad will get more reps , i think he needs them , edwards said vinny gets evaluated when the games start i think vinny is going to have a heck of a year how are you going to evaluate the guy in the preseason \? let him play that s how he 'll have to lose his job edwards later explained a situation in which pennington would have a chance to win the starting job if he plays well and for some reason vinny does n't play good , then chad has to go in the game and play , edwards said the last time i checked , vinny took us to the playoffs the story is that they 're competing , no different than lamont jordan is trying to compete to beat out curtis martin if vinny plays like he did last year , we win 10 games i want him to play better than that during the minicamp in april , edwards was concerned that pennington was still thinking too much but pennington , who practiced with the first team during the offseason workouts as testaverde was recuperating , said he now felt much more confident in his ability last year , pennington said , he did not have much fun because he put too much pressure on himself now , backed by a greater knowledge of the offense , his confidence peeks through when he evaluates his prospects i 'd have to play really , really well , pennington said of his chances of moving up to no 1 but anything is possible my challenge is to be ready when my number is called we 're in a great situation we 've got an old guy who is a proven veteran and a younger guy who is eager to play for testaverde , who arrived at training camp in true starting quarterback style driving a bentley convertible all this is old news everybody wants to play but everybody ca n't play , he said we 're back at work and you put feelings aside this is my 16th camp i 've never been a part of a camp where someone was n't after my job no matter whose job it is , the goal for the jets' offense this season is to string together the brief bursts of explosiveness it produced last season edwards wants to score in the mid20 s each game he delineated several statistics that illustrated last season s offensive shortcomings the jets were 24th in the league in first downs , 17th in completions , 31st in the number of offensive plays run , 23rd in redzone offense the jets made few personnel changes on offense , especially in comparison with the overhauled defense , indicating a belief that progress on offense is just a matter of familiarity but they did hire jimmy raye as a senior offensive assistant he will stand on the field and be in communication with the offensive coordinator paul hackett , but edwards denied that raye would also act as a buffer between testaverde and hackett , whose relationship grew tense near the end of last season there s no problem , edwards said that s a family matter and it got outside of the house that s the only thing i'm disappointed at vinny and paul are fine even more promising may be the tinkering done with the offense testaverde and hackett reviewed the playbook during the offseason to determine what plays they liked and what worked well to the mix , the jets will add plays in the spread formation a testaverde favorite that will see jordan , martin , santana moss , laveranues coles and wayne chrebet on the field at the same time the jets hope that the conservative offense that relied heavily on runs by martin but stalled frequently without touchdowns will be a thing of the past we need to make some more big plays , some 25 or 40yard plays , edwards said extra points the jets signed their secondround draft pick , safety jon mcgraw , and will turn their attention to several key veterans center kevin mawae , right guard randy thomas and receiver wayne chrebet are in the final year of their contracts and running back curtis martin , who has two years remaining , counts about 20 million against the salary cap over the next two seasons all the players said they would prefer to have their contract situations resolved before the regular season begins , but none issued a deadline mawae said the training camp schedule that gives players every sunday off was probably the easiest he had ever seen photos vinny testaverde will take the first snap with the first team today and is expected to start the opener \( g paul burnett the new york times \) \( pg d1 \) quarterback vinny testaverde signing an autograph for a young fan , far left coach herman edwards at a news conference , above and chad pennington , who will begin the season as testaverde s backup again \( photographs by g paul burnett the new york times \) \( pg d2 \)
researchers in pittsburgh have reported an outbreak of a strain of group a streptococcus , the bacterium responsible for strep throat and a number of other infections , that is resistant to the commonly prescribed antibiotic erythromycin writing in this week s issue of the new england journal of medicine , out today , the researchers said this was the first study from the united states to show a high prevalence of erythromycinresistant group a streptococci given their findings , the researchers said this strain of the bacteria , which also cause rheumatic fever , tonsillitis , certain skin infections and the lifethreatening toxic shock syndrome , would be resistant as well to other drugs in the same class as erythromycin that class , called macrolide antibiotics , includes azithromycin \( sold under the brand name zithromax \) and clarithromycin \( biaxin \) the researchers , from children s hospital of pittsburgh , found the resistant bacteria while conducting a study on the prevalence and nature of sore throats in children from kindergarten to eighth grade at a school in pittsburgh in the first two years that the children were followed , 15 percent tested positive for strep throat , but in none of those cases were the bacteria resistant to erythromycin in the third school year \( 20001 \) , 18 percent tested positive , and of those cases , 48 percent were resistant the strain also spread to the wider community , where resistance to erythromycin was found in 38 percent of people who tested positive for group a previous reports in the united states show very low rates of erythromycin resistance , said dr judith m martin , the lead author of the study until now , those rates hovered around 2 percent to 3 percent but erythromycinresistant strep has been seen at very high rates in several european countries and in japan we 've talked about this for years , dr martin said , and now it s here we ca n't sit back and say , 'not us' it s clearly here the standard treatment for strep throat is penicillin or amoxycillin , drugs of a class different from erythromycin s group a streptococci have never been shown resistant to either of those drugs but patients who believe they are allergic to them only 5 percent to 10 percent are really allergic are given erythromycin or azithromycin we want to get the word out to physicians that we ca n't just assume that group a is sensitive to erythromycin , dr martin said doctors may want to think about using a different antibiotic or find out if that person they 're treating is truly allergic to penicillin in such a case , the alternative antibiotic of choice , in yet a third class of drugs , is clindamycin but if a doctor still wants to prescribe a macrolide , dr martin said , a throat culture should be taken and analyzed for resistance dr pentti huovinen of the national public health institute of finland , who wrote an editorial accompanying the study , said in an interview that if a macrolide antibiotic was used to treat a group a infection , the physician should be sure that the strain is not resistant to macrolides , to avoid treatment failures the pittsburgh clone or other resistant strains may already have spread elsewhere , dr huovinen said this macrolide resistance situation has to be determined everywhere in the united states resistance to antibiotics , a matter of growing concern , is caused partly by their overuse from 1989 to 1999 , american adults made some 67 million visits a year to the doctor for sore throat , according to a study published last year in the journal of the american medical association in 73 percent of those visits , the study found , the patient was treated with antibiotics , though only 5 percent to 17 percent of sore throats are caused by bacterial infections , the only kind that respond to antibiotics macrolide antibiotics in particular are becoming extremely popular for care of upper respiratory infections , in part because of their typically short , convenient course of treatment people have been using a lot of azithromycin , dr martin said , because it s convenient it s once a day for five days as a result , she said , many doctors have prescribed it even for people who are not allergic to penicillin research has linked such vast use to a rise of the resistant bacteria in studies conducted in finland , an increase in the use of macrolides correlated with an increase in macrolideresistant group a streptococci when nationwide action was taken to reduce the number of macrolide prescriptions , the rate of resistant strep decreased sharply
randolph maddix , a schizophrenic who lived at a private home for the mentally ill in brooklyn , was often left alone to suffer seizures , his body crumpling to the floor of his squalid room the home , seaport manor , is responsible for 325 starkly ill people , yet many of its workers could barely qualify for fastfood jobs so it was no surprise that mr maddix , 51 , was dead for more than 12 hours before an aide finally checked on him his back , curled and stiff with rigor mortis , had to be broken to fit him into a body bag at anna erika , a similar adult home in staten island entrusted by the state to care for the mentally ill , three other residents had previously jumped to their deaths when a distraught lisa valante , 37 , sought help but it was after 5 pm and , as usual , the residents , some so sick they cannot tie their shoes , were expected to fend for themselves no one stopped ms valante , then , from flinging herself out a seventhfloor window sometimes at these homes , the greatest threat can be the person who sleeps in the next bed despite a history of violent behavior , erik chapman was accepted at park manor in brooklyn after four years of roaming the place with a knife , mr chapman stabbed his roommate , gregory ridges , more than 20 times at last , mr chapman was sent to a secure psychiatric facility mr ridges was sent to cypress hills cemetery at the age of 35 every day , new yorkers come face to face with the mentally ill who have ended up on the streets since the state began closing its disgraced psychiatric wards more than a generation ago mr maddix , ms valante and mr ridges were among thousands more who ended up in dozens of privately run and stateregulated adult homes in new york city a yearlong reporting effort by the new york times , drawing upon more than 5 , 000 pages of annual state inspection reports , 200 interviews with workers , residents and family members , and three dozen visits to the homes show that many of them have devolved into places of misery and neglect , just like the psychiatric institutions before them but if the times s investigation found that the state s own files over the years have chronicled a stunning array of disorder and abuse at many of the homes , it discovered that the state has not kept track of what could be the greatest indicator of how broken the homes are how many residents are dying , under what circumstances and at what ages the times s investigation has produced the first full accounting of deaths of adult home residents at 26 of the largest and most troubled homes in the city , which collectively shelter some 5 , 000 mentally ill people , the times documented 946 deaths from 1995 through 2001 of those , 326 were of people under 60 , including 126 in their 20 s , 30 s and 40 s at two of the largest homes , leben home in queens and seaport manor in brooklyn , roughly a quarter of the 145 residents who died were under 50 the times s analysis of the deaths used social security , state , court and coroner s records , as well as psychiatric and medical files the analysis shows that some residents died roasting in their rooms during heat waves others threw themselves from rooftops , making up some of at least 14 suicides in that sevenyear period still more , lacking the most basic care , succumbed to routinely treatable ailments , from burst appendixes to seizures some of the hundreds of deaths undoubtedly stemmed from natural causes and were unavoidable studies have found that the mentally ill typically have shorter life expectancies than the general population , because they have difficulty caring for themselves and are more prone to health problems the average age of death in the overall survey was 63 there are few extensive studies on death rates of the mentally ill in facilities like adult homes but dr e fuller torrey , a psychiatrist who is a nationally recognized expert on mental illness and mortality , called the times s analysis disturbing it would certainly suggest a fair number of deaths that were premature , said dr torrey , who is executive director of the stanley medical research institute in bethesda , md , and is familiar with the adult home system in new york city there is no question that if these people were getting better care and more skilled care , they would be living longer and this poor care leading to death is going to cut right across the age population it also means that people who are 70 are dying prematurely in the end , whether the residents were in their 20 s or 70 s , it is impossible to know just how many of their deaths could have been prevented the only other accounting of the dead seems to be on hart island in the east river , where scores of adult home residents are buried in the mass graves of potter s field officials at the state department of health , which regulates the homes , acknowledge that they have never enforced a 1994 law that requires the homes to report all deaths to the state asked for records of any investigations into deaths at the homes , the department produced files on only 3 of the nearly 1 , 000 deaths
marsh mclennan companies , the insurance brokerage firm that lost 295 employees on sept 11 , has agreed to contribute millions of dollars more to its own charity to provide extended health benefits to the families of its dead employees the move comes in response to criticism from several surviving spouses when the company , the world s largest insurance brokerage firm , initially planned to offer them one year of health benefits other world trade center companies have offered survivors 5 , 10 or unlimited years of health coverage the company later agreed to extend the coverage for three years , yet that decision stirred still more anger that was because marsh mclennan said that the costs , projected at 2 million , would be paid by the mmc victims relief fund , a charity set up by the company as a result , families stood to collect thousands of dollars less in cash from the 13 million fund also , some spouses argued , company employees and friends who donated almost 3 million to the fund would surely object now , the company announced in a letter to the 295 families , the insurance costs will be borne fully by additional marsh mclennan contributions to the charity fund none of the money given to the fund by colleagues , friends and clients and none of the 10 million already contributed by the company will be used to pay for extended health insurance , the company said , adding that it had tried to be open and sensitive in considering the needs of our colleagues' families
trenton , april 5 the last of the county republican conventions is over , and james w treffinger , the essex county executive , has held on as he predicted he would to his position as the candidate with the strongest party support to take on senator robert g torricelli in november that leaves the five other candidates for the republican nomination talking about how unimportant partyorganization support is in new jersey as they experiment with new themes , including immigration and national security , in their quests to break out of the pack as expected , mr treffinger easily won the endorsement of bergen county republican leaders at their convention on thursday night , giving him the favored position on the county s june 4 primary ballot the bergen vote was mr treffinger s 11th victory among the 17 counties that pick party favorites at conventions or by executive committee decision his strength within the party suggests how badly state republicans want to win their first statewide election victory since former gov christie whitman was narrowly reelected in 1997 but as the campaign director for a rival candidate , state senator diane allen , put it today , the party leaders also supported former representative bob franks for governor in last year s republican primary , yet republican voters handed the nomination to bret d schundler , the mayor of jersey city diane allen has been targeting her message toward primary voters and the party cadre , said brian donahue , ms allen s campaign manager the last primary election showed that the party bosses did not determine the outcome of the election , and the best use of our resources and energy is to focus our efforts on primary voters who will make up their minds on june 4 and not just a small group of backroom party workers robert ray , the former whitewater special prosecutor , who joined the race too late to be considered even in the bergen county convention , made the same point today county conventions are about persuading certain party officials to support you , mr ray said , but the point here is that as bret schundler showed , the only thing that matters is what the voters decide to do , and in new jersey , the voters have a habit of being particularly independentminded charlie smith , mr treffinger s campaign manager , maintained today that in a crowded field , not the twoman race mr schundler won , party organization had everything to do with winning yet david rebovich , a rider university political scientist , argued that the scattered nature of the race for the republican nomination , particularly with two strong south jersey candidates in ms allen and state senator john j matheussen , makes it more unpredictable than mr treffinger s lead in party support might suggest in some ways it s an enigmatic race , mr rebovich said today yes , we know bret schundler taught us last year that we ca n't always trust the power of the organization to win for you , but this year none of the candidates has really broken out from the pack yet three other candidates divided up the remaining six county endorsements senator matheussen beat senator allen in south jersey by winning cumberland , camden and gloucester counties , while ms allen was endorsed in burlington and cape may douglas forrester , a wealthy businessman and , like mr ray , a relative newcomer to state politics , upset mr treffinger s expectations by winning the middlesex county convention less wellfinanced candidates grumbled that mr forrester took middlesex on the strength of the beef stroganoff and shrimp scampi his caterer served to convention voters the sixth candidate is assemblyman guy gregg the candidates have been united in focusing most of their attacks on senator torricelli and the ethical issues surrounding the long federal investigation into his fundraising an inquiry that ended without any charges but mr forrester introduced the idea of tightening immigration controls and national security in his first radio commercial , and mr ray took up the theme in his announcement last month we did n't think anything like the trade center attack was possible in this country , mr ray said today , and i think we need to look at what s happening in the middle east and reflect seriously on the fact that something like that could happen here mr forrester said polling had shown national security to be a growing voter concern i 've tried to make sure that we do n't play into a xenophobic mindset , mr forrester said , but rather , to develop a balanced point of view to protect national security and legitimate immigrants , who are welcome photo diane allen , right , campaigning for senate in milburn , nj she aims her message at voters , not gop leaders \( dith pran the new york times \)

who s to blame for much of our weed problems \? possibly jethro tull , the 18thcentury farmer and writer who advocated , and developed , implements for the thorough pulverization of the soil as we gardeners go out every spring to turn over our soil we have also been churning our ground and exposing the myriad weed seeds lurking in every soil to light and air , which is just what they need to sprout years ago , i decided to try to put an end to my weed problems , and began by dispensing with tilling my soil in fact , although it may seem contrary to what many gardeners take as gospel , i now try to avoid any disruption of the natural layering that develops over time in soil i set transplants in the ground by pushing the dirt aside just enough to snuggle the roots in place spent annual flower and vegetable plants are cleared from the garden by giving their stems a sharp twist or jerk , or else by first severing the largest roots with a knife small roots are left to rot and improve the soil i even avoid disrupting the natural layering when enriching the soil rainfall and earthworms and other soil life gradually work fertilizers and organic materials into the ground after i lay them on the surface organic materials also protect the surface from pelting rain and hot summer sun , a benefit that is largely lost when these materials are dug in furthermore , fertilizers and organic materials do most good near the surface , where plant roots naturally proliferate not all weeds come from seeds within the soil they also sprout from seeds carried by wind or dropped by birds most weeds that arrive in this manner can be dealt with by covering the ground with a thin , weedfree mulch , renewed yearly or as needed the kind of mulch depends on the look i want , the plants and the soil poorer soil or more demanding plants get the most nourishing mulch compost i slather it an inch thick each fall over all my vegetable beds buckwheat hulls are adequate and attractive in flower beds paths get wood chips , straw or some other lean material free of viable weed seeds i could not , of course , just banish such words as rototill and dig from my vocabulary , throw some mulch over the ground and carry on as usual most soils need to be aerated , which tillage does however , the reason most soils need to be aerated is because they have become compacted from being driven or walked upon i avoid this problem by not walking or driving where plants grow my garden is laid out with permanent areas for plants and permanent areas for traffic planted areas in my vegetable garden consist of rectangular beds my flower gardens are more free form ground covers almost never get walked on and trees are planted in islands of mulch that also are rarely trod upon ideally , it should be possible to reach into the center of any bed especially vegetable beds , which need frequent attention for planting and harvest with feet firmly planted in a path thirtysix inches is a good width for a vegetable bed , although gardeners with longer reaches than mine could make do with 40inch wide beds flower beds can be wider , tolerating an occasional step garden paths range in width from a minimum of 18 inches for those between adjacent vegetable beds to 5 feet for a main path through the vegetable garden or a path for leisurely strolling among flower beds instead of mulch , paths could be nothing more than steppingstones among flowers , for example or even wellbehaved lawn there is little or no reason to go to the trouble of creating and maintaining raised beds except where drainage is a problem changing my watering technique was the final step i took on my road to weedless gardening not all plants need regular watering , but for those that do , i use drip irrigation drip irrigation pinpoints water right to plants , so none is wasted promoting weed growth between widely spaced plants or in paths the combination of all these techniques has brought benefits beyond fewer weeds the mulches also conserve water and keep roots cool minimal soil disturbance keeps humus levels high and maintains a network of permanent pores for draining excess water and moving capillary water around i no longer have the trouble of tilling and the delay of waiting for the soil to dry enough to till in spring and because there s no need to leave space between every row of plants for walking , more plants can be squeezed into the garden planted in beds and more vegetables and flowers reaped of course , in spite of my weedless gardening system , weeds do still appear , but weed problems do not what few weeds i find i yank out roots and all weeds with long taproots , like dandelion and burdock , may need to be coaxed out by thrusting a trowel alongside their taproot , then levering up just enough to free the root colonies of small weeds are quickly done in with a winged weeder , colinear hoe or some other hoe having a sharp blade that slides parallel to and just a fraction of an inch below the soil surface i pay special attention to the garden edges , where weeds and grasses attempt to sneak in very important in avoiding weed problems are regular weed forays young weeds not only are easiest to remove but have yet to spread by seed or creeping roots by planting in beds and not disturbing the soil , keeping the surface covered and using drip irrigation when regular watering is needed , my regular weed patrol has been pared down to a few pleasant minutes each week photos garden paths whether through vegetables , top , or flowers mean the

taking a lesson from a campaign by mario m cuomo when he ran for governor 16 years ago , h carl mccall yesterday called on his opponent in the democratic gubernatorial primary mr cuomo s oldest son , andrew to release a list of clients he is representing as a private lawyer in new york like the elder mr cuomo in 1986 , mr mccall argued that voters had a right to know of potential conflicts with clients who might have business dealings with the state if you are running for public office , and you disclose your income , you ought to disclose how you derived that income , mr mccall declared , standing in a stiff wind on broadway , just north of city hall who paid you \? if you worked for a law firm , and you were paid to represent clients , we should know who those clients were but the younger mr cuomo who ran his father s campaign when governor cuomo repeatedly pounded his republican opponent , andrew p o'rourke , for refusing to release a list of his law clients sounded more like mr o'rourke than mario cuomo yesterday as he sought to deal with this latest turn of the table like mr o'rourke , mr cuomo asserted that these were private law clients and that he thus had no obligation to identify them no , said josh isay , mr cuomo s campaign manager , when asked , first by a reporter and later in response to mr mccall s statement , if mr cuomo would list the names they are private clients that he handles on a private basis , period mr isay continued , none of andrew cuomo s clients have anything to do with the state thus began a rather muddy backandforth , as the two democrats seeking the nomination to challenge gov george e pataki began raising a series of questions about each other s ethics moments before mr mccall , the state comptroller , began his news conference in front of a drugstore the subject was a plan to reduce the price of prescription drugs mr isay preemptively emailed out a statement demanding that mr mccall release a list of all campaign contributors who did business with his agency , arguing again that mr mccall was handing out state contracts to reward campaign contributors he s a walking conflict of interest , mr isay said , tweaking a remark he made three weeks ago , when he described mr mccall as a walking quid pro quo as soon as mr mccall finished speaking , his aides distributed , with evident delight , a transcript of a broadcast encounter between mario cuomo and mr o'rourke from the 1986 campaign in which the governor repeatedly demanded that mr o'rourke disclose the names of his clients mr isay , speaking for mr cuomo , demanded in turn that the state comptroller report how much time he was spending on his campaign , and that he reimburse the state for that part of his salary but when asked if the hardcampaigning mr cuomo would do the same with the salary he is collecting from his own law firm , fried , frank , harris , shriver jacobson , mr isay demurred he s a private citizen , he said the question of whom mr cuomo represents for fried , frank took on a certain amount of currency last week when he allowed reporters to review tax forms that showed that he collected 405 , 000 last year from his employer of one year mr cuomo , who joined the firm after resigning as the united states housing secretary , is of counsel to the firm , rather than a fullfledged partner at the same time as he has worked for the firm , he has been running what has appeared to be a very fulltime campaign , as mr mccall s aides noted yesterday it begs the question , since he apparently has been very active as a candidate , and has told people he is running for governor full time , what exactly is he doing to earn 405 , 000 , to earn that kind of compensation , said allen p cappelli , mr mccall s campaign manager as you may recall , back in 1986 , when he was the principal adviser to his father s campaign , his father made precisely the same point against andy o'rourke indeed , governor cuomo fairly tormented mr o'rourke , who was then the westchester county executive , on the subject , though his demands were not quite so broad as mr mccall s the governor insisted that mr o'rourke release a list of whom he represented before westchester county agencies while he was on the county board of legislators mr cuomo , who was way ahead in public opinion polls , said he would not debate mr o'rourke unless he complied , though many democrats viewed that as a tactic by mr cuomo to avoid debating a much lesserknown rival mr cappelli said he did not see any difference between what mr mccall was asking for and what governor cuomo had demanded
when the mets were mired in a 12game losing streak last month , they came to play each day with virtually no hope of making the playoffs and only the motivation of ending their futility the mets finally broke the streak , and players confidently said that things could not get much worse now that they are stuck in another skid , the mets are again grasping for inspiration they lost again yesterday , falling by 95 to the philadelphia phillies on a dreary day to extend their losing streak at shea stadium to 14 games , a club record that not only exceeded the club s 1979 record for ineptitude at home but also tied the national league mark set by the boston braves in 1911 , the elias sports bureau said the 1953 st louis browns hold the major league record with 20 straight home losses the mets' home losing streak is the longest in the majors since detroit lost its final 17 games at tiger stadium in 1996 the mets \( 6173 \) were swept by the phillies in the threegame series and have lost four in a row over all and 16 of their last 19 it s a strange sort of feeling where your motivation and your goal is not to extend a losing streak , mike piazza said trust me , it s bitter it s not fun to go out here and get your tail kicked every day and feel the frustration of everyone on your team and the fans piazza did not play yesterday and might not be catching for a while the tendinitis in his left wrist has not dissipated , even though the mets have given him regular rest he has looked strong in batting practice and early in games , but the pounding of catching more than 100 pitches a game plus swinging the bat weakens his wrist as a game progresses the new plan is to shut piazza down for the next few days and hope his wrist responds an earlier magnetic resonance imaging test and xrays confirmed the tendinitis , and the mets have no plans for further tests general manager steve phillips said trainers and doctors had cleared piazza to play if he could tolerate the pain piazza was not receiving treatment as of saturday morning , but he left shea stadium yesterday with his arm wrapped for the first time , piazza admitted that the injury had hindered him , and he described the pain as feeling as if a nail was pounding on his arm in 11 games since the injury , he has 5 hits in 40 atbats \( 125 \) with one home run , two doubles and three runs batted in the mets also lost outfielder tony tarasco for 10 to 14 days after he severely sprained his left ankle at first base while trying to beat out a grounder in the sixth inning tarasco , a reserve , crumpled to the ground in foul territory and was wheeled off on a golf cart he said he was trying anything he could to help the mets out of their funk things could have been worse on a day when rain accompanied most every pitch , but not much al leiter lacked his signature cut fastball , leaving him with his secondary pitches , a curveball and changeup , to battle a team he was facing for the third time this season leiter \( 1111 \) allowed seven runs \( five earned \) as he pitched into the third , retiring none of the three batters he faced in the inning it was his shortest regularseason start since he pitched one inning for the yankees in 1988 last season , after the mets were eliminated from the playoff race in the final week , leiter spoke of his unfamiliarity with pitching when nothing was at stake he had not been in that situation since 1996 with the florida marlins now he must push himself for a month with little motivation , but he would not fault a lack of it for his performance yesterday it s something you better block out because there s still a pride factor and i still have a job to do , leiter said i would say no , that s not why i failed today it was a matter of me just not getting in a groove and making good pitches manager bobby valentine acknowledged the difficulty in playing games in a september with little hope he could not fault the effort yesterday , and he pointed out that center fielder timo perez ran into the outfield wall chasing a double and tarasco s effort that resulted in his injury i really ca n't ask more than that , valentine said that is about all the mets can take from these games it s a new month , sept 1 , read a board in the back of the clubhouse but this month appears similar to last month it s funny two weeks ago we came out and said it ca n't get worse than this , tarasco said do n't ever ask that question
two freshly minted brooklyn cyclones , members of this class a baseball team that is more or less a wisp less would be the key word here of the late , loved and lamented dodgers , were in this kaleidoscopic part of the universe for the first time yesterday , and feeling their way one , a 22yearold pitcher named eric templet , is from gonzalez , la the other , kevin deaton , a 20yearold , also a righthanded pitcher , is from cocoa beach , fla they were sitting in a dugout at keyspan park , with the empty , swooping rides of the nearby coney island amusement park just beyond the outfield fences the players were about to work out in preparation for their opening game tonight against the staten island yankees , and home opener tomorrow with 98 percent of this season s tickets already sold for the 7 , 500seat stadium in baseballstarved brooklyn templet had extolled a popular cajun restaurant in his hometown , named hymel s \( pronounced email \) it s on the levee , he said he cited as specialties of the house the crawfish touff e as well as the mississippi mud pie he was asked if he knew of any places to eat in brooklyn hmm , he said no just got here deaton did nathan s , he said , with just the slightest air of the gourmet it s the hotdogeating capital of the world i saw a tape on television the other night of the hotdogeating contest they held last july 4 i saw a 97pound chinese woman eat 22 1 2 hot dogs that 1 2 came in for emphasis in 12 minutes it was pretty disgusting and she only finished third ! in fact , the chinese swept the cyclones , an instant hit last season , are a mets farm team , and these players , as well as their manager , howard johnson , the former mets infielder , and the pitching coach , bob ojeda , the onetime mets pitcher , are hoping to find their way across the borough to the big stadium in queens johnson was the batting coach for the cyclones last season , the first year of their existence so he knows the ropes of the league and what the players can expect , though , he admits , he has something in common with his players he still has n't figured out the subway system and he does n't wear his 1986 mets world series ring , the symbol of reaching the highest levels of the profession managers or coaches sometimes wear such jewelry as a spur , perhaps , to their young charges hojo does n't wear it yet , anyway we 've just moved from san diego , he said , it s still packed away he is moving here with his wife , kim , and their three children the cyclones , one notch above the rookie leagues , were a good team last year and named cochampions of the league when the final series was halted after sept 11 some players have advanced to higher levels , but none to the parent club it would seem at first thought that , the way the metsies have been playing this season , any team that wins anything in their organization should be able to send some help to shea stadium like tomorrow johnson was more restrained we feel we 've got some bona fide prospects here , he said , and they might prove it out in a few years this a developmental league , but we also want to teach winning two of the standouts are dominicans named rodriguez andres rodriguez , 21 , is a lanky , slugging first baseman , and edgar , 22 , is a third baseman , from the small town of san pedro de macoris , where , improbably , scores of major leaguers have come from , from sammy sosa to jose offerman to luis castillo edgar says that to make the major leagues , he must work on his concentration johnson said that a major part of his job was to keep the players relaxed most of them are straight out of college , and have n't played before big crowds , he said and tomorrow night there s going to be a full house like 6 , 500 people in the ballpark in staten island an intense rivalry has developed between the teams from the two boroughs , and the yankee and mets organizations and there s going to be television , johnson said have n't told them about the television might get them too hyper and as one watched the players go through their drills , with johnson and ojeda watching closely , it was all like a dream a little dream ballpark , the big dream of the future tyler beuerlein , a 23yearold catcher who went to cal and majored in economics and is in his second year with the cyclones , was asked if he knew how to get to shea stadium literally or metaphorically \? he said the same was asked of pitcher dave lohrman when told the old joke about the way to get to carnegie hall was practice , practice , practice , lohrman smiled wanly that about sums it up , he said photo corey ragsdale of the brooklyn cyclones practicing at keyspan park yesterday \( richard perry the new york times \)

i strongly suggest that parents not make chores synonymous with negative responsibilities parents creative about matching children and chores can encourage skill development and dependability in addition to family participation for example , the artistic child can be assigned the chore of making birthday cards or place cards for family occasions for the quieter child , perhaps the chore of helping with the cooking , getting oneonone time with a parent while learning about the kitchen the athletic child can mentor siblings when children have a balance of chores that tap into their own personalities and talents , they may well be less resistant to the chores that none of us wants to do faye kimerling tarrytown
newark , nov 14 twentyone employees at newark liberty international airport used fake identification to get jobs that allowed them into restricted highsecurity areas , the authorities said today as they announced the results of a background check on all employees begun after the 2001 terror attacks none of the employees , most of whom worked on cleaning crews , were believed to have terrorist connections , said christopher j christie , the united states attorney in newark all will be arrested and charged , he said most of them are accused of using counterfeit social security numbers and falsified immigration documents to get jobs with subcontractors at the airport that allowed them in and around aircraft , baggage handling areas and the international facilities at newark , the metropolitan area s busiest airport , mr christie said he added that many of them had lied about their immigration status this obviously raises serious questions about security at the airport , he said if these individuals could simply present false identifications and false social security numbers to be employed at the airport , others with more nefarious intentions could do the same i do n't need to tell anyone how serious a matter this is in the aftermath of sept 11 still , mr christie said that the number of arrests 21 out of a work force of 24 , 000 was not high compared with the results of similar sweeps at other large airports , part of a nationwide campaign since the terror attacks to check the backgrounds of security screeners and other airport workers not many have had less than us , he said we are on the low end in april , federal prosecutors charged a total of 104 people working at three washingtonarea airports dulles , reagan national and baltimorewashington international with supplying false information to get security badges in december , arrest warrants were issued for 69 workers at salt lake city airport arrests have also been made in boston , miami , phoenix , seattletacoma and portland , ore at newark , mr christie said investigators checked background information on all 24 , 000 employees of those , 18 , 000 have security badges that allow them access to sensitive areas while all employees are fingerprinted and undergo criminal background checks , mr christie said that their employers may not have made sure they gave correct social security numbers or accurate immigration information mr christie said today that he would recommend that security badges not be issued to any employees until the authorities had received clearance from the social security administration and the immigration and naturalization service that the employees' statements were accurate no badges should be awarded before this very fundamental check is completed , he said airport officials here said they would cooperate with the changes , but they said the task could be complicated because it would require collaboration with large , bureaucratic federal agencies we conduct criminal background checks on all employees before they get the badges , but obviously work needs to be done on better checking to see if people have valid social security and green cards , said steve coleman , a spokesman for the port authority of new york and new jersey , which controls newark , kennedy and la guardia airports mr coleman would not say whether similar sweeps have been made or planned at the other airports eleven of the 21 accused of falsifying records were in custody today , and federal authorities said they had put warrants out for the others the charges carry a range of penalties a maximum of 5 to 10 years in prison and a 250 , 000 fine of the 11 , only one worked in security , patrolling one of the concourses , mr christie said , but did not work on the xray and metal detection crews the background checks also turned up 15 more employees who had outstanding warrants on such charges as drug possession and sexual assaults , mr christie said those 15 were arrested weeks ago , he said of the 11 arrested on today s charges , almost all worked for cleaning companies and one for a security company that subcontracted with the airport
it is no surprise that vatican officials have put the united states catholic bishops' zerotolerance policy on hold many catholics may be surprised to learn , however , that the vatican s concern focuses on due process for priests accused of child sexual abuse due process has not been a hallmark of vatican decision making why raise it now \? the vatican has raised it as a way to protect church authority although various curial congregations promise to work with the american bishops in clarifying their policy on clerical sex abuse , it is more likely that the policy will be changed not so much to protect accused priests or their victims as to protect the vatican s power including its power to control bishops it is true that the zerotolerance policy adopted by the american bishops in dallas last june needs finetuning the rights of accused priests have not been observed in the current climate cases decades old can have an expostfacto quality that begs for clarification as does the definition of abuse itself and the standard for establishing a credible allegation still , faced with the greatest scandal in the history of the american catholic church , the bishops took some dramatic steps last summer they recognized that their failure to resolve the abuse problem in the mid1980 s , when it first made headlines in louisiana , was in some measure because there was not a national policy binding on all bishops they tried to repair that in dallas by adopting such a national policy and seeking vatican approval to make it binding they also implicitly acknowledged that their past efforts to have the vatican remove priests who abused children had failed miserably cardinal bernard law of boston , the man at the center of the abuse scandal since january , was finally allowed in 1998 to defrock father john geoghan , a serial abuser , only on personal appeal to the pope in their search for an effective solution the bishops turned to lay catholics , who were to constitute a majority on boards set up in each diocese to review and evaluate accusations the bishops were not wrong to assume that putting lay people on these boards professional experts , parents and victims of abuse would finally bring an end to the problem of serial abusers no lay catholic would tolerate an abusive priest in the service of the church the bishops also knew that laydominated boards would protect due process for the victims against biases present when the investigation and evaluation were controlled by clergy the bishops did not have any reason to believe that these boards , which have been operating for years in a number of dioceses , would be cavalier about due process for priests and though neither these local boards nor the national one established to monitor the situation could supplant the decisions of bishops , the boards' opinions would possess great moral force but many at the vatican will have none of this vatican officials and united states bishops are scheduled to have consultations over the next several weeks when they conclude , the role of the laity in solving this crisis is likely to be merely advisory if not abolished altogether the only real authority , it will be emphasized , belongs to the bishops , including those who have already failed in the task of removing abusive priests , and to the vatican curial officials , who in spite of their stated sympathy for the victims are more clearly concerned about their own power that , too , is an abuse of power that lay catholics must struggle to remedy the bishops , at least , realize they need help from the laity to restore their authority and credibility if the vatican does not allow them to create and sustain the structures necessary to ensure that lay people have a voice , it will be a blow not just to the laity but to the whole church and to the bishops most of all drawing \( wes bedrosian \)

jerusalem a dangerous and deceptive plot line has become superimposed on the story that israeli society tells itself about its conflict with the palestinians since the outbreak of the current intifada two years ago , it is as if the israeli mind has turned to a new page in the chronicle of the conflict and , at the same time , erased many of the pages that preceded it it s as if the 33 years of repression , occupation and humiliation that israel imposed on the west bank and gaza between june 1967 and september 2000 vanished with the wave of a magic wand the majority of israelis take comfort today in believing that the horrifying deeds committed by palestinian terrorists in the last two years somehow balance the books for those long years of subjugation and that all the guilt for the current state of affairs rests on palestinian shoulders furthermore , they believe , the suicide bombings , and the broad support they have received from the palestinian population , have revealed things about the palestinians that ex post facto justify the injustices of the occupation in a contorted way , many israelis believe that the new wave of palestinian terrorism has granted their country absolution for its problematic past of course , the israeli occupation is not the entire story during those 33 years the palestinians contributed their share to the march of blood and folly by being intractable in their positions and murderous in their actions and we must not forget that the sixday war was not a war that israel wanted yet , despite this , the historical story that israel chooses to tell itself is astoundingly obtuse and superficial the story that now reigns nearly unchallenged in the media and political discourse obliterates more than 33 years of roadblocks , thousands of prisoners , deportations , and killings of innocent people it s as if there were never long months of closures in cities and villages , as if there had been no humiliations , no incessant harassment , no searches of houses , no bulldozing of hundreds of homes , no uprooting of vineyards and olive groves , no filling up of wells and , especially , no construction of tens of thousands of housing units in settlements and largescale confiscation of land , in violation of international law the new narrative leaps back through the manipulative fog created by the prime minister and his cabinet , his supporters and his various spokesmen straight to the sixday war , our pinnacle of justice and looking forward from that point in 1967 there is a kind of desert devoid of history , devoid of responsibility , devoid of blame , until we suddenly emerge from the miasma right at the oslo accords , the proposals that ehud barak made to yasir arafat at camp david and , after camp david , like thunder on a bright and sunny day , the second intifada according to this story , the palestinians suddenly exploded in september 2000 in an uncaused natural eruption , spewing out lava and ash and igniting the entire region they had no logical reason for exploding and there was no prior israeli provocation ehud barak made them a generous offer , and they betrayed him with an outburst of violence because they , by their nature , are motivated solely by destructive , irrational forces that make impossible any future compromise with them this theory is also the basis of another rightwing claim that now seems to be accepted by the majority of israelis it is that the oslo accords , and their supporters , were what in fact caused the second intifada in other words , it was n't the intolerable conditions in which the palestinians lived for more than three decades it was n't the tacit support that most israelis lent to the ongoing occupation , all the while persuading themselves that it was such an enlightened occupation that it was barely an occupation at all it was n't the refusal of every israeli government before the second administration of yitzhak rabin to try to reach a true , if painful , accommodation with the palestinians it was n't the doubling of the number of israeli settlers in the territories in the years after oslo nor was it the way in which ehud barak conducted the camp david talks , presenting to yasir arafat as ultimatums proposals that , while they were generous compared with israeli positions in the past , were entirely insufficient in palestinian eyes none of these factors are now viewed as sufficient reason for a popular uprising by a subjugated and despairing people no , it s the oslo accords that are to blame , as if in the absence of oslo the palestinians would have come to terms with the israeli occupation , accepting it tranquilly , even lovingly , to this very day as if the oslo agreements were a match , not a fire extinguisher obviously , one of the reasons this story line has gained acceptance is that it seems to give a logical structure to a chaotic and threatening reality along the way , it also seems to justify the use of massive and unrelenting military force against the palestinians but this view of reality is fraught with danger because it is simply not realistic it s true that the palestinians have committed serious errors and war crimes in the last two years it also may well be true that , had they acted otherwise , they would have a state today but if israel is interested not just in punishing the palestinians but also in extricating itself from the trap it s in , it must wake up and reinsert into the tragic story of the conflict those parts that have been expunged from its consciousness during the last two years if we do not replant the recent intifada in its historical context , no chance of any minimal mutual understanding will sprout and without context , we will never be truly cured
executives at us airways met with union representatives yesterday to lay out a proposed business plan that would cut costs deeply to move the airline toward profitability and help it obtain a 1 billion federal loan guarantee but many union leaders said they left the meeting more confused than combative , still unsure of exactly what concessions the executives wanted under the plan , the company , the sixthlargest airline and an east coast mainstay , would cut 13 billion in costs , with 950 million of that coming from nonmanagement labor costs and 50 million from management , union representatives said almost 90 percent of its work force is represented by a union , and labor leaders went into the meeting skeptical but they left without knowing exactly how much each labor group would have to contribute to the cuts the overarching theme is to have a competitive cost structure , david n siegel , chief executive of us airways , said yesterday evening in a telephone interview we 're taking a very cooperative , inclusive , consensual approach to solve the problem it s a challenge , obviously the plan also proposes heavily increasing the airline s use of regional jets , strengthening its three east coast hubs and forming a partnership with a larger carrier to expand its route system at home and abroad the fourhour meeting , held in a lawyer s office in downtown washington , was the first step in trying to win employee approval for a huge revamping about 100 people packed the room , with labor leaders coming from around the country us airways is working with a tight deadline because it must have a lean business plan by next month to apply successfully for a loan guarantee after the sept 11 attacks , congress set up a 10 billion loan guarantee program for the airlines , in addition to giving them 5 billion in immediate aid the air transportation stabilization board , which administers the program , expects applicants to have business plans that demonstrate stringent costcutting measures and a feasible route toward profitability the board gave america west 380 million in backing last december , and that airline has been the only successful applicant of half a dozen so far at yesterday s meeting , executives repeatedly stressed the need to obtain a 1 billion loan guarantee to keep us airways afloat mr siegel said he intended to file an application by june 15 , well before the june 28 deadline but he said he would not present the application until he won agreements from the labor unions i'm not as skeptical as i was before about the overall plan , but i'm still not sure what participation is expected from the flight attendants , said karen lascoli , president of the us airways branch of the association of flight attendants none of the labor groups know about their participation executives are planning to hold separate meetings with each union next week to discuss specific costcutting measures if the meeting today was noteworthy for anything , it was for a lack of details , joe tiberi , a spokesman for the machinists' union , said our members who are being asked to participate in a restructuring program ca n't be asked to take part in a plan where details are withheld the longer they wait to give us proper information , the harder it will be for the carrier to meet that deadline , mr tiberi added the reductions in labor costs would come from cuts to wages , work hours , pension plans and health care , among other things the plan did not call for immediate furloughs or layoffs mr siegel said he wanted to put together a plan that takes every opportunity to preserve jobs us airways suffered more than most of its competitors after the terrorist attacks because it relies heavily on east coast travel it reported a 269 million loss for the first quarter , its seventh consecutive losing one as of march 31 , it had 561 million in cash and was using that up at rate of 35 million a day the airline also has some of the highest labor costs in the industry its operating cost 1246 cents to fly one seat one mile is more than that of any competitor labor and management have clashed over bringing down those costs , although mr siegel did not step into his job until march and does not have much of a history with the airline s unions besides the proposed 1 billion in labor and management cost cuts , the plan also calls for 300 million in reductions from partners like aircraft leasers , technology service providers and other suppliers , mr siegel said he added that the airline was looking to join with another carrier , and it would try to increase its regional jets to 300 in three to five years regional jets are much cheaper to operate than widebodied aircraft , and pilots are generally paid less to fly them the pilots' union had a contractual clause with us airways to limit the airline s fleet of regional jets to 70 , but recently agreed to increase that to 140 if more regional jets mean more passengers to our hubs feeding mainline flights , then the regional jets would be used in a manner that is acceptable , roy freundlich , a spokesman for the pilots' union , said if it s simply about outsourcing our jobs to make the main line smaller , it will remain a contentious issue
it sounded almost too good to be true a rich new yorker who had died had left his millions to the city s poor , and the money was being given out at a federal office in lower manhattan by the end of the day yesterday , as many as 5 , 000 people had stood in a line that at times wrapped twice around the block at the worth street office of the federal emergency management agency unfortunately , the rumor was not true those who had lined up came from each of the five boroughs and new jersey , and all expected the federal agency to provide them with their share of the deceased man s wealth many waiting in line said they had heard about the giveaway thursday morning on a spanishlanguage radio program , while others said they had seen it wednesday evening on public access television , though none could identify the stations others said friends , family members and neighbors had told them to go to the agency , where checks were supposedly being distributed people said a chinese multimillionaire man died and left his money to the poor , said vanessa cordero , 21 , who came with her mother from their bronx home to claim it you had to come here and get an application everybody told us to come down here , so we came agency officials were caught offguard by the size of the crowd outside 141 worth street , which began with a few curious people shortly after 10 am and grew to thousands by early afternoon police barricades were erected and motorcycle officers were called to control the throng people got a little hyper when they learned they were n't getting money , said james mcintyre , a fema spokesman many , he said , did not know why they were standing in line there are people in line who are just lining up because someone told them to , he said people are on cellphones calling family members , telling them 'come on down there s free money' officials said the rumor probably stemmed from a popular federal grant the agency has distributed since the world trade center collapse it has offered new york city residents reimbursements for air quality equipment like air purifiers and filters to clean indoor air agency representatives told many in line yesterday that they might qualify for the reimbursement , and they scheduled thousands of appointments , but even with their agency registration numbers in hand , people still wanted to know when they could claim their money it s a lie , ms cordero s mother , natividad cruz , said in spanish but i have 11 grandchildren we 're poor we need it

paris , feb 26 the versions of medea passed down by euripides and seneca portray the wild goddess from colchis as a barbaric outsider who uses her magical powers to destroy corinth and who thinks nothing of murdering her children to punish her faithless husband , jason the underlying message , it seems , is that civilized nations , like greece and rome , should be wary of unacculturated foreigners of course the myth of medea can also be easily modernized , with jason and his argonauts portrayed as colonial brutes raping and pillaging colchis and medea herself as a darkskinned immigrant who finally avenges the discrimination , betrayal and humiliation she has suffered in a land that claims to be civilized as for her infanticide , well , perhaps as an act of madness brought on by despair , the charge can be reduced to manslaughter but what if the myth is reworked with a different modern twist \? what if , instead of leaving medea for the king of corinth s daughter , jason runs off with the king s son , creon \? this is at least the plot of medea , the last opera by the swiss composer rolf liebermann , who died in 1999 at 88 and it has gained instant renown here after one french critic proclaimed it the first explicitly homosexual opera whether or not it is in fact the first such opera , it is certainly the first to be presented on the grand stage of of the bastille opera , where it runs through friday it does no favors to medea true , in this 70minute work she has no children to kill , although she is none too happy to be carrying jason s child more pertinent , she is blamed for jason s betrayal it is her noisy , jealous and dominating behavior that drives jason into the arms of creon she gets her revenge when she sends her young rival her wedding dress , which catches fire , kills creon and razes corinth but while she dismisses her distraught husband as nothing but a legend \( he of the golden fleece \) , jason is allowed to justify his breach of faith your aim was to possess , not to love i was merely the mirror of your ambition in the arms of this man , i felt free the explicitness addressed by dominique fernandez in an essay in the bastille opera s program precedes this denouement as it happens , the hugs and kisses between jason , sung by the finnish bassbaritone petri lindroos , and creon , sung by the american countertenor lawrence zazzo , are not written into the libretto they were proposed by the production s director , jorge lavelli but the two men also sing lyrically of their love for each other mr fernandez , a novelist and music critic , says this is what distinguishes medea he argues that , in tchaikovsky s eugene onegin , the duel between onegin and lensky is a substitute for a declaration of love , with death the ultimate expression of desire in britten s billy budd and death in venice , he notes , while the homosexual undertone is clear , it is not explicit in the libretto but in medea , he writes , for the first time , two men sing of their love , without disguise or evasion liebermann , who ran the hamburg opera from 1959 to 1973 and the paris opera from 1973 to 1980 , was not a prolific composer , although he wrote five operas , with his adaptation of moli re s cole de femmes best remembered for receiving a record 67 curtain calls when it had its premiere at the salzburg festival in 1957 that work and l onore 40 45 , p n lope and la f ret are rarely performed today in 1989 he became intrigued by the myth of medea , and the subject stayed with him to the end of his life after writing monologue de medea for soprano and orchestra , he was inspired by ursula haas s novel the acquittal of medea to plan what he called an antimacho opera portraying medea sympathetically but ms haas , who became his librettist , concluded that jason s adultery with a greek princess was insufficient motive for her fury so when this first version was performed in hamburg in 1995 , a homoerotic relationship was included still not satisfied , liebermann and ms haas returned to the work , expanding medea s role in a central act in which she sings of her love and hatred for jason and adding lyricism to the scene in the third and final act , in which creon recalls how he and jason fell in love the work was completed shortly before liebermann s death , and it is this definitive version that had its french premiere here this month the production is also a homage to liebermann , who was enormously influential when he was running the paris opera in the 1970 s to this day , the liebermann era is mentioned with reverence and among those who learned the ropes with him is hugues gall , the current director of the paris opera somewhat cruelly , however , le monde recalled that liebermann was named to the paris opera for his skills as an administrator rather than as a composer the score of medea , played here by the paris opera orchestra conducted by daniel klajner , is modern without being contemporary , with ample use of brass and percussion , strong rhythms and echoes of berg , bartok , stravinsky and messiaen the dominant voice is that of medea , sung in this production with passion and poignancy by the american soprano jeannemichele charbonnet mr lindroos s jason and mr zazzo s creon also won accolades from french critics perhaps most dramatic , though , were agostino pace s d cor and graciela gal n s costumes , above all in the first act set where an arena enclosed by high walls represents the temple in colchis where medea , the high priestess of the matriarchy , is preparing to castrate her brother absyrtus the wall then opens , a gangway descends and the rampaging argonauts arrive to steal the golden fleece in the second act medea sings her grief on a raised platform surrounded by corinthian women wrapped in white cloth and resembling walking mummies then , in an operatic nod to the modern , the third act s set is art deco , including a steaming shower from which a barechested creon emerges eric dahan , music critic of the leftofcenter paris daily lib ration , did not approve he said it reminded him of the 1978 movie , la cage aux folles while the bastille opera s public gave the production and notably the singers a warm reception , renaud machart of le monde was another music critic who came away less than satisfied he said that liebermann had displayed happy politeness by writing a short opera , but that he feared medea might be remembered best for mr fernandez s definition of its originality and to sum up the work , his review had the headline sad and gay photo lawrence zazzo , rear , as creon and petri lindroos as jason play lovers with hugs and kisses in medea \( pascal victor maxppp \) \( pg

chicago , april 15 the release of a landmark study of capital punishment in illinois reignited debate today on one of the country s most contentious topics , with people on both sides saying the breadth of the proposed changes would severely reduce the number of death sentences , if not eliminate them opponents of the death penalty embraced the study s 85 recommendations , made by a bipartisan commission , as evidence that abolishing capital punishment is more practical than trying to ensure it is administered fairly prosecutors , meanwhile , denounced the commission for skirting the question of whether the 160 people now on death row in illinois should be executed and said the laundry list of changes would leave heinous killers unpunished gov george ryan , who appointed the 14 members of the commission after declaring a halt to executions two years ago , accepted the report this afternoon , flipped through its 207 pages and said he would spend weeks or months reviewing it before determining the fate of the condemned i'm not going to act in haste , i'm going to deliberate , mr ryan said at a news conference where advocates held signs saying abolish the death penalty behind a phalanx of television cameras i 'll do what i think is right , and what we have to do based on this commission s work the report lands at a challenging time , politically the illinois legislature s spring session ends in a month and is expected to be dominated by negotiations to cover the budget shortfall mr ryan , the commission s champion , is a lame duck who opted against running for reelection and has been tarred by a political corruption scandal in an election year , lawmakers are loath to approve expensive proposals , like those in the report , particularly if they can be perceived as soft on crime regardless of when or whether the specific recommendations are adopted , experts said the report would reframe discussion already , senator russell d feingold , democrat of wisconsin , announced that his subcommittee on the constitution would convene a hearing this spring to consider the findings illinois has been a focal point of the capital punishment debate , in part because 13 death row prisoners have been exonerated since the state reestablished capital punishment in 1997 , and this report is the most thorough , independent analysis of the system to date nine other states have similar commissions two have already released their reports i think we 're in the phase where we 're making a policy determination , not so much a moral determination , but a practicality determination , said richard c deiter , executive director of the death penalty information center in washington this says it s going to be very difficult to have the death penalty that americans want , which is one that does n't risk innocent lives and is implemented fairly while the commission stopped short of calling for the abolition of the death penalty , the report acknowledged that a majority of members believed it should be stopped in presenting the report , commission members said that without a complete overhaul , the capital punishment system could not be trusted repair or repeal , declared thomas p sullivan , a former federal prosecutor in private practice , who was a cochairman of the commission with former senator paul simon and frank mcgarr , a former federal judge fix the capital punishment system or abolish it , mr sullivan said there is no other principled recourse prosecutors said the proposals to videotape interrogations of suspects and establish a state panel to review decisions on whether to seek the death penalty undercut local authority and would be impractical they were outraged at the proposed elimination of several categories of capital crimes , especially murder committed in the course of a felony they scoffed at the need for an independent forensic laboratory what this report does , said kevin p lyons , the state s attorney in peoria , is brick by brick , stone by stone , rock by rock , place added burdens on the shoulders of every prosecutor so as to eventually say , 'oh , the heck with it' mr lyons added , it clearly upsets the balance between protecting the rights of the accused and protecting the rights of the rest of us joshua k marquis , a prosecutor from astoria , ore , who is on the board of the national district attorneys association , objected to the proposed prohibition on sentencing someone to death based solely on the testimony of a single eyewitness , a jailhouse informer or an accomplice he also said videotaping was impractical , noting that in his last capital case , one suspect made incriminating statements as he was being rescued from a fiery boat death penalty opponents celebrated the commission s report but , in many cases , read it as a call for a permanent moratorium the commission s recognition that no system can be devised to ensure that an innocent person would not be executed is strong support for replacement of the death penalty , the illinois coalition against the death penalty said in a news release amnesty international called on mr ryan to extend the moratorium until all 85 recommendations are implemented and said the report provides a profound rationale for abolishing the death penalty altogether mr ryan acknowledged the tough political climate and huge budgetary hurdles the proposals faced but promised he would not be deterred from pursuing the commission s recommendations , if he accepted them we 're talking about life and death here , he said , we 're not talking about whether you win or lose an election photo gov george ryan of illinois scanned the death penalty report yesterday as former senator paul simon spoke for the panel that produced it \( associated press \)
a federal appeals court has issued a ruling in a case involving compaq computer that tax experts say will make it much more difficult for the internal revenue service to demolish many corporate tax shelters some experts predicted that tax shelter promoters would quickly take advantage of the ruling to fashion new shelters for corporations to shed billions of dollars in taxes this is disastrous for the integrity of the tax system , said david a weisbach , a university of chicago law professor who has argued in several articles that congress must prevent corporations from using a patina of legitimacy to justify tax shelters compaq itself agreed that the ruling narrows the definition of prohibited tax shelters that seems to be the gist of the decision , said ben k wells , treasurer of the company , whose tax shelter was upheld in a ruling by the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit in new orleans the ruling greatly narrows the sort of deals that the internal revenue service can disallow as having no purpose besides tax avoidance federal law allows companies to cut taxes when they engage in legitimate deals but not when tax savings are the sole purpose the court , agreeing with compaq , said its deals involved risks , however tiny , of profit or loss and , therefore were legitimate business transactions for tax purposes the irs says that abusive corporate tax shelters are its most serious enforcement problem corporations have acknowledged saving at least 147 billion in 2000 through the use of tax shelters , many of them illegal , the irs said last week the agency has described this amount as just the tip of an iceberg and announced a program to waive penalties for companies that acknowledge using tax shelters and name the promoters none of the transactions affected by the court s ruling involved individuals the ruling , issued on friday and published yesterday in the journal tax notes , overturned a 1999 united states tax court decision that compaq had improperly reduced its 1992 income tax bill through a series of huge , rapidfire stock trades in 46 trades , compaq bought , and then immediately sold back , more than 900 million of royal dutch shell stock in one hour on sept 16 , 1992 the trades were intended to let compaq receive a tax credit for dutch taxes on shell dividends compaq , which did not have to pay these taxes , used the credit to reduce its american income taxes by 27 million , the court said compaq says it was a minor customer of the tax shelter promoter , twentyfirst securities , a new york investment boutique that helps investors reduce taxes twentyfirst securities said that contrary to the government s contention , tax avoidance was not compaq s main goal i obviously thought that compaq had done this just to make money , and it did not have a lot to do with taxes , said robert gordon , the firm s president i am glad that the court came to this conclusion the crucial issue in the case was whether the trades were bona fide transactions that carried a potential for profit and a risk of loss , as compaq argued , or were shams intended solely to avoid taxes , as the irs contended in a carefully arranged strategy , compaq bought the royal dutch shell stock and then sold it moments later at a lower price the difference in price represented the value of the dutch tax credit , which was about 45 cents a share the irs tried to show that compaq faced little , if any , risk from the trades because it owned the stock for only a few moments and the prices almost perfectly captured the value of the dutch tax credit the stock used in the trades belonged to pension funds and other taxexempt organizations for whom the dutch tax credit was worthless because they do not pay income taxes compaq said that because the trades were performed on the floor of the new york stock exchange at market prices , they involved real risk other traders could exercise their right to jump into the transactions and offer higher or lower prices , compaq said but none did judge edith h jones , in a 14page opinion , held that just the possibility of other traders interrupting the bidding was enough to make the trades bona fide for tax purposes judge jones acknowledged that the risk of changes in the price of the stock in such rapid trades was minimal the absence of risk that can legitimately be eliminated does not make a transaction a sham , she wrote judges jerry e smith and harold r demoss jr joined in the decision tax experts say the ruling could apply to a broad range of taxsaving transactions in which the apparent business risks have been virtually eliminated through sophisticated financial strategies david p hariton , a leading tax lawyer in new york , said he was neither for or against tax shelters , but he found great significance in the court s ruling the decision suggests that there are at least some financial transactions that are permissible even though they are designed solely to obtain tax benefits , mr hariton said the interesting question is , which ones \? the lawyer who argued the case for compaq , mark a oates of baker mckenzie in chicago , drew the point more narrowly the fact that you can diversify most risk away , or hedge it , does not mean that you had a riskfree transaction , he said the latest ruling is similar to one last year involving alliant , the old iowa electric industries in that case the tax court held that the trades were shams , but the united states court of appeals for the third circuit in st louis disagreed in that case , most of the trades were done in the middle of the night in a private office in amsterdam , where there was no risk that another trader might intervene treasury and justice department officials said last night that they were still analyzing the latest decision while an appeal is possible , the supreme court is generally reluctant to accept cases in which two circuit courts have reached similar conclusions

' the truth that he has stumbled upon and that the author plainly wishes to underscore is that human love can restore , renew , revive if rose is magical , it is simply because she is human , and because she loves to be sure , as l'heureux reminds us on nearly every page , people are imperfect , lacking in willpower , infirm in their beliefs , their lives cluttered and unfocused , their character traits largely impervious to change \( why ca n't i be humble \? moriarty asks why ca n't pigs fly \? \) yet love can work through them to effect wonders the human soul is the seedbed of the miraculous it is primarily through one another that we mortal millions encounter the divine all of which comes as a revelation to leblanc deep down , he secretly hates himself for his joie de vivre , his hunger for human contact , his eagerness to be liked by others what matters , he is convinced , is sacrifice what matters is to obliterate the self moriarty disagrees , branding such views as fascist spirituality leblanc s kremlin interrogator , monsignor glynn , puts it another way his young colleague , he maintains , has shut out god \( you do n't let him in , do you why not let him in \? \) in his soul , in short , leblanc is a blank the novel s epigraph , from deuteronomy , sums up l'heureux s message as bluntly as possible choose life and life is assuredly what l'heureux gives us himself a former priest and the author of a memoir entitled picnic in babylon a jesuit priest s journal not to mention several earlier novels , like tight white collar and the clang birds , about priests and nuns at odds with the church authorities l'heureux has created in the miracle a set of characters who feel fiercely authentic , not least in their contradictions , their changes of heart , their oscillations between strength and weakness , certitude and perplexity , ardor and apathy now and then , admittedly , this authenticity wavers a bit at times , for example , moriarty and glynn both of them good , wise , saltoftheearth clerics brush up against oldmovie stereotypes \( moriarty , cantankerous as barry fitzgerald in going my way , refuses to call his ailment lou gehrig s disease it s my own goddamn disease , not some baseball player s \) similarly , rose s failure , after mandy s reawakening , to even think of securing professional help or institutional care for the plainly selfdestructive girl or , at the very least , to make more of an effort to keep her away from her drugaddict boyfriend may strain some readers' credulity , even if others find this inconsistency thoroughly human nor , frankly , is it entirely credible when leblanc who appears to know the entire score of gypsy turns out to be heterosexual for all its realistic texture , the miracle is also shot through with touches of biblical symbolism mandy s resurrection , like the last supper , takes place in an upper room the building s owner is named sal , as in salvation none of this , fortunately , is overstated on the contrary , one of the accomplishments of l'heureux s novel which is written in swiftmoving prose of unaffected simplicity is that , despite its nakedly upbeat message , it comes off as neither pat nor preachy but , rather , as a delicately nuanced portrait of recognizably human individuals making what they can of life drawing \( nicole schooley \)
investment bankers , start your engines that was essentially the message to wall street and the media industry yesterday as a federal appeals court in washington unleashed what is expected to be a major wave of deal making , with the titans of the television business snapping up their smaller brethren unless the supreme court overturns the rulings , the decisions will allow a single company to own both a cable television system and a local broadcaster in the same market in addition , yesterday s rulings threw into serious doubt a rule that currently prevents a single company from owning broadcast stations reaching more than 35 percent of the nation s television households in the wake of the rulings , the federal communications commission could increase that 35 percent figure to perhaps 50 percent , or it could eliminate the cap altogether either way , the rulings will probably prompt executives at companies including the news corporation , viacom and the walt disney company , which each own many television stations already , to seriously consider expanding their empires by acquisition moreover , major players in the cable television market like aol time warner and cox enterprises can now consider significantly expanding their relatively small broadcasting operations this sets the stage for an enormous relandscaping of the media business , probably over the next three years , said larry gerbrandt , the chief content officer of kagan worldwide media this should ignite the deal market we 'll see a whole new set of combinations possible out there many of the most profitable broadcast stations are already owned by big companies but there are still plenty of smaller and midsize broadcasters with valuable properties , including the belo corporation meredith and scrippshoward , which is owned by e w scripps if the 35 percent cap is relaxed significantly , as is expected , the companies in broadcasting s second tier could prove attractive acquisition candidates for the industry s giants and could also consolidate among themselves if we get to a landrush mentality , who knows what could happen , said thomas wolzien , a media analyst with sanford c bernstein my guess is that companies with 15 billion to 30 billion market cap , like gannett and tribune , will have incentive to make some serious moves one senior executive at a large owner of broadcast stationssaid all the companies will get the message you have to get bigger or sell all the market forces will be pushing toward acquisitions local broadcast stations are attractive assets because they are among the most profitable businesses in the media world networks like abc and cbs generally pay their affiliates to distribute their programming and the local broadcasters transmit the network programs with very little commensurate cost the networks make their profits by retaining most of the advertising time on their programs for instance , the news corporation s 33 local television stations had 526 million of revenue in the final quarter of 2001 while generating 259 million in earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization or cash flow for an ebitda margin of almost 50 percent that is excellent for just about any sort of business , especially in a poor advertising market in fact , the news corporation reaped more cash flow from its local broadcast group in the last quarter than from any of its other myriad farflung divisions given the profitability of local stations , it was no surprise that yesterday s statements from the media behemoths could have been written by a common hand aol time warner , the news corporation and viacom each blandly said that it was pleased by the decisions describing the rules at issue , the news corporation used the word outdated , nbc chose antiquated , while aol time warner and viacom opted for anachronism a disney spokesman declined to comment yesterday s decisions have perhaps the most intriguing implications for aol time warner , which owns the nation s no 2 cable operation with about 128 million subscribers time warner cable s biggest market is new york city , followed in size by tampa , fla the orlando , fla , area houston and the raleigh , nc , area until yesterday , aol time warner could not own local broadcast television stations in any of those markets , or in any of its other cable markets it could own stations in markets where it has no cable presence , like chicago and san francisco , but the company had decided against getting serious about the local television business with so many important markets beyond its reach that is why the wb network , owned by aol time warner , had not owned its own broadcasting stations , though its minority partner , the tribune company , owns 17 wb stations for now , aol time warner owns only one broadcast station , the tbs superstation , which is broadcast over the air in atlanta after yesterday , that could all change if yesterday s rulings are not overturned , aol time warner will have many reasons to consider acquiring local broadcast stations or even a major network
chicago , june 10 the man suspected of plotting a radioactive bomb attack , a brooklynborn hispanic catholic who converted to islam when he married a middle eastern woman , had a lengthy criminal record in two states the record started with an arrest in connection with a murder when he was a teenager , according to law enforcement officials and court records in 1985 , the man , born jose padilla to puerto rican parents but later known as abdullah almuhajir , told the police that after his friend stabbed a stranger in a chicago alley , mr padilla , who was 14 , kicked the victim in the head because he felt like it , a police report said while in jail in florida in 1992 , mr padilla pushed an officer and said , if you touch me , you do n't know what i 'll do to you , recalled the officer , marc albino of the broward county sheriff s department mr padilla , now 31 , served time in a juvenile detention center in illinois and later in a florida prison , though neighbors here and on long island , where he lived with his pregnant wife in 1994 , remembered him as quiet and goodnatured he has the same face he did when he was a child , norma leon , 47 , said this afternoon after seeing his photograph on the internet for a decade ms leon shared a house with mr padilla s family in the logan square neighborhood of chicago i do n't believe it , she said , but then again , people do change donna newman , a new york lawyer who represented mr padilla from his arrest on may 8 on a material witness warrant at o'hare international airport until his transfer this weekend to a military brig in south carolina , said , the issue is civil liberties , and that s the real issue because he is an american she added , it s very strange indeed when the defense counsel is not told he is being moved , ms newman added the story of how a chicago street criminal may have become an operative for al qaeda baffled law enforcement officials and gang experts mr padilla s path is strikingly different from that of john walker lindh , the american who the government says joined the taliban after growing up in a liberal , affluent family in california s bay area before traveling to pakistan and afghanistan to find himself through islam though many blacks become muslims while in prison , conversions are rare among hispanic gang members mr padilla s mother , estrela ortegalebron , had told friends that her son joined a cult victor olds , ms ortegalebron s lawyer , said that today s announcement regarding the socalled dirty bomb plot caught her off guard and that before mr padilla s arrest at o'hare , where he arrived from pakistan , via zurich , with 10 , 000 , his mother , who lives in florida , thought he was coming home to visit the family she knows that he was in the middle east for a while , mr olds said , but there is nothing else she knows a highranking law enforcement official in new york said that mr padilla had hatched a plan for exploding a dirty bomb himself and that it was unclear whether it had been embraced by al qaeda leaders or whether a site had been picked he might have been distrusted , the official said , maybe because he was not arab or he was a convert mr padilla moved to chicago as a child of 4 or 5 , living with his mother , who worked in hotels , and several halfsiblings , neighbors said he played baseball and basketball at the school across the street from the graystone house where he slept on a bunk bed in a room off the kitchen one landlord recalled teaching the boy to drive a blue 1965 chevy in an empty lincoln park lot another said he was diligent about doing his chores , hauling out garbage and cleaning his room but in 1985 , mr padilla was arrested in chicago in connection with an armed robbery turned homicide he told the police that he and a friend had decided to rob a pair of mexican gang members because they were drunk court documents show they took a watch , 107 and some mexican currency the victims chased the robbers , leading to the stabbing mr padilla was prosecuted as a juvenile mr padilla s records are sealed because of his age at the time , but he is believed to have spent three years in juvenile detention the prosecutor at the trial where his partner was convicted of murder said in a closing statement that mr padilla punched , kicked and clubbed a victim with a baseball bat court records show that mr padilla , using aliases , was arrested twice in 1989 , for assault and battery and for trespassing , and failed to report to his probation officer two months in a row , prompting an arrest warrant two years later , he faced weapons charges after being caught on chicago s west side with an unregistered 357 magnum smith wesson , police records show at one point , he identified himself as a member of the latin disciples gang mr padilla apparently jumped bail and , soon after , got in trouble 1 , 355 miles away , in sunrise , fla , near his mother s home he was sentenced to 364 days in jail after a traffic accident in which he fired a revolver toward a car 20 to 25 feet away , according to police reports he was resisting our commands , he was reaching for the gun , said the arresting officer , lt charles vitale of the sunrise police he was 20 years old it was an angertype incident none of those prior incidents came out there were no links to organized crime or anything during our investigation sometime after his release in 1992 , mr padilla apparently married a muslim and adopted the name abdullah almuhajir carl christesen remembered watching him play with his son on the lawn of the house the family rented in a workingclass section of brentwood , ny , in 1994 here in chicago , neighbors said they last saw mr padilla , then known as mr muhajir , in 1995 , when he returned to logan square for the funeral of diego ojeda , the brother of his former landlady and father of his halfbrother nelly ojeda , mr ojeda s sister , said ms ortegalebron told her over the telephone several months ago that her son was doing fine i guess she never knew either , mrs ojeda , 63 , said sometimes we are the last to know photo nelly ojeda outside her home in chicago , where

oakland , calif although the jets' season ended in a black hole called raider nation that is terrifyingly , terrifically more like raider asylum , herman edwards can take solace in the fact that his team fought in the frenzied style befitting this dungeon up and down the field the offenses marched early in this game , and the drives on both sides finished with more fizzle than bang it was a kicking spree raiders convert three field goals , jets miss one , make one and have another blocked before tim brown scored the game s first touchdown on a 2yard catch with 22 seconds left in the first half oakland led , 163 , at halftime and then came a jets drive and touchdown to make it 1610 early in the third quarter and though the jets' offense would score on short touchdown passes on two thrilling fourthdown plays , the raiders' determination and speed won out , especially jerry rice \( 183 receiving yards \) and charlie garner \( an 80yard touchdown jaunt that sealed it \) the raiders advance , 3824 it is over for the jets but really , with herman edwards , it has just begun edwards was the answer for the owner , robert wood johnson iv , and general manager terry bradway to lead the jets deep into this new era of free agency , of players who are more partners than employees with the nfl and its owners , players who now have more freedom and more voice in his debut season , edwards led the jets to a 106 regularseason record and a decent playoff showing here he is the only coach of the six new ones hired last season to manage a winning record and make the playoffs he is the first jets coach in history to make the playoffs in his first season he is one of only 10 of the 88 coaches hired in the league since 1990 who have made the playoffs in their first season edwards guided the jets with a fresh brand of heartfelt fire and brimstone mixed with the usual steady dose of x s and o s edwards said he tried to coach his players up , not down , and that he offered them ownership of the team but made certain they understood that it was not for free i thought a lot over the last few years about what it would be like being a head coach , but i was not one of those guys who kept a log every year and tried to do it by following the football book 101 guide , edwards said the first thing i tried to do was make sure that whenever i stood before our owner , general manager or players , i was speaking from the heart i had a plan , but i wanted to be creative with it , he said football players are different from the way they were 20 years ago and if you do n't relate to them now , you have no shot i shared with them the road i had traveled after 11 years as an assistant and 10 years as a player i tried to give them ownership of the football team , but they had to give me something to get it the players today are more educated , much smarter , and i wanted them to have ownership with accountability , edwards said i tried to make them the system i tried to get them to understand that they should use their role to benefit not just themselves but all , the players here today and the ones to come tomorrow , in a team concept even before edwards got to that , he realized that he was entering a franchise that had a deep , dark and haunting history of harsh failures it permeated the building , he said , and all year long he fought it during the process , edwards has learned who his leaders are , who has the potential to lead , which players can perform and which ones cannot he has learned plenty about his coaching staff , who can stand in the fire , who works best with others and who he can depend on most it took the jets 17 games to finally find an offensive rhythm that could produce touchdowns the way they converted in the red zone late in the game tonight was astonishing , considering that all season long that was one of their worst failures at the very end , though , they returned to form , ending the game at the raiders' 1yard line , unable to punch the ball in before time expired the edwards jets have to fix this offense , and it starts , as all offenses do , at quarterback the jets will take a long , hard look at quarterback vinny testaverde my guess is the jets will opt for chad pennington next season or find quarterback help elsewhere the jets need more size and speed at receiver and a willingness to feature the passing game their interior defensive line needs help so does their secondary the big games from rice and garner and quarterback rich gannon showed edwards something he needs more bigplay guns and none of that you learn without going through those fires , edwards said i 've learned how certain people react to wins and losses and what we are lacking i 've defined it and we are going to go out and get what we need in the seasons to come but you ca n't get everything all at once it takes time the beauty of it for edwards is that he won while learning in his first season any coach in any sport will tell you that having success while building toward greater success is a precious luxury after this loss , this ending , edwards s head was bowed , but he was not broken as he has often said , he goes by faith , not by sight his plan is to build the jets steadily , infusing them with speed and confidence and fight in his image his opening makes most jets fans proud his encore is worth anticipating
raleigh , nc , april 19 after losing game 1 of the first round of the playoffs to carolina , bobby holik said the devils were not in a hole a hole is going to be if we lose the next game , holik said well , the defending twotime eastern conference champions are in a hole a deep one they will not dig themselves out of if they do n't start scoring more often the hurricanes took a twogamestonone lead in their series tonight when bates battaglia redirected a marek malik pass past martin brodeur at 15 minutes 26 seconds of overtime to give carolina their second consecutive 21 victory battaglia chopped down at the puck , which bounced off the ice and went into the top right corner of the net arturs irbe , carolina s 5foot8 goaltender , stopped 30 shots tonight and has made 64 saves in the series holik was at a loss to explain the devils' punchless offense i do n't have an answer , he said we tried to drive to the net more tonight being two games down is not the best situation to be in , but you cannot hang your heads there s nothing we can do about the first two games now it comes down to us scoring more goals that s the bottom line the last time the devils dropped the first two games of a playoff series was in 1994 against the boston bruins the devils won the series , 42 the series shifts to continental arena for games 3 and 4 on sunday and tuesday we have to go home and win our home games and then come back and win one here , the devils captain scott stevens said stevens was furious at a call by the officials that could have cost the devils the game the devils thought they had taken a 21 lead at 7 01 of the third period when brian rafalski blasted a slap shot from the right point through traffic for an apparent goal but the referees ruled that irbe had been interfered with by patrik elias elias was not called for a penalty , but the goal was disallowed because elias had hit irbe outside the crease i thought the crease was there for a reason , stevens said we made the creases bigger because we wanted to give the goalies more room if he comes out , a player may get pushed into him when asked about the call , elias said i thought it was a little shady , but what can you do \? we 've got to score more goals than just one on the gamewinning goal , malik was able to pinch in brian gionta s clearing attempt and flick the puck toward battaglia , who had parked himself in front of brodeur battaglia chopped down at the puck , which bounced off the ice and went into the top right corner of the net the defenseman threw a little bomb right in front of the net , said brodeur , who made 26 saves i do n't even know who scored the goal i'm not sure if i got it with my shoulder a little bit but it hit the post and went in all of the overtime , i do n't think we created much we were standing on our heels we have to score more goals we 've played well enough defensively to win these games even with joe nieuwendyk , who had missed game 1 with a stomach virus , and petr sykora , who missed the opener with a bruised right ankle , back in the lineup , irbe kept the devils at bay the devils could not score on five power plays , including one in the overtime both teams had good chances to take the lead late in the third period with about six and a half minutes left , battaglia hit the left post with a shot from the slot with less than two minutes remaining in regulation , sykora nearly gave the devils the lead , but irbe stopped him from pointblank range in the slot as the puck bounced off irbe s left shoulder i knew that was my chance , sykora said he made a great save on me holik , whom carolina coach paul maurice had called the big center iceman every team wants before the series started , opened the scoring 37 seconds into the second period holik , who is eligible to become an unrestricted free agent this summer after 10 seasons with the devils , scored between irbe s pads from just off the left wing post after the hurricanes' rookie center , erik cole , had left him all alone in front of the goal cole , who may have been the best player on the ice despite his defensive gaffe , made up for the mistake late in the second period , when he tied the score at 11 on the power play at 15 05 cole s second goal of the series came on a 3on2 rush it was set up by a magnificent nolook pass from battaglia that went between stevens s legs and through the slot as he was flying down the edge of the right circle , cole flubbed his onetimer , but the fluttering puck eluded brodeur on the far side , just inside the left wing post he missed the shot , brodeur said if he threw the shot where he wanted to , i'm sure i would have made the stop slap shots the devils' martin brodeur became the second goaltender in nhl history to make 100 consecutive playoff starts for one club brodeur joined colorado s patrick roy , who started his 106th consecutive game thursday night photos the devils' john madden leaving the ice while carolina s erik cole lifts bates battaglia , who scored the winner \( associated press \) \( pg d1 \) the hurricanes' bates battaglia , left , watching his redirected shot sail past the devils' martin brodeur and tommy albelin in overtime for the winning goal \( photographs by the associated press \) \( pg d4 \)
ever since president bush took office i 've had this feeling that the only serious opposition party in america , at least in foreign policy , was made up of three people , and none of them were democrats the only three people mr bush really worries about the only three people who could take big constituencies with them if they openly parted company with the president on an issue like iraq are colin powell , tony blair and john mccain what happened to the democrats \? well , i do n't buy their whining that their voices have been cynically drowned out by mr bush s focus on iraq the problem with the democrats is not that they are being drowned out by iraq the problem is that the democrats have nothing compelling to say on all the issues besides iraq iraq is winning control of the agenda by democratic default , not by republican design i spent the last month traveling the country on a book tour , during which i said that what worried me most after 9 11 was what kind of world my girls were going to grow up in i ran into so many americans who share that concern after a talk in atlanta , one guy came up to me , just opened his wallet and showed me the picture of his daughter he did n't say a word the point is that i can assure the democrats that while mr bush may be obsessed with iraq , most americans are worrying about their jobs , the stock market , the environment and the fact that their kids may not grow up in as open and peaceful a world as they did the biggest security concern of americans today is not iraq or osama it s the fear that america itself could be weakened by shortterm , greedy decisions , taken by politicians squandering our hardwon surplus or corporate executives squandering our pensions and undermining our markets and americans are right to be concerned because without a strong america holding the world together , and doing the right thing more often than not , the world really would be a hobbesian jungle because i believe that is what is really gnawing at americans , and because i believe that mr bush is not really addressing this broader concern but is still running on the momentum of his strong military performance right after 9 11 there is a leadership opportunity for bold democrats but where are they \? where are the democrats who are ready to argue forcefully that the future tax cuts that mr bush pushed through are utterly reckless and need to be repealed because they will erode the resources the government needs to remain a great power in this age of uncertainty \? and they send a terrible signal to our kids , corporate leaders and the world that all that matters is shortterm , mefirst gratification where are the democrats who would declare that the best way to enhance our security , make us better global citizens , reduce our dependence on middle east oil and leave a better planet for our kids is a manhattan project to develop a renewable energy source , along with greater conservation \? mr bush has totally ignored the longing by young americans to be drafted for such a grand project to strengthen america and so , too , have the democrats where are the democrats who would declare that confronting saddam is legitimate , but it must not be done without real preparation of the us public \? decapitating saddam s regime will take weeks building iraq into a more decent state , with a real civil society , will take years but it is this latter project that is the most important the one that really gets at the underlying threat from the middle east , which is its failed states but do we know how to do such nation rebuilding , and if we do , do americans want to pay for it \? we need to go in prepared for this task \( which is unavoidable if we really intend to disarm iraq \) or stay out and rely instead on more aggressive containment , because halfhearted nationbuilding always ends badly and would surely weaken us why are n't the democrats clarifying this \? at the moment , the bush team is leading the nation much more by fear than by hope the democrats can only win , or only deserve to win , if they can offer a bold alternative that would be a program for strengthening america based on hope not fear , substance not spin , a program that addresses the primary concern of americans now the future for the kids whose pictures they carry around in their wallets

birmingham , ala , nov 19 an alliance of environmental and civil rights groups filed a federal lawsuit here today in a lastditch effort to block the army from burning tons of chemical weapons in a populated area the suit demands that the army complete more environmental studies before proceeding with its plan to incinerate thousands of old shells containing nerve gas , mustard gas and other deadly agents at the anniston army depot the lawsuit contends that the plan should be halted so scientists can consider recently discovered , less risky alternatives the army plans to begin destroying the weapons early next year to stop the project , one of the issues the alliance must prove is that the weapons disposal poses an imminent danger to the community to place this burden on us is unacceptable , said brenda lindell , a homemaker who has been active in local causes in anniston , a city of 24 , 000 people 58 miles east of birmingham if there is an accident , there is no way to protect us what about our children \? what about our elderly \? what about those of us who like to be outside \? to help make anniston residents feel better , local officials said they would pass out gas masks and duct tape to seal homes that made most people feel worse they know it s not safe or they would n't be doing do that , said the rev abraham woods , president of the birmingham chapter of the southern christian leadership conference and i hate to play the race card , but it s always in communities with high proportions of minorities that the government is committed to using outdated , dangerous technologies anniston is about half white and half black the army , which houses 9 percent of the nation s chemical weapon stockpile at the anniston army depot , says that its process of burning chemical weapons at 2 , 700 degrees is completely safe and that no fumes that could hurt the public will be released the project has already safely eliminated 25 percent of the nation s total stockpile , including 38 percent of all munitions using the current technology , said michael b abrams , spokesman for the anniston chemical agent disposal facility local officials , though , say they are not ready for the burning to begin they are still waiting to obtain bids for gas masks and other equipment the project has already been delayed several months opponents of the plan called a news conference today on the steps of the federal courthouse in downtown birmingham , where the suit was filed , but the turnout was sparse several environmental lawyers accused the army of taking advantage of what they called alabama s lax environmental laws and its image as backwoods and poor they 're treating us like a third world country , said byron bart slawson , who helped draft the suit there are other plants that burn old chemical weapons , including ones on johnston island in the pacific ocean and at tooele , utah , in the great salt lake desert but none are in populated areas the anniston plant is in a hilly region surrounded by churches , parks , schools , fastfood restaurants and homes despite the repeated assurances from army officials , people here expect trouble they have been told that a shrill whoopwhoop is the most serious of several publicaddress siren tones , signaling a major disaster they have studied evacuation plans army officers now acknowledge that more than 800 mortar shells and m55 rockets are leaking , though only trace amounts , of deadly nerve gas the lawsuit , which seeks a preliminary injunction against the army , is similar to suits filed in other states , including one pending in oregon , but few have prevailed the anniston suit has three parts , with the first arguing that the government is obligated , under federal environmental law , to research safer alternatives to burning weapons in the past few years , scientists have discovered how to neutralize weapons with chemicals , but the last environmental impact study the army did for the anniston plant was in 1995 , before much of that research was done the second part of the suit says burning weapons creates imminent and substantial endangerment to public health the third says the army knowingly misrepresented and underestimated the risks and impacts of the emissions on minority populations mr abrams , the army spokesman , declined to comment on the specifics of the lawsuit photo an army plan to incinerate chemical weapons at this site in anniston , ala , is under attack from environmentalists and civil rights groups \( grant bankenship the gadsden times \)
on dec 6 , 1999 , att replaced the chief of its huge business services division , michael g keith , after barely nine months on the job to the outside world , it appeared that c michael armstrong , the company s chairman and chief executive , had moved mr keith to the company s wireless unit simply because he was not getting the job done now some people close to att say mr keith was actually transferred mostly because his division could not match the reported profit margins of its biggest competitor , worldcom he was being held to worldcom s margins and he was screaming to armstrong that it could n't be possible and so he got moved out , one person who was close to mr keith recalled last week it now turns out that the pressure that was put on him and on att generally was based on a false assumption and that happened across the industry worldcom s announcement last week that it had misrecorded 38 billion in costs has forced the company to the brink of bankruptcy the ranks of the losers are legion employees , investors , perhaps even consumers in some ways , however , the most farreaching effects of the financial shenanigans at companies like worldcom , global crossing and qwest were the dislocations and costs they caused for the companies that tried to compete with them it is even possible that had it not been for att s inevitable comparisons to worldcom , mr armstrong would not have felt compelled to set the company on the path to a threeway breakup as worldcom and qwest , in particular , reported spectacular growth and gross profit margins as much as 62 percent at worldcom and 70 percent at qwest in recent years they made their peers seem sluggish and they may have compelled those companies to alter and even distort their strategies in an attempt to keep up our performance did not quite compare and we were blaming ourselves william t esrey , chief executive of sprint , the no 3 longdistance company , said in an interview last week mr esrey echoed other senior telecommunications executives in saying that the vicious price wars that decimated the longdistance industry in the 1990 s were driven by an unsustainable , almost irrational pursuit of growth we did n't understand what we were doing wrong , he said we were like , 'what are we missing here \? ' several top executives said last week that competing against worldcom for the attention of investors and wall street analysts in recent years was essentially like running track against an athlete who is later discovered to be using steroids a bird seye view of the numbers can illuminate the pressures on older companies in 2001 , for instance , worldcom reported a gross profit margin of 62 percent while qwest reported 64 percent the comparable figures were 50 percent for att and 51 percent for sprint last week , worldcom acknowledged misreporting its costs only as far back as the first quarter of 2001 , yet the securities and exchange commission had already begun an inquiry into worldcom s accounting going back as far as the beginning of 1999 the costs of trying to keep up with the industry s highfliers may have extended far beyond the individual travails of executives like mr keith , who is now a senior executive at att wireless , an independent company , and who declined to comment \( some other people close to att say that mr keith really was removed from the businessservices unit because he was not up to his job \) in october 2000 , att announced that it would break itself into three separate companies with four separate stocks it made the move for many reasons , and some seem rational no matter how many of its competitors might have operated fraudulently nonetheless , it now appears at least possible that had it not been for comparisons with some bad seeds like worldcom , att could still be one company in the months leading up to the breakup announcement , att s shares had been hammered by investors concerned about the company s cable strategy and because wall street did not believe that att s core operations were being run as well as , say , worldcom s wall street was more than captivated by these new guys they were eating the lotus leaves and it made companies like att and sprint look stodgy in comparison , said howard anderson , an investor who founded the yankee group , a research firm in boston there was never any question that in terms of the strength and reliability of the network , none of these new guys compared to att att made a lot of legitimate moves and the stock market did not reward them and in fact they were punished in the end , that helped lead to the breakup charles h noski , att s vice chairman , said the factors that prompted the company s breakup ranged far beyond its stock price nonetheless , he agreed that competing against worldcom for the hearts and minds of investors at times seemed sisyphean we were constantly dissecting all of the public information about worldcom and we would scratch our heads and try to figure out how they were doing it , mr noski said we were certainly frustrated because we could n't figure it out we sort of absorbed the beating and kept our heads down and kept trying to get better sprint s time of trial
kibbutz yad mordechai , israel , june 23 it was on a lonely hill here , swept by salt breezes off the mediterranean , that munio brandwein helped lead a tiny band of jewish immigrants from poland in a sixday stand against an overwhelming egyptian force marching north toward tel aviv that was in may 1948 , after israel declared its independence and found itself in its first fight for survival now 89 years old , a greatgrandfather with faded hearing but crystalline blue eyes , mr brandwein thought back today on that struggle , when the new israelis had no armor and few bullets he compared it to the conflict now , when an israel with stateoftheart tanks and jet fighters faces off against palestinians equipped with semiautomatic rifles , homemade rockets , and homegrown bombs it was worse then , he said of the security situation but the mood is worse now there is frustration today , because of the difference between the ability the physical ability and the moral limitations for all israel s power , he said , it could not shoot and bomb its way out of this conflict what we could do , we ca n't do morally , politically , he said like many israelis , mr brandwein is ready to try something different , though , like perhaps all israelis , he is not sure exactly what he would like to see some intensive diplomacy this spring , israel conducted its biggest ground offensive in 20 years , sending its forces into the west bank in a bid to destroy what prime minister ariel sharon called the infrastructure of terror israeli officials predicted that the operation would quell any wave of terrorism for months but within weeks , each of the major palestinian factions renewed its violence now , the israeli army is widening its raids into the west bank and threatening to seize territory , though defense minister benjamin beneliezer has warned that such actions , which he called necessary , help create more suicide bombers one of the first acts of the kibbutzniks here in 1943 was to build a perimeter fence , and mr brandwein is willing to try a fence along the west bank boundary but he favors that only as a shortterm move this is a murky time in israel , a time of softening israeli confidence in the israeli government , but none at all in the intentions of yasir arafat , the palestinian leader israel issued yet another emergency callup of reserves today in this peaceful but anxious kibbutz an oasis of honeybees , crimson bougainvillea and fragrant orange groves , hewn from the dunes less than a mile north of the gaza strip one woman spoke sadly of a soninlaw called up three times during the life of his sixmonthold daughter one of israel s surveillance drones buzzed above the kibbutz today , as it often does all night , residents said people are getting used to the idea of getting used to violence , of living with fear of their children boarding a bus and accepting images of israeli tanks rolling through emptied palestinian streets but the mighthavebeens still torment some for almost two years , israel has been winning the war against the palestinians , while losing all the while , nahum barnea , the dean of israeli political columnists , wrote on friday in the newspaper yediot ahronot the process repeats itself so much that it is boring , on the brink of losing the public s interest the deterioration towards the chasm is almost unfelt , he continued only when you remember how things were seven or eight years ago , how we grew from month to month , how masses of exisraelis , immigrants and tourists lined up at the country s gates , how much energy , adrenaline , talent and optimism erupted here , all at once , like a waterfall in the desert , like a miracle , do you understand how far we have fallen but who remembers \? mr brandwein remembers so much he remembers forming his kibbutz in poland in the 1930 s , then sneaking illegally into britishgoverned palestine , in hopes of becoming one of the first jewish fishermen , he thought , in 2 , 000 years eventually , the jewish national fund bought land for the kibbutz here the british permitted the jewish settlers only six guns , but they smuggled in more and hid them in the sand they dug trenches and fortified their fence mr brandwein remembers sending the children off and digging in with 129 men and women from the kibbutz and 20 soldiers from the embryonic army , armed with 55 light weapons , a mortar and a machine gun they faced a brigade of more than 2 , 000 egyptians with tanks and artillery in a battlefield memorial , the trenches still line one hill here , a tank still sits where the israelis destroyed it , and one field swarms with iron figures of attacking egyptians , each with a metal helmet curiously resembling a bowler hat after six days , the israelis retreated 23 had been killed and 35 wounded israel estimates that 300 egyptians were killed or wounded less than six months later , mr brandwein , by then a soldier , was back the kibbutzniks built again despite that bloodstained history , mr brandwein longs for israeliarab relations , not separation one of the children sent off to safety in 1948 , ilan meiri now 59 had little patience for mr brandheim s sentiment your generation was very nice but very na ve toward the arabs , he said for mr meiri , only separation holds out hope at the heart of the kibbutz is a statue of mordechai anilevicz , a leader of the warsaw ghetto uprising against the nazis he died in the fighting there in 1943 my last , largest goal in life has been fulfilled , reads the inscription the jewish selfdefense has become a fact mr brandwein expressed no doubt about israel s ability to survive it s not a question , he said the question is how to go through it without major upheaval photo munio brandwein , 89 , a founder of kibbutz yad mordechai , stands before a statue of the kibbutz s namesake , a warsaw ghetto fighter \( rina castelnuovo the new york times \)
following are excerpts from the house debate yesterday on the use of force against iraq , as recorded by the new york times speakers included the minority leader , richard a gephardt , democrat of missouri the majority leader , dick armey , republican of texas the republican whip , tom delay of texas and representative nancy pelosi , democrat of california representative gephardt let me say to my colleagues and my constituents in missouri why i 've decided to vote for this resolution first , sept 11 has made all the difference the events of that tragic day jolted us to the enduring reality that terrorists not only seek to attack our interests abroad but also to strike us here at home we have clear evidence now that they even desire to use weapons of mass destruction against us before 9 11 we experienced the terrorist attacks on khobar towers , the uss cole , on two embassies in africa but we did n't believe it would happen here on 9 11 it did happen here and it can happen again sept 11 was the ultimate wakeup call we must now do everything in our power to prevent further terrorist attacks and ensure that an attack with a weapon of mass destruction cannot happen the consequences of such an attack are unimaginable we spent 50 years in a cold war and trillions of dollars deterring a weapon of mass destruction attack on the united states by another country now we must prevent such an attack by terrorists who , unlike our previous adversaries , are willing to die in these new circumstances deterrence well may not work with these new dangers prevention must work if you 're worried about terrorists getting weapons of mass destruction or their components from countries , the first candidate you worry about is iraq the 12year history of the un effort to disarm iraq convinces me that iraq is a problem that must be dealt with , diplomatically if we can , militarily if we must i did not come to this view overnight it has instead evolved over time as we have learned the facts about the iraqi regime with clarity as you know , i opposed the use of force against iraq in 1991 in favor of giving sanctions more time to work others supported force but thought that by dislodging iraq from kuwait we would neutralize the threat in hindsight both of these assessments were wrong in 1991 , no one knew the extent to which saddam hussein would sacrifice the needs of his people in order to sustain his hold on power , deceive the international community in order to preserve his weapons of mass destructions programs or take hostile actions against us interests in the region saddam hussein s track record is too compelling to ignore and we know that he continues to develop weapons of mass destruction including nuclear devices and he may soon have the ability to have a nuclear weapon against other nations i believe we have an obligation to protect the united states by preventing him from getting these weapons and either using them himself or passing them or their components on to terrorists who share his destructive intent as i stated in a speech in june , i believe we must confront the threat posed by the current iraqi regime directly but given the stakes involved and the potential risks to our security and the region , we must proceed carefully and deliberately that s why i felt it was essential to engage in negotiations in order to craft an effective and responsible authorization for the force , if necessary , so we can defend our nation and enforce un resolutions pertaining to iraq at the insistence of many of us , the resolution includes a provision urging president bush to continue his efforts to get the un to effectively enforce its own resolutions against iraq i have told the president directly on numerous occasions that in my view and in the view of a lot of us he must do everything he possibly can to achieve our objectives with the support of the united nations his speech to the un on sept 12 was an excellent beginning to this effort exhausting all efforts at the un is essential but let s remember why we started the un over 50 years ago we remain the greatest advocate of the rule of law , both domestically and internationally we must do everything we can to get the un to succeed it s in our own selfinterest to do that in 1945 , harry truman told the senate that the creation of the un constituted , in his words , an expression of national necessity he said the un points down the only road to enduring peace he said , let us not hesitate to start down that road with god s help and with firm resolve that we can and will reach our goal of peace and security for all americans completely bypassing the un would set a dangerous precedent that would undoubtedly be used by other countries in the future to our and the world s detriment it s too high a price to pay i'm glad that the president said in his speech monday that diplomacy is the first choice for resolving this matter this resolution also limits the scope and duration of the president s authority to use force it requires presidential determinations before our armed forces may be used against iraq , including assurances to congress that he has pursued all diplomatic means to address this threat and that any military action will not undermine our ongoing efforts against terrorism
two months after america s roman catholic bishops adopted broad new policies to defuse a sexual abuse crisis , 31 bishops say they have moved swiftly to remove or suspend 114 priests , throwing dozens of parishes into turmoil , according to a survey of the nation s dioceses by the new york times but despite the bishops' overwhelming vote at their june meeting in dallas to strip past abusers of their collars and ministries , many bishops have not yet lived up to that promise some bishops say they have not acted because they need more time to revamp the local church panels that review abuse cases , the survey found others are hesitating until they see whether the vatican accepts the new american policies we 're waiting for instructions from rome as to how to proceed , said the rev kevin slattery , a spokesman for the diocese of jackson , miss , where several priests accused of abuses were suspended before the dallas conference but have not been permanently removed from ministry in addition , 55 dioceses said they had not yet appointed a coordinator to offer pastoral care to victims of sexual abuse one of the simpler mandates in the dallas policy , the charter for the protection of children and young people the bishops intended their resolution in dallas to be the turning point to restore trust in a church torn by scandal , and indeed they have galvanized dioceses across the country to initiate a flurry of measures to prevent sexual abuse many are recruiting laypeople to serve on diocesan boards that review abuse cases , conducting background checks on church employees and setting up abuse awareness programs for parents and staff the times surveyed the nation s 194 dioceses by telephone late last month and early this month of the 177 roman catholic and 17 eastern rite dioceses that were contacted , 119 responded 18 of those declined to answer some of the questions it is clear from the results that the bishops are still struggling to realize the zero tolerance promise they made in dallas to sweep the church clean of every priest who ever abused a child in some dioceses , like chicago and detroit , years of controversy may be ahead as priests removed from ministry prepare to appeal their removal in church courts many bishops have avoided disciplining priests they regard more as brothers than employees spokesmen in dioceses like jackson said their bishops had made no moves because the vatican might refuse to give its approval , known as a recognitio , to the bishops' charter there is some hesitation on the part of the bishops , said the rev robert j silva , president of the national federation of priests councils , a coalition of diocesan priests' groups because if they go ahead and implement the charter and then the recognitio does n't come , then they 'd have to undo what they 've done msgr francis maniscalco , the spokesman for the united states conference of catholic bishops , said , our impression is that quite a few bishops did move very quickly after dallas to remove abusive priests who were in ministry others have said they want to see the vatican s reaction , monsignor maniscalco said but that should n't leave the impression that priests are being left in situations where they can harm children in only a handful of cases have bishops asked the vatican to take the more drastic step of permanently removing a cleric from the priesthood , a process known as laicization , the survey found one of those priests is in phoenix , and has served a prison sentence two priests in chicago have requested their own laicizations a vatican spokesman , joaquin navarro valls , has said that the bishops' dallas charter is now under careful review , and he could not predict when the vatican would have its response the document must pass muster at many vatican departments , including those that oversee priestly life and church doctrine , to ensure that it does not run afoul of church law and theology there is concern among some vatican officials and church experts that the american bishops' policy is too punitive , tipping the scales to the point where , these authorities believe , priests are not given the protection they should have from the church some critics in the vatican have chastised the bishops for giving in to secular pressure the american bishops are asking the vatican to alter some provisions in canon law for the church in the united states , including dropping the church s statute of limitations on sexual abuse cases some church sources have recently speculated that the roman curia may reject aspects of the bishops' policy , but monsignor maniscalco said the bishops had received no such indication the bishops are aware they are requesting something that will have to be exceptional law in this country , meaning that it is an exception from the law of the rest of the church , monsignor maniscalco said it is a lot to ask , but we think it is worth asking for in their charter , the bishops agreed to permanently remove from ministry any priest who committed even one abusive act against a child , to report every abuse accusation against priests to government authorities , to conduct background checks on all church employees who work with children , to establish abuse prevention programs and to appoint special ministers to help abuse victims as well as lay committees known as review boards to assess accusations against priests in the telephone survey , carried out by the times' news research and other staff , church officials were asked to review their compliance with each of those commitments

washington , may 8 robert s mueller iii , the director of the federal bureau of investigation , acknowledged today at a senate hearing that his agency had paid too little attention to a july 2001 memorandum written by an fbi agent in phoenix who detected a disturbing pattern of middle eastern men attending american flight training schools should we have done more in terms of the phoenix ec \? mr mueller said of the memorandum , referring to it as an electronic communication yes several democratic senators at the judiciary committee hearing criticized what they said was the bureau s tepid response to the memorandum s conclusions , suggesting that the fbimay have missed a chance , two months before the attacks , to investigate arab men at american flight schools only one paragraph of the classified memorandum has been made public but government officials have said the bureau agent concluded in the document that a number of arab men with possible ties to terrorism had attended flight schools he urged the bureau to conduct a nationwide review today , mr mueller defended the agency s handling of the memorandum he said that the memorandum mentioned several people by name but that none were found to have had any ties to the 19 hijackers one or more may still be under investigation , and some could have ties to terrorist groups he made a recommendation that we initiate a program to look at flight schools , mr mueller said of the agent that was received at headquarters it was not acted on by sept 11th i should say in passing that even if we had followed those suggestions at that time , it would not , given what we know since sept 11 , have enabled us to prevent the attacks of sept 11 mr mueller said the recommendation to investigate middle eastern men in flight schools was regarded at the time as a monumental undertaking without any specificity as to particular persons , the individuals who were being investigated but some senators seemed unwilling to accept mr mueller s assurances and the prickly exchanges between mr mueller and democratic senators indicated how sentiment in congress had swung sharply away from the prevailing mood after the attacks back then , lawmakers seemed unwilling to criticize agencies , like the bureau and the central intelligence agency , which were trying to thwart fresh attacks under questioning , mr mueller said he doubted that the memorandum was reviewed at a senior level by agency directors he said he did not believe that the memorandum had been sent to the joint ciafbi counterterrorism center mr mueller added that he did not believe that the agents who investigated zacarias moussaoui , whom the government says was intended to be the 20th hijacker , in august had been told of the phoenix memorandum senator dianne feinstein , democrat of california , said the memorandum was much more consequential than many of them that i read on almost a daily basis now , much fuller , much more descriptive ms feinstein added , it was something that perhaps should have gone right to the director of the fbi , and perhaps he should have even sent it to the president john edwards , democrat of north carolina , said , the american people are entitled to know why red flags were ignored , and i think the fbi has a lot of explaining to do richard j durbin , democrat of illinois , said , i believe the phoenix memo is going to come to be one of the most important documents in our national debate about whether we did enough to protect america from the attack of sept 11th bush administration officials have said they had no evidence that any agency had warning of the attacks , but today s hearing indicated that democrats were willing to challenge those assertions the questions are surfacing as congress prepares for joint hearings on the performance of counterterrorism agencies in the months before to the hijackings investigators are examining the files and have conducted meetings with the fbi photo robert s mueller iii , the director of the fbi , left , and lawrence d thompson , the deputy attorney general , testifying in washington \( stephen crowley the new york times \)
milford , mich the horrors in noble , ga , where hundreds of the dead have been found in various states of putrefaction around the 16acre site of tristate crematory , are the result of a series of failures the failure of the crematory operator to dispose respectfully of the dead is an appalling and inhuman act the failure of the funeral directors who contracted with tristate crematory to notice this atrocity in the making is , at the very least , gross professional negligence that none of the professionals who dealt with this crematory ever noticed anything amiss suggests that they simply never looked they never went the entire distance they owed their client families more the failure of government officials who practice a kind of official blindness on matters mortuary is another kind of negligence regulatory oversight of cemeteries and crematories in this country is , too often , a catchascatchcan arrangement for years the national funeral directors association has asked the federal trade commission to expand the rule now governing funeral homes to require inspection of cemeteries and crematories but the corporate cemetery and conglomerate mortuary lobbies have resisted such scrutiny the honorable operators of crematories , cemeteries and funeral homes across this country welcome such oversight , in a changing marketplace , as good for the consumers and the professionals that serve them but if the dead and the families of the dead in georgia have been victimized by criminal conduct , professional neglect and a lack of regulatory vigilance , the culture at large has likewise been too long willing , when it comes to cremation , to look the other way too many americans view cremation not as an alternative to burial but as an alternative to bother a way of avoiding all that fuss and for this reason , many people give their families instructions that they be cremated after death cremation can become not a way of disposing of the dead honorably , but of disappearing the dead conveniently and costefficiently many families choose cremation to honor the wishes of the deceased or to lovingly return their dead to nature but some are just as pleased to have it taken care of we are more comfortable with the urns than the burning this is why most of us have witnessed many burials and few of us have witnessed any cremations cremation , in western culture , is valued for its quickness and apparent simplicity in eastern culture it is valued for its ritual , religious and symbolic meanings cremation among modern hindus and buddhists , as with ancient celts and vikings , is publicly conducted , rich with liturgy and metaphor it requires the witness and participation of the surviving family , who often bring from home the fire that will release , purify and reunite the dead with their creator or creation among americans the burning of the dead more often is a private matter , done behind closed doors where no one has to watch the many positive values of cremation the release , the return , the reunion of humankind with the elements of creation , the powerful spiritual subtexts of fire are not evident if they are not witnessed the shame and the sadness in noble , ga , is that few were watching and few wanted to the dead of course do n't care whether they are buried or are burned they are indifferent to caskets , urns and obsequies they have whatever heaven the living s faith provides no more , no less nothing of what happened in noble will subtract from that still , it seems we owe them something witness , at the very least not because it matters to the dead , but because the dead matter to the living drawing \( lauren redniss \)
atlanta , may 9 doctors and the public poorly understand the dangers of the smallpox vaccine and need to be better informed if vaccinations are to be reintroduced after an absence of 30 years , federal health officials and infectious disease experts said here today focus groups conducted for a panel of scientists advising the government uncovered a catalog of misinformation about the smallpox vaccine the first vaccine to be developed \( in 1796 \) and considered to be the most dangerous unlike most other immunizations , smallpox vaccine can harm recipients and their contacts resumption of vaccination on a large scale would probably lead to thousands of serious complications and hundreds of deaths , as it did when millions of americans were routinely vaccinated today , the focus groups found , some doctors mistakenly believe that the disease still occurs naturally many doctors , particularly those under 40 , know little about the vaccine s complications or how to use twopronged needles to administer it the doctors also expressed concerns about liability if they were to give the vaccine many nonphysicians said they assumed that the vaccine was safe , provided lifelong protection and was still given to children \( before 1972 , many americans were periodically revaccinated \) many participants said they believed that exposure to the smallpox virus was always fatal in fact , the death rate is about 30 percent dr glen nowak , from the centers for disease control and prevention , reported the findings to the panel , known as the advisory committee of immunization practices and the national vaccine advisory committee the government asked it to determine by june 20 whether to continue the policy of prohibiting vaccinations unless the disease returns in a bioterrorism attack or to allow smallpox vaccine to be offered to everyone who wants it the current knowledge levels of physicians and the public likely limit understanding of strategies intended for determining smallpox vaccine use before or after a bioterrorist attack , dr nowak said the disease control centers and the committee plan to hold forums around the country over the next few weeks to discuss the risks and benefits of reintroducing smallpox vaccination current guidelines , published in june 2001 , do not recommend smallpox vaccine for the public vaccination is limited chiefly to laboratory workers directly involved with smallpox virus or its close virological cousins the limits were based largely on the lack of enough vaccine at the time , the government had only 15 million doses but in the wake of the anthrax attacks last fall , the government has expanded its stockpile of smallpox vaccine tests have shown that the 15 million doses can be diluted to 75 million the drug company aventis pasteur has donated about 80 million doses that have been frozen since 1958 and that the government says would be used only in an emergency the government is also buying 220 million doses made by a new laboratory technique delivery is expected by year s end dr d a henderson , who led the worldwide smallpox eradication program in the 1970 s and is now an adviser to tommy g thompson , secretary of health and human services , told the panel that there was no information to suggest that a smallpox attack was likely yet , dr henderson said , there is a tremendous demand for smallpox vaccine from every quarter , including parents and healthcare and other workers who would be the first to respond in an attack if an outbreak occurs , the disease control agency says it will respond with the technique known as ring vaccination , which was used to eradicate the disease in the event of an attack , the agency s current policy based on the advisory committee s recommendations last june is to give priority for vaccination to individuals who had facetoface contact with smallpox patients in a household , workplace or during transportation to a hospital contacts of cases or exposure to a deliberate release of the virus dr henderson and other speakers at the meeting cited myriad problems if smallpox vaccine were to be offered to all americans who want it a crucial problem is that the food and drug administration has approved none of the smallpox vaccines for marketing and classifies all of them as investigational the classification requires that each individual give consent before receiving the vaccine even the new generation of vaccine will require informed consent until at least late 2003 , said dr phil russell , a health and human services official the standard smallpox vaccine can cause a variety of severe , even fatal , reactions people with aids and other diseases that damage the immune system are one particularly vulnerable group millions of individuals with skin disorders like eczema , atopic dermatitis and acne are at risk for potentially fatal complications the panel was told that serious reactions can occur in someone who had eczema years ago , a problem complicated by the fact that many adults may not know they had it as a child a recipient of smallpox vaccine may infect another person through transfer of the virus by hand or bathing , and the infection can be far more severe in such contacts than in the vaccine recipient other complications include impaired vision from infection of an eye , heart or bone anemia and encephalitis the blood supply could shrink if smallpox vaccinations became widely used because donors are rejected for one year after a vaccination
washington , june 3 white house officials were given 24 more hours today to turn over information about their contacts with enron , as the administration and democrats on the senate governmental affairs committee debated how thousands of pages of documents covered by subpoenas would be handled by investigators on the panel even so , both democratic and republican staff members from the panel began reviewing the documents this afternoon in the eisenhower executive office building in another development today , texas utility regulators recommended fining enron 71 million because they say that the company manipulated the state s wholesale power market last august texas officials said that actions by enron threatened the integrity of the electricity market , while unjustly enriching the company an enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the accusation the white house counsel , alberto r gonzales , said officials had already gathered 1 , 745 pages of documents detailing the white house s enronrelated contacts that were subpoenaed two weeks ago by the governmental affairs panel , which is led by senator joseph i lieberman , democrat of connecticut other documents are still being gathered by the white house , mr gonzales said the white house , which faced a deadline of noon today to hand over the materials to the committee , received a oneday extension after the committee s ranking republican , senator fred thompson of tennessee , asked mr lieberman for the delay but the white house agreed that committee staff members could begin reviewing the materials immediately the committee voted along party lines on may 22 to issue two subpoenas to the white house , seeking all information about communications between enron and the white house since 1992 that in any way dealt with eight federal agencies , including the federal energy regulatory commission and the securities and exchange commission in addition , the subpoenas seek information about contacts between white house officials and officials at the eight agencies regarding enron they also seek contacts between enron and the white house over the formulation of the national energy policy so far , the white house has not come across anything that it intends to withhold from any review by the committee , mr gonzales said but in a letter to mr lieberman , mr gonzales wrote that he was concerned about turning the information over to the committee unless there was a final agreement with the committee about procedures to safeguard the security and confidentiality of these documents specifically , mr gonzales said he was concerned about some private information that might be in some files , including staff members' social security numbers , foreign relations materials and proprietary and confidential business and commercial information mr gonzales also said that a review of the documents so far indicated that none of the white house s contacts with enron were inappropriate or improper in a statement , mr lieberman said his panel is trying to work with the white house to provide all appropriate assurances that the documents it subpoenaed will be maintained in a secure manner , while still allowing the committee to conduct its important oversight work he added , however , that he expected the white house to comply with the new subpoena deadline of noon tuesday a spokeswoman for mr thompson said the extension of the subpoena deadline came after mr thompson raised concerns with mr lieberman this morning about procedural issues in how the materials would be handled by the committee the spokeswoman said she did not know what the exact procedural issues were , or whether white house officials had asked mr thompson to seek the delay in the texas development today , officials at the texas public utility commission accused enron of illegally overscheduling the amount of power it had to deliver , and then collecting payments from the state when its actual load was less that its scheduled load their accusations were similar to practices outlined in internal enron memos released last month that showed how traders manipulated the california power market commission officials said the proposed penalty reflects the egregiousness and repetition of the violations and the seriousness of the violations in terms of the impact on the integrity of the state s power grid enron has 30 days to respond after that time , the full commission can vote to formally impose the fine photo senator joseph i lieberman , left , democrat of connecticut , yesterday agreed to a request by senator fred thompson , republican of tennessee , to give the white house 24 hours to turn over enron documents \( carol t powers for the new york times \)
washington , dec 7 the last time the knicks looked like a playoff team , they had won four of their last five games and had blown away the highly regarded milwaukee bucks on the road that was a year ago then , with the future looking bright , jeff van gundy startled the team by resigning abruptly after nearly six years as coach the knicks have been awful ever since sunday is the oneyear anniversary of van gundy s stunning announcement it seems longer , latrell sprewell said it seems like it was a long time ago a lot has happened a lot of it bad the knicks , who were 109 at the time of van gundy s departure , have gone 2556 under coach don chaney , van gundy s former assistant last season , they failed to reach the postseason for the first time in 15 years , and the legitimate hopes of reaching the nba finals that were commonplace during van gundy s tenure have been replaced by equally legitimate hopes of winning the draft lottery making the playoffs is a pipe dream for the knicks , who are 513 after tonight s 10097 loss against the washington wizards allan houston said van gundy s resignation was one of the major factors in the decline of the team , not only because the knicks lost a very good coach but also because the ambiguity surrounding his departure diminished the players' confidence in the organization when jeff left , something changed , houston said , not just a belief in ourselves and where we can go , but there was a sense that we were n't really sure of what s going on in the organization , what s really happening for your coach to want to leave we wished him the best , but that was a strange situation for us and from that point , i think we were really unsure about a lot of things , from the top down that was a key turning point van gundy , who had two years and roughly 7 million remaining on his contract , had several reasons for leaving at the age of 39 he cited a desire to spend more time with his wife , kim , and daughter , mattie , and he was deeply affected by the world trade center disaster , in which his college roommate , farrell lynch , died he also said he had lost the laserlike focus that had enabled him to be so successful but there were other factors that went unmentioned van gundy , who joined the knicks as an assistant coach in 1989 , had a poor relationship with james l dolan , the chairman of madison square garden , and was wary of dolan s growing influence in the team s basketballrelated decisions van gundy , who was bothered by the knicks' refusal to extend his contract , had also been critical of his own performance that season and might have worried that he was losing control of the team chaney said he thought van gundy was also annoyed by the declining quality of the team s roster since the trade of patrick ewing in the summer of 2000 and the retirement of larry johnson shortly before van gundy left i think he was getting frustrated in the last couple of years , chaney said sprewell said the absence of van gundy was not the reason for the knicks' troubles he pointed to the players as the main factor guys kind of put it behind us , sprewell said we figured that he had to do what was best for him it did n't linger on i think it really was a function of the talent we have here van gundy , who is working as an analyst for tnt sports , will almost certainly surface as one of the league s top coaching candidates in the offseason he might have taken a job last summer if the knicks had not held his rights through the end of this season van gundy has the thirdmost victories \( 248 \) among knicks coaches , and his 590 winning percentage is second only to that of his mentor , pat riley \( 680 \) because of van gundy s success , it is hard to imagine the knicks struggling the way they are if he were still around but there were signs that their winning ways might have ended even had van gundy stayed in april 2001 , the knicks lost in the first round of the playoffs for the first time in 10 years with marcus camby injured , they played the first 14 games of last season with a lineup similar to the one chaney has this season the knicks went 68 , despite playing against nine teams that eventually failed to make the playoffs camby returned and the knicks won four of five games , but none of those victories were against playoff teams this season , all but 3 of the knicks' first 17 games were against playoff clubs there was an inkling of the team s maddening habit of blowing large leads under van gundy they had a 20point lead in a loss to indiana and a 16point lead in a loss to detroit , and they barely beat atlanta despite leading by 16 points with three minutes to play as sprewell said , the knicks' fall is probably more traceable to the losses of camby , larry johnson and antonio mcdyess than to the loss of van gundy houston said we 've had some unfortunate things happen with our team , so you ca n't put it all on the loss of one person or the gain of another person we 've had other things that played a big role in that i do n't really like to reflect on it , because it s over with we 're in a new regime , i guess this is where we are i 've always said i learned a lot from jeff , and i appreciate the things i learned from him we won and had some experiences with jeff being here that i never would 've had without him but we 're in a new situation now that s for sure photo jeff van gundy with his daughter , mattie , at a college game last year , two weeks after he abruptly resigned as head coach of the knicks \( m david leeds for the

every so often a report comes out of a remote part of the world that is so shocking it makes us sit bolt upright and start thinking hard about global warming now it is news from the bolivian andes , where glaciers more than three miles above sea level are retreating with alarming speed , creating the threat of potentially disastrous water shortages according to a story last week by the times s juan forero , the glacier on chacaltaya mountain , which claims the world s highest ski slope , has been shriveling so fast that scientists predict its disappearance in 10 years chacaltaya mountain is hardly alone shrinking glaciers are a worldwide phenomenon great slices of snow and ice are disappearing in places from the austrian alps to glacier national park in montana , where the number of glaciers has declined from 150 a century ago to 35 today in 30 years , there may be none in the park at all the tropical glaciers of the andes seem to be retreating more quickly than any others some scientists have warned of a calamity in the making because countries like bolivia and peru depend on glaciers and the rain and snow that fall in the mountains for drinking water , for irrigating fields and for generating electricity there appear to be two reasons for the crisis one is a series of unseasonably dry years attributed to el ni o , the name given to the weather pattern generated by warm pacific currents off the south american coast el ni o has occurred with abnormal frequency in the last 20 years the other is climate change in bolivia , the average temperature has risen by 1 degree celsius in the last century , mirroring changes in some other parts of the world that may not seem like much , but it is enough to cause environmental havoc this unsettling news could have a bright side if it persuaded the bush administration to pay more attention to the global warming issue a report early last month from 18 leading scientists , published in the journal science , called for a concentrated national effort equal to the apollo moon landing project to develop energy sources other than fossil fuels most scientists now believe that the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has contributed heavily to the warming trend but just two weeks later , the bush administration called for further research into the causes of global warming given the degree of consensus on the issue , the research project looks like just one more excuse for inaction from a president who shocked the world early in his tenure by reneging on a campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide , the main global warming gas , and by renouncing the kyoto agreement on global climate change but in view of the sobering news from places like the andes , it is hard to imagine that mr bush can sustain his casual attitude much longer
with the american economy still sputtering and the federal reserve divided over whether to cut interest rates again , foreboding comparisons between the united states and japan are gaining a renewed currency japan s stock market and real estate bubbles began losing air in 1990 , almost exactly a decade before stocks in the united states peaked , and the country has still failed to recover fully the japanese market remains near an 18year low , consumer prices are falling and the central bank has already cut interest rates to near zero , limiting its ability to lift the economy today few policy makers or economists expect this country to fall into the same trap , largely because the american bubble never reached the size of japan s and american financial and political systems appear more flexible still , numerous signs suggest that the united states could suffer a hangover that lingers for at least a few years although stocks rallied yesterday , the overall market is still likely to decline this year for the third consecutive year , its longest losing streak since 193941 none of the american economy s three engines consumers , businesses or the government appear poised to propel the nation sharply ahead in the near future after the economy grew at a moderate pace this summer , business spending on new factories and equipment has weakened again in recent weeks , and large retailers warned this week that their september sales were lower than expected it takes more than a bubble to become japan , said adam posen , a former fed staff member and a senior fellow at the institute for international economics in washington but , he added , there s no question that the props for keeping up growth are going away the fed is clearly concerned that it is flirting with danger the risk remains small that the economy will remain in the doldrums for years but the weak demand for new goods has caused prices nearly to stop growing and presented perhaps the single biggest economic threat deflation if the american economy grows less than many forecasters expect , prices could begin falling and set off a dangerous chain of events similar to the one afflicting japan consumers there have cut their spending , waiting for future bargains , and some are unable to pay off debts that are effectively growing more burdensome by the month reflecting the seriousness of the debate here , two top fed officials dissented last week from alan greenspan , the chairman , and voted to reduce interest rates again having cut rates 11 times last year to lower the cost of borrowing , the fed has helped prop up the economy but has yet to end the downturn altogether i do n't know at what point welcome disinflation might morph into unwelcome deflation , robert d mcteer , the president of the dallas federal reserve and one of the two dissenters , said in a speech on monday i do n't think we 're there yet but that really does n't much matter , mr mcteer added , because i do believe faster real growth is essential promoting faster growth will also ward off deflation , he said in a study of the lessons to be learned from japan s decadelong slump , fed economists said this summer that governments should take extraordinary steps to support prices like deep rate cuts or new spending when falling prices become a serious risk deflation is often difficult to anticipate and far harder to end once it has started than to prevent in the first place , the study said mr greenspan and most economists say the economy is growing quickly enough to avoid deflation despite the draining impact of a loss of 8 trillion of stock market wealth , a sharp contraction in capital investment and , of course , the tragic events of sept 11 , 2001 , our economy held firm , mr greenspan said last week in a speech in london although both countries have huge capitalist economies , japan and the united states also differ in important ways equity markets , which tend to pull their money quickly from failing companies , dominate corporate finance in this country , while banks , which often must make concessions to avoid foreclosures , dominate in japan the united states also has a twoparty political system that by design or happenstance has injected much more money into the economy recently than japan s ruling party did at the start of its slump meanwhile , the fed has cut interest rates more quickly than japan s central bank did unlike the bank of japan , the fed can still significantly cut its benchmark interest rate , now at 175 percent the biggest similarity may be that many people in both countries came to see their own economy as recessionproof at the height of the respective booms and sent stocks to unsustainable prices as a result in both cases , people had decided that the structure of the economy had changed fundamentally , said jeffrey a frankel , an economist at harvard and a former adviser to president bill clinton people thought they found the secret to eternal youth the troublesome signs of the last few weeks have increased worries that the american economy could follow a path similar to , if perhaps not as rugged , as the japan took on the downside of the boom
wilmington , del , june 8 beth daniel responded well after every bad hole today in the third round of the 15 million mcdonald s lpga championship , the second major of the season she made birdies twice after bogeys and that helped her go into the final round with a fourshot lead i think it will be a great story , daniel , 45 , said when she was reminded that a victory sunday would make her the oldest woman to win a major daniel shot a threeunderpar 68 in the bright sunshine today for a threeday total of eightunder 205 and a fourshot lead over se ri pak \( 68209 \) karrie webb , last year s winner , shot a oneover 72 and was tied for third with kim saiki \( 69 \) at 211 daniel , who has 32 lpga victories \( including one major \) but none since 1995 , has held the lead going into the final round 44 times in her career and has won 22 times she has failed to win three times when leading entering the final round in a major daniel , who was paired with webb in the last group , registered her 68 today with six birdies and three bogeys she responded with birdies after bogeys on the sixth and 10th holes i call them momentumbuilders , daniel said of her success after bad holes it helps a lot when you come out of bad shots well i'm very pleased because i played with one of the best players in the world and managed to match shot for shot , daniel said of her pairing with webb it was very gratifying daniel did better than matching shots with webb webb started the day in second behind daniel at three under and never got on track she made three bogeys and two birdies , while pak , playing in the group ahead of daniel and webb , made four birdies and a bogey in her 68 i'm striking the ball well and my putting is fine , said pak , the winner of the tournament in 1998 as a tour rookie my plan for tomorrow is the same as the first three days not to miss the greens and not to miss the fairways juli inkster , the winner two years ago , had three birdies before the turn and another with two holes left , but she also had two bogeys for a 70 that put her one over for the tournament annika sorenstam , who has four victories this season and is first on the money list , had a slightly better day than on friday , when she shot 76 she birdied the first and the 16th holes , but bogeyed four others for a 73 betsy king , the winner of 34 events , including six majors , had a trying round she started the day at 7over and is at 13over after shooting 77 liselotte neumann , with 12 victories to her credit , had an even harder time than king she had five bogeys and a doublebogey on the front nine she had a total of seven bogeys and finished with a 78 for a threeday total of 227 perhaps the most surprising casualty was the twotime champion laura davies of england , who had finished out of the top 10 in this event only once in the previous eight years davies missed the cut by six shots after rounds of 76 and 80 chip shots michelle redman was alone in fifth place at even 213 after a 70 laura diaz , who posted the first victories of her career this season after finishing second to karrie webb here last year , was at twoover 215 after a 71
vernon township , nj , oct 15 for those who trek from peak to peak along the appalachian trail , this is a definite low point aptly called the pochuck quagmire , a broad valley of empty meadow and soggy marshland here has long forced hikers to detour and dodge traffic along two and a half miles of shoulderless highway but now , thanks to years of hard work by a small army of volunteers , the quagmire has been turned into a scenic panorama that is attracting even casual strollers on sunday , state officials plan to formally dedicate a new milelong elevated boardwalk and a handsome 144foot timber suspension bridge that traverse the meadow and the marsh they provide a pristine link to two longdisconnected sections of the trail and take hikers away from whizzing cars and into a world of rustling cattails , songbirds , a swiftly flowing creek and serene acres of field the bridge , boardwalk and vista are unrivaled along the 2 , 169mile trail , said pamela underhill , manager of the appalachian trail for the national park service there s nothing else like it on the whole trail from maine to georgia , she said it s just so extraordinary most of the trail , ms underhill said , is on wooded hillsides and the tops of ridges in the 14 states in which it lies although a few lowland sections exist here and there , none are as big as the valley here , she said and none are crossed by anything as elaborate as the curving , fourfootwide boardwalk and the suspension bridge , which arches nearly 17 feet above pochuck creek and is designed to withstand the worst flood that might occur every 100 years but just as unusual , she said , is who built the bridge and boardwalk customarily , volunteers who work along the trail perform smaller tasks like clearing brush , cutting new trails , maintaining shelters and building rock stairways and small bridges here , hundreds of volunteers spent thousands of hours building the bridge and boardwalk through soggy wetlands the project could not have been built without them , said larry wheelock , trails director of the new yorknew jersey trail conference , a federation that builds and maintains trails in the two states probably half the value of the project was in volunteer labor raw materials , including lumber for the bridge and boardwalk and the hundreds of galvanized steel posts that support the boardwalk , cost about 400 , 000 , he said construction of the boardwalk started in 1999 and was finished a few weeks ago the bridge was completed in 1995 and stood alone and unused until the boardwalk was completed the start of construction on the boardwalk was delayed while the corridor was surveyed and changed several times , and permits for construction in wetlands were obtained the impetus for the project was a 1978 federal law intended to stop the increasing rerouting of the appalachian trail from privately owned land to roads the law gave the park service and states along the trail 90 million to buy land for new , publicly owned trail corridors for the project here , the park service bought 865 acres in the pochuck quagmire for 265 , 000 and the state bought another 128 acres the project was a joint effort of the park service the state department of environmental protection the appalachian trail conference , a federation of 31 clubs that provide volunteers to maintain the trail and the new yorknew jersey trail conference , which recruited the hundreds of volunteers these workers were a mix of men and women from their teens to their 70 s they included retired teachers , a former diplomat , doctors , lawyers , nurses , vernon police officers and highway workers , high school students and members of local churches who cooked meals and brought them to the site many lived in the vernon area others drove up to 90 minutes one way outofstate members of the appalachian trail conference came on weekends and lived in tents among the most backbreaking chores were erecting the prebuilt sections of bridge brought in on donated flatbed trucks , and hauling thousands of fourfoot planks and steel anchor posts for the boardwalk , then driving the posts up to 20 feet into the mushy surface with augers the planks and posts were airlifted into the site by helicopters from the state s forest fire service we ran long seasons , said wes powers , the state s manager on the project since 1995 we started when it was cold in the spring and finished when it was cold in the fall we worked in heavy rain and scorching heat paul decoste , a retired english teacher and a former cochairman of the new yorknew jersey trail conference s management committee for the appalachian trail , said people came back again and again and again and again the camaraderie was tops volunteers talk of a labor of love paul bell , a banker and nonhiker , helped with the project in memory of his 25yearold son duane , who loved the outdoors and was killed in a car crash while returning from a hiking trip mr bell persuaded a new jersey utility company to donate the telephone poles for the bridge s superstructure and the crews to install them tibor latincsics , an engineer and a hiker , served because he was asked he wound up donating thousands of hours studying suspension bridges in national parks around the country and then designing the bridge here , overseeing its construction and writing a 95page book on the project for the federal government my wife became a bridge widow , he said new jersey s environmental commissioner , bradley m campbell , said he hoped the effort would attract volunteers for a trail maintenance and expansion program the state is planning now with 14 million in new federal money the bridge and boardwalk are already a hit with many residents here hikers as well as strollers diane mcnulty , a vernon resident who often hikes parts of the trail near here with her husband , frank , was walking the boardwalk in the morning chill today it s just beautiful , she said it certainly beats using the road we 've seen deer and fox out here , and my husband s seen bear john fritz , also of vernon , has been walking in these woods for years the other day , on his daily hike along the new boardwalk , he walked within 10 feet of a hawk perched on a boardwalk railing i 've lived up here for 10 years , he said , and i 've never gotten that close to a hawk before photos a 144foot timber suspension bridge , right , and a mile of boardwalk now take the 14state appalachian trail across the pochuck quagmire in northern new jersey the bridge and

on a billboard high above 20th street and 1oth avenue in chelsea , the faces of four women stare down , daring you not to see them on the surface , the billboard is just another clever manhattan advertising ploy , an eyecatching invitation to a new exhibition at the white box gallery on west 26th street but look closer there s more to this story these are not glamorous faces they are not made up they are real portraits , actually of women who are from the neighborhood but not of it the faces belong to mothers , daughters , wives women who for myriad ugly reasons live locked up in bayview , a minimumsecurity prison on chelsea s edge , tucked safely out of sight from the art dealers and gallery crawlers who circle the streets looking for signs of the second coming of soho in a way , the billboard has brought the women of bayview to life or at least into view , proving , as so often happens in new york , that the most divergent of worlds can find reason to collide and coexist the reason in this case is an irish artist named brian maguire last summer , he traveled from dublin to paint the women as a favor to a friend , fergus mccaffrey , an art curator like many of chelsea s new arrivals , mr mccaffrey had discovered the women by chance while working in a nearby warehouse they whistled at him , a gesture that triggered his curiosity and a phone call pleading for mr maguire s help who were these women \? mr maguire wondered we had no clue about them or that there was this jail here curious , mr maguire gathered up his brushes and persuaded bayview officials to let him set up shop in the jail so he could paint elaborate oil portraits of 15 of the 141 inmates eventually , he also gave them brushes , a first for some , and a chance for all of them to paint snippets of the worlds they left behind and worlds still dreamed of the pictures the women came up with innocent paintings , some as simple as a street corner in washington heights , a watch surrounded by the words time is passing you by are on display at white box , alongside mr maguire s portraits of the women before , there was no connection between the art world and the jail , said mr maguire , who has traveled the world from belfast to brazil , painting people living on the margins now there is a link , a reason to look up at them and to see these women as they are , just people , irrespective of whatever brought them to the jail for some of the women featured in the show and the billboard advertising it , mr maguire s brushes have given them keys to the world around them , a chance to emerge from chelsea s shadow i'm proud my face is one of the ones up there for people to see , elizabeth cassarino , a former inmate , said as the show was preparing for its nov 9 opening they need to keep it up there , and put one over at bayview too it shows who we are , that we 're still people and we can enjoy art just like everybody else the crime that landed ms cassarino in bayview , and took her from her family and her job as a cabdriver , is history , she said , an argument with a gas station cashier who said she threatened him she was sentenced on a charge of attempted coercion at the request of the women , they are listed as anonymous artists , a courtesy , mr maguire said , that is meant to keep spectators' eyes focused on their art and not their crimes none of the work is for sale , by agreement between the gallery and state correction authorities but some have , in at least one way art is all that ms cassarino , now a chelsea gallery crawler herself , wants to talk about my whole life has changed , she said yes , she is doing the important things she has a job , answering telephones at a radio station she s surrounding herself with plenty of wellmeaning friends and sometimes even going to the theater but it is art , she insisted , that has made the difference in her life now her eyes and words ignite with the enthusiasm of a child as she led a visitor , literally by the arm , on a personal tour of the seven paintings she has in the show it just showed me a different way to see myself , like my picture right here , she said , moving to to a portrait of a young woman wearing what is supposed to be an expensive dress i could have that dress , my old cab , my family whatever i painted became real when you 're locked up , you do n't think people will see anything but that i was in bayview but i'm more than that drawing \( lisa haney \)
for years , developers and state officials have sold florida as a great place to retire often without any regard for the longterm consequences of a ballooning older population now those consequences are piling up , and the state is becoming a test case of how well society will deal with the health care needs of growing numbers of old people right now , the nation is n't passing with flying colors , according to bentley lipscomb , the florida director of aarp we 're just not thinking ahead , said mr lipscomb , who is based in st petersburg we 've never had a situation like this , and people just do n't recognize that they have to deal with it now he is in a position to know , and policy makers would do well to heed his warnings in addition to his role with aarp , mr lipscomb was secretary of florida s department of elder affairs for much of the last decade and was the staff director for the united states senate s special committee on aging from 1979 to 1982 his is a story of numbers according to the 2000 census , 5 of the 10 american counties with the highest percentage of residents over 65 are in florida charlotte , 347 percent highlands , 33 percent citrus , 322 percent sarasota , 314 percent and hernando , 308 percent the other five are rural counties , mainly in the west , with small populations ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand and thus less important demographically the five florida counties have high percentages of older people because of retirees moving there those others have high percentages because younger people move away , said prof william j serow , director of the center for the study of population at florida state university in tallahassee in the nation as a whole , 124 percent of the population is over 65 that percentage is expected to grow to 185 by 2025 using the age of 60 as a benchmark , mr lipscomb says , gives a broader picture of what has happened in florida four of our counties pinellas , palm beach , broward and dade each have more people , in absolute numbers , over the age of 60 than do 19 states , he said and dade , broward and palm beach combined have more people over 60 than 38 states nearly half 425 percent of the 142 , 000 people in charlotte county are 60 or older what happens 20 years from now , when nearly half of charlotte county s residents could be in their 80 s \? mr lipscomb asked we do n't know nobody has ever faced that situation before there s never been a health care system in the world designed to deal with half the population turning 85 at the same time but i can tell you this there are clear data that show that in the 65yearold population , one out of 25 needs nursing home care at 85plus , one out of two needs nursing home care so we could wind up with a quarter of charlotte county needing nursing home or acute care unless ponce de leon comes back and finds a fountain of youth or we have a plague that wipes out old people , we 're going to have to deal with this situation he added none of these projections are based on the mapping of the human genome and improvements in treating disease that are likely to be the result we may extend life expectancy another 5 or 10 years if that happens , then all these other numbers go out the window he says there is nothing wrong per se with encouraging older people to come to a state like florida but we should n't do so unless we understand that someone is going to have to pay money to take care of these people , he said that s not what developers want to hear for many who retire to florida , he said , the golden years of advertising brochures become less golden as ailments increase sure , the weather is better than in buffalo , he said and it s great when you first come here and are healthy and can play golf and swim but people need to understand that if they get into difficulty in a place where they have lived for 30 years , they have the support mechanisms of family , friends , neighbors and church they can call on if they move here they can become nameless , faceless people with no community support system that s a tough place to be if you get in trouble he cites disorganization on the state and national levels in dealing with the problem the aarp is trying to get the state legislature to set up a commission to study longterm care , he said that might seem like a nobrainer in a state like florida , but they have n't acted on it yet despite describing himself as cynical on the issue , he says he believes that the aging of the big and powerful baby boomer generation will prompt the nation s leaders to act right now reminds me of 1952 , he said then people woke up one morning and said , 'oh my god , look at all those babies ! ' those babies , the boomers , had been coming since 1945 , but nobody paid any attention until they hit a critical mass well , we 're about to hit critical mass with older people in some places now , especially florida as the baby boomers enter the oldage picture , the free ride for the politicians is over the boomers are not cautious and selfsacrificing like their parents for example , they 're going to demand prescription drug coverage for medicare recipients their attitude is 'i'm sorry the twin towers got knocked down , but i do n't want to die of heart disease because i ca n't afford to buy medication' mr lipscomb , who is 65 , plans to retire in st petersburg , because he still regards florida as 20 years ahead of the rest of the nation in dealing with an aging population we 're not meeting the needs , but we 're still ahead of the curve , he said it s important that the country pay attention to florida and not make the same mistakes we 've made drawing \( cathy hull \)
philadelphia president bush and congress appear headed for a battle over marriage before it left for recess , the senate approved 100 million , a third less than the president had proposed , for programs that promote marriage the issue is sure to be revisited in the fall , but unfortunately the terms of the debate are skewed people do n't need to be convinced of the value of marriage so much as they need support to make it work many social scientists are skeptical about the feasibility or even the necessity of a government campaign to rehabilitate the institution of marriage the problems that americans are having with marriage are hardly universal research shows that college graduates are just as likely to get and stay married as they were several decades ago opting out of marriage has increased only among those who did not graduate from college these findings are consistent with what i 've learned from following several hundred teenage mothers and their children in baltimore for the past 30 years over half of the mostly black and poor women in the study married the father of their child but their efforts to build stable families turned out poorly four out of five of these marriages dissolved over the next decade and a half women who married men who were not the fathers of their children fared even worse more to the point , those who married fared no better than those who did not in several areas staying off welfare , returning to school and finding stable , wellpaying employment in the decades after their first child was born their children were not significantly better off in the long run regardless of whether they married of course , none of this is to say that marriage is not a wonderful institution when it works , it brings great benefits to adults and their children when it is mired in conflict and disaffection , however , or destabilized by economic uncertainty , it leads to problems quite similar to those experienced by remarried couples , unmarried couples and single parents we do n't need government programs to convince people like the mothers in the baltimore study that marriage is good for them the children of the teenage mothers in the baltimore study were far more reluctant to marry at younger ages , though most say they do want to get married someday still , many of these women are wary of entering matrimony until they find a man who offers them some prospect of economic support and wo n't act like another child , as one woman explained to me these children have higher expectations of marriage than did their mothers they watched their parents try and fail , and they do n't want to repeat their mistakes what will it take for them to feel confident that they wo n't \? certainly , more than weekend workshops telling them that marriage will make them happier and healthier they know that lack of commitment is not the reason most marriages do n't work their parents were very committed , but they faced huge problems supporting their children if the bush administration wants to help women like these , it should reconsider its proposal and get down to the hard work of creating the economic and social conditions that will support marriage for the less advantaged child care subsidies , paid parental leaves , cheaper health insurance for lowincome families and other programs to help support them it s true that money alone will not bring couples into marriage men and women must develop better skills to deal with the gender divide that has developed , especially in lowincome families women simply wo n't put up with carrying more than their fair share at home when they also work all day in this regard , the bush proposal may have an impact family counseling and marriage workshops can help couples better understand each other and improve their chances for success but most couples ca n't acquire these skills without a sustained and costly effort most social scientists believe that counseling can be helpful and even necessary , but it is hardly sufficient if the bush administration truly wants to promote marriage , it should start by providing tangible financial assistance to families that need it
democratic contenders for president are beginning to challenge president bush s record on terrorism , arguing that mr bush has failed to do enough to prevent another fatal attack on american soil and that the nation is barely safer than it was before sept 11 , 2001 the expressions of concern about the nation s safety by mr bush s prospective challengers , voiced in interviews , speeches and television appearances over the last three weeks , suggest that the focus of the democratic white house candidates in 2004 will go well beyond the traditional democratic fare of education , the economy , jobs and health care while so far the criticisms lack many specifics beyond asking for more money for police agencies or the creation of an additional intelligence force , campaign aides said these early challenges on terrorism signaled what they expected to be a central theme in 2004 they argued that mr bush was potentially vulnerable on the issue that republicans view as a pillar of the president s political strength it s time for us , without regard to party , to say what every american knows washington is not doing enough to make america safe , senator john edwards of north carolina said in a speech on domestic security in washington last week mr edwards added , if the administration continues to do too little , it will be too late again senator joseph i lieberman of connecticut said the american people are only slightly safer today here at home than we were on sept 11 , 2001 senator john kerry of massachusetts said in an interview that the administration had squandered a year since the attacks , by failing to make the preparations necessary to properly deal with an obvious problem of growing terror and the threat at home gov howard dean of vermont said democrats have a real opportunity here , noting in particular what he described as the administration s bungling response to the rash of anthrax attacks mr lieberman said with the possible exception of the aviation systems , we have not raised our guard sufficiently this administration has been slow and inadequate in the response to the terrorist threat here at home white house officials described this line of attack as risky and unorthodox , with some suggesting that it would make the candidates appear willing to exploit american fears for political gain any candidate who suggests that when the enemy attacks , the blame lies with the united states and not with the enemy does so at great peril to their own political future , said the white house spokesman , ari fleischer still , it is becoming increasingly clear that the dialogue of the coming presidential race will be unlike any other white house campaign in years , as a direct result of the attacks of sept 11 several democrats predicted a fundamental shift in the way presidential candidates would have to present themselves in the 2004 campaign they said polls showed that the voters would now consider a presidential candidate s ability to protect them from terrorism at home in much the same way voters in a big city might now consider a mayoral candidate s ability to stop crime in their neighborhoods this is clearly going to be one of the cornerstones of the 2004 election i do n't think there is any question about it , said steve jarding , a senior adviser to mr edwards every campaign cycle , you see candidates talk about education , talk about health care and i guess for better or worse , terrorism is going to be a part of that dialogue from now on the contenders have offered a few , though not many , details on what they would do differently mr edwards , for example , urged creation of a domestic intelligence agency with the specific directive to work against terrorism at home , making up for what he asserted were the nowdemonstrated weaknesses of the fbi and cia mr kerry and mr lieberman assailed the administration for holding up 15 billion in antiterrorism aid to local police departments and emergency agencies allocated by congress this year , and mr lieberman said the white house should move aggressively to improve protection of borders , ports and transportation systems , which he described as vulnerable to attack none of the democrats have suggested , for example , further incursions on civil liberties or immigration , in some cases arguing that the administration has gone too far in a reflection of these difficult times , aides to the contenders said they were planning their campaigns with the assumption that another terrorist attack could happen at any moment and discreetly trying to assess what that might mean for a continuing contest if something else horrible happens , does the nation instinctively rally around the president \? asked a senior adviser to one contender , who did not want to be identified because of the delicacy of the subject or do they say 'it s this guy s job keep my family safe he s had two years to prepare for it' along those lines , aides suggested that some statements by the white house and the democratic candidates were intended in part to position the campaigns in the event of a terrorist attack over the next 24 months
karachi , pakistan , oct 16 just after one o'clock this afternoon , a messenger from a private courier service delivered a thick 10by12inch manila parcel to waqar abassi , a 35yearold father of three and a civil servant at police headquarters while the courier waited , mr abassi started to open the package , which was addressed to the director of operations the package exploded , and mr abassi lost both his hands mr abassi was one of eight people injured today when six parcel bombs were sent to the offices of the city s top lawenforcement official and five senior police officials and investigators the investigators had led the recent arrest of islamic militants accused of carrying out sectarian killings and the car bombing of the united states consulate in june the bombs hurt none of the senior officials and investigators instead , they maimed personal assistants and lowlevel civilian functionaries like mr abassi three parcels were opened in a government office and two police stations in the heart of karachi before the police realized what was happening a police bomb squad destroyed two unopened parcels a final undelivered bomb was found in the scooter of the delivery man who was in mr abassi s office at the time the police said the delivery man was being questioned , but appeared to be an unwitting victim police chief syed kamal shah said that the attacks were sophisticated but that it was too early to know what group was responsible it will be too premature to talk about al qaeda at this stage , chief shah said we need to catch these men and they will tell us the parcels were delivered on tuesday to post offices in different parts of the city , he said the sender paid an extra fee to have them hand delivered by private courier chief shah said a small diary or address book inside each parcel was filled with an explosive pulling a ribbon wrapped around the parcel apparently triggered the explosion officials said at least one of the packages was labeled from the mma , apparently a reference to the mutahida majliseamal , a coalition of hardline religious parties that won record support in elections last week mr shah played down the importance of the notation , saying it could have been placed on the packages to mislead people officials from the coalition denied any responsibility for the parcels , the associated press reported emails sent to a pakistani newspaper and signed asif ramzi , the name of a wellknown pakistani militant , said 35 packages holding five ounces of explosives each were sent from three different post offices the messages said the bombs were a warning to those police officers involved in operations against mujahedeen at the behest of the americans , the ap reported they also threatened further attacks on antiislam police officers and other infidels and said muslims are planning a mass attack on the united states the attacks today were the first directly against the police in karachi since president pervez musharraf began a crackdown on some islamic militant groups in january police officials said any of several groups could be responsible , but pointed out that the ones focused on by investigators were all involved in the recent arrests of two groups of islamic militants some of the militants are accused of killing minority shiite muslims in karachi , the scene of thousands of ethnic and religious killings in the 1990 s the vast majority of pakistani muslims are members of the sunni sect the investigators were also involved in the arrest last month of more than a dozen members of a militant splinter group , the international movement of mujahedeen the police accuse members of the group of carrying out the car bombing of the american consulate , which killed 12 pakistanis in the raids , officers also found weapons and plans to attack american fastfood restaurants and other western targets photo investigators examine one of the police rooms in karachi where parcel bombs exploded yesterday five officers were among the eight wounded there were no immediate suspects or evident links to al qaeda \( getty images \)
'window on the west' nassau county museum of art , one museum drive , roslyn harbor , \( 516 \) 4849337 through april 28 in her catalog essay for this selection of work from the phelan collection , circulated by the trust for museum exhibitions , eleanor jones harvey , curator of american art at the dallas museum of art , mentions the controversy that has arisen recently regarding the analysis of american western art the two extremes , which she calls the scylla and charybdis of interpretation , are , in simple terms , art as documentation versus art as propaganda did artists aim to show the west as it really was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , or as the increasingly dominant white culture imagined it \? like mariners navigating between the rock and the whirlpool , scholars and curators enter these ideological waters at their peril the dilemma is avoided here , in part because the exhibition includes none of the grandiose canvases that swayed public sentiment in favor of territorial expansion as a fulfillment of manifest destiny but it is also a deliberately neutral stance that acknowledges the conflict but views the issues as secondary to mr phelan s personal interests in building his collection this is a relief from the fraught scholarship that has burdened recent shows of western art instead , some good oldfashioned connoisseurship comes to the fore , and one is aware of the realities of cost and availability that also contribute to the process of assembling a historical collection many of the pieces are by lesserknown artists , and the famous ones are represented by minor works far from being detrimental , these limitations enhance the notion that , with an open mind and a sharp eye , a collector can find remarkable material oil sketches by albert bierstadt , john frederick kensett , sanford r gifford and samuel colman and a watercolor figure study by frederic remington lack the detail and gravity some would say manipulative purpose of these artists' large canvases unlike the big finished paintings , they were done on the spot , with the freshness and spontaneity of direct observation despite its small size , bierstadt s view of nebraska s wasatch mountains captures the sense of awe one feels when looking across a vast open landscape colman s indian rider , wyoming , is a study in tonal harmonies , with the lone redclad horseman and his reflection serving as a color contrast to the dominant greens and golds , as well as a measure of scale if there is an ideological implication in this barbizoninspired work , it is surely the unity of man and nature that the indian commonly symbolized there is no sculpture in the phelan collection , but a concurrent display , american western art from bierstadt to remington , assembled by the museum s curators , fills that gap remington s theatrical bronzes , with their stereotyped characters acting out stock situations , make a fascinating comparison to the works of solon borglum , who is best known as the sculptor of mount rushmore while remington is all technical panache , borglum favors a more earthbound approach with deep emotional undertones both artists are working in a narrative vein , but remington is stuck in specifics , whereas borglum transcends them 'alfred stieglitz' heckscher museum of art , 2 prime avenue , huntington , \( 631 \) 3513250 through april 21 a nearmythic figure in the annals of american art , alfred stieglitz \( 18641946 \) was both a major force in the development of fineart photography and a promoter of modern painting and sculpture his journal , camera work , which he published from 190217 , was a forum for the pictorialist movement and for nearly 50 years , he operated new york city galleries where the most advanced european and american art could be seen in the final decade of his life , he stopped making his own photographs and devoted himself to his last gallery , an american place indeed , his commitment to promoting the work of others might have overshadowed his achievements as a photographer if it had not been for the determination of his second wife , georgia o'keeffe , to protect and nurture his reputation after stieglitz s death , o'keeffe made strategic gifts of his work , notably to the national gallery of art , the metropolitan museum of art and the international museum of photography and film at george eastman house in rochester , ny , from which this exhibition is drawn with more than 100 images , the show offers an excellent survey of his career it traces his evolution from the atmospheric style of photography that aimed to emulate painting to a more objective , although highly formalized , approach in the 1920 s and 30 s , foreshadowed in 1907 by the steerage , one of his most famous images the exhibition comprises street scenes , landscapes and portraits of friends and family , including several of his more than 400 portraits of o'keeffe , although none of the explicitly erotic studies he made when they first became lovers but his sexual fascination with her is clear in even the most seemingly formalistic images , as when he focuses on her sensuous fingers caressing the luscious chrome of a ford wheel cover the photograph was made at the family s lake george retreat , where , from 1923 to 1931 , stieglitz also created his equivalents series of cloud studies his abiding interest in modern abstraction and particularly the work of arthur dove , whose paintings he exhibited inspired his search for ambiguous natural forms that could transcend objectivity to represent moods and feelings perhaps more than any other aspect of his work , the equivalents show how stieglitz successfully adapted the camera to serve less as a recording device than as a creative and interpretive tool photos color harmony indian rider , wyoming , an 1888 painting by samuel colman , and other art and sculpture depicting the american west is

united nations , sept 9 senior canadian and european officials , openly expressing their frustration with washington s objections to the international criminal court , pledged today to work to extend its jurisdiction worldwide as expectations heightened here of the speech president bush will make thursday to rally support against iraq , the differences over the court between the united states and some of its closest allies were conspicuous while mr bush met in detroit this morning with prime minister jean chr tien of canada to seek his support for a confrontation with iraq , canada s foreign minister , bill graham , was here chastising the united states for its ad hoc and often unilateral pursuit of the prosecution of crimes against humanity as he reassured democratic , lawabiding states that they have nothing to fear from the court , mr graham warned that the united states' lack of faith in it could erode the faith of other countries in american justice officials from germany , italy and the european union also said they would move ahead on expanding the range and legitimacy of the court the bush administration , citing fears that american soldiers or political leaders could face politically motivated prosecution , withdrew the united states' signature from the treaty creating the court and has sought bilateral agreements from countries around the world to exempt american citizens from its reach officials from the united nations and countries supporting the court have said the bush administration s efforts could undermine the court s credibility , crippling its ability to detain war criminals for trial the session today was part of the first organizing assembly for the new court , and representatives of the nations that ratified the treaty by july 2 were invited by that date , 76 states had ratified the treaty , bringing it into force much more quickly than many nations , including the united states , expected it is expected to go to work next spring none of the speakers today directly called for nations to spurn washington s overtures but they made it clear that they thought the american tactics were unnecessary many speakers said they thought the best way to convince the bush administration was by helping the court to get started prosecuting major human rights crimes in a fair , competent and effective manner , in the words of lene espersen , the justice minister of denmark , who spoke for the european union last week the organizing assembly approved a budget of 3937 million through 2003 and rules for electing 18 judges and a prosecutor the rules were intended to ensure that recognized professional jurists would be chosen for the bench , avoiding nominations based on political patronage diplomats also built in a requirement that governments cast half their votes for women among the candidates the assembly also adopted descriptions of the human rights crimes to be prosecuted united states delegates had agreed to those descriptions in a series of meetings since 1998 , when the treaty was completed but washington s pressure has worked with several countries , slowing the court s progress colombia , the world s third largest recipient of american aid for its war against leftist guerrillas , rightwing paramilitaries and drug traffickers , opted for a treaty provision exempting it for seven years from war crimes prosecutions under the court the philippines has also delayed ratifying the treaty but the representative from east timor , a young nation that was reported to have signed an agreement with the united states , said today in an unmistakably defensive tone that the measure was still under debate by its parliament some of the united states' most important friends were the most blunt today invoking the example of the trials of nazi war criminals , j rgen chrobog , a senior foreign ministry official from germany , said the american concerns about the new court were unfounded he pointed out that under the treaty , national courts take precedence , so if governments conscientiously prosecute war crimes by their own citizens , the international court would not have jurisdiction to take over those cases

television broadcasts and closely controls many elements of the company , which emphasizes quality and good things , like making a blueberry pie with a lattice crust or rediscovering petunias one analyst said the revelation of her stock trade complicated the company at a time when it appeared to have emerged from the recession and was starting to see advertising rise for its magazines and its television programs none of this has looked good for martha stewart as a person , in an environment where people are very sensitive to any appearance of impropriety by corporate leaders , said laura richardson , an analyst for adams , harkness hill in boston , who follows the stock it s unfortunate , because it has taken attention away from the fundamentals , which are improving for media companies and for martha stewart ms stewart , who has not been charged with any crime , issued a detailed summary of her activity with regard to imclone stock late yesterday she said she bought 5 , 000 shares several years ago in the public market and sold about 20 percent of them at 70 each as part of a bristolmyers squibb tender offer last october the remaining 3 , 928 shares , she said , were to be sold if the share price dropped below 60 she said she made the arrangement with her broker , whom she did not identify her statement is consistent with information she gave to the house energy and commerce committee , which will hold hearings today ms stewart is not on the list of witnesses scheduled to appear before the committee what remains unclear is exactly when , and why , ms stewart instructed her broker to sell the stock if it sank below 60 a share in october , imclone s share price climbed from 5848 a share at the start of the month to 6119 by the end of the month in november , the stock also rose , sinking below 60 once , on nov 9 , when it closed at 5975 a share by nov 30 , the stock had hit 72 , its high for the year , and remained in the 70ashare range for most of december a spokeswoman for ms stewart could not be reached for comment last night ms stewart appeared at an investor conference sponsored by us bancorp piper jaffray in manhattan yesterday afternoon , where she was pursued down a corridor by a camera crew from cnbc but refused to speak to reporters inside the meeting , where cameras were not allowed , she delivered a polished presentation about martha stewart living omnimedia that included a list of all the longtime employees , other than herself , who make up the creative and administrative talent at the company the model is very much to teach so our audience can do , she said about 36 million of her company s revenue comes from licensing the martha stewart name , and most of that business is from kmart , the discounter that declared bankruptcy in january kmart management has said martha stewart is essential to its turnaround , and she was one of the first creditors to be paid under kmart s reorganization a kmart spokesman refused to comment on the investigation one analyst said ms stewart would emerge financially unscathed from the investigation , forced at worst to return any profit she made from selling imclone but there may be additional fallout , said alan bromberg , professor of corporate and securities law at southern methodist university , because of other scandals a lot of people are pretty disgusted at ripoffs by insiders or people in high places , he said , and some of that is likely to rub off on her even if she is n't guilty in any technical sense it will hurt her some , but she s not going to go out of business

baltimore , oct 30 it is a tale of two lawyers one is an earnest public defender , who takes each case as a mission , works it extremely hard and uses his firstclass legal chops to represent firstclass thugs the other is a successful private defense lawyer with a waterfront office , a reputation for being crafty and a whole bunch of awards after his name what brings james wyda and joshua treem together , at least for now , is a case that has been called unwinnable , one that even johnnie cochran said he would n't touch the two men , experienced criminal defense lawyers , have been catapulted into the middle of the washingtonarea sniper investigation this week mr wyda , the head of the public defender office in baltimore , began a campaign to dedemonize his new client , the prime suspect in the sniper case , john muhammad we have yet to hear any evidence against mr muhammad , mr wyda said at an impromptu news conference all we know about him is that he served his country honorably in cases such as these , with emotions so high , we have to make sure we do n't rush to judgment those were the first nice words anyone had said about mr muhammad , 41 , an army veteran accused of methodically planning a shooting rampage that killed 10 people meanwhile , mr treem , a partner at a highpowered baltimore law firm , was receiving the first layers of paperwork on the case against lee malvo , the 17yearold sidekick who the authorities said traveled the country in mr muhammad s beatup chevy caprice , helping him kill the two lawyers have represented their share of killers , child molesters , scammers and thieves but colleagues who have stood in their shoes , drafted to defend supernotorious personalities , say mr wyda and mr treem are about to set off on a crusade that no one can really be prepared for you know how hated their clients are \? said stephen jones , the lawyer who represented the oklahoma city bomber , timothy j mcveigh on a scale of 1 to 10 , i 'd say a 15 that s the thing with these cases they provoke the most intense emotions you get death threats and hate mail your family gets pulled in taking a case like this completely changes your life mr muhammad has not been in custody even a week and the race to execute him has already hit a gallop prosecutors in maryland , virginia and the justice department have been vying to see who gets to try him first a quick and sure death is what they all promise even mr muhammad s son said on larry king live that his father should be executed the case against mr malvo is a little murkier as a juvenile , he may not be executed in maryland or by the federal government , but he may be in virginia also , it is not clear how much of a spell he was under , having turned to mr muhammad , a stern disciplinarian , as a father figure some authorities say there is evidence the 17yearold pulled the trigger in some killings none of that evidence has been made public there has been no shortage of vilification , with profilers , law enforcement and politicians on tv for three weeks , theorizing who the monster was when mr muhammad and mr malvo were arrested on thursday , their faces became among the most recognizable in america because of a potential conflict of interest , mr muhammad and mr malvo have been assigned lawyers from separate offices while prosecutors will want to try the two together , most defense lawyers predict that mr wyda and mr treem will push to split the cases that will allow them to argue that the other defendant was the gunman though no witnesses have come forward to say they saw the two shoot anybody , the authorities say that when they arrested mr muhammad and mr malvo , they found a 223caliber rifle behind the seat of the chevy caprice the two were sleeping in the gun was tested and connected to several of the killings defense lawyers say that will be a very difficult piece of evidence to explain away mr wyda and mr treem declined to be interviewed , saying it was inappropriate to discuss their strategy both were appointed by the court because neither defendant could afford a lawyer though different in style and ambition , the two lawyers share wide respect in the baltimore legal scene mr wyda , a law professor and graduate of yale law school , is known as very calm , very thorough and very committed the stereotype of the criminal defense lawyer is one of a headline grabber who charges in , raises all kinds of issues and attacks witnesses that s not jim s style , said gregg bernstein , a baltimore defense lawyer he s much more calm , deliberate and focused he feels very strongly about the representation of indigents and those less fortunate some in this profession are more cynical jim is one who believes in the system mr wyda , 43 and father of two , is also known for a love of books and an intense driveway basketball game he grew up in a bluecollar neighborhood in baltimore , got a scholarship to a private high school , went to trinity college , clerked for a federal judge and worked his way up the public defender system unlike mr wyda , mr treem is not an employee of the federal public defender office a partner at schulman , treem , kaminkow , gilden ravenell , he was selected from a pool of 100 lawyers who do federal criminal defense work by contract in baltimore last year , mr treem , 54 , won the criminal justice act john adams award , from the federal district court of maryland before that , he was named one of maryland s top criminal lawyers by baltimore magazine a graduate of johns hopkins university and duke law school , mr treem started his law career in the prestigious attorney general s honors program and then worked as a federal prosecutor in cases like this , the judges do n't just pick anybody they are very selective , said larry nathans , a lawyer who used to work in the federal defender s office here josh is very smart and he works very hard he sees the issues and will spend a tremendous amount of time going through every nuance of the case it is not clear how long this tale of two lawyers will last if the sniper case gets sent to a state court in virginia or maryland , the public defenders in those areas will most likely step in mr jones , the lawyer who represented mr mcveigh , said whoever ended up defending the sniper suspects should expect every day from here on to be filled with adventure and despair and it s an experience that stays with you , mr jones said not a day goes by that i do n't think of tim link to sniper rifle is seen washington , oct 30 \( reuters \) the rifle connected to the sniper shootings has been implicated in an alabama killing that first led police to suspect mr muhammad and mr malvo , the washington post reported tonight chief john h wilson of the montgomery , ala , police said new ballistics tests suggested that the gun used in a sept 21 liquor store shooting was the bushmaster xm15 found in mr muhammad s car , the post reported photo james wyda , right , with his associate paul hazlehurst , is the lawyer for john muhammad , who was charged in the sniper attacks \( associated press \)
sandra bullock is in the middle of doing some final tweaking on her new movie , two weeks notice , at the brill building in midtown manhattan when she appears in one of its cluttered offices and throws down the gauntlet i'm the queen of saying absolutely nothing , she says defiantly within seconds of plopping down on a couch i can make somebody feel like they 've gotten an entire interview and i will have said the same thing a million times before that remains to be seen but it s a relief to discover that someone with as impeccable a reputation as ms bullock s even those who speak anonymously with nothing to gain call her unusually down to earth for a star actually has an edge certainly there are reasons ms bullock may be feeling defensive one tabloid newspaper reported that the lastminute reshoots for two weeks notice augured poorly for the movie , which she both produced and stars in she counters that warner brothers actually liked the movie so much that the studio offered to put up more money for any improvements ms bullock wanted to make dawn taubin , president of marketing at warner brothers , said the studio had agreed to some last minute tweaks to make it as good as it can be ms bullock , 38 , also finds herself at a crossroads in her career she says unequivocally that she is finished with her run as one of america s cinema sweethearts you 're not going to see me in any romantic comedies for a good long time , she says i love them , but i have nothing else to offer i feel like this little chapter is closing in my life ms bullock says two weeks notice , opening on friday nationwide , in which she plays a lawyer who represents an irresponsible real estate tycoon \( hugh grant \) , is the ultimate romantic comedy for me i did it with the person i wanted to do it with in the style in which i wanted to do it , she says in ms bullock s case , what sounds like career spin is probably close to the truth though it might be shrewd to talk about moving on from the types of movies that helped make her a star especially as younger actresses like reese witherspoon are already commanding bigger paychecks than she is ms bullock has been preparing for her next chapter for some time two weeks notice is the fifth movie for which she has done double duty as producer and star while filming it this year , she was also working as the executive producer of george lopez , the abc sitcom based in part on the life of the standup comedian george lopez being behind the scenes is more enjoyable to me now than what i do for a living in front of the camera , she says i think there s far more talent out there who should be in front of the camera than me the film producer lynda obst , whom ms bullock considers a mentor , says ms bullock has learned to be a real producer many movie stars dabble in producing and take credit , but sandy is the real thing , says ms obst , who first worked with ms bullock on the 1998 romantic comedy hope floats i was not happy about having to share a credit with a movie star , ms obst recalls by telephone from los angeles philosophically it was a problem for me i told her , 'if you 're going to be my partner , you 're going to work' and she did she showed up more than actual producers do , to the early morning meetings , the teamsters deals , the location scouting there was n't a beat of work she skipped i told her if she was n't so beautiful , she could run a studio in the interview at the brill building , a 90minute conversation late last month , ms bullock came across more as a workaholic producer than as a movie star , stopping frequently to answer phone calls about postproduction details she seemed embarrassed talking about herself she spent the first half hour answering questions with her hand covering parts of her face like someone uncomfortable with the spotlight she s not a narcissistic maniac , says ms obst there s a shyness to her and a desire to deflect attention onto others she enjoys aspects of being a movie star , she loves the clothes , but she s not about having a public life that may be partly because ms bullock is the rare star who seems to have had a relatively stable childhood and never sought fame as a panacea her only real trauma in life , in fact , seems to have come from adjusting to being a celebrity i get very scared that there 'll be a point where i ca n't maintain or do n't live my life the way i did before any of this happened , she says because i liked the way my life was before all this happened there was nothing i would have changed about it , even monetarily but ms bullock seems to have come to terms with her stardom you just keep your mouth shut , she says do n't announce you 're there fly under another name or take road trips rather than planes i think i 've done pretty well in flying under the radar ms bullock divides her time between an apartment in downtown manhattan and a house on a lake in austin , tex she says she has a group of friends who are so close , they fine each other 100 if they do n't return a phone call within 24 hours
offering some of the best angling of the year as well as the start of upland bird and waterfowl seasons , fall in the northeast is often more than one who both hunts and fishes can successfully embrace after the steaming , sultry days of august are done , lakes and rivers begin to cool trout no longer have to sulk in lifesustaining cold water at the mouths of feeder brooks or in icy springs welling up from pond or lake bottom as in spring and early summer , they are once again free to forage widely , a final burst of intense feeding before winter s bitter cold renders them less active the annual fall transition from fishing to hunting engenders ambivalence among some who use both rod and gun this month , for example , i was tying trout flies in anticipation of a visit to cole pond in enfield , nh deep , cold and covering 17 acres , cole pond is a forestsurrounded hilltop jewel that holds some large brook trout , is accessible only on foot and is limited to fly fishing midway through my endeavors , i thought of the substantial stands of old beech trees along the winding trail to the pond there is no lovelier light than that of the late afternoon sun shining through yellowing leaves of beeches and of the ruffed grouse i have often seen scrabbling for beechnuts under those trees at that point i rose from my flytying desk to check out the overandunder 20gauge shotgun that i use for grouse hunting i inspected its bores , swung it to my shoulder a few times , and then , of course , it was necessary to see if i had a box of proper grouse loads this syndrome began nearly 50 years ago when i first began hiking to new hampshire s remote trout ponds all my fishing gear , which sometimes included an inflatable raft , went into a backpack so that my hands would be free to carry my shotgun toting a heavy pack does n't enhance one s wing shooting ability , but every once in a while i would bring home a grouse as well as trout , and i still follow the ritual when fishing remote trout ponds in fall trying to pursue both fish and birds on the same trip is n't really practical , but in the case of grouse and trout the fishing does n't suffer the hunting is another matter most of the leaves are still aloft deep into october and many birds flush and fly away , heard but not seen on occasion the urge to hunt and fish on the same outing gets out of hand a few decades ago , one of my sons and i went sea duck shooting in cape pogue pond on martha s vineyard , where we now live we set up our blind at dawn in a cove that is often visited , or at least , flown over , by both scoters and eiders coming in from the ocean we put out a dozen decoys and in less than half an hour were enjoying some good shooting most of the ducks were n't decoying , but many veered our way to look at our spread then , an hour or so after sunup , the water around and among our decoys was churned white by striped bass chasing baitfish the feeding bass stayed in front of us for more than an hour while we took half a dozen ducks driving along the ocean beach on our way home , we decided that another hunt was in order and that we would bring fishing gear with us armed with fishing rods and shotguns , we returned two days later a few ducks showed in the distance early on , but none came within range for more than an hour we had taken one scoter before the stripers put in an appearance then whether to fish or shoot became the question we would scan the skies , see no ducks , scuttle from the blind to cast , and a minute later half a dozen big heavybodied scoters would be flying low over the water in our direction only to flare when they spotted us scurrying back to our hiding place after an hour or two of this the fish departed and the flights of ducks ended and we went home with one mediumsized striper and the one scoter we had taken early on occasionally the timing of a season turns me off in recent years , massachusetts has had an early canada goose season that , for me at least , has no appeal this year that season was sept 925 there are plenty of resident canada geese on the vineyard , but i do n't wish to sweat in a goose blind in shirt sleeve weather , swatting mosquitoes and deer flies and watching summer visitors strolling through the dunes with picnic baskets and beach chairs or kayaking past my decoys in fall in the northeast because the time remaining for open water fishing is running out one often debates which species to pursue along the northeast seacoast , stripers are getting ready to move south and bluefish are also poised for departure if the water is unusually warm , their exodus will be slowed , as will that of two summerarriving species , atlantic bonito and false albacore and then , if you have a salt pond nearby as i do with tisbury great pond , there is almost always a bonus in the form of youngoftheyear bluefish , fish spawned offshore in june that seek the sanctuary of bays , estuaries and salt ponds and grow at an astonishing rate early this month , my companion ruth kirchmeier and i took a canoe to tisbury great pond we had a triple quest oysters , seaweed as fertilizermulch for our gardens and striped bass or bluefish from the pond s opening to the ocean we quickly gathered the seaweed and the oysters , but there was nothing going on at the opening a strong onshore wind had created heavy surf and the cut appeared to be closing \( manmade openings through the barrier beach two or three times a year keep the pond s salinity at the proper level for softshelled clams , oysters and other brackish water critters and plants \) we got back to our launching area at the mouth of tiah s cove at dusk and while lashing the canoe to my truck s roof rack i looked at an arm of the cove about 100 yards to the north and thought that i saw fish breaking on the surface i returned the following evening just before sundown with a light spinning rod and some small top water plugs and soon had four young bluefish on the beach , two of which we had for supper that night three of them were more than a foot long they had been dining on dense schools of baby menhaden about an inch and a half long that also came into the pond after being spawned in the ocean the multiplequest syndrome has also affected my deer hunting if i see a clump of oyster mushrooms while poking through the woods , i cannot resist picking them and the gun i most often carry in recent years is a drilling a shotgunrifle combination the shotgun is for the ruffed grouse i might put up while looking for deer one does n't want to shoot a bird smaller than a duck with a highvelocity big game cartridge i have killed three deer in five hunting trips with that drilling but have never fired it at a grouse drawing \( illustration by james prosek \)
in 1979 , a 21yearold ann hampton callaway moved from chicago to new york to start a singing career maybe even to follow in the path of her idol , barbra streisand , who had become a star at the same age people compared her extravagantly rangy and supple voice to ms streisand s , but fate had different plans for ms callaway she spent a dozen years in the noisy world of the piano bars , where she all but swung from the chandelier to get attention accompanying herself on piano , she made everyone sing her name to the tune of god bless america mimicked the mgm movie star kathryn grayson , breaking a glass with a tinny soprano high note improvised songs out of phrases solicited from the audience , like colostomy bag and threemasted schooner sandwiched between the party pieces were ballads , in which she poured out her heart so nakedly that it was hard not to be moved in 1987 , she wrote at the same time , a tearful plea to overcome our fears and join to build a world that loves and understands that summer , she announced that the song had been sent to ms streisand everyone cheered and nothing happened not for some time , anyway ten years to the day after it was written , ms streisand recorded her final touchups on a grandiloquent version of at the same time to ms callaway , this was a sign that , as she put it , the little voice inside her head was right never give up , and do n't let anyone tell you what you ca n't do the results are impressive , if a bit scattered in 2000 , she won a tony nomination as best featured actress in the longrunning musical swing at ms streisand s request , she wrote i 've dreamed of you , a confectionary love song , for the star s wedding to james brolin , the actor having spoofed herself in the piano bars with the 'i'm too white to sing the blues' blues , ms callaway now salutes louis armstrong , joe williams and billie holiday in signature , her eighth cd that album , and another , this christmas , both on after 9 records , are the focus of her sixnight run at new york s jazz standard , which starts on tuesday ms callaway is currently billed as a jazz singer but her key selling point outside manhattan is her ditty about the blushing girl from flushing , the theme of the hit television series the nanny , which ran six seasons , ending in 1999 the song made her a fortune recently , in her spacious apartment on the upper west side of manhattan , she bounded into the living room , tea tray in hand , and settled onto the sofa to talk now 44 , ms callaway has managed to keep one foot in reality and the other in the clouds for her , no goal is beyond reach i learned from picasso , she said he had all these different chapters of his work , but he did n't do them all at once he focused i do feel that i am essentially a lover , that i am here to love through my music , and that every moment is an opportunity to love well , ok but the uninitiated may have trouble figuring out exactly what she does the chameleonlike quality that proved such fun in piano bars has made her hard to market in the showbusiness world beyond when i was 10 , i thought , 'why are n't i with the beatles \? ' she said then i wanted to be an opera singer then i wanted to be a jazz singer then i wanted to be an actress then i remember when i was a little girl wanting to be president , because i could make inspirational speeches ultimately she became known as a cabaret singer , a tag that spells death at the box office it took her more than a decade to get an album released for generations of aspiring songbirds , including her , the fabled overnight stardom of ms streisand set a disillusioning example the notion was that if you have talent it will be recognized when you 're young , ms callaway said and if you do n't turn into a star fairly young , it probably means you do n't have talent she inherited her drive from her father , john callaway , a chicago newscaster who has won nine emmy awards , and her mother , shirley , a classical vocal coach in the 70 s , ms callaway majored in acting at the university of illinois six feet tall in heels and visibly uneasy in her body , she was n't anyone s idea of an actress she often recalls the day she went to audition for a school production of chekhov s three sisters all the candidates stood in a circle one by one they were called to read , except her i did n't get a role or anything in the show , she said , frowning it was another example of , 'no matter what i do , i'm somehow invisible' i was devastated her sister , the theater singer and actress liz callaway , knows her determination she was always very positive she had a lot of moxie i was the shyer one but liz became a broadway star at 22 , winning a tony nomination for the musical baby i was very proud of her and happy for her , said ann , but i was also frustrated , because i did n't have the chance i was too tall , too strong , i was n't an ing nue , and people did n't know what to do with me
hebron , west bank , nov 16 settlers massed to recite psalms here tonight at a solemn service near the scene of a palestinian ambush on friday that killed 12 people , including the commander of israeli forces in the area benny elon , a member of parliament and a settler from north of jerusalem , declared , we will free hebron of these wily murderers the earth will not cover the blood that has been spilled , he said , addressing more than 1 , 000 people gathered on a moonlit patch of dirt where the army had bulldozed a palestinian orchard after another recent attack if anyone does n't want to live in peace with us , they should be deported around the rally , hebron was silent and seemingly empty , as more than 100 , 000 palestinians locked themselves in their homes under israeli curfewisraeli forces , who seized control of the city , conducted house to house searches , arresting dozens of palestinian men and blindfolding them before busing them out of hebron the israeli army described the attack as a carefully planned assault on jewish settlers returning from friday night prayers , a trap laid to draw security forces into an exposed alleyway none of the worshipers were among the dead , israeli officials said today they said that those killed were five border police soldiers , four regular army soldiers two of them officers and three civilian security guards from the nearby israeli settlement of kiryat arba the commander who died , colonel dror weinberg , was the highestranking officer to be shot dead in the conflict , which has lasted more than two years israeli forces responding to the ambush killed three palestinians , whom they identified as the attackers during tonight s rally , mr elon and other speakers called for the creation of a settlement near the site of the attack , to connect kiryat arba to the tiny jewish settlement inside hebron young men who called for vengeance were shouted down by speakers declaring that the army should do the job but as the psalms ended and the service broke up , a few young men pounded on the doors of nearby palestinian houses and headed off toward palestinian areas before scores of soldiers and police officers turned them back the islamist group islamic jihad claimed responsibility for the attack , calling it retaliation for israel s killing a week ago of its local leader in the west bank city of jenin it was the deadliest assault on israelis in hebron in the twoyear conflict the ambush was a devastating blow to the israeli army , which only on friday morning had described hebron , with the rest of the southern west bank , as at least temporarily calm and under control israeli officials said prime minister ariel sharon was consulting with his new defense minister , shaul mofaz , in considering a response mr mofaz , like the new foreign minister , benjamin netanyahu , has long been an advocate of expelling the palestinian leader , yasir arafat but a senior israeli official said mr sharon had ruled out immediate action against mr arafat with the israeli army already in control of the west bank , it was not immediately clear what retaliatory steps would be taken the question is what response we have left in our basket , the official said uzi landau , the minister of public security and a rightwing member of the government , said it was time to destroy mr arafat s governing palestinian authority we have to destroy the terrorist infrastructure and that means destroying the palestinian authority and the islamic militant hamas group , extracting from them a heavy price , mr landau said before the attack on friday , the israeli army said it was seeking to ease restrictions on palestinians , at least in the southern west bank , as they celebrated the holiday of ramadan that step appeared sure to be reversed before dawn today , israeli helicopters fired rockets at a metal shop in gaza city that the israeli army said was used to make weapons today , army bulldozers leveled the orchard here where the palestinians laid their ambush the attack came on a tranquil , moonlit night along a lonely stretch of road shortly after 7 pm , jewish settlers were returning from prayer at the cave of the patriarchs , revered by jews and muslims as the burial place of abraham accompanied by a jeep from the border police , they walked along a dusty road known as worshipers' lane toward kiryat arba , at hebron s edge the road , which passes through the israelicontrolled section of hebron , dips into a gully , which until today was planted with olive trees , before climbing past palestinian homes toward a gate to kiryat arba the first fusillade came from among the trees in the shadowy gully , the army said bullets smashed into the armored jeep , fracturing its bulletproof glass hearing the gunshots , guards from kiryat arba raced down the hill still firing and throwing hand grenades , the palestinian gunmen fell back down a narrow alleyway that intersects

judges at the figure skating events have the best seats in the house they clearly see , or choose not to see , as was witnessed in the pairs event , the most blatant and the most minute technical details of an athletic performance what they do not witness , however , is the intense preparation that nearly all skaters routinely execute behind the curtain , in the corridors and empty spaces of the arena this is an event in itself and it will be repeated on tuesday when the women begin the short program these rituals have been in place for years today it seems they play an even more important role because of the intensity of the competition and the incredible difficulty in the skaters' programs , with triple and quad jumps everywhere only by being physically and mentally warmed up , having the ability to manage the stress , ride the emotional rollercoaster , and understand and accept the crucial role of your coach , do you even have a chance at successfully competing at the olympic level , or at any level in acknowledging the uniqueness of skating versus a team sport , you definitely travel down a different road a glimpse down the backstage corridor gives you an idea of the various warmup techniques skaters jump , skip , run , do situps and splits against the wall some like jumping rope , while others choose to take a lap around the arena yoga positions and stances help with centering , relaxing the body through breathing and focusing , none of which you can compete efficiently without skaters are flexible and strive to lengthen limbs through sustained and sometimes pretzellike positions the twotime united states silver medalist sasha cohen is deliberate in her routine of pilates mat exercises i used to do a ballet barre designed especially for me by georgina parkinson , the ballet mistress of american ballet theater and the former principal dancer with the royal ballet almost every skater has a definite routine that works for him or her the mental warmup is an equally important part of the equation i tried to find a quiet place to sit , close my eyes , and visualize my program if i made mistakes , i would go back and fix them , making mental notes a fourminute program might sometimes take six minutes to get through , depending on my concentration level i would then get together with my partner , michael seibert , to do our runthrough on the floor this was a crucial time to connect and establish rhythm and timing , both physically and mentally a slight miss with a hand position could be devastating in competition then you have to deal with the interminable wait between warmup and performance , and all the stress , anxiety and emotions those who say they do not get nervous are not being candid nearly everyone gets nervous , but the greatest competitors are those who can embrace their fears and emotions , and channel that nervous energy in a positive manner during the performance finding a space where you can be at peace with the distractions that these natural feelings bring forth is the key even the most prepared and confident competitors feel this stress they are different only in that they have mastered the art of competing and that is a journey that takes time and patience coaches play an integral role behind the curtain they not only serve as teachers , but as therapists , motivators , security guards , good listeners , fans and friends our first coach , doreen denny , knew when to provide comic relief to break the tension and when to give us our space bobby thompson , our coach in sarajevo , yugoslavia , in 1984 , kept a calming distance when necessary , but was nearby to encourage and inspire us coaches offer a safe haven , even if it is only temporary the united states and world champion , michelle kwan , has chosen to go to these olympic games without the security of a skating expert some have speculated that her decision is foolish others have said that they admire her tenacity , confidence and willingness to take on the sole responsibility for her performance her father will be standing by her side as cheerleader and fan , and who knows \? in the end , she will use all the expertise she has received from every great coach and choreographer frank carroll and sarah kawahara being the most recent and work her magic on the ice there is no doubt they helped put things in perspective i would hope she was a keen listener the figure skating world is distinctly different especially in comparison to team sports it is not only a matter of completing a jump , spin or piece of footwork on time and to the music but you must do all this while maintaining a calm , dignified and confident appearance under the most unbelievable pressure you are out there on that ice alone , and while you sense the support and energy of the crowd , you are going solo all you have is the confidence and belief that your training has prepared you for the moment at hand in tennis , the ball is either in or out in track and alpine skiing , you are judged by the clock in hockey , the team with the most goals wins the same is true with runs in baseball or points in football in figure skating , you put yourself on the ice , in front of 20 , 000 people and nine judges , hoping that a great performance , a stylish costume and some major behindthescenes politicking will earn you the ultimate honor the olympic gold medal the reality , however , is that even without the gold medal , figure skaters who experience this journey come out with something equally as golden pride , selfesteem and dignity photos the american michelle kwan practicing at the salt lake ice center the women s short program is scheduled to begin on tuesday \( photographs by associated press \)
it had to happen eventually chinatown already spills over into two neighborhoods moving from modest to mod little italy and the lower east side and it is just a cellphone s throw from tribeca and soho gentrification was bound to come to chinatown now that it has arrived , the neighborhood is experiencing the usual side effects , including landlords trying to evict longtime tenants who pay very little rent in favor of deeppocketed bond traders but this time there is a twist it seems that many of the chinatown apartments that tenants are clinging to are illegal subdivisions , minuscule single rooms divided by little more than wooden boards so when the landlord comes to evict these tenants , he can do so by wielding the city s building codes from 200 to 400 families have been evicted from chinatown every year in recent years , legal aid lawyers and social workers say many have moved to chinese enclaves in brooklyn or queens some families have become homeless to many immigrant families , there is not much choice either a tiny and squalid living space or nothing these apartments cause us a lot of headache , said rosie huang , a housing advocate and a counselor at university settlement , a social service agency that works on the lower east side and in chinatown this is a fire problem , a health problem and a sanitary problem but if the government is going to evict people strictly according to the fire codes and health regulations , onethird of chinatown will be gone in the short term , having a piece of roof over your head is better than having none , she added but in the long run , we need more lowincome housing to solve the crisis there is little dispute that illegal spaces are all over chinatown in some cases , said a number of social workers , some immigrant tenants profited from cutting their rentcontrolled or rentstabilized one and twobedroom apartments into smaller units , and illegally renting them out to other families others say that in the 1980 s , as huge waves of immigrants poured out from china , some chinatown landlords divided singlefamily apartments themselves but no matter who did the dividing , these illegal living quarters mean that many families share one kitchen and bathroom the spaces , often partitioned into warrens with thin wooden boards , could be firetraps now the building owners are courting city agencies to come inspect those longtime hazards this is what is happening at one building on rutgers street zongbo zhou and his wife , caizhu tan , live in one of those tiny spaces , with wooden boards for walls mr zhou , a gaunt 82yearold , once taught chinese in elementary schools in rural guangdong , china , then butchered chickens in chinatown s live poultry market before retiring for 14 years , the couple paid 300 a month rent on a squeezed 150squarefoot room , with a fullsize bed , a small table , a cupboard and a couple of chairs but now their landlord wants them out they say that the wooden partitions were erected before they moved in at the end of last year , the landlord , bao li , called in the fire department to inspect the building s second floor when the fire department found a violation , he evicted every tenant 18 immigrants from china since then , mr li has started to modernize those apartments and he has told all tenants on the other floors to move out immediately why was n't the landlord interested in the fire hazards five years ago \? mumbled mr zhou , who is almost toothless and , although he admits there is a danger from fire , his biggest worry is being thrown out living in the streets is a lot more dangerous than living here the department of buildings does not spotcheck for fire hazards in buildings instead , it waits for complaints to be filed if the conditions are unsafe , said ilyse fink , the head spokeswoman for the department , referring to the subdivisions , then the landlord has done the correct thing but shame on the landlord , she said , if he has known about the hazards for years and is turning to us only now bao li , the landlord on rutgers street , has filed a complaint with the state supreme court , claiming that the tenants are squatters illegally occupying his building the tenants say that they have always paid rent , and that mr li has even given them receipts from time to time john gorman , a lawyer hired by asian americans for equality , an immigrant advocacy group , to represent the remaining tenants in mr zhou s building , said he planned to file a countersuit against mr li for knowingly letting his tenants live in illegally subdivided spaces and frequently failing to provide heat and hot water he will also ask the court to compel the landlord to erect fireresistant walls between the units to make them legal apartments the telephone number listed for the landlord , bao li , has been disconnected his lawyer , mark friedlander , declined to comment , saying , i do not like litigating cases in newspapers there have been at least three cases since 1987 in which judges required the landlords to convert illegal subdivisions into legal units for the current tenant so there is a chance of winning an eviction case in court , social workers say , but very few tenants decide to try many , usually recent immigrants , are too frightened by the tactics adopted by some landlords
in his long uphill battle to acquire directv , charles w ergen , the chairman of echostar communications , may have one last slim chance to salvage his satellite television deal so why is he reluctant to take it \? antitrust opposition to echostar s pending acquisition of directv is mounting , and mr ergen s opportunity to overcome it may lie in striking a side deal with charles f dolan , the chairman of cablevision , the nation s seventhlargest cable television company cablevision has proposed that regulators allay their antitrust concerns by transferring some of echostar s licenses to a newly created cablevision satellite operation even though his deal appears to be foundering in washington , mr ergen seems to be holding out for total victory rather than embrace the compromise so far , at least antitrust officials in washington seem to be leaning against echostar s plan to acquire hughes electronics and its directv unit , a deal that as currently configured would combine the nation s only two significant satellite television providers lawyers involved in the review said on monday that senior justice department staff members had recommended trying to block the deal a takeover that mr ergen and echostar arranged last fall , beating a competing bid by rupert murdoch s news corporation on its face , the antitrust case for rejecting the deal is simple and powerful most consumers currently have three choices for pay television directv , echostar s dish network and their local cable company but an echostardirectv combination would reduce the number of choices to two and for consumers whose homes are not reached by cable , the number of choices would fall to one it is possible that charles a james , head of the justice department s antitrust division , will overrule his staff and bless the echostardirectv deal but few in washington see that as a real possibility , unless echostar agrees to some sort of groundbreaking compromise , which so far the company has not appeared willing to do at this point , mr ergen s best hope seems to be making common cause with mr dolan last week , cablevision presented a plan to staff members at the federal communications commission , which is also reviewing the echostardirectv deal under the cablevision plan , echostar and dominion , a religious broadcaster that is under contract with echostar , would transfer 17 satellite frequencies to cablevision s nascent satellite operation we believe that if the merger is approved with a modest condition , that it will create an extraordinary opportunity for enhanced competition that will deliver more satellite programming to more viewers nationwide , mr dolan said yesterday cablevision would use those frequencies in conjunction with its own satellite , rainbow 1 , which it plans to launch into orbit next march next year , cablevision hopes to introduce a national directbroadcast satellite service of its own , according to its fcc presentation the underlying concept is that by transferring frequencies to cablevision , a new competitor would be created to take the place of directv , which would be acquired by echostar the 17 frequencies that echostar and dominion would give up would be dwarfed by the assets echostar would gain in acquiring directv for cablevision , the plan has an added bonus the company s fcc presentation makes no mention of any payment for the 17 frequencies it may be an unlikely plan , given the nebulous nature of cablevision s satellite operation , to which the company has already committed more than 400 million mr dolan and cablevision have declined to give investors any public hint yet of what its satellite service will offer or how much it will ultimately cost to develop cablevision has said only that its satellite ambitions will not obscure the company s broader financial goals so the cablevision plan may be a long shot , but it may also be mr ergen s best chance in hopes of appeasing antitrust officials , echostar over the months has already offered to keep its prices stable , to deliver local stations and to ensure diversity of programming none of those offers swayed the justice department antitrust staff according to people close to the review , however , echostar has told federal officials that the company is not interested in the cablevision plan in fact , some people close to the companies said that cablevision and mr ergen had not conferred at all marc d lumpkin , an echostar spokesman , said only that his company had informed the fcc that it planned to use those 17 frequencies for its own new services in the end , however , it may not matter just what compromises mr ergen is willing to make from the beginning , many regulatory experts believed that his deal was doomed this is not a deal you can negotiate your way into , scott cleland , chief executive of the precursor group , a consulting firm in washington , said yesterday this deal will be rejected this is as close to a nobrainer as you can come photo an ariane4 rocket lifted a directv satellite from a launching pad in french guiana last year \( associated press \)
with a week left for teams to negotiate exclusively with their free agents , the mets are taking a familiar , if dangerous , approach with third baseman edgardo alfonzo after the 1999 season , the mets watched as john olerud left to play for the seattle mariners after the mets were unwilling to lock him up before he could negotiate with other teams a year later , mike hampton left for a richer deal with the colorado rockies now the question is whether alfonzo will do the same , and whether the mets will regret it unlike olerud and hampton , alfonzo has repeatedly said he wants to remain a met but the mets' negotiations with alfonzo have been nonexistent of late they have not spoken with his agent , peter greenberg , since oct 17 , when greenberg disclosed that the mets did not intend to offer alfonzo a contract before he could begin negotiating with other teams on nov 12 greenberg said the mets told him they did not want to set the market price for alfonzo but in taking a cautious approach , the mets risk losing a third baseman to the yankees for the second straight season the mets traded robin ventura to the yankees last offseason and he became an allstar , before slumping badly in the second half ventura is now a free agent , and he appears willing to accept a oneyear deal to remain with the yankees alfonzo , meanwhile , has drawn interest from six or seven teams , greenberg said , although none can talk money with him until next week some are interested in him as a second baseman , some as a third baseman , greenberg said greenberg would not name the teams , but he has said that alfonzo s preference is to remain in new york , and one baseball official confirmed that the yankees have expressed interest alfonzo , who turns 29 on thursday and is 6 years younger than ventura , wants a multiyear deal and could become a publicrelations problem for the mets if he were to excel for the yankees i think we have to make our own decisions on the information we have on our players and not be swayed by other teams , mets general manager steve phillips said alfonzo , who earned 62 million last season and batted 308 with 16 home runs and 56 runs batted in , wanted a fiveyear contract from the mets but alfonzo recently told the mets he would consider a shorterterm deal for more money , perhaps two years for 10 million annually the mets are willing to pay alfonzo 8 million a year but will not consider more than a twoyear deal until alfonzo gets another offer last week phillips termed the alfonzo situation one of many business decisions looming for the mets and said that in the end we would have to decide whether a four or fiveyear deal is appropriate one baseball official described the mets as being leery of overspending the way they did a year ago and being unsure of how much alfonzo is really worth is he the player he was in 1999 and 2000 , when he averaged 26 home runs and 101 rbi , or the player from the past two seasons , when injuries limited him to an average of 17 home runs and 53 rbi \? still , the mets' current alternatives are slim , beginning with the rookie ty wigginton , who made 3 errors in 14 games at third base last season alfonzo returned to third base this season to accommodate roberto alomar , after alfonzo spent the previous three seasons at second base alfonzo s versatility intrigues the yankees , who would play him at third until drew henson is ready although it is not clear when , or if , that would occur then move alfonzo to second base if they can persuade alfonso soriano to play the outfield but yankees officials are torn on whether alfonzo would be able to physically handle a return to second base or whether it might be easier to sign ventura for another season the phillies have shown an interest in alfonzo , but their priority at third seems to be the free agent david bell of san francisco philadelphia is also aggressively pursuing two other free agents first baseman jim thome of cleveland and the lefthander tom glavine of atlanta thome is expected to visit the phillies on thursday and his signing would most likely preclude the phillies from being able to afford alfonzo phillies general manager ed wade will travel to atlanta tomorrow and is scheduled to speak with glavine , said glavine s agent , gregg clifton inside pitch the mets have had conversations with dan horwits , the agent for the lefthanded reliever mark guthrie , about a multiyear contract the mets have received permission from baltimore to speak with denny walling , its roving minor league hitting coordinator , about becoming the hitting coach for manager art howe walling was howe s hitting coach in oakland from 199698 the orioles have asked to speak with the mets assistant general manager , jim duquette , about their general manager s position , but the mets have not decided whether to grant permission

' and then he heard we were in bed , and he said maybe we should n't i said 'get out of here i 've been in politics long enough to know that this kind of thing happens' mr yassky won the runoff , 27 to 26 elizabeth rose daly , a democratic district leader who came in third that day , learned a lesson from mr yassky you have to be on a war footing , she said for mr yassky , victory meant the deployment of his affable but superhuman persistence the odds against him were long he is 37 but looks younger he had never held office and was just one of the scores of hopefuls last year who saw opportunity in the city s termlimits law in his brooklyn district , he faced a crowded field and a favored , machinebacked candidate and like other politicians , he had to weather a canceled primary on sept 11 and a radically altered political landscape for the rescheduled primary two weeks later but he won , handily , and last tuesday he began his fouryear term of office mr yassky s quest took the better part of two years he grappled with campaign finances , the tactics of mass mailings and voters too busy to talk in the process , he turned a long shot , a law professor s pipe dream , into a place at city hall in november 2000 , mr yassky sat in a brooklyn heights coffee shop and sketched out his bleak prospects for replacing kenneth k fisher as the council member for district 33 , a jagged area spanning brooklyn heights , greenpoint and parts of williamsburg , park slope and boerum hill his key opponent was steven d cohn , a political insider with strength in williamsburg and greenpoint mr diamondstone described mr cohn s support among one group , the hasidim , this way it is monolithic it is unwavering it is predetermined although mr yassky painted himself as a progressive and mr cohn as a member of the democratic machine , mr yassky was hardpressed to name any issues on which they differed i do n't know , he said i realize that s a ridiculous admission his background , though , was nothing like that of mr cohn , who is a product of brooklyn and its schools mr yassky grew up in rockville centre , on long island , and on the west side of manhattan , and was educated at dalton , princeton and yale law school he was a clerk for a federal judge , practiced law at a prestigious firm and worked for several years for mr schumer , who was then a united states representative by the time he turned 30 , he was chief counsel for the house subcommittee on crime he helped to draft the brady bill , requiring background checks for gun buyers , and other major crime legislation he did not live in brooklyn until 1998 , when he moved to brooklyn heights he and diana fortuna , his wife , have two daughters , 7 and 3 his relatively recent arrival in brooklyn left him open to charges of carpetbagging but mr yassky had boundless enthusiasm in the coffee shop that november day , he spoke excitedly of the new blood that the termlimits law would bring to the council asked why a man with a golden r sum would want a job that pays 90 , 000 in a body that many regard as a joke , he turned quiet and serious let me speak to you from the bottom of my soul , he said i would love someday to be city budget director ms fortuna , president of the citizens budget commission , a private watchdog group , remembered how she and mr yassky met in 1986 she was working for the city s office of management and budget , and mr yassky was a very fresh , very enthusiastic intern they were attending a meeting on a rentincrease exemption program for the elderly in such a setting how could love not bloom \? and she was wondering whether his earnestness could be real she decided it was

phoenix , april 30 the trial of arthur andersen s secondlargest financial problem its audits of a baptist foundation that collapsed and led to criminal prosecutions began today with a plaintiffs' lawyer maintaining that andersen had ignored warnings that the charity was a ponzi scheme years before the foundation fell apart this is a case about the terrible things that can happen when auditors do not do what we pay them to do , said john p coffey , a partner with bernstein litowitz berger grossmann who is the lead attorney for the arizona baptist foundation bankruptcy liquidation trust andersen , he said , went from being a negligent auditor to being complicit in the fraud the baptist foundation had borrowed money from investors and used it to invest in real estate , promising that its profits would go to pay for baptist charitable projects when the arizona real estate market declined , mr coffey said , the foundation s management found ways to avoid that reality , largely by setting up shell corporations to buy real estate from the foundation at inflated prices , with the foundation lending the money for the purchases when the foundation collapsed in 1999 , it owed 570 million , mostly to elderly investors who had been attracted by high interest rates william crotts , the foundation s former chief executive , has pleaded not guilty to criminal fraud charges and has told lawyers that he will invoke his fifth amendment right to avoid testifying in the civil case andersen s lead lawyer , don martin , told the jury today that andersen was a victim of fraud it was a fraud , he said it misled investors it defrauded its own auditor , arthur andersen he said that by dec 5 , 1996 , every member of the board of the foundation knew of the fraud , as did lawyers and accountants who worked for the foundation they knew about the fraud , and they kept quiet , he said in an opening statement that never mentioned the enron corporation , mr coffey nevertheless managed to invoke echoes of the charges of obstruction of justice that andersen will face in a federal trial that begins next week in houston he told of memorandums reflecting warnings the firm had received as early as 1997 about the baptist foundation s financial statements those memos did not show up in andersen files , but still came to light one memo , found in baptist foundation files , reports that andersen planned in 1998 to check the finances of one of the shell corporations that memo did not show up in andersen files , he said , and the inspection was never done , even after a series of articles in the phoenix newspaper new times , which was based on interviews with disgruntled former employees of the foundation mr coffey said that even though the newspaper identified its sources by name , andersen auditors did not bother to call any of them before reassuring state officials that there was no cause for concern about the foundation s finances mr martin , the andersen lawyer , said all the warnings referred to by mr coffey came after the board already knew of the fraud he said andersen acted properly in considering them and should not be blamed for not uncovering the fraud mr martin pointed out to the jury that the plaintiff in the case was the bankruptcy trustee now overseeing the baptist foundation , not investors who were hurt he suggested that it was unfair that andersen is being sued by the successor to the party that committed the fraud an investor classaction lawsuit has not yet come to trial , but if money is recovered in this suit it will probably go to the creditors of the foundation , including the defrauded investors the small maricopa county superior court courtroom was packed , with a number of elderly people who were victims among the spectators who stood in the aisles judge edward berke warned the spectators not to say things like amen or yes in response to statements by lawyers or witnesses i empathize with you , he said to the spectators , noting that many had lost money , but we are going to have a fair trial here one spectator , betty shoup , 77 , a retired secretary who said she and her husband had lost 250 , 000 , said she had thought her money was safe we knew they were not federally insured , but they always said , 'we are godly insured , ' she said in a brief interview she said the baptist foundation had promised interest rates of up to 15 percent they had easyaccess accounts , just like checking , but with pretty good interest , she said andersen agreed to settle the case nearly two months ago with a payment of 217 million but that deal fell apart after andersen said its insurance company , which is owned by andersen and its foreign affiliates , could not pay the money because andersen had not paid up on its premiums since then andersen s ability to pay has been further undermined by client defections the trial that began today is expected to last more than a month for the plaintiffs , who lost hundreds of millions of dollars they invested with the baptist foundation , there is substantial doubt that they will be able to collect much money even if they do obtain a large verdict we certainly hope so , mr coffey , the plaintiffs' lawyer , said after being asked if andersen would be able to pay i believe andersen will do everything they can to survive if necessary , he said , we will fight in bankruptcy court asked if andersen would be in any position to pay when the trial ended , mr martin , the lead attorney for andersen , responded , that s a good question he said he read the newspapers every day looking for answers andersen s official position is that it is trying to reorganize as a smaller company that will be virtually an auditonly firm , as recommended by a panel headed by paul a volcker , the former federal reserve chairman but none of the conditions mr volcker viewed as necessary for that to happen have occurred , and few in the accounting industry think andersen can survive
london , feb 15 the unseen cellphone began ringing at the worst possible moment , just as rudolph w giuliani started his speech for a moment , the room froze while the guests wondered what the oncecombative former mayor would do maybe they would get to see some authentic new york irascibility maybe , if they were lucky , he would even yell not a chance this was the kindlier , fuzzier , postmayoral rudy giuliani this was the one whose threeday trip to london in which he received an honorary knighthood , sped around town in a multicar entourage like some sort of prizefighter , and tried to drum up support for new york tourism , the twin towers fund , and his new consulting business was nothing less than a mutual lovefest , with the former mayor hearing repeatedly how wonderful he was so , instead of fixing the cellphone culprit with an evileye stare or making a mean remark about qualityoflife crimes , this mr giuliani smiled , chortled amiably and told a long anecdote about the film dr strangelove in one scene , the general played by george c scott is disturbed by the incongruous ringing of a telephone during a tense meeting in which the united states is deciding how to avert an allout nuclear war so , he picks up the phone and says , 'i told you not to call me here yes , i love you , yes , ' mr giuliani said , hamming up the henpecked bit before the audience the crowd , including the mayor of london , ken livingstone , and a gaggle of showbusiness celebrities like andrew lloyd webber and alan rickman , obligingly burst out laughing the former mayor loved it when it turned out that the person with the ringing cellphone which continued to ring because it was hidden so deeply in her very full purse was none other than sunny mindel , his communications director at giuliani partners , he poked fun at her up to a point finally , he said , sunny , would you just put it off \? twice charmed by british manners mr giuliani , who is traveling to germany on saturday to receive an award , was clearly tickled by the sheer englishness of it all he enjoyed meeting the queen , who charmed him by wishing him less stress in the future , and he found prime minister s question time , in which politicians bitterly denounce their opponents while referring to them as honorable gentlemen and the like , invigorating , if slightly puzzling he was particularly taken with the way he was introduced at a banquet given in his honor by the corporation of london as is standard during these occasions , the master of ceremonies , standing under a sword and mace and wearing an almost comically ornate traditional costume , began his introduction by referring to the titles of the people present , from prince andrew on down , in order of precedence instead of asking for quiet , he said pray silence for mr giuliani that part about praying silence i wish i 'd had you around when i was mayor , mr giuliani responded it s a wonderful touch , and i'm going to try it the next time in brooklyn but he said he did not think his new royal insignia , the medal he received with his knighthood and wore all day wednesday , would go over well back home he affected his best brooklyn accent they would say , 'hey , wait a second , knock it off or we 'll knock it off for you' liking 'rudi , ' with no buts sept 11 was never far from anyone s mind mr giuliani spoke repeatedly about watching bodies fall from the world trade center , about scrambling to reestablish city government in the chaos , about feeling the embrace and support of britain in the days and weeks afterward it was the former mayor at his most emotional and his most sincere a particularly wrenching moment took place when he and the former police commissioner , bernard b kerik , went to scotland yard to present the metropolitan police with the badge of joseph vigiano , a detective who was killed in the attack detective vigiano , 34 , was known as a daring police officer who survived three shootings in his career , but still volunteered to work in the dangerous emergency service unit he was probably one of the most heroic cops ever in the history of the nypd , mr kerik said in london , there is no double edge to people s attitudes toward mr giuliani , as there is in new york although a powerful black local legislator , trevor phillips , pointedly stayed away from one of the lunches , most londoners seem not know , or not to care , about the former mayor s presept 11 clashes with minority groups , civil libertarians , the city council and his estranged wife even if many of them cannot spell his name he is inevitably called rudi in the papers here the question is not whether the public likes him , but how much people even seem thrilled to hear him discuss , over and over , the intricacies of his theories about fighting crime in the house of commons , sir patrick cormack , a tory member of parliament , compared mr giuliani favorably to mayor livingstone if mr livingstone wants to know how to run a great city properly , he should have discussions with him , he said at a fundraising auction , sir richard branson , the celebrity businessman , could barely contain himself his is a message about how the human spirit triumphed , he said and outside buckingham palace , during the former mayor s investiture as knight , dirk van der straeten , a belgian citizen who does not speak a great deal of english , perked up when he heard the word giuliani he was like a human being , 100 percent there when the accident happened , mr van der straeten said , referring to sept 11 it s a pity that he s not the mayor anymore photos rudolph w giuliani had a new role thursday tourist as mayor ken livingstone of london took him to the roof of the new city hall \( pool photo \) \( pg b3 \) rudolph w giuliani and judith nathan \( agence francepresse \) \( pg b1 \)

to the editor as a coscreenwriter of the film harrison s flowers , and author of the autobiography le diable a l'avantage from which the movie was adapted , i would like to respond to issues raised by stephen kinzer in his article a story the movies ca n't get right march 3 mr kinzer seems to find it absurd that the photographers in the movie work standing up rather than lying down we lie down for protection and stand up to work from the best angle possible also , a photographer in a combat zone is always on the move , carrying 20 pounds of gear it s wiser to work standing up rather than having to lie down and get up a hundred times that s one practical aspect of the job that you learn in the field mr kinzer writes , the journalists do n't even know enough serbocroatian to yell 'novinar ! ' at the soldiers around them , presuming instead that 'press ! ' will do the trick none of us ever used the word novinar in the croatian mountains the serbs and croatians would tell one another apart by their accents before shooting , and it would have been extremely unwise for us to risk appearing to be from one side or another i have observed in almost 20 wartorn countries that everyone understands the word press finally , concerning the wearing of camouflage by andie macdowell s character , i agree that we normally refuse any kind of uniform to avoid confusion even so , i had to don camouflage in croatia to enter vukovar the commander who let us through the final checkpoint gave the order the croatian snipers had to be able to tell who we were mr kinzer refers to other films , claiming that certain scenes in harrison s flowers echo them but all wars are alike inevitably , films dealing with the same subject have points in common and , personally , i am rather flattered by such references isabel ellsen boulogne , france
ahmedabad , india here in the adopted hometown of mohandas k gandhi , the great apostle of nonviolence , hindu mobs committed acts of unspeakable savagery against muslims this spring mothers were skewered on swords as their children watched young women were stripped and raped in broad daylight , then doused with kerosene and set on fire a pregnant woman s belly was slit open , her fetus raised skyward on the tip of a sword and then tossed onto one of the fires that blazed across the city the violence raged for days and persisted for more than two months , claiming almost 1 , 000 lives it was driven by hatred and sparked by a terrible crime a muslim mob stoned a train car loaded with activists from the world hindu council on feb 27 , then set it on fire , killing 59 people , mostly women and children the carnage that followed here in the western state of gujarat has become a festering political sore because of widespread allegations that the bharatiya janata party , the hindu nationalist party that leads india and gujarat , and the world hindu council were complicit in the attacks on muslims the party and the council both part of the same hindu nationalist family deny the charges but official statistics provided in june by the police department , now under new administration , show that the state of gujarat the only major one in india governed solely by the bharatiya janata party failed to take elementary steps to halt the horrific momentum of violence the day after the train attack , police officers here in ahmedabad did not arrest a single person from among the tens of thousands who rampaged through muslim enclaves , raping and looting as well as burning alive 124 muslims police officials and survivors said in interviews that workers and officials of the party and the council were complicit in the attacks and , in some cases , instigated the mobs this was not a riot , one senior police official said angrily it was a statesponsored pogrom party officials who lead the national government , while publicly condemning the attacks , dispatched soldiers to restore order but resisted opposition calls for a forceful assertion of the central government s authority to halt the violence fathoming what happened here in the first major outbreak of hindumuslim violence in almost a decade is critical for india the specter of such violence has shadowed the country since its birth india , a secular democracy , and pakistan , an islamic nation , were hacked apart when they won independence from britain in 1947 the furies of religious hatred were unleashed , and about a million people died the use of religion for political gain is an enduring theme in both india and pakistan and a wellspring of violence that vexes the subcontinent even today senior national leaders of the bharatiya janata party , including prime minister atal bihari vajpayee , have maintained that india s tolerant hindu ethos has helped guarantee religious freedom for india s billionstrong population , which includes 820 million hindus and 130 million muslims until the violence in gujarat , the party , which has led the national government since 1998 , had proudly pointed to the absence of hindumuslim violence during its years in power as evidence of its secular credentials but many influential indians are once again questioning whether the party can be trusted to ensure that hindus and muslims live together in peace and to resist the temptation of exploiting religious divisions to reap hindu votes gujarat , a state of 51 million people , has over the past decade become the country s laboratory for hindu nationalism that ideology has long depicted muslim and christian indians as converts to foreign religions who must accept the primacy of hindu culture gandhi s assassin was an extreme adherent of this view in the recent carnage in gujarat , most of those killed were muslims among the survivors , 100 , 000 became refugees in their own country more than 20 , 000 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed , along with 360 muslim places of worship the events have inspired an anguished outpouring from many indian intellectuals gujarat disowned mohandas karamchand gandhi long ago , ashis nandy , one of india s leading social thinkers wrote in seminar , a monthly magazine that addresses domestic and international problems in india the state s political soul has been won over by his killers in an interview in june , the state s chief minister , narendra modi , offered no consolation to the state s muslims and expressed satisfaction with his government s performance his only regret , he said , was that he did not handle the news media better we have 18 , 600 villages , he said in his office , where a photograph of gandhi hung on the wall ninetyeight percent of gujarat was peaceful is it not a credit for the administration , the government \? mr modi was a longtime party organizer and pracharak , or preacher , from the source of the hindu nationalist movement , the association of national volunteers he was handpicked less than a year ago by the bharatiya janata party s high command to turn around its fading fortunes in the state mr modi dissolved the state assembly on july 19 to bring on elections in the usual practice , he resigned and was named caretaker chief minister while he led the party s political campaign
in a way , it s a shame that so much of david brock s blinded by the right the conscience of an exconservative is about the private lives of our selfappointed moral guardians those tales will sell books , but they may obscure the important message that the vast rightwing conspiracy is not an overheated metaphor but a straightforward reality , and that it works a lot like a specialinterest lobby modern political economy teaches us that small , wellorganized groups often prevail over the broader public interest the steel industry got the tariff it wanted , even though the losses to consumers will greatly exceed the gains of producers , because the typical steel consumer does n't understand what s happening blinded by the right shows that the same logic applies to noneconomic issues the scandal machine that employed mr brock was , in effect , a specialinterest group financed by a handful of wealthy fanatics men like the rev sun myung moon , whose cultlike unification church owns the washington times , and richard mellon scaife , who bankrolled the scandalmongering american spectator and many other rightwing enterprises it was effective because the typical news consumer did n't realize what was going on the group s efforts managed to turn whitewater a 200 , 000 moneylosing investment into a byword for scandal , even though an eightyear , 73 million investigation never did find any evidence of wrongdoing by the clintons just imagine what the scandal machine could have done with more promising raw material such as the decidedly unusual business transactions of the young george w bush but there is , of course , no comparable scandal machine on the left why not \? one answer is that for some reason there is a level of anger and hatred on the right that has at best a faint echo in the antiglobalization left , and none at all in mainstream liberalism indeed , the liberals i know generally seem unwilling to face up to the nastiness of contemporary politics it s also true that in the nature of things , billionaires are more likely to be rightwing than leftwing fanatics when billionaires do support more or less liberal causes , they usually try to help the world , not take over the us political system not to put too fine a point on it while george soros was spending lavishly to promote democracy abroad , mr scaife was spending lavishly to undermine it at home and his achievement is impressive key figures from the scaife empire are now senior officials in the bush administration \( and mr moon s newspaper is now in effect the administration s house organ \) clearly , scandalmongering works the public and , less excusably , the legitimate media all too readily assume that where there s smoke there must be fire when in reality it s just some angry rich guys who have bought themselves a smoke machine and the media are still amazingly easy to sucker just look at the way the press fell for the fraudulent tale of vandalism by departing clinton staffers , or the more recent spread of the bogus story that ken lay stayed at the clinton white house regular readers of this column know that not long ago i found myself the target of a minorleague smear campaign the pattern was typical rightwing sources insisting that a normal business transaction \( in my case consulting for enron , back when i was a college professor , not an oped columnist , and in no position to do the company any favors \) was somehow corrupt then legitimate media picking up on the story , assuming that given all the fuss there must be something to the allegations and no doubt a lingering impression , even though no favors were given or received , that the target must have done something wrong \( is n't it hypocritical for him to criticize crony capitalism when he himself was on the take \? \) now that i 've read mr brock s book i understand what happened slate s tim noah , whom i normally agree with , says that mr brock tells us nothing new we know that an appallingly wellfinanced hard right was obsessed with smearing clinton but who are we \? most people do n't know that and anyway , he should n't speak in the past tense an appallingly wellfinanced hard right is still in the business of smearing anyone who disagrees with its agenda , and too many journalists still allow themselves to be used i found blinded by the right distasteful , but revelatory so , i suspect , will many others
for decades , the main weapons for preventing pregnancy have been condoms , birth control pills and sterilization sure , other methods are available , and there have been innovations from time to time , but none have quite caught on to the same extent that may soon change two contraceptives will be introduced this summer that will significantly enhance women s options and if the new methods are as popular as many family planners say they will be , they might even make a dent in the 49 percent rate of unplanned pregnancy in the united states but there are problems already the new contraceptives a skin patch that is replaced weekly and a vaginal ring that is used for three weeks at a time , each releasing contraceptive hormones may not be readily available to poor women public clinics , like those operated by health departments and planned parenthood , may not be able to afford these new methods for the 65 million women , mostly poor and young , that they serve the national family planning and reproductive health association , which represents many of the 7 , 000 public clinics , says that so far the best rate it can get from orthomcneil pharmaceutical , the johnson johnson unit that makes the ortho evra patch , is about 15 for a monthly supply while that is far less than the retail price of 30 to 40 a month , it is still substantially higher than what public clinics pay for oral contraceptives \( negotiations on the vaginal ring , called the nuvaring and made by organon , have n't begun the retail price , however , is also expected to be 30 to 40 \) with so many kinds of birth control pills on the market , competition has helped to keep a lid on their prices , and manufacturers have given deep discounts to clinics a onemonth supply of pills , which normally goes for 30 elsewhere , may cost a clinic just 150 of course , there is no such price competition for the patch or the ring but family planning organizations do n't begrudge the drug companies their rates orthomcneil has just spent hundreds of millions developing the patch , said judith desarno , chief executive of the national family planning and reproductive health association they 're doing their best to figure out how to give us a bigger discount ms desarno says public clinics have felt especially squeezed lately they 're seeing more patients who are uninsured or not enrolled in medicaid , while spending more on screening and treating diseases at the same time , she said , financing for title x , the only federal program dedicated to family planning , has been flat in fact , when adjusted for inflation , it declined 57 percent from 1979 to 2001 it was n't always this way contraception for all may not be the phrase most associated with the presidency of richard m nixon , but in 1969 he asserted that no american woman should be denied access to family planning assistance because of her economic condition he called for more money for flexible familyplanning programs , and title x followed a year later title x is still the backbone of the system , though it does n't appear to be a priority for president bush for the fiscal year that begins this october , the president has proposed 265 million for the program , about the same as this year education programs on teenage abstinence , however , would get a 33 million increase , to 135 million in the long run , though , the president s title x budget may cost the government more than it saves according to the alan guttmacher institute , a nonprofit group that focuses on reproductive health research , for every public dollar spent on family planning services , 3 is saved in medicaid spending on pregnancy and care for newborns researchers say ortho evra and the organon nuvaring are nearly 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancies , a rate similar to that for birth control pills but they may be more effective than oral contraceptives in one crucial way women do n't have to remember to take a pill every day , and forgetfulness is one reason that 75 percent of women who are on the pill become pregnant during their first year dorothy mann , executive director of the family planning council , which oversees 85 publicly financed clinics in the philadelphia area , sees the patch and ring as good birthcontrol options , but she worries that she wo n't be able to afford them for her clinics eightyfour percent of the clinics' 120 , 000 clients receive contraceptive services this year , her budget for contraception is 132 million , or a little more than a dollar a month for each patient , before insurance and medicaid reimbursements if , as expected , the patch or the ring end up costing more than what she essentially allocates for each patient , she may have to severely ration the devices you have to make horrible choices , she said it has always been our practice to provide all birth control methods to all women , regardless of income but i do n't think i can do that anymore drawing \( gayle hegland \)
gerard guarniero spent eighth grade using a braille slate an eightinch metal device that looks like a ruler with four rows of stencil spaces for lettering he would place paper between the two sides and use a short pointer to punch holes in the paper it would take him three or four times as long to write the same paper as his sighted classmates some 30 years later , when pratik patel was in eighth grade at intermediate school 237 , a mainstream school in queens , he could simply type his essays on a keyboard he sent his work to a braille printer , where a sheet with raised lettering would come out in minutes mr guarniero , 52 , and mr patel , 22 , were among dozens of students who gathered at a recent retirement party in queens honoring their middle school teacher , betty salz , whose work with blind students in new york city spans more than four decades there , they traded fond memories of mrs salz s classes and marveled about the way computers are changing the lives of the sightless and visually impaired just as computers and other personal technology gadgets have revolutionized learning for sighted students , personal data assistants , word processing and the internet have rapidly altered the ways blind students do schoolwork mrs salz , who retired after teaching blind students for 33 years , remembers staying up for hours translating assignments she used for other classes into braille and then taking the students' braillewritten papers and typing them the tedious process would take hours , even though mrs salz was an expert braillist it s a different world now i just scan the books , translate them and print them out in a few hours , said mrs salz , who is not blind but the rapidly developing methods , called assistive technology , have not come without some groans from teachers just a few years ago , the new equipment was gathering dust in a room , said rose chin , the technology trainer for educational vision services in district 75 , which oversees programs for about 1 , 100 blind and visually impaired students nobody knew what to do with anything , ms chin said they were mystified by it they were still in a fog several of the teachers ms chin worked with refused to go anywhere near the computers in the early 1990 s , preferring to stick to typewriters and braille typing all their reluctance gave her time to understand what the machines were capable of now , the same teachers cannot imagine going back to technology as it once was barriers have been nearly eliminated in subjects that rely on essays and stories , like history and english in biology , geometry and other classes that use graphics , learning can be far more complicated students in math and science classes use raised line drawings to read the graphics and special paper and pens to create the diagrams themselves perhaps the most important improvement has come in the most basic , and often most dreaded , part of school the taking of notes braille is based on a sixpoint system , where every letter , number and punctuation mark is assigned a combination of each of the six points until the last decade , students would use a stylus to punch holes into the braille slate , making it impossible for them to keep up with students who used pen and paper robert feinstein , 52 , would often hear other students complain about the taptaptap sounds that he made as he punched holes into his thick paper mr feinstein says it sounded much like a woodpecker now , the sounds of mr patel taking notes at queens college are no louder than those of a computer keyboard most blind students now use a machine called braille lite , a personal data assistant that works like a palm pilot , with a memo pad for notes , appointment calendar and address book the six keys on the machine allow students to type in braille and a display shows each line in braille in the 1970 s , none of mrs salz s students could have imagined such a machine now , nearly all her blind students own one none of these advancements can be overemphasized , said jay d leventhal , a technology associate with the american foundation of the blind and the editor of accessworld magazine , which critiques new machines mr leventhal uses his braille lite to store up to three books , which he can then read anywhere he takes the fivepound machine technology is one of the driving forces behind advancement of independence for the blind , he said even teachers may not realize what the technology can do , so they are not utilized properly yet ms chin bristled when another teacher who was attending mrs salz s party said that she was unable to use the braille printer for spanish assignments you probably just were n't doing it right you just have to set it properly , ms chin explained i 'll come and show you that s precisely the approach mr patel wants to see just eight years after mrs salz s eighthgrade instruction , mr patel now runs a technology program for the blind at the city university of new york though he is pleased with the advancements , problems remain with new developments like internetbased distance learning there are still so many things that are changing the ways we learn , mr patel said it might be an entirely different world in just a few years

like so many college football and basketball players , i'm coming to the end of my year at school with no degree in sight i have n't even declared a major i'm having trouble with my course work , my professors , my fellow students i may have to take an incomplete i ca n't get a grip on the connection between college and sports if i'm not drafted by the pros , i'm in trouble the national collegiate athletic association \( just those five words make me feel like i 've pulled an allnighter \) has a new president , myles brand , who is famous beyond academia because he fired coach bob knight brand is one of the indiana university presidents who enabled knight for many years yet as the first ncaa president who is not a coach or athletic director , brand is expected to lead that organization into an era of righteous reform my required readings indicate that the opposite could just as easily happen just as only president nixon could go to china , captain kirk make peace with the klingons and chief justice earl warren help create a progressive supreme court , so can only the former philosophy professor brand take the top college teams into the stratosphere of professional sports entertainment no wonder i'm in danger of flunking out not to mention all these espn thursday night football games who has the time to study \? i might be getting out just in time will fox take over tuesday nights \? maybe it s a done deal knowing that the pressure for superstars will only increase at the top several dozen sports schools , the ncaa s premier division i has just changed some of the rules that discriminated against athletes who should n't be in college classrooms in the first place under the new rules , athletes with low standardized test scores but good high school grades will be allowed to compete in college so long as they appear to be making progress toward a degree although college football , in general , is considered affirmative action for beefy white guys , the stars of the game tend to be disproportionately africanamerican standardized testing has long been under attack as unfair to members of minority groups , particularly those from substandard rural and inner city high schools so if this is true , why would getting good grades in such schools be a better indicator of college success than a standardized test \? beats me all of this is controversial , and there has been research bolstering all opinions coaches of all colors wave the race card , but then most coaches will support anything to give them access to prime players even if only for a season or two before they flunk out the rule about athletes' needing to be on track for graduation \( which would include declaring a major and passing a certain number of courses \) seems to be a way of derailing an interesting suggestion by the estimable knight commission that universities who do not graduate half their athletes will be ineligible for postseason play football bowl games and basketball tournaments are often the profit margins for the big schools not that it s so hard to keep a star on track for graduation if the administration is on the same page as the athletic department in the scandal du jour , the president of gardnerwebb university , a baptist school in boiling springs , nc , personally erased an f awarded to the school s basketball star for cheating on a religion exam he did this three years ago , just in time for the star to lead the school to a christian conference championship and put it in position to rise this year to the ncaa s prestigious division i gardnerwebb enjoyed less than two months in division i before all was disclosed and the president and others resigned or were fired students , reeling , said they could see this happening at alabama or tennessee , but how could it happen here \? what did happen , beyond a president s common decision to get his school on the happy news network , was the uncommon courage of gardnerwebb professors to stand up to the jocks in offering gardnerwebb faculty members the support of the reformist drake group , the embattled university of tennessee professor linda benselmeyers wrote unlike the faculty of your institution , ours were too afraid for their own jobs to speak out , and the academic administration ultimately capitulated to the athletic department by claiming that none of our academic policies were enforceable , the only argument that would enable the institution to avoid ncaa sanctions and the loss of endorsements ah , endorsements , another complication caught in an arms race for celebrity coaches , bluechip athletes and the money to finance stadium skyboxes , universities are accepting soda , fastfood and sneaker deals , whether or not they are in the best interests of their athletes after you find out what conference a school is in \( the top six run the ncaa \) , you need to know whether it is a nike or adidas licensee and whether it pours coke or pepsi according to a reluctant gadfly , marc isenberg , universities are also slipping into relationships with online gambling operations and with the manufacturers of nutritional supplements that the ncaa has banned for use by athletes a writer and lecturer on college sports , isenberg has been urging the ncaa and individual college programs to divest themselves of connections to metrx , which he says is the manufacturer of products containing creatine , ephedra and taurine , and former manufacturer of 'hurricane andro , ' which contained androstenedione \( andro \) , sponsors several ncaa division i athletic programs \( including university of miami , oregon state university , university of southern california , university of utah \) and the 'metrx college football preview' show on abc television isenberg has been in fruitless correspondence with the outgoing ncaa president , cedric dempsey , and with donna shalala , president of the university of miami soon he will start writing to brand i 've asked him to hurry up before my year at school ends i could get a term paper out of that exchange the series so far articles in this series about the role of college sports in american culture have explored race and athletics , paying the players , gambling on campus , football and title ix , and a whistleblower s defiance robert lipsyte s email address is thelipsite aolcom photo jennie jones , a student at gardnerwebb university , protesting the school s recent athletics scandal \( associated press \)
bitale , congo when a peace accord in the conflict called africa s first world war brought the withdrawal of most of the foreign armies involved , it seemed that the violence that has killed an estimated 25 million people since 1998 might end but congo s carnage has continued , courtesy of tribal groups and the traditional warriors known as mai mai , fierce fighters whose origins date from around the time the country broke free of belgian rule in 1960 the disparate and elusive mai mai have marched across hundreds of miles of eastern congo into the power vacuum left by the foreign withdrawals , waging a guerrilla campaign that the united nations says has driven close to a million people from their homes bringing relief to the starving and the displaced and ending the fighting will almost certainly involve making contact with the mai mai in congo s vast jungles a weeklong visit there revealed much suffering war wounded scarred by bullets , teenage rape victims , and mothers and fathers who had lost track of spouses and family in the chaos of the conflict if you do n't include the mai mai in the eventual peace agreement , they 'll stay in the forest and you really wo n't have peace , said hans romkema of the life and peace institute , a swiss group that has been working to establish dialogue with the fighters it s been a taboo to work in mai mai territory or talk to these guys , mr romkema said i want to break that taboo not everybody believes it is possible to engage the mai mai , who seem to have many leaders , varying ideologies and a history of ruthlessness they were left out of the multinational accord of 1999 that laid the groundwork for a ceasefire in congo that has yet to be realized you have new factions of mai mai coming up every day , said claude jibida , who recently finished a tour as the united nations humanitarian coordinator in eastern congo the mai mai are an actor in this war i 've met some of them at roadblocks but i do n't know if it s possible to include a group that is this amorphous at the negotiating table recently mr romkema trekked into the bush on a peace mission approved by some top mai mai leaders and took a journalist along for a rare direct glimpse of the group the visit found a weary band of fighters , some just boys , with powerful weaponry they tried hard to give the appearance of a disciplined force , saluting their commanders with crisp efficiency , even if some wore flipflops and tattered tshirts it was impossible to tally the number of fighters in this particular mai mai group , since most stayed hidden in the growth estimates for the total number of mai mai in the east range from 10 , 000 to several times that they know their surroundings well , although sometimes they seem to lose track of just what they are fighting for or even whom they are fighting the congolese government has armed the mai mai to make life more difficult for the various rebel groups , but other mai mai have trained their guns on government troops their battle is waged with a heavy dose of superstition , which holds great sway in the country deep in the forest here , an intense man in a snakeskin hat set aside his automatic weapon and began dousing his visitors with water he sprayed it on their faces and drenched their shirts he wet down their vehicles , chanting , mai , mai , mai , mai , mai , mai ! this name comes from the lingala word for water , and to that water the warriors ascribe the magical power of preventing enemy bullets from piercing the skin you 're safe now , the mai mai commander said after the dousing you ca n't die now in october a group of mai mai , backed by other fighters , took control of the strategic lakefront town of uvira before being repelled by rwandan soldiers some advancing mai mai wore lucky charms and carried rosary beads with their guns the mai mai also made headway toward bukavu , the regional capital , prompting united nations agencies there to dust off evacuation plans the world food program has warned of a disaster developing in the area from uvira north to bunia , where the lack of security has blocked the delivery of food the situation in the east is worse now than ever , said robert dekker , the eastern congo director for the united nations food agency mindful of the many claims on the agency s resources and the remoteness of eastern congo , he added , but it probably has to get even worse before it gets better the mai mai say they equip themselves with the uniforms and arms of the enemy soldiers they kill , whoever they might be a more important way they keep themselves afloat , according to the united nations , is by controlling valuable mines where diamonds , gold and coltan , a mineral used in electronic components , are extracted last year the mai mai took 25 foreigners hostage , mostly thais working at a logging concession in northeastern congo they later released the hostages the mai mai say they acted out of anger at the looting of congolese resources by foreigners
washington , oct 8 when an unknown killer began mailing anthrax to east coast targets last october , the government s slow and disjointed response set off recriminations from the white house and fingerpointing among investigators this week , in contrast , the local and federal authorities chasing a deadly sniper in the washington area presented a united front that is a reflection , they say , of the hard lessons about the need for coordination and communication in a time of crisis learned from the sept 11 attacks with the montgomery county police taking the lead in the probe , dozens of federal agents have given their support , providing forensic analysis , psychological and geographic profiles , computer data runs and helicopters local schools , using emergency plans that were refined after sept 11 , have moved swiftly to impose code blue lockdowns intended to protect students better and the white house s office of homeland security says it is monitoring the shootings the genesis of all this was sept 11 , a bush administration official said the terrorist attacks spawned a new era of coordination and communication , and we 're seeing the fruits of that now historically , many federal law enforcement agencies particularly the federal bureau of investigation fought turf battles over highprofile or sensitive cases , refusing to share information and sparring for control some in congress have blamed such turf battles for the intelligence community s failure to connect signals warning of the sept 11 attacks , as well as for the deaths of two postal workers killed in last year s anthrax attacks amid conflicting information about the potency of the virus but a new spirit of cooperation appears to have taken hold in the washington sniper investigation , as local officials have gone out of their way to praise federal officials for their assistance and have tested new measures put in place since sept 11 attorney general john ashcroft called the montgomery county police chief , charles a moose , today to let him know that he would bring to bear the full resources of federal law enforcement agencies , mr ashcroft s aides said anything you need , pick up the phone and call me , a spokeswoman , barbara comstock , quoted mr ashcroft as telling the police chief at chief moose s request , mr ashcroft also agreed today to invoke a provision in the criminal code that establishes federal jurisdiction in serial killer cases while the move essentially formalizes what had already been an informal partnership between federal and local authorities since the shootings began last week , it also expands the tools available to investigators a federal prosecutor was assigned to the case this week , and federal officials will now be able to issue subpoenas and take grand jury testimony if needed and while federal agents had provided largely support services early on in the investigation , such as forensics testing , an fbi official said agents would now be available to knock on doors and chase tips in the casethe montgomery county police said today that they had received more than 6 , 000 calls with tips on the case , including 1 , 250 that appeared credible we 're bringing all that we can to the table , a senior fbi official said , but this is a tough case until we get more evidence to work with indeed , for all the talk of the expanded cooperation in the case , the newfound harmony may not help the police find the sniper so far , the authorities acknowledge that they have very little to go on but law enforcement officials have been careful not to classify the shootings as a terrorist attack while the stillunsolved anthrax attacks last october were treated from the outset as a terrorism case , the fbi is investigating the shootings as a violentcrimes case the agency s baltimorebased field office is leading the bureau s part of the investigation the bureau s richmond and washington field offices are also involved because of shootings in their regions the shootings do not fit the typical profile of a terrorist attack , with mass casualties and a group claiming credit for the violence , law enforcement officials noted officials said it would likely take new developments such as coordinated attacks in other cities or intelligence linking the shootings to a foreign agent to set off a terrorism investigation the strong leanings at this point are that this looks like a serial sniper , said a justice department official who asked not to be identified , but these days , no one is going to rule anything out you ca n't go by the book anymore even though the shootings are not being investigated as a terrorist attack , the way in which they are being handled mirrors the structure set up after sept 11 , with emergency command posts , multijurisdictional involvement , expedited communication systems and other measures set up to better coordinate the crisis response , officials said the lessons of the sept 11 attacks led to better cooperation among all agencies , said tom hill , a spokesman for the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms , which has about 100 employees , including forensic examiners , lab workers and k9 units , on the case a lot of agencies have gone through drills , assimilations , that have helped prepare us for this , he addedyou 're seeing an end result of people working together very quickly that model was put to the test successfully in may , when a series of pipe bombs were planted in rural mailboxes across five states from illinois to colorado , sparking fears of a new wave of terrorist attacks after a nationwide manhunt coordinated between federal and state agencies , state police in nevada charged a minnesota college student in the bombings douglas duncan , the montgomery county executive , said the cooperation among different law enforcement agencies in the region involved in the washington sniper case was better than he had ever seen before that was not because of any procedural changes put into place after sept 11 , but rather a profound change in attitude among the law enforcement personnel , he added in the past you always heard about turf battles between agencies , he said this time there was none of that back and forth , and i attribute this to sept 11 it s from that , i think , that there is this shared sense of responsibility among law enforcement officers , a sense of a greater obligation than before to help each other out the montgomery county public schools made significant changes to their emergencyresponse system after sept 11 , and a spokesman for the school district said the changes allowed the district to respond quickly after the first shootings last week on thursday morning , all of the 191 schools in the county school system received an automated telephone alert , along with an urgent email message , detailing the circumstances of the emergency and the response within minutes , the schools were ushering kids indoors , and the blinds were being drawn , said brian j porter , school system spokesman almost simultaneously , he said , the school system issued a similar email alert to 45 news organizations in the region , advising them that the code blue alert had been imposed so that parents could be informed by midafternoon police officers and police cruisers were deployed throughout the county and at individual schools so when we dismissed school that day , there was a very visible police presence , mr porter said photos viewed through trees , a police officer stood guard in maryland \( david

within five months after terrorists struck the world trade center , insurance companies paid more than 16 billion in claims for damage from the attack , providing a sharp boost to new york s struggling economy but the flow has slowed so far this year , the insurance companies have paid 3 billion in claims the payments have slowed , industry experts said , because insurance companies and their customers have taken care of the easiest claims , and now they are dealing with the most complicated ones , some of which may take years to resolve by the latest industry estimates , insurers expect to pay about 40 billion for the attacks on sept 11 in new york and washington this suggests that about 20 billion remains to be paid , though not all of it will come to new york , because many people with claims like the families of passengers on the planes used in the attacks are scattered around the country but whatever the final amount , new yorkers struggling with a battered economy and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the wake of the attack have already received much more money from insurers than from the state and federal governments and all other sources and the impact has been profound without the insurance money , said mark zandi , the chief economist at economy com , a research company , the city s economy would probably still be under water most of the insurance money has been paid fairly smoothly , according to the the new york state department of insurance , which regulates the insurance industry more than 33 , 000 claims often several related to the same business have been paid or partly paid , the department said , and 300 complaints about payments have been received gregory v serio , the state superintendent of insurance , said the insurers have generally acted responsibly but , he said , that does n't mean there have n't been some complications or controversy the amount of trade center losses is still defying some degree of mathematical precision , mr serio said even though estimates of the insured losses have generally been lowered to 40 billion from as high as 70 billion initially he said the losses might ultimately run to 50 billion the number is hard to nail down , said robert p hartwig , the chief economist for the insurance information institute , a trade group in manhattan that is so , he said , because businessinterruption insurance is calculated on lost income , and there is a certain amount of estimating or subjectivity involved also , liability claims for deaths and injuries depend on proof of negligence , which may take years to resolve the customer with the biggest claim of all is larry a silverstein , the holder of the lease on the twin towers he is fighting in court with his insurers over his contention that the events of sept 11 constituted two occurrences , instead of one , and that he is thus owed about 7 billion in insurance money for two events at the world trade center , rather than about 35 billion for one event for some , payment was swift that was so for wet electrics , a startup software company whose offices at 30 west broadway were crushed by falling debris kevin p cunningham , the founder and chief executive of wet electrics , said that without the 150 , 000 he received from his insurer , the hartford , in late december , wet electrics' debut would have been delayed for months there are other happy customers , too tradeweb , an internet company that had been on the 51st floor of the north tower , lost everything but its people within six months it received more than 5 million for property damage and lost income from its insurer , the hartford their people were not only skilled at what they do , but very eager to cooperate , said brian g hunt , a vice president of tradeweb , which enables bond trading on the internet the process has not gone so well for everyone peter semetis , the owner of sale pepe fine foods and catering , a deli at trinity place and exchange alley , got exactly what he asked of his insurer , the utica national insurance group 160 , 000 , also for property damage and lost income but he said it took repeated phone calls from him and his lawyer before he got his final check for 110 , 000 in august michael austin , a spokesman for utica national , said he regretted mr semetis s disappointment but he said utica national handled hundreds of claims and we feel we dealt with most all of them quickly and fairly julie menin , an owner of vine , a restaurant at 25 broad street , estimated that she lost 600 , 000 in sales in 2001 she said her insurer initially offered to pay for seven days of lost business , less than onetenth of what she considered her actual losses ms menin , who founded an organization called wall street rising to help rebuild downtown , said that after the dispute was mentioned in an article in the new york times last fall , the state insurance department phoned her they were incredibly helpful , she said early this year , she said , she reached a confidential settlement with the insurer
it s a game like the one yesterday at yankee stadium in fact , it s a series like the one just concluded between the yankees and the boston red sox that could be destructive to baseball literally just let the owners and players dare , just dare , to come to such an impasse in their labor negotiations that a strike is called in the next month or so , then moats and armed guards would be necessary to try to protect the ballparks from irate fans seeking vengeance , brick by brick it s the best threegame series in professional baseball i 've ever seen , said one of those in the park yesterday , one who happened to be smack in the middle of things this was jeff weaver , and he had an intriguing view of proceedings because he was on the mound for the yankees for the first seven innings a relative newcomer to the yankees he came in a trade on july 5 and a total tyro to the pyrotechnics of the intense yankeered sox rivalry , weaver added that the three games were obviously exciting for the fans because they stayed to the end this threegame series , this game today , said bernie williams , the yankees' patrician outfielder , had all the atmosphere of a world series for those who are still hiding under their beds waiting for the world cup to end , they can crawl out now baseball is back in the headlines , in new york and boston , for two places , and better than ever take yesterday a perfect day for anything , especially baseball a balmy 78 degrees at game time the sun kissing the ebullient crowd of 55 , 581 and the game itself , in which the top two teams in the american league east were battling for hegemony while some fans were still coming off the el or stopping to purchase popcorn under the stands , the yankees scored four runs with their first four batters the game seesawed , with the red sox getting five runs in the fourth it came down to the bottom of the ninth , with none out and the score tied , 88 , the bases were loaded and well , the joint was a madhouse i wo n't keep you in the suspense that had the park in a quiver jorge posada fouled off five balls in running the count to 32 against boston closer ugueth urbina then posada , patient as a spider greeting a fly to his web , took ball four game over it was weird , williams said after all the offense , it came down to that walk this followed the 11inning game saturday in which the yankees also won by 98 after coming back from a deficit , before another nearsellout crowd of 55 , 526 and the night before that , the tension was similar some 55 , 510 waited out a 2hour17minute rain delay before the game began matching two of the best pitchers in baseball pedro mart nez , the leanasalamppost red sox ace , and mike mussina , the stanford graduate with brains even in his right arm the red sox , who entered the series down by three games to the yankees in the division , won that first game , 42 the yankees' lead is now four games but the beauty of the rivalry is that each side knows it can turn with the crack of a bat after saturday s comefrombehind victory , rondell white , a yankee outfielder , said we have a great offensive team we always feel we can score runs whenever we want to the way the red sox remain undaunted in the face of yankee run splurges , and come back to score themselves , it s hardly inconceivable that they are of a like mind after all , they hammered five home runs yesterday off weaver , a record for a yankee pitcher at yankee stadium but in the ninth , they could n't overcome a checkedswing single by jason giambi , followed by a single by williams that right fielder trot nixon played as though he were trying to catch a mouse with his glove it allowed the tying run to score and williams to reach third two intentional walks preceded that walk to posada , and it was curtains for the red sox but , perhaps , only temporarily it s going to be this way to the end between these two teams , joe torre , the yankees' muse , said he added this was a lot of entertainment it lived up to all the expectations the fans will come out and watch it again these teams are scheduled to play two games in late august at fenway park and three more here in early september but if the owners insist on trying to make the players pay for the owners' incompetence and greed and chicanery , and there is another blackout of games this season , the natives will surely be very restless man the moats stuff like what transpired in the bronx over the weekend is simply too good to stamp out
the most shocking thing about american politics is how shocked we are every time the obvious happens you 'd think it would be a nobrainer to call an election in which a popular , barnstorming president is pitted against a leaderless political party whose only coherent message is that the other guys aim to toss the elderly into the street but almost everyone got it wrong , including the network stars who giddily imagined that deadlock 2000 would repeat itself and louisiana would become the new florida , thus allowing them to ruin our thanksgivings by bloviating from new orleans for a solid month history has a way of moving on , even as pundits and politicians alike keep fighting the last war the democrats are farcically or , if you choose , tragically even more mired in the past than the press is terry mcauliffe has been fond of saying that defeating jeb bush was his top priority this year the notion that avenging 2000 could be more important than , say , holding onto the senate into 2004 is so nonsensical that only a party chairman cryogenically entombed in the clintongore fin de si cle could say it with a straight face this obsession with a lost battle was doomed in any case , and tuesday brought final proof of the complete failure of the 'florida anger' strategy as a motivating force for democrats , in the words of byron york of national review not only did jeb bush win easily but democratic turnout in the party s south florida stronghold was down 17 percent from the 1994 bushlawton chiles race , despite campaign appearances for bill mcbride by al gore , 2000 anger incarnate the fault this time was not in the chads i'm not sure what we did wrong , mr mcauliffe declared on wednesday , no less clueless in defeat than in anticipating victory denial , the first of elisabeth k blerross s five stages of death and dying , is his party s order of the day \( no 2 , anger , is rapidly yapping at its heels \) tom daschle s position is that president bush drowned out the democrats by talking about iraq and north korea we felt we did have the economic plan , he told paula zahn on cnn we just were n't successful in getting you to cover it nearly every democratic leader is offering a variation on dick gephardt s excuse that 9 11 shrouded the election , to the white house s advantage but if conservatives are rarely more irritating than when they wrap themselves in the flag , liberals are surely at their most annoying when donning the veil of victimhood the democrats were not done in by osama bin laden or the media or anyone other than themselves their intellectual vacuity in this year s campaign was apparent well before 9 11 it was in may 2001 that the house democrats issued a cautious energy plan whose cover depicted an allamerican family happily washing its suv it promised that the party would never advocate environmental policies that might jostle our standard of living it was in august 2001 , as both the economy and george w bush s poll numbers were tanking , that mr mcauliffe was asked to explain his party s economic plan what are the democrats going to do \? asked gloria borger of cbs do you want to repeal this tax cut \? do you want to repeal parts of this tax cut \? what \? mr mcauliffe replied i want george bush when he comes back from vacation , to pull everybody together and put a plan together a year after 9 11 , this nonpolicy still survived as a major plank in the democrats' campaign arsenal , with messrs daschle and gephardt this fall calling for the president to hold a new economic summit as the reigning clich had it , 2002 was the seinfeld election an election about nothing but how could an election in the midst of one war and on the eve of another be about nothing \? how could an election at a time of economic torpor be about nothing \? even jeb bush , in an arguably freudian episode of oneupmanship after his victory , said flatly on tv that while florida was doing well , the national economy is weak this election was not about nothing it s the democrats who were about nothing that is hardly the ideal stance from which to fight someone like george w bush the bush administration has big ideas it believes that toppling saddam hussein is the slamdunk gambit that will remake the arab world to our liking \( and israel s \) it has codified a security strategy built on the notion of preemptive war it believes in the partial privatization of social security , in rewarding the very wealthiest with a repeal of the estate tax , and in tailoring every conceivable policy , including those governing human , fiscal and environmental health , to the needs of its corporate sponsors many democratic politicians are opposed to these ideas or at least to those not supported by mr mcauliffe s highrollers but that s not the same as having big ideas of their own foreign policy is a nonstarter with democrats at home , we know that they are in favor of protecting social security and that some of them dream of energy independence , or of universal health insurance in a nation where 41 million people have none at all but they put forward no serious plans to accomplish such goals , let alone plans specifying a price tag and the means by which to pay the bills all politics may be local , but the local mimics the national bill mcbride s star fell when , in a debate with jeb bush , he called for mandating smaller publicschool class sizes but punted when asked where he might find the billions required to do so
portland , me , jan 25 president bush said today that he would propose spending 11 billion next year to protect the united states' land , sea and air borders from terrorist attacks the president s proposal , an increase of more than 2 billion from the current budget for border security , is to pay for more customs inspectors , more border patrol agents , technology that will more quickly inspect shipments into the united states and a new system that will track the arrival and departure of people who are not american citizens none of us ever dreamt that we 'd have a twofront war to fight , one overseas and one at home , but we do , he said in a speech at southern maine technical college here mr bush added that every morning he looked at a threat assessment , an overview of the present dangers facing the united states the enemy still wants to hit us , he said and therefore this nation must do everything in our power to prevent it although mr bush did not mention it in his remarks , the portland airport was the departure point for mohamed atta and abdulaziz alomari , two of the hijackers in the world trade center attacks on the morning of sept 11 , mr atta and mr alomari flew from portland to logan airport in boston and then boarded an american airlines jet that the authorities believe mr atta later flew into the north tower of the trade center the biggest chore i have , my biggest job , is to make sure our homeland is secure , mr bush told the crowd he added that his goal was to create seamless borders with canada and mexico that would keep out terrorists , drugs and disease but more easily let legitimate goods in mr bush also said the immigration and naturalization service would crack down on visitors who had overstayed their visas the ins estimates that 40 percent of the people who are here illegally came because of the generosity of america , were given a period of time in which they could stay , and then they did n't leave , he said and one of the things we want to make sure of is we find the 40 percent to make sure they 're not part of some al qaeda network that wants to hit the united states and so we 're looking , we 're listening , we 're following every single lead such a crackdown might not have affected the sept 11 hijackers , most of whom were in the country legally mr bush s speech was the fourth this week leading up to his state of the union address next tuesday night , and like the others it served as both preview and practice session for his themes of reviving the economy , winning the war against terrorism and protecting the united states from attack he spoke on tuesday in west virginia about creating jobs and on wednesday and thursday in washington about increasing the pentagon and domestic security budgets the president spent part of his trip here touring the coast guard cutter tahoma , which was the command vessel in new york harbor on sept 11 they stayed there for 40 days , on alert 24 hours a day , making sure that not only the traffic flowed smoothly , but people were safe , he said of the cutter s crew the president also appealed to a hometown crowd throughout his remarks , recalling his summers spent at his parents' vacation home in kennebunkport , me it s nice to be back in i guess my second home , said mr bush , who calls his real home his crawford , tex , ranch mr bush also joked about his father , the 41st president , as 41 , and the kind of coastal security he has as president now , you probably think i 've had a sweet spot in my heart for the coast guard because when i spend the night at 41 s house down the coast , i wake up and see the cutter sitting out there , mr bush said to laughter this morning , mr bush left the white house carrying a copy of bias , a book by bernard goldberg that describes a liberal bias by the news media ari fleischer , the white house press secretary , said that he did not know who had given the book to mr bush , but that many staff members at the white house were reading it mr fleischer said that mr bush had just begun the book and that he did not know his reaction photo president bush with the crew of the coast guard cutter tahoma yesterday in portland , me he proposed spending 11 billion for border security , an increase of more than 2 billion from the current fiscal year \( agence francepresse \)

charged with similar crimes , and its corporate counsel , mark belnick , who was charged with falsifying records to conceal loans he obtained from the company totaling more than 14 million perhaps most revealing , the filing includes a neverbefore disclosed list of lowerlevel employees who received millions of dollars in loans from tyco that were forgiven , these people said a spokesman for tyco refused to comment yesterday on the contents of the planned filing the undisclosed loans came from two programs tyco created to help employees pay taxes on stock and to help employees relocate to homes near tyco s offices in manhattan a person close to the company said yesterday that none of the newly disclosed forgiven loans would have a material impact on earnings and that many of the expenses had already been charged off in previous quarters it is unclear whether any executives included on the list could face charges or may be working with government in its case against mr kozlowski , mr swartz and mr belnick for those three , the indictments from last week were the beginning of a legal process that could drag on for years with suits by the manhattan district attorney , the sec , tyco and scores of shareholders , mr kozlowski will probably face the most trouble , even if he is never convicted as a practical matter , all other cases will probably await the outcome of the criminal case , lawyers said , in part because other lawyers will want to take advantage of evidence presented by prosecutors in proving their own civil cases if mr kozlowski and the other executives are found guilty of the criminal charges , lawyers for all the parties are likely to negotiate over where any seized assets will go a part to a restitution fund for the company and shareholders , a part to the state of new york , for example daniel j horwitz , a former prosecutor in manhattan who now works for carter ledyard milburn in new york , said the prosecution , the court , the sec , they 're all going to be pretty sensitive to the victims here , even though criminally the major focus of the sentence will probably be in this case prison time the district attorney has already sought to freeze more than 600 million in assets of mr kozlowski and mr swartz indeed , the ability to compel a defendant to forfeit illgotten gains is one of the most powerful weapons a prosecutor can bring to bear , lawyers say forfeiture restricts what a defendant can do with money and possessions alike , reducing the amount of money available to pay for food , rent or other basic necessities it is huge leverage over people , mr horwitz said you can essentially stop their lives by seizing their property it is very broad for that reason , prosecutors will probably negotiate with lawyers for the tyco executives over how much money they need to live on , said michael j shepard , a former federal prosecutor who now works at heller ehrman white mcauliffe in san francisco there s some assessment of hardship to the defendant , mr shepard said it s one thing to take the guy s boat , it s another thing to say , 'i'm taking your house , and now you have no place to live' of course , mr shepard said , prosecutors and lawyers for the defendant usually have a different idea of how big an allowance is appropriate judges are often unsympathetic to 50 , 000amonth expenses for food , cars and multiple homes , he added the procedure that allows the government to seize property bought with money from fraud , lawyers said , is more complicated than that for a criminal driving a car stuffed with drugs and cash , for example the police can simply impound the car in that case and lock up any money and drugs , mr shepard said even before a trial , prosecutors usually ask the court to freeze assets of an accused , especially if the assets can easily be transferred outside the country because of the array of charges against former tyco executives , prosecutors has different options , mr horwitz said first , prosecutors can bring a separate civil lawsuit against the particular property they want to seize , whether it is a car , a house , or a yacht the court will usually then issue a temporary order freezing the assets , unless the defendant s lawyers are able to persuade the judge not to at that point , prosecutors could filed alien against a house , have a car impounded , even have the yacht locked up , mr horwitz said alternatively , prosecutors could skip the civil proceeding which would continue normally after the criminal case was resolved , and ask the grand jury that indicted mr kozlowski to approve freezing any assets , mr horwitz said
kofi annan , the united nations secretary general , is searching for a new high commissioner for human rights to replace mary robinson , whose term expires at the end of the summer in naming a new commissioner , he needs first to recognize the office s flaws and then to look for a leader who can address them and seize the office s opportunities the high commissioner , whose post was created by the general assembly in december 1993 , operates in a largely undefined space the commissioner was intended to be a moral leader for the united nations , a spokesman for protecting human rights and an advocate for limiting state sovereignty who would treat all states with an even hand achieving this goal , however , is difficult the scope of the job is so broad that its actual focus can become too dependent on the biases of the individual in the position , which in turn can be magnified by the high profile of the office one way to avoid this trap is for the office to do more through the legal mechanisms that are currently underused the operations of the office , based in geneva , are divided among laworiented facilities focusing on human rights treaties staff servicing the intergovernmental human rights commission and its subsidiaries field operations and other technical assistance united nations member states control much of this apparatus , either directly in the human rights commission or indirectly through funding decisions nevertheless , many people turn to the high commissioner for help with their individual grievances each year more than 100 , 000 letters about human rights violations are addressed to the united nations many describe sad tales of abuse at the hands of government or officially sanctioned thugs these letters , faxes , postcards and electronic messages go into piles in the cellar of the palais des nations in geneva and stacks in the high commissioner s office in palais wilson in response , the annual human rights commission session , which ended last month , was able to agree on resolutions concerning the conduct of just 11 of the 189 member states this is not uncommon because in almost all cases commission members seek to avoid directly criticizing states with human rights problems , frequently by focusing on israel , a state that , according to analysis of summary records , has for over 30 years occupied 15 percent of commission time and has been the subject of a third of countryspecific resolutions as an alternative to the politicized commission , the legal side of the high commissioner s office has the potential to offer redress since the united nations began , six major human rights treaties have led to the creation of what are called treaty bodies committees that monitor implementation of the treaties four such bodies , three of which are based in geneva , offer individualized attention to human rights grievances through a complaint mechanism but almost none of the 100 , 000 pleas for help sent to the united nations make it to a treaty body for consideration for various reasons , some as mundane as a lack of clear guidelines about directing mail to the proper desk and some more substantive , like the insufficient number of staff lawyers who could help transform complaints into viable legal cases that could be pursued in theory , this petition system is supposed to provide a means for one and a half billion people to complain about human rights violations over the right to vote , freedom of expression and of religion , and discrimination on any ground but there are fewer than 100 cases registered by this system annually not one has been registered from chad or somalia , for example , and just a couple from algeria and angola the treaty body on women s rights , which has been empowered to receive complaints for the past year and a half , has still not registered a single case the new high commissioner must press for reform of the treaty system so individual cases are encouraged and accommodated this means placing emphasis on treaty obligations their universal application and their implementation in internal united nations budget battles , in contacts with governments , and in raising funds from states and foundations it also means finding a way to have complaints read , sorted and brought into a working legal system the failures of the united nations human rights system have led many human rights advocates now to pin their hopes on regional systems like the european court of human rights \( part of the 44nation council of europe \) , the interamerican commission and court of human rights \( part of the organization of american states \) , and the african commission on human and peoples' rights \( under the organization of african unity \) but these regional alternatives have limits , and there is no regional system at all for what the united nations calls asian countries including china , indonesia , india , the nonafrican middle east and iran nongovernmental organizations like human rights watch and amnesty international the natural partners for a high commissioner offer another avenue in which human rights grievances might be aired but such organizations have often mirrored the intergovernmental system by allowing the choice of states and issues they tackle to be politicized they have at times also shown a disturbing inability to sort worthwhile grievances from declarations of prejudice , as when the nongovernmental organization forum at the united nations conference against racism in durban , south africa , was turned into a platform for antisemitism a united nations high commissioner for human rights will always need to withstand political pressure from member states to engage in a highly selective application of human rights norms to succeed , a high commissioner must be guided by the principle of universality , yet root his or her work in the rights of the individual person the appointment of someone with such abilities is an important challenge for mr annan at a time when the evenhandedness of the united nations is widely doubted drawing \( robert van nutt \)
washington , feb 27 lawmakers investigating the collapse of enron turned their attention to wall street today , criticizing financial analysts for continuing to urge investors to buy enron stock even as the company headed toward bankruptcy several members of congress suggested that wall street firms' hunger for investment banking business and other conflicts kept them from leveling with investors four prominent wall street analysts appeared before the senate governmental affairs committee today and defended their decisions to maintain buy ratings on enron until close to the company s collapse they said they had no way of knowing that the company was issuing deceptive financial statements without accurate and complete financial reporting from a company , said curt launer , an analyst with credit suisse first boston , i simply do not have the proper tools to do my job but other witnesses and some lawmakers said the analysts should have seen red flags in enron s financial disclosures as early as two years ago and taken enron s refusal to explain its complicated finances as a sign of trouble why did n't these analysts press for answers or see the lack of information as a warning sign \? asked senator susan m collins , republican of maine howard m schilit , an accounting expert who runs the center for financial research and analysis , an independent research firm , scoffed at the excuse that analysts could not have detected problems at enron everybody is saying , 'they hid from us , ' he said , but beginning in march 2000 , he added , there were a string of warning signs in enron s public securities filings the problem , mr schilit said , is that analysts who question the value of a popular company are branded as controversial if you want to move up the hierarchy of the wall street establishment , you do n't rock the boat , he said today s hearing was the first to make a direct examination of wall street s role in enron s rise and fall , but lawmakers are expected to spend more time on the matter in coming months they will focus on contentions that wall street firms agreed to invest in partnerships central to enron s collapse in exchange for underwriting business from the company they are also expected to examine allegations that enron officials threatened to stop doing business with the firms if they did not invest in the partnerships lawmakers also want to know whether wall street officials learned about enron s hidden problems through their involvement in the partnerships and yet did not tell the public the bigger issue is what did these investment banks know , and when did they know it \? a congressional investigator said today in a separate hearing today , the executive director of the pension benefit guaranty corporation , the federal agency that oversees traditional definedbenefit pension plans , said that one of enron s three pension plans would be underfinanced by at least 125 million if the agency was forced to take it over that amount could change with interest rates and stock prices , the executive director , steven a kandarian , told the senate finance committee this afternoon the agency will not assume any pension obligations or sustain a loss if the enron plans remain ongoing , he said at the senate governmental affairs hearing , lawmakers praised recent proposals by wall street s selfregulatory organization to improve the integrity of wall street research but some said legislation was still needed to reduce deep conflicts within wall street brokerage firms all too often , they said , the expectation of honest and impartial research by analysts is undermined by the desire of the analysts' firms to win investment banking business from the same companies they are appraising business that generates much of the firms' revenue and , ultimately , of analysts' pay most financial analysts wear two hats , said senator carl levin , a michigan democrat , one of the allegedly independent analyst of publicly traded companies , and the other hat is that of the sophisticated , insider investment banker analyst who helps his company attract investment banking business but while there is support on the panel for legislation of some sort , critics question whether congress , or anyone else , will ever take the steps needed to eliminate conflicts on wall street entirely conflicts of interest will always exist , said frank torres iii , legislative counsel for consumers union , the advocacy group , where analysts are part of the same firms that loan money or have other business relationships with the companies on which the analysts offer their recommendations mr torres added that conflicts were likely to continue growing in the aftermath of the repeal three years ago of the glasssteagall act , a move that has allowed mergers of banks , wall street firms and insurers before its bankruptcy filing on dec 2 , enron , once the world s largest energy trader , was lauded by wall street as a unique business model with a dominant presence in the trading of natural gas and electricity while a few skeptics questioned the company s true value , most wall street analysts were firmly behind the company , promoting its stock until it neared collapse
before her gamewinning shot had even crossed the goal line , power striker tiffeny milbrett had a fist in the air and a smile on her face bright enough to light villanova stadium in unlikely fashion , the power ended its ninegame losing streak last night the lastplace power scored three times in a fourminute span late in the second half to earn a 32 victory against the firstplace philadelphia charge the loss for the charge \( 1024 \) was its first in 10 games and denied the team a chance to clinch a berth in the women s united soccer association playoffs the power is 3131 and already eliminated from playoff contention none of that seemed to matter , though it s pretty unbelievable , said milbrett , who did not enter the game until the 56th minute in the pregame , one of my teammates had said that it had been so long since we won that we had forgotten what it felt like we were celebrating on the field like we had just won the world cup the game followed a familiar script for the power it trailed by 20 , looked lifeless on offense and was thoroughly outplayed for the first 83 minutes but four minutes after liu ailing scored to give the charge a 20 lead , milbrett woke up her team with a 25yard rocket that pulled the power to 21 the power struck again 77 seconds later justi baumgardt played a hard shot that went over philadelphia goalkeeper melissa moore and off the crossbar the rebound went directly to the left foot of emily janss , who tapped the ball into an unguarded net from 6 yards out milbrett scored the final goal , in the 87th minute , but some credit should go to forward minna mustonen , who played a perfect through pass behind the defense to the streaking milbrett all milbrett had to do was elude moore and tap the ball in the character that we showed being down , 20 , against one of the best teams in the league and coming back like we did is just unbelievable , power coach charlie duccilli said the effort has been there all year , so it s nice to see that effort rewarded brandon lilly faria scores twice to lead metrostars rodrigo faria scored twice and mamadou diallo added a goal as the metrostars beat the host kansas city wizards , 31 , last night faria opened the scoring for the metrostars \( 982 \) in the 22nd minute , and added his eighth goal of the season in secondhalf injury time diallo scored his 10th goal off a centering pass from faria to make it 20 in the 26th minute igor simutenkov drew kansas city \( 667 \) to 21 in the 61st minute , scoring on a penalty kick nine yellow cards were issued in the game , six to the metrostars , with no ejections \( ap \)
the attorneys general of florida and washington state filed suit this week against an online pharmacy and a florida physician who prescribed cipro , a powerful prescription antibiotic that can be used to treat anthrax , without examining patients or speaking with them shortly after sept 11 , and the anthrax scares , we became aware of these sort of hoaxes on the internet , involving cipro and anthrax decontamination kits and all , said cheryl reid , a spokeswoman for the washington attorney general , christine gregoire chris talked with her colleagues in other states , ms reid said , and they decided it was a problem they all wanted to go after our state took the lead , because it was chris s idea what we 'd found was that we did n't have anyone in our state doing this , but those in other states were offering it to our consumers ms reid said that her office worked closely with the florida attorney general and that such cooperation was crucial in pursuing fraudulent internet practices that cross state lines investigations of other pharmacy web sites are continuing , she said the suits were filed after an investigator from ms gregoire s office ordered ciprofloxacin from the web site aprescribecom , using a fictitious name aprescribecom , based in florida , offers not only cipro , but also many other prescription drugs , including viagra , vioxx and a number of weightloss , hairloss and skincare medications customers do not have to submit prescriptions , but are asked to list any current or past medical problems and surgeries but the space for them to provide that information is already filled out with the word none , so patients would have to delete that answer to submit their own information the site also requires consumers to certify a series of statements , including an acknowledgment that the consumer is fully informed and understands the risks , benefits , and possible side effects of the prescription drugs the statements also include an agreement to waive all liability claims against the company the web site describes cipro as protection against anthrax , but does not provide any information about its risks and side effects , including the fact that indiscriminate or premature use of cipro can render it ineffective according to the complaints , a florida physician , dr serge lefevere alexandre , purportedly reviews the medical information and then writes a prescription for the drug ordered , without examining or consulting the patient the lawsuits charge that these practices are illegal and that the defendants are not properly registered to do business as a pharmacy in washington or florida in addition to dr alexandre , the defendants are the operators of the web site , bg wholesale inc , and linzer burton , its president the complaints , filed on thursday under washington s unfair business practices act and florida s deceptive and unfair trade practices act , seek to stop the sales and obtain fines and restitution for consumers we ca n't allow anyone to violate our laws and threaten people s health in order to profit from the fear of bioterrorism , attorney general gregoire said improper use of antibiotics can make them ineffective , and the unsupervised use of any prescription medicine can be harmful , or even deadly

washington , march 25 federal immigration officials have arrested and are seeking to deport a young pakistani immigrant who they say plotted last spring to blow up power plants and other sites in south florida , law enforcement officials said today the officials said the immigration and naturalization service , supported by the police in florida , arrested the immigrant , imran mandhai , 19 , about a month ago as he was returning to his apartment from an islamic center in hollywood , fla they said mr mandhai , who lives in hollywood with his parents , conspired last march and april with others , whom they declined to identify , to acquire guns and explosives for a jihad against the united states it is unclear whether he obtained such weapons patricia mancha , the immigration service spokeswoman in miami , confirmed that mr mandhai was in custody , but she would not say when he was arrested or whether the agency would start deportation proceedings the man s father , muhammad farooq mandhai , an accountant , said in an interview over the weekend that his son had done nothing wrong he said his son was in the krome detention center in miami , where illegal immigrants are often held he described his son as an excellent student who was in his second year in computer science at broward community college in fort lauderdale law enforcement officials and associates of the son painted a more ominous portrait of him the local police and other law enforcement officials said mr mandhai became disenchanted with american life and was attracted to militant islamic politics soon after he arrived in the united states in april 1998 last spring , the officials said , a federal bureau of investigations informer reported that mr mandhai was trying to organize a jihad in south florida to bomb electrical power stations and other sites mr mandhai , they said , told some associates that he had received training from a man he identified only as the marine on how to make bombs officials said that last april , mr mandhai discussed the importance of jihad with seven arab men , whom they refused to identify , at a meeting in neighboring miramar that month , they said , he also tried to buy an ak47 assault rifle at a gun show in fort lauderdale for 300 but his credit card was rejected the officials said that one of mr mandhai s targets was a large florida power and light plant near fort lauderdale airport and that he had planned to bomb it on april 27 , 2001 they declined to say why the plot failed it is not known whether mr mandhai succeeded in making a bomb or whether he even bought components for one a spokesman for the fbi in miami declined to discuss the case , or to say whether anyone else had been detained or questioned bureau officials in washington suggested that the justice department might still bring charges against mr mandhai or others , but officials in florida said the case had been turned over to the immigration agency after justice department lawyers declined to prosecute mr mandhai because of technical problems with the case one official said nothing indicated that mr mandhai or his purported plot was connected to osama bin laden s qaeda or the sept 11 attacks the official said investigators spent months following mr mandhai s movements and associates before his arrest the elder mr mandhai said his family immigrated from karachi about four years ago the father and others confirmed that the son attended the darul uloom islamic institute , in an industrial section of hollywood imran mandhai s lawyer , nashid sabir , did not return calls seeking comment in another matter , federal law enforcement agencies continued today to search for four pakistani sailors who disappeared last week after being allowed ashore in norfolk va , apparently in violation of visa rules attorney general john ashcroft has ordered an investigation of the incident , which he has described as maddening , as part of a larger inquiry into the immigration and naturalization service , which has been the target of intense criticism for lapses since the sept 11 attacks despite initial reports that one of the pakistani sailors may have been on a federal terrorist watch list , officials said today that none of the men were on any criminal watch list and that there was no reason to believe they posed a danger on sunday , mr ashcroft said he had ordered the inquiry into the disappearance of the four pakistanis , who had no visas but were apparently allowed ashore in violation of the immigration agency s rules i tell you , what s happened in the ins is enough to drive a man to drink , mr aschroft said in an appearance on fox news i believe we will find these individuals , and i believe we will be able to correct this situation but it s part of the need to renovate the ins photo imran mandhai , a pakistani immigrant shown in the 2000 yearbook of his south florida high school
robbinsville , nc , jan 9 it is a long way from the grandeur of presidential politics to the grand opening of the microtel inn and suites in robbinsville , nc , population 747 but that is where elizabeth dole , now a candidate for the united states senate in north carolina , found herself this week it was the 40th stop on her planned tour of north carolina s 100 counties , a pilgrimage intended to help mrs dole reacquaint herself with the people and concerns of a state where she has not lived for four decades there was no speaking role for mrs dole at the motel in this snowy appalachian hollow but she was repeatedly recognized by town leaders and she made use of her trademark southern charm at most such events around the state , mrs dole , 65 , has been received like the celebrity she is , attracting outsized crowds in tiny towns , like the 50 folks who filled nearly every seat in the back room during a luncheon at phillips restaurant here it helps that mrs dole , who leads in all early polls , has established herself as the solid frontrunner in the race to succeed senator jesse helms , who is retiring next year after five terms mrs dole , former presidential candidate , twotime cabinet secretary and president of the american red cross , had planned to kick off her campaign in her hometown , salisbury , on sept 11 , but the events of that morning caused her to cancel instead , she began campaigning quietly in the late fall , focusing primarily on fundraising and organizing in november , her leading republican opponent , the former charlotte mayor richard vinroot , dropped out of the race , saying he was too realistic to try to overcome mrs dole s fundraising advantage she has the republican field virtually to herself and can spend the first half of this year stockpiling money for the general election and overcoming concerns about her residency her remaining republican opponents are three doctors venkat challa of winstonsalem , ada fisher of salisbury and jim parker of lumberton and a lawyer , jim snyder of lexington none are expected to pose much of a challenge , though mr snyder has the personal financial means to mount an aggressive campaign and has already broadcast advertising among democrats , erskine b bowles , a former clinton chief of staff , is raising money for his race against elaine f marshall , the secretary of state , and daniel t blue jr , a state representative mrs dole said in an interview that the war on terrorism was still driving the agenda in the race and that defense preparedness and rising unemployment had emerged as the primary issues you still need to be sensitive to the tone in this country , she said most people are still very much focused on the war against terrorism , and you do n't see other issues getting traction right now mrs dole s 25minute stump speech , characteristically delivered while strolling the room , is largely cotton candy she joked about riding a motorcycle with jay leno , paid tribute to the military , expressed hope that sept 11 terrorist attacks would generate a spiritual renewal in america and emphasized the importance of local control over education i'm glad to see that there will be an education bill that the president will sign soon , she said , apparently not realizing that he had done so on tuesday mr snyder has attacked mrs dole on perceived shifts in her position on gun control , a critical issue to conservatives while campaigning for president in 1999 , mrs dole opposed laws allowing people to carry concealed weapons and supported legislation to ban assault weapons now facing a more conservative electorate , she wrote to the north carolina rifle and pistol association pledging to oppose restrictions on the ownership of firearms that penalize the lawabiding citizen in the interview , she described herself as a strong supporter of the second amendment , and said the assault weapons ban appeared to have had little effect on crime and should not be extended or expanded until studied further she also said she would have no trouble supporting north carolina s concealed weapons law , which requires passing a gun safety test before being allowed to carry a concealed weapon and restricts where guns can be carried mr snyder said mrs dole s shifts on gun control raised questions about whether she was a suitable successor to mr helms , one of the senate s conservative stalwarts the same , he said , is true of her past stands on abortion , which she opposes in most instances but has called a divisive and largely irrelevant topic of debate the folks out there are concerned about the trust issue , mr snyder said the second amendment and abortion are sacrosanct issues to conservatives , and they just do n't waver on those but steve odom , a republican who is sheriff here in graham county , said he was satisfied with mrs dole s positioning i do n't know that the republican party could ever find someone to replace jesse helms , mr odom said , but elizabeth is conservative enough for me to help address the issue of her residency , mrs dole has taken title to the twostory tudorstyle house in salisbury where she grew up and where her 100yearold mother still lives her campaign paid to send 26 , 000 christmas cards from mrs dole and her husband , former senator bob dole , that depict the house and offer greetings from our home to yours the couple s primary residence is the watergate complex in washington in her appearance here , mrs dole received an assist from chester w crisp , the graham county republican chairman , who introduced her at the restaurant of course , they tried to pack her off as another hillary , mr crisp said , referring to senator hillary rodham clinton , who won her senate seat in new york without having lived there previously but she s not she s a native north carolinian , so she s our own flesh and blood photo after making a brief statement about her run for a senate seat from north carolina

' remember how captain kirk has that star log \? well , he ai n't a girl and neither am i in this spirit no heroes is born mr offutt is a wonderful raconteur , sharpeyed and selfeffacingly funny even as he appreciates the essential mournfulness of his experience in this slender , captivating book , he captures the full arc of his homecoming adventure the shock of recognition sustains the first part of his story , as he looks around to find his freshman composition teacher , his typing teacher and a guy who once sold him marijuana all eating at the dixie grill a boy i 'd grown up with came by the table to say hello , he writes he was balding now and i remembered when a vista worker took him to a dentist the next day he brought a toothbrush to school since he 'd never seen one , he figured none of us had either elsewhere he finds a boy from childhood who had inexplicably become a grown man driving a huge truck this man would very much like to be in mr offutt s book and even offers to trade a beer for that privilege write me a whole chapter and you can have a shot at my old lady , he offers but it ai n't as good as everybody says then there is the baseball coach who greets him with i 've got a videotape of when we won the regional tournament one old boy frogjumped right over you just put his hands on your head and polevaulted you should come and see it humorous local color abounds , especially in a place where the video store is a cultural mecca and film criticism means complaining about the denouement of deliverance \( at the end when that old boy gets shot with a crossbow , the arrow sticks out of his chest , someone tells mr offutt as close as he was , it 'd go right through him \) and the biggest local literary event is the monthly changing of paperback books at walmart no heroes describes all this without condescension and with mr offutt s rueful awareness of his own ineradicable ties to the place i am reminded of the old story about the axe that entered the woods , he says upon seeing it , the trees said , look , the handle is one of us mr offutt s honesty extends to revealing how bittersweet his stay at morehead turned out to be and the book s early hope turns to disappointment , which would ordinarily be enough to give it shape but he also incorporates something else the world war ii reminiscences of his inlaws , arthur and irene , holocaust survivors who emigrated from poland to queens mr offutt , a man raised in a place where jew was a verb , questions the legitimacy of using this material there were no jews where i grew up , he writes as a kid i thought they were the same as christians only they went to church on saturday i married the first jew i met the synthesis of appalachian and holocaust stories winds up working unexpectedly well how does he accomplish this \? you figure it out , sonny , arthur tells him i have faith maybe something subliminal it helps that mr offutt s ear for anecdotes is so keen , and his inlaws' recollections are so clear and forceful and it also helps that mr offutt is ultimately able to define some common ground like these migr s , he must come to the conclusion that , in arthur s words , home is a feeling , nothing more along with his fatherinlaw , mr offutt can share this closing sentiment home is where i hang my head photo chris offutt \( sandy l dyas \)
london , sept 5 les selby had only to hear the words ken livingstone and he was off and ranting he had plenty of time for it , because the taxi he was driving was inert , hemmed in from all sides by london s formidable midmorning gridlock it borders on criminal , what he s got up to , mr selby said of mr livingstone , or kamikaze ken , as he unfondly calls the man elected mayor two years ago on a trafficreduction pledge he wants people to use public transportation , but i would n't let a dog on the bus at night , let alone the wife london s bold trafficabatement scheme a program to charge motorists 5 , or about 780 , a day for the privilege of driving into central london at peak times is scheduled to take effect next february while the famously automobileshunning mayor is already hailing the plan as the best way to get traffic moving , critics , including small businesses and residents' associations , cannot quite believe it is actually going to happen to pay to drive your own car into your own city , i think it s a bit rich , said a woman who lives in kennington in south london , the site of the southernmost boundary of what is now being called the congestion area she did not want her name used , but stopped for a minute on the street to point to the demarcation area between the payment zone and the free zone if i want to drive across the street to visit my son , i'm going to have to pay 5 each time , she said nobody disputes that the traffic situation is terrible each morning , 40 , 000 cars , trucks and buses an hour pour \( or trickle \) into central london , using roads meant for horses , carriages and pedestrians traffic now moves at an average of less than 10 miles an hour businesses estimate that some 3 million a day is wasted because of gridlock according to the mayor , the answer is to impose socalled congestion charges , which are meant to reduce traffic in eight square miles in the center of london by 10 to 15 percent , while raising some 204 million a year although similar systems are being adopted elsewhere , most notably in singapore , no city of london s size and complexity has come close to anything this comprehensive other cities in britain are eagerly watching to see if the plan can be adapted for their areas the single most important thing about this is that it s actually going to go ahead , said robert r kiley , london s transport commissioner ken livingstone s view is that if you put it off , it wo n't happen it s a very gutsy thing to do some business groups have given the plan a tentative thumbsup , saying that any effort is better than none but the scheme will take a great deal of getting used to for one thing , the mayor has ruled out the idea of using smart cards , similar to the ez pass system in use on many toll roads and bridges in the united states , saying they would be too cumbersome as well too unfamiliar for london drivers while weekly , monthly and yearly passes will be available to regular commuters , people who want to make occasional trips into central london during peak hours from 7 am to 6 30 pm on weekdays will have to pay separately each day they make the trip payment can be made by telephone , over the internet , or through machines at gas stations and the like spontaneity will be a thing of the past , said angie bray , a conservative member of the london assembly you 'll no longer be able to say , 'let s do some shopping in oxford street , ' and take your car if you want to do that now , you will have to ring up or get on the internet and book your passage enforcement is another potential problem the system will be policed by 260 cameras that will photograph the license plates of each car using the zone each day , and connecting to other cameras and computers will theoretically be able to electronically separate the cars that have paid from those that have n't drivers will have until 7 pm the same day to pay the 5 people who forget to pay , or shirk their responsibility , will have to pay increasing penalties , up to 80 , depending on how long they wait the fine for not paying at all is 120 one of the big teething problems is going to be irate motorists who have no idea that they crossed the boundary and who find that they 're suddenly stung for large sums of money , miss bray said londoners do n't necessarily love their cars but they complain that the public transportation system which serves a sprawling city full of narrow , haphazardly arranged streets and is hardly comprehensive is not always an enticing option critics of the mayor s program have been horrified by the trafficabatement schemes he has already put in place , including adding more bicycle and bus lanes embarking on various roaddigging projects , including one making part of trafalgar square a pedestrianonly zone and adjusting many traffic lights to favor pedestrians over drivers traffic has become much slower , said kevin delaney , traffic and road safety manager for the royal automobile club foundation , a lobbying group mr delaney recently conducted a private road test , measuring his driving time on several of london s busiest roads his average speed was a miserable 29 miles per hour at one point , it took him 28 minutes to travel sixtenths of a mile i was surprised , he said well , staggered would be a better word many critics of the mayor s plan have accused mr livingstone of sneakily making the traffic worse now so that when the congestion charges start he can restore the lights and then claim the improvements are due to his new system he denies this emphatically he also denies that his anticar stance is personal , although there is evidence to the contrary mr livingstone rides the subway to work and does not have an official mayoral car , preferring public transportation or , in a pinch , a taxi when the subway shut down during the last transit workers' strike , the mayor walked to his office , an epic journey that took him several hours one sometimes suspects that his policy might be driven by an inchoate philosophical hatred of cars , said piers merchant , campaigns director of the london chamber of commerce , who does not himself hate cars that would be very bad indeed photos a london cyclist had an easy run down the bus lane on vauxhall bridge , notorious for traffic jams mayor ken livingstone , below ,

ballots all over the country are crowded with the nominees of strange and mysterious entities like the cool moose party or the politicians are crooks party , along with more traditional groups like the libertarians and the greens only in new york , however , are small parties rewarded for nominating someone who is not a member , has probably never attended a meeting and is possibly unclear about what the party stands for the intricacies of election law do n't generally make for exciting conversation there is something sort of gloriously awful , however , about the rules in new york we are the battlefield earth of ballot access under new york law , any party whose candidate for governor receives 50 , 000 votes then gets a line on the ballot in every general election over the next four years , from the humblest judicial contest to the united states senate races having a line is wonderful you can give it away to your friends , or punish your enemies by nominating somebody who will siphon away their votes or you can rent it out in return for patronage and consultancy fees the easiest way to get the magic 50 , 000 votes , far and away , is to crossendorse one of the major party candidates a george pataki , for instance , or an andrew cuomo new york is possibly the only state that encourages this kind of behavior as a result , organizations like new york s liberal party , the independence party and working families party do n't waste any time wondering which of their members to run for governor they just have to decide which of the large parties' candidates is most likely to produce the necessary spillover this system was devised at the behest of the liberal party , a longtime fixture in new york politics that , as the local saying goes , is not really liberal and not really a party originally founded as a home for anticommunists , it mutated over the years into a patronage machine raymond harding , its longtime leader , delivered the liberal line to rudolph giuliani in 1993 , allowing mr giuliani to call himself a fusion candidate for mayor , even though in real life the republican plus liberal nominations amounted to a fusion of about 11 parties mr harding managed to place not one but two sons in high posts in the giuliani administration one of them , russell harding , was made president of the new york city housing development corporation even though he had no college degree and no experience in housing according to stories first reported by tom robbins in the village voice , he turned the job into an openended expense account for travel , meals and entertainment for himself and a friend the fact that the younger mr harding even put his morning bagel on his expense account , not to mention up to 250 , 000 in larger items , suggests he may have gotten the idea somewhere that the public trough was his own personal banquet hall this year the liberal party s gubernatorial candidate is andrew cuomo , who is running for the democratic gubernatorial nomination the working families party has nominated mr cuomo s democratic opponent , h carl mccall governor pataki , a republican , is involved in a twofront fight with thomas golisano , a wealthy upstate businessman , for the nominations of the conservative and independence parties mr golisano was a founder of the independence party , and twice its gubernatorial nominee , but its leaders claim mr pataki has won its heart by supporting some of their election law reform proposals election law reform is extremely important to this group , whose members appear to have absolutely nothing in common but their frustration at not ever having been elected to anything at one point , the new york leader , a marxist named lenora fulani , was allied with pat buchanan thanks to just that sort of meeting of the minds opponents say ms fulani s support for mr pataki is actually a payback for his help in getting 10 million in interestfree loans for a nonprofit group she runs ms fulani says nothing could be further from the truth mr golisano is also planning on starting a new , yettobenamed party that will put him on the ballot in november no matter what it s expensive and highly technical and labor intensive , said his political adviser , roger stone , with that cheerful tone consultants get when they talk about something that will require an extremely large number of billable hours but this is a guy who s talking about spending 75 million mr golisano is also leading a fight to keep mr pataki from getting the advantage of the conservative nomination , the details of which are more confusing than the plot line of attack of the clones obviously , this is a process that gives very small factions of very small parties way more power than they deserve mr pataki is worried that mr golisano can drain away the votes of conservatives who do n't appreciate his recent swing to the left the democrats , meanwhile , are worried that the rules will leave the loser of their primary stuck on the ballot on a third or fourthparty line , splitting their already nonetoosubstantial support if there s any justice in the world , all those things will happen at once , and a chastened legislature will feel compelled to impose some sanity on the process this would be an easy problem to solve simply change the law to require that the parties get 50 , 000 votes for a gubernatorial candidate who is actually a member of their organization an innovative idea for new york , but worth a try
among the democrats to take a governorship from the republicans was jim doyle , the state attorney general , who will assume office on a platform of balancing the state s budget and putting an end to the political corruption that led to charges against leaders of both parties in the state legislature in the last year mr doyle ousted the incumbent , scott mccallum , who was filling the twoyear vacancy created when tommy g thompson , the popular and influential former governor , was brought into president bush s cabinet as secretary of health and human services mr mccallum had held state office since 1976 , when he was just 26 but his brief tenure as governor came at a tough time , and he seemed to take the blame for high unemployment and a big budget deficit the two candidates and their supporters spent an estimated 20 million on the race , a record for the state , and much of the money went into negative advertising the technique did little for mr mccallum , who never got much traction in the polls his effort late in the campaign to link mr doyle to the state scandals , calling him crooked , appeared to backfire perhaps because voters were unhappy with the nasty tone of the race , mr thompson s brother , ed thompson , running on a libertarian ticket , made a strong showing as a thirdparty candidate the state s entire house delegation was reelected , returning three republicans and four democrats to washington for two more years none of the races were close governor 100 reporting doyle 800 , 971 \( 45 \) mccallum 732 , 796 \( 41 \) thompson 185 , 085 \( 10 \)

cabo san lucas , mexico , oct 27 president bush left a summit conference here today without a pledge from mexico to support the american resolution in the united nations security council to disarm iraq mexican officials made it clear that mexico is siding with france in the debate at the united nations while the united states is demanding one resolution that includes a legal basis for the military action against iraq , france wants two stages , authorizing force only when baghdad fails to comply with weapons inspections mexico is a crucial swing vote in the security council , and the lack of explicit support from president fox is a setback to the united states in what american officials say will be the final days of the difficult deliberations mr fox said mexico s priority is to achieve a resolution with the broadest possible backing from the 15nation council the crucial thing is collective action , he said a few hours after meeting for about 35 minutes with mr bush , who seemed somewhat shorttempered after their discussion american officials had expected that mexico , one of the 10 nonpermanent members of the council , would be what one called an easy vote the lack of agreement on iraq came as mexico and the united states also reported scant progress of the bilateral agenda that mr fox has been promoting , especially on his push for a broad immigration agreement mr bush says he will lead a coalition to disarm iraq unilaterally if the 15member security council does not pass a strongly worded american resolution for inspecting and dismantling iraq s weaponry that proposal contains the implicit threat of immediate military action if iraq resists france has said it does not want a confrontation with washington but rather is striving to close the gap between their views in the final stage of the highstakes negotiations secretary of state colin l powell , who only recently was openly optimistic about the american resolution s prospects at the united nations , said saturday that a victory there may evade us he added , we have reached the point where we have to make a few fundamental decisions in the next few days a security council resolution must pass with at least 9 votes in favor and no negative vote from any of the five permanent members among the permanent council members the united states , britain , france , russia and china only britain unequivocally supports the american proposal among the 10 nonpermanent members , so far only five have clearly indicated they will vote with the united states that leaves mexico along with ireland as pivotal swing votes because of mexico s close economic ties with the united states , and the personal friendship betwen president fox and president bush , american officials had expected mexican cooperation but even a 9to6 resolution would be a diplomatic debacle for the united states , a senior mexican official said , arguing that a split decision would send a signal of disunity and division the two nations made no progress in a series of meetings this week on other major issues that both draw them together and pull them apart , including trade and migration we 're about where we were not any closer than we were before , not further , said mexico s foreign minister , jorge g caste eda what we want is a resolution that is approved by all 15 or 14 members of the security council , said mr casta eda we think that s more important for the united states' cause the 15th vote would be syria s , but no one thinks it will vote against iraq unanimity , the members agree , would be a good thing but none exists today france has circulated an informal alternative to the american resolution its text omits two crucial words from the american proposal , which would find iraq in material breach of a number of past security council resolutions france and other nations consider that phrase a tripwire that would authorize the united states to decide whether to go to war with iraq regardless of the results of weapon inspections while mr bush , secretary powell and the national security adviser , condoleezza rice , attended the 21nation asia pacific economic cooperation talks here this weekend , secretary powell and the french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , spoke several times by telephone , as did the american and french ambassadors to the united nations , john d negroponte and jeandavid levitte , diplomats said the united states and mexico find themselves at an impasse as well , with little sign of progress or compromise on mr fox s dream of an accord on migration the extent to which that standoff may affect mexico s position on iraq is unclear it is clearly cooling the relationship between the two nations mr fox seeks some legal rights for more than three million undocumented mexican immigrants in the united states , along with more visas and expanded guestworker programs he says implementation of those goals will benefit both the security and the economy of the united states on average , between 300 and 400 mexican migrants die every year trying to cross the border in january , when tariffs are lifted on a slew of heavily subsidized american farm products under the north american free trade agreement , the flow of cheap american food and feed will become a flood , potentially swamping mexican farmers and small businesses mexico says that may drive many more people north seeking work but mr fox got nothing from president bush , save a noncommittal response when he invited him for a state visit next year time and circumstance have not allowed us to progress with the speed we want , mr fox said
david ditzel had a prestigious research job at sun microsystems in 1995 but was spending too much time in meetings that did n't matter much to him i did n't like where things were heading , and i did n't believe in the vision , so i became demotivated , he is quoted as saying in a new book i had to force myself to go off and think of something new he quit his job and founded transmeta , which has a radical new approach to making semiconductors mr ditzel is an example of a hip , hot and happening innovator , or h3 , portrayed in the book , new ideas about new ideas insights on creativity from the world s leading innovators , by shira p white , a new yorkbased consultant \( perseus publishing , 26 \) the term h3 may make readers roll their eyes , as ms white acknowledges , but do n't let the instant clich deter you her book which she wrote with g patton wright , whom she describes as a writing coach and mentor is filled with insight about the creative process and is presented most engagingly it is precisely in these tough economic times , she contends , when innovation has a black eye because of the bursting of the dotcom bubble and the collapse of incubators like idealab , that true innovators keep pushing ahead with a search for leap innovation much ink has been spilled on the topic of innovation , but ms white approaches the subject in a fresh way , partly because of her background and training she had been a painter but decided to get a master s degree in business administration at new york university ms white tells how she butted heads with one professor of management of information systems the professor gave the class an assignment ms white came up with a novel solution , but got a d the reason , she remembers the professor saying , was that it was n't the answer the professor was seeking the business mind , it seemed to ms white , was closed to creative solutions since getting her degree , ms white has led something of a dual life she has served as an instructor at the pratt institute and a lecturer at new york university s school of visual arts she also started a consulting business , spwi the letters are her initials , plus i for innovation which helps companies innovate for new ideas , ms white interviewed a mix of 100 artists and sculptors and architects as well as business leaders at america online , corning , emc , enron , genzyme , ibm research , imclone systems , microsoft , palm , progressive insurance and others obviously , at least one of these companies has been too creative ms white met and quotes enron s former chairman , kenneth l lay , and former chief executive , jeffrey k skilling , discussing their pursuit of creative people for their staff and their expansion into new lines of business she was able to adjust many of her references to enron because much of the news about the company s collapse happened just before the book went to press this month the fact remains , however , that the company was in many ways an innovator , coming up with a new market for trading commodities and for hedging , among other things imclone , another company that figures prominently in the book , has encountered problems in trying to have its new anticancer drug approved by the food and drug administration and her praise of corning , a leader in fiber optics , and idealab , the technology venture capital firm , overlook some harsh realities corning lost 55 billion last year and idled many factories because of the global glut in fiber optic cable , and investors in idealab have sued its founder , bill gross , accusing him of squandering their money but none of that detracts from the overall message that ms white offers as was the case with mr ditzel , the best innovators find it hard to work in an organization that is too wedded to the status quo in traditional organizations , people who have investments in the 'old model' are not always happy to see new talent coming along with a bright and shiny new design , ms white writes typically , the need to change is in conflict with the need to stay the same , she adds she says the best way for top executives to encourage innovation is to spot the talent in the company , then give these people enormous room to run and expose them to other influences , whether art or different scientific disciplines the point is to create what she called a spark soup of data and thoughtsharing from which new ideas emerge new things do n't tend to come out of heavy organization , she writes some executives , like corning s former chairman , roger g ackerman , even allow ideas they do n't like to percolate they also encourage innovators to play around with their mistakes the company , she argues , has a newidea culture elsewhere , she writes that true innovators do their best work when they have emotional connections to others in their research unit ms white quotes mr gross , of idealab , as arguing that researchers should be organized as tribes doing battle against other tribes that allows for greater intimacy , better communications and more camaraderie , the author says reflecting her artistic background , ms white writes that too many executives attempt to make decisions strictly by the numbers the numbers , like returns on investment , often do n't capture mushy stuff like the quality of a company s employees and the value of brands and customer bases , she says one surprise in the book is that ms white finds creativity in companies that are n't widely known for innovation progressive insurance , welch foods and capital one financial , for example progressive , now the no 4 insurer in the country , has turned auto insurance upside down by figuring out ways to offer lower rates in many cases and changing the way accident victims repair their cars rather than giving a customer an estimate to take to a repair shop , which encourages both the customer and repair shop to pad the bill , progressive takes charge of the repairs and has them done at a lower cost the company s chairman , peter lewis , told ms white that he got some of his best ideas when he swam with a tape recorder poised at each end of the pool i 've solved most of my problems at the end of the workday , in a somewhat altered state of consciousness , mr lewis said aside from the broad lessons on creativity , the book offers compelling personal accounts of how brilliant people create new things the sensational design that frank gehry developed for the guggenheim museum in bilbao , spain , started when mr lewis of progressive insurance hired the architect in 1989 to design and build his dream house i started playing with movements , making shapes that are dynamic and have a quality of movement to them , mr gehry said in the book one thing led to another , and the design morphed into a museum many creative people play with ideas and concepts that suddenly blossom , ms white concludes her innovators often pursue projects in unrelated spheres of life , all at the same time sometimes they need immersion in the spark soup at other times , they need isolation to work all night on new inspirations new ideas has an inspirational quality to it , but not in a crass lose 10 pounds in five days way even if the technology bubble has popped and enron has crashed , american creativity is n't over no one can put innovation in a bottle , but we can keep learning about how to do it better ms white s book will encourage readers to do that photos a new book advocates creative processes like the one behind the guggenheim museum in bilbao , spain \(

a manhattan judge said yesterday that he would issue a decision at 10 30 this morning that could overturn the convictions of five young men in the 1989 central park jogger case , an announcement that was greeted with anger among senior officials in the police department and with a threat of extraordinary legal action by the police detectives' union lawyers for the union , the detectives' endowment association , will try to block the judge presiding in the jogger case , charles j tejada of state supreme court , from issuing his decision by seeking an injunction from another judge , said michael j palladino , a vice president of the union because the union is not a party to the jogger case , its petition is likely to have little impact on the authority of justice tejada to issue his decision instead , the union legal filing is likely to serve as a vehicle for the arguments of retired detectives who believe that valid convictions in the jogger case have been abandoned by the manhattan district attorney s office the convictions , in a sensational case that was originally thought to involve a gang rape by a mob of teenagers , were based on confessions obtained by the detectives earlier this month , robert m morgenthau , the manhattan district attorney , agreed with a defense motion that the guilty verdicts should be overturned , saying that the confessions had significant weaknesses that were exposed when a murderer and serial rapist confessed to the attack on the jogger the purpose of the union s action , said its lawyer , richard dienst , is to protect the integrity of this investigation , and the credibility of these detectives , and to make sure the court is not rendering a decision based upon omissions and errors of fact the prosecutor s report has patent errors , mr dienst said that view is shared by a number of top aides to the police commissioner , raymond w kelly , but neither mr kelly nor his aides have made any direct public statements on the matter last night , officials indicated that a statement would be issued by the department , but later said that none would be made detective palladino initially said the union s lawyers had been encouraged by senior police officials to block the judge s decision , but later said he had been misinformed after an 11month investigation into a confession by the murderer and rapist , matias reyes , the manhattan district attorney s office found persuasive evidence that he was the jogger s sole attacker on the evening of april 19 , 1989 the prosecution said that his claim was substantiated by dna and other evidence , including details mr reyes provided of how the jogger was first struck down near 102nd street by a blow to the rear of her head with a heavy tree branch those details corresponded with a fracture on the right rear portion of her head , just as other details he provided accounted for the loss of her keys and her walkman , and for the dispersal of her clothing justice tejada is expected to issue a written decision on the motion to vacate the convictions , according to david bookstaver , spokesman for the office of court administration mr bookstaver would not comment on the contents of the judge s decision , but lawyers for the five young men said last night that they expected the judge to vacate the convictions i do n't see that there is any other alternative , said michael warren , a lawyer representing three of the defendants , antron mccray , kevin richardson and raymond santana councilman bill perkins , a friend of and adviser to the defendants , added this is a major breakthrough hopefully , justice tejada will finally set the record straight and clear these five young men of all charges mr warren asked the judge to expedite the decisionmaking process last month in the hope of having a ruling before the holidays justice tejada initially set a january date , but court officials said all along that a decision could come earlier late yesterday , lawyers in the case were told by the judge s clerk to be in court this morning one defendant , mr santana , is in prison on an unrelated charge , serving a sentence that was extended because of his conviction in the 1989 attack mr warren said he hoped to have him freed for christmas the others , now 28 to 30 years old , have all completed their prison terms of 7 1 2 to 13 1 2 years police officials questioned whether the district attorney s office had a role in pushing the judge to accelerate his decision to preempt the police from presenting their side the department is still completing a report that is expected to argue that evidence indicates the teenagers played some role in the attack many of the attacks on the prosecution s report have focused on nancy e ryan , the chief of trials in the district attorney s office , and the principal author of the report detective palladino continued that theme , which avoided direct criticism of ms ryan s ultimate supervisor , mr morgenthau if nancy ryan s preparing an inaccurate report , she s deceiving the court , detective palladino said asked why ms ryan , a veteran prosecutor and the chief of trials for mr morgenthau , would not support convictions obtained by her office , detective palladino answered you got me beat i do n't understand it mr morgenthau had no comment last night , a spokeswoman said , but last week he denounced such criticism of ms ryan it s ridiculous , he said he added that a team of senior prosecutors had worked on the findings , and that he had consulted with all of them it s my decision , mr morgenthau said the buck stops here
one blustery afternoon a few months ago , i set out to find a former home of sergei rachmaninoff the great pianist and composer once lived at 33 riverside drive , but when i arrived i discovered that his townhouse had been razed to make room for a stately apartment building at the same address a plaque affixed to the facade tells the passerby nothing about the old russian master but proudly notes that george and ira gershwin lived there years later i was intrigued by this coincidence like the vertical strata of an archaeological site , new york s musical history seemed to be stacked on top of itself if anyone could appreciate this observation , i knew it was a wonderful couple i had recently met only blocks away there is no plaque on their building , but inside their apartment the layering of the musical past goes far beyond the overlapping addresses of yesterday s new york indeed , to enter their home is to find this very history distilled into the world of artifacts books , photographs , etchings , paintings , manuscripts , letters , diaries , quotations , concert programs and instruments these objects line the walls , tower high in the closets and quite literally emerge from the carved woodwork the only things they have in common are that they are old and musicrelated and that they have been collected by the remarkable husbandandwife team of marianne wurlitzer and gene bruck the apartment is a gallery with elements of a museum , an archive and an antiquarian shop , but none of these quite describe the space that this couple has created it is perhaps better thought of as a variety store of music history where , for a reasonable sum , you can purchase an actual letter written by brahms to his publisher , a first edition of bach s st matthew passion , an original silhouette of paganini in concert or an autographed musical quotation from verdi s aida in the composer s own hand there are thousands upon thousands of such items within these walls given how much it encompasses , the gallery fittingly draws its name from a simple linking of theirs wurlitzerbruck i first heard of this extraordinary place the way most people do , by word of mouth although they have been in business for more than 25 years , the two have never advertised or sent out a catalog or even placed a sign on the door business is by appointment only , and they say customers who are serious have a way of finding them when i arrived at the gallery for the first time , i found it difficult to keep my eyes on any one thing , so intense was the overload of the curious , the strange and the beautiful everywhere i looked , centuries of history intermingled and distinct musical traditions competed for scant wall space a bourdelle bust of beethoven peered out austerely beneath a gorgeous norwegian hardanger fiddle with a fingerboard of bone , ebony and mother of pearl a signed portrait of the jazz drummer max roach levitating in the lotus position hung mischievously over a quotation from wagner s tannh user a giant 4by3foot original etching of the joachim string quartet adorned a wall next to a blue and white porcelain cello made as a garden ornament , and on and on the main room of the gallery was bathed in a soft afternoon light that streamed in through large windows overlooking the hudson the striking view , 17 stories up , added to the peculiar enchantment of this place a secret musical reliquary in the sky after a quick tour of the apartment , mr bruck and ms wurlitzer invited me to sit down , and across the two bronze shan rain drums that they use as a coffee table we began to get acquainted mr bruck is a gentle and softspoken man who has had many jobs in music journalism and publishing ms wurlitzer comes from an illustrious line of instrument dealers \( known primarily for their pianos , organs and jukeboxes \) , and she speaks with the knowing sharpness one might expect from growing up around a family business , together with the thoughtful wisdom of having reinvented it the idea to open a shop selling what they themselves are hardpressed to describe but generally refer to as oddball musical things came to them in 1974 they took their first business trip to europe to start buying shortly thereafter if we could sell it all when we got back , fine , mr bruck said if not , we 'd have all that nice stuff , and we 'd go and get real jobs almost three decades later , business is still good , and in true momandpop fashion , they have moved their living quarters to a studio apartment one floor above the gallery conversation eventually turned to the shop itself , and the stories began to dovetail one into the next i quickly realized that for every one of the countless items in this shop , there was a separate tale of the research , the hunt , the acquisition , the provenance and the personalities involved the couple clearly relished telling these charming anecdotes , and they would pass the narrative thread between each other in midstory or even midsentence with a practiced ease , like string quartet players handing off a single melody across several instruments

east rutherford , nj , dec 27 michael strahan s speech here today was simple and direct , his head bobbing with every inflection some teammates nodded along as strahan outlined what he considered the most significant regularseason game in his decade with the giants we do n't like the eagles and they do n't like us , strahan said , according to teammates they 're coming into our stadium they beat us the last time if we win , we 're in the playoffs we have to get it done and the players' faces were stone serious when they broke the huddle at the end of practice they can still make the playoffs if they lose to the philadelphia eagles at giants stadium on saturday , but none of them want to be in the position of hoping for new orleans to lose again the saints play at home against carolina on sunday it s a playoff game for us , giants coach jim fassel said win and keep going or lose and very possibly pack your bags tight end jeremy shockey , who missed thursday s practice because of flulike symptoms , returned today , moving well and running with verve after taking intravenous fluids will peterson , the giants' right cornerback , did not go through a regular practice , but he did work out , backpedaling and cutting , and there is a sense he will try to play , so long as he can stand the pain from his injured left knee two days before the giants played philadelphia in october and lost fassel walked out of practice angrily , taking the assistant coaches with him he thought the players were not preparing properly , and he wanted them to take ownership , to invest in themselves fassel has seen that lately the players came to giants stadium to study videotape of the eagles on monday , on what was supposed to be a day off , and practices have been crisp and purposeful the players seem confident and intense but not tense the difference in the players' attitude since fassel s walkout two months ago , he said today , is that we have more guys who understand we can do this , and it s our responsibility to go out and play well we 're going to have fun at what we do , fassel said , but we 're going to be serious , and we 're not going to mess around in practice within their own framework , they raised their expectations tight end dan campbell said he felt as if the team had developed an understanding of itself we 're on a threegame winning streak and we 're playing pretty good football right now , campbell said i think maybe a lot of it , you get that feeling you know what it takes to win , regardless of who you 're playing we 've got that taste now of what it takes to win , what it is that gives us momentum , how we respond after we have good practices the eagles beat the giants two months ago at veterans stadium , 173 , running through them for 295 yards running back duce staley accumulated 126 yards , quarterback donovan mcnabb 107 when the giants' defensive linemen and linebackers reviewed the videotape of that game in the days that followed , they felt that most of the yards were because of their own poor play , rather than overpowering blocking by the eagles' line it was definitely one of our worst games , defensive end kenny holmes said much of philadelphia s attack was aimed at holmes that game was the giants' first without defensive tackle keith hamilton , who tore an achilles' tendon he was our big force , and we did n't have anyone to lean on , said denny marcin , the defensive line coach strahan was trying to hold the fort that was part of it and part of it was the biggest part we got outexecuted they executed better than we did the giants' run defense has been strengthened during their recent winning streak lance legree , the tackle who replaced hamilton , said he felt more comfortable , learning from his experience frank ferrara , who shifted from defensive end to share the tackle position , has gained weight through heavy squat lifting and holiday food the giants' linebackers played the run exceptionally well at indianapolis on sunday , slamming into the gaps in the defensive line and allowing strong safety shaun williams to roam the secondary rather than support the run defense mcnabb is out now with a broken ankle , replaced by the secondyear quarterback a j feeley the eagles are 40 with feeley starting , but he has not been required to make plays under pressure philadelphia has held the lead at the end of each of the 18 quarters he has played the eagles have run for more than 100 yards in each of their last 14 games , a foundation for their success if the giants can stifle the running game and shadow tight end chad lewis , they can place the onus on feeley to hold the ball a little longer and beat them down the field in a game in which philadelphia will most likely be without its best wide receiver , todd pinkston , who is hampered by turf toe the giants will probably commit their defense to stopping the eagles' ground game , increasing the pressure on feeley peterson and will allen , the giants' cornerbacks , stood at their lockers today , musing over the question of how many times in their lives , from high school through the nfl , they will have played a game like today s the season on the line , the goals clearly defined probably only 10 times , allen said what s fun about this is everything is on the line , he said running back tiki barber said , every time we play these guys it s a brutal war all but one of barber s teammates echoed him this is not a big game , shockey said it s just another game somebody give him another iv photos the

on the way back from kabul , i passed through pakistan , the persian gulf , london and belgium , where i had a variety of talks with arab and muslim journalists and business people and muslim community leaders in europe all of them were educated , intelligent and thoughtful and virtually none of them believed that osama bin laden was guilty let s see , there was the serious arab journalist in bahrain who said that arabs could never have pulled off something as complex as sept 11 there was the euromuslim woman in brussels who looked at me as if i was a fool when i said that the bin laden tape in which he boasted of the world trade center attack was surely authentic and had not been doctored by the pentagon there was the americaneducated arab student who insisted that somehow the cia or mossad must have known about sept 11 in advance , so why did n't they stop it \? there was the saudi businessman who declared that there was a plot in the us media to smear saudi arabia , for absolutely no reason and there was the pakistani who confided that his kids' entire elementary school class believed the canard that 4 , 000 jews who worked in the world trade center were warned not to go to the office on sept 11 frankly , these views have been present across the arabmuslim world ever since sept 11 , but i somehow hoped that after the fall of the taliban , or bin laden s confessional tapes , they would have melted away but they have not indeed , they have congealed into an iron curtain of misunderstanding separating america and the arabmuslim world , and are now as deeply held as they were on sept 11 even if people are slightly more reticent about airing them and they add up to a simple point that while america has won the war in afghanistan , it has not won the hearts and minds of the arabmuslim world the culturalpoliticalpsychological chasm between us is wider than ever and if you do n't believe that , ask any us ambassador from morocco to islamabad any one of them they will share with you cocktail party chatter about the american conspiracy against the muslim world that will curl your ears yes , there are exceptions in every country when i sat with bahraini friends in manama last week , i found many of them deeply introspective and ready to look reality in the eye but these are not the rule why \? what produced this iron curtain of mistrust and misunderstanding \? there are many rivets in it one is our own failure over the past two decades to really explain ourselves in arabic and to puncture canards about us policy with hard facts the bush team has yet to provide a dossier , in arabic , detailing all the evidence against bin laden it is not too late for that , although facts alone will not be enough there is enormous cultural resistance to believing anything good about america some of this is deliberately fanned by the staterun press in certain arab countries to deflect criticism from the regime some is revenge for america s support for israel , particularly at this time when the israelipalestinian conflict has turned into such a human meat grinder , aired every night on arab tv not acknowledging america s version of reality , or undercutting its sense of victory in afghanistan , is a way for arabs and muslims to get revenge for america s support for israel , which they feel so powerless to affect at the same time , there does seem to be a certain strain of selfloathing at work in parts of the arabmuslim world today what else can one think when someone tells you that arabs or muslims could never have been clever enough to pull off sept 11 only the mossad or cia \? it is a sad fact that arab selfesteem is very low these days , because of the lagging state of arab political systems and economies , and that feeds the freefloating anger that bin laden has been surfing on finally , we have to admit that bin laden touches something deep in the arabmuslim soul , even among those who condemn his murders they still root for him as the one man who was not intimidated by america s overweening power , as the one man who dared to tell certain arab rulers that they had no clothes , and as the one man who did something about it quietly today , many in the arabmuslim world are rooting for bin laden to get away they are whispering in their hearts , run , osama , run ! that s what s really going on out there i just wish we knew how to change it

much has been made since july 1 of the knicks' interest in this summer s middling crop of freeagent centers , but scott layden , the team s president and general manager , is focused on making a far more significant transaction while no deals are imminent , layden hopes to pull off a trade before training camp begins in october that would rival the magnitude of the knicks' draftnight acquisition of antonio mcdyess perhaps the most coveted player on layden s wish list is andre miller , the cleveland cavaliers point guard who was nearly traded to the los angeles clippers on draft night since cleveland has no interest in any of the knicks' players , except for mcdyess , who is offlimits , layden s pursuit of miller will be futile unless he can involve a third or a fourth team the knicks would also love to acquire new orleans hornets point guard baron davis , who has reportedly said he wants to be traded to a team in a larger market , but layden believes bob bass , the hornets' vice president for basketball operations , has no intention of trading davis while the knicks obviously like minnesota s wally szczerbiak , speculation that they may trade latrell sprewell for him seems unfounded at shaw s summer pro league in boston yesterday , kevin mchale , the timberwolves' vice president for basketball operations , said a trade was undesirable because of the contracts involved even if the contracts of sprewell \( 12375 million \) and szczerbiak \( 29 million \) were close , the knicks would not make that deal , even though they are willing to part with sprewell before sending marcus camby to denver in the trade for mcdyess , the knicks had been shopping camby and sprewell now that camby is gone , sprewell s been the most shopped player in the league , one nba general manager said while that may be an overstatement , it shows that sprewell s name has been prominent in trade talks the knicks realize he will have to be involved in any deal that brings them a topflight player the reason sprewell has not been traded is not because of a lack of effort on the knicks' part , said the general manager , who spoke on condition of anonymity there are some teams interested in him , but it s not like the knicks are going to get kobe bryant for him after sprewell , kurt thomas is the knick most likely to be dealt he is coming off the best season of his career and , with only three years and 15 million remaining on his contract , he is a virtual steal there have been preliminary talks within the knicks organization of trading thomas and charlie ward to dallas for point guard nick van exel , but no serious discussions have taken place the knicks' reported interest in obtaining a center is real , but they know that a trade for a center who can have an impact , or even a starter , is unlikely the clippers have not indicated a willingness to trade michael olowokandi , a center the knicks have pursued , so the knicks have been focusing on finding a point guard coach don chaney , who has been outspoken about his desire to see his roster revamped , said recently that he hoped the team could trade for a star point guard the top three centers of this freeagent class , toronto s keon clark , seattle s jerome james and minnesota s rasho nesterovic , could help the knicks , but only to a minor degree all are pursuing the maximum midlevel exception , 4546 million , but the knicks are willing to pay only half that , at best the knicks approached minnesota about a possible signandtrade for nesterovic , but the timberwolves were not interested having learned from the team s financial mistakes of the past , most notably last summer s trade of glen rice for the overpaid role players shandon anderson and howard eisley , layden is being frugal few general managers believe that players of that caliber will receive contracts beginning at 45 million , so they are waiting a few weeks until the agents realize that big money is not forthcoming james could be the first to be signed , said his agent , marc fleisher fleisher said yesterday that james had received two offers and that he would probably sign a multiyear deal starting at 45 million within the next few days minnesota has said it will match any contract offer that is made to nesterovic , a restricted free agent the athletic and energetic clark would seem to be a great addition for the knicks , but layden has not spoken with his agent , jim mourer , since an inconsequential chat the first week of july the knicks have an interest in those guys , but it has to be at the right price , one league official said the knicks have definitely overspent in the past , and scott s big thing is to sign the right player at the right price none of these guys are viewed as impact players , and there are a lot of trade routes he s still looking at rebounds frank williams , the knicks' rookie point guard , underwent successful surgery to repair a broken bone in his left wrist yesterday and is expected to be available to compete in the knicks' training camp , which begins the first week in october williams , who injured his wrist tuesday night in a game in shaw s summer pro league , will wear a cast on his wrist for six weeks after the cast is removed , he will start physical therapy dr norman scott , the team physician , said williams should have full use of his left hand three to four weeks later the knicks will open their 20023 season on oct 30 at detroit the nba champion los angeles lakers will visit madison square garden on feb 6 photo latrell

we are at war , dear as funny as it is to watch jiminy writhe in his chair , twisting his bloated limbs into positions that even a contortionist would n't try , it s even funnier to watch his guests watching him damon wayans , whom jiminy praised as one of his favorites only to add , though i have n't actually seen the work , could n't stop laughing long enough to actually participate in the interview poor rosie o 'donnell looked authentically terrified strangely enough , jeff goldblum seemed baffled , which was also billy crystal s initial reaction , though he recovered slightly when jiminy queried him on whether or not marvin hamlisch should still wear jeans the biggest dud , though , was bill maher even though jiminy praised his work in dc cab , mr maher , the host of politically incorrect , responded to questions about drug use and political correctness as if he were on meet the press mr maher got his comeuppance when he attacked jiminy s marriage to dixie , his beloved wife of 23 years with whom he has four wonderful , strapping boys , morgan , mason , matthew and modine as a sham and accused him of being gay is n't that interesting , jiminy shot back , coming from a 44yearold bachelor the show s two interview segments the first takes place in the studio while the second , called out and about , takes jiminy on location are totally improvised and there have been moments when host and guest are so in sync and the timing is so sharp that you feel as if your head is spinning you would expect steve martin to be terrific , as you would jerry seinfeld , conan o'brien and tom hanks \( whom jiminy introduced as tom hank \) but who could have predicted that alec baldwin would have jiminy stamping his little feet in ecstacy \?

paris , oct 14 they say , france is one and indivisible , said dogad dogoui , with characteristic deadpan humor , as he poked at a lunch of fish recently i say , yes , and with lots of people who are invisible after 17 years in france , mr dogoui is still uncomfortable with the french treatment of blacks he is one of hundreds of thousands of nonwhite immigrants , mainly blacks and arabs , whom france has absorbed over the years from its former colonies in africa and the caribbean but french sensitivity to the arabs in their midst , largely because of the potential for a spillover of violence from the middle east , far outstrips that toward blacks here , he said so last year , mr dogoui , a stocky , cheerful man who earns a living advising foreign companies how to do business in france , founded a club for black business leaders now , he is spearheading a drive to involve more blacks in politics french attitudes toward blacks , he conceded , are ambiguous the cradle of human rights , paris raised a statue early in the last century to toussaintlouverture , the black haitian liberator for years , the french have regularly denounced american racism , and the road from harlem to paris was wide , inviting talented american blacks like the singer josephine baker , musicians like sydney bechet and writers like richard wright , langston hughes and james baldwin yet , today , blacks are not much on the french agenda , said mr dogoui , 38 , who migrated here from abidjan , ivory coast he thinks they should be for 30 years france has been changing , he said but they do n't open their eyes and see it officially , blacks number about 15 million of a total population of 59 million but the unofficial number is higher , mr dogoui maintains , and more come daily in national elections this year , christiane taubira , a feisty economist from french guiana , became the first black candidate for president , drawing 660 , 000 votes , or 23 percent of the total but in french politics , mr dogoui said , blacks arrange the chairs at conferences and clean up afterward no black person sits in the national assembly or in regional parliaments in all of france , he said , there are only about 100 black city council members that s ridiculous , he said , what does that mean , among 36 , 000 towns and cities \? the oldest of 12 children , mr dogoui grew up in comfortable circumstances his father was deputy director of the port of abidjan at one time , he had wanted to emigrate to quebec , but his father objected , saying the move would carry him too far from their closeknit family he is now married to a french woman from normandy they have three children in 1994 , he became a french citizen after trying unsuccessfully to enroll in medical school , mr dogoui studied psychology , but became drawn to public relations he obtained his degree from the leading french school for public relations , making useful contacts while working as an intern in several government ministries earlier , he had attended a catholic boarding school in normandy , where he cut his teeth on politics , founding an african students association and organizing an african film festival as a student , mr dogoui supplemented an allowance from his father by working with other black and arab immigrants in a packaging plant in a paris suburb while there , he saw how long hours on the factory floor prevented the blacks from overseeing their children s education but what particularly troubled him , he said , was how the workers clung to an immigrant mentality , happy to have escaped african poverty and content with the simplest of jobs they forget that their kids are not immigrants , he said they nevertheless showed enough concern to complain that the schools offered their children none of the extra help they needed or a place to study after hours it s not a financial question but a question of interest , mr dogoui said while white pupils are encouraged to continue studying , black children are steered toward vocational training he heard , he said , of black students telling their teachers they wanted to study medicine , only to be laughed at black kids say , 'why should i study journalism \? ' he said there are no blacks on tv mr dogoui likes to tell a story about his 10yearold son , who returned recently from a trip to london , where he visited stores with nonwhite owners they 're bosses there , the boy told his father , with an unmistakable note of wonder during a layover recently at the amsterdam airport , mr dogoui sat in a lounge with other business people onethird of them were black , he said , yet he was the only french person the others were from north america , britain and the netherlands france s largest corporations have no black directors or senior executives , he said , claiming competent blacks are unavailable yet , as a corporate consultant advising north american and scandinavian companies how to do business with french companies , mr dogoui has observed how savvy businesses use blacks to increase their effectiveness in dealing with nonwhite countries or customers finding competent black executives should be a challenge for french companies , he said but it is n't one that they seem particularly eager to confront sometimes it s racism , he said , referring to french companies but sometimes they just do n't get it when asked whether the french people are racist , however , he reflected a moment before saying no some blacks see the french as racists , he said , because they distrust all french society i chose to adapt , he said , attributing his success to his mastery of the french language , which he spoke at home in abidjan , and to an ease accepting people of other cultures that he inherited from his father at boarding school and in college , he said , he met french students who were curious about africa and its art , literature and film but the average french person , he said , shows little interest france , he said , is a strange country closed , traditional , even on the left one goal of the business club is to create an investment fund to finance black startup companies france has room for ethnic african and caribbean restaurants , mr dogoui said , as well as hairdressers and cosmetics french advertising lacks blacks , he notes , both in the advertisements and the agencies , and has neither a major black newspaper nor magazine the goal of mr dogoui s political movement is to discover talented blacks to run for office at all levels of government he has no illusions about the difficulties they will face for example , when the new prime minister , jeanpierre raffarin , assembled his cabinet last spring , black leaders including mr dogoui asked him to name a black minister for african affairs they were refused blacks , he said , are disappointed with the left , believing that the former socialist prime minister , lionel jospin , did little for them and they mistrust the right he favors no particular faction my dream , he said , is to have blacks some day on the left , on the right and in the center an optimist by nature , he fears nonetheless that , barring change , racial unrest could explode in france as it did in america in the 1960 s highrise slums surrounding french cities are cauldrons of racial anger dominated by urban gangs and they are armed , he said you have to give young people hope photo dogad dogoui s political movement aims to find talented blacks to run for office in france \( owen franken for the new york times \)
linda richard thought she would feel better by now instead , she is more anxious , more afraid , more paranoid six months after sept 11 , she cannot sleep she is overeating , taking the antidepressants she had stopped using last spring , and her apartment , in crown heights , brooklyn , is a mess there are too many mondays spent under the covers , staring at the receipt for the last thing she bought at the world trade center a pretzel and ignoring the telephone she is moving out of new york city on friday , she said , because she is haunted by the roar of airplanes flying overhead , fearful that her 22story apartment building is the next terrorist target the feelings , the hate , the fear , the insecurity are overwhelming , ms richard , 31 , said recently , standing in the halfpacked bedroom of her two young daughters , preparing for her move to mount vernon , in westchester county i would rather be somewhere simple , where nobody will get hurt ms richard did not know anyone who died in the attack on the world trade center , and she was miles away at her job in east new york , brooklyn , when the twin towers were hit but her story , a plunge from stability to fragility , from wellness to illness , is not an isolated case mental health professionals across the country say the psychological fallout from sept 11 affecting people with chronic psychiatric and addiction problems and people who had never experienced anything like the wrenching angst they are battling now is strikingly pervasive there is a deep degree of uncertainty , said leon schein , a west village psychotherapist it has to do , in part , with a sense that safety was taken for granted and then ripped away with a suddenness i think we may have underestimated the number of people who were going to have a later onset of the effects , dr schein added the residue of this experience is going to last a lot longer than we anticipated many therapists , psychiatrists and drug and alcohol counselors say that they are seeing more serious problems now and more evidence of a widespread anxiety than they did in the immediate aftermath of sept 11 , attributing it to a delayed reaction after the shock of the attacks wore off in most cases , these mental health professionals are treating patients who did not lose a relative or close friend , participate in the rescue effort or directly witness the attack but were nevertheless deeply affected much of the evidence available so far is anecdotal , although one measure that city officials and mental health experts consider to be very telling is the record number of calls being made to lifenet , a telephone help line and referral service paid for by the city with some private support in january , lifenet received 6 , 600 calls , up from a monthly average of 3 , 000 calls before sept 11 , and 5 , 300 in december , said john draper , director of the lifenet hotline network he said that before sept 11 , less than half of one percent of all callers were reporting symptoms of trauma , such as anxiety in january , 21 percent of the callers were reporting either anxiety or symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder , with many callers saying they were experiencing sleeping and eating problems , depression and substance abuse each month , we have seen more psychological distress , dr draper said in december , researchers from the national center on addiction and substance abuse at columbia university released findings of a survey in which they found that admissions to treatment centers since sept 11 had risen by a national average of 10 to 12 percent , with substantially higher increases in new york city , washington , phoenix and houston those having difficulties include both those with previous psychiatric problems or histories of addiction and those who had not reported problems before a lot of people we deal with already have a trauma history , said jody silver , director of advocacy and public policy for community access , a manhattan nonprofit agency that works with the mentally ill people were having relapses , their symptoms were getting a lot worse , and they 're still dealing with it at one extreme is robin simon , 46 , who had struggled with anorexia , bulimia , alcoholism and bipolar disorder for much of her life before the terrorist attack , ms simon said , she felt well she had not been hospitalized since 1996 she was holding down a fulltime job for the first time in decades , working as a counselor for the mentally ill she was sleeping and eating regularly the intrusive thoughts , paralyzing phobias and moments of mania that had made her want to jump out of her skin were fleeting and manageable , she said but on sept 11 , the day ms simon watched the twin towers burn and collapse from her office in downtown brooklyn , her face pressed against a window , her body suspended in time , it all fell apart she hardly spoke for two weeks she began throwing up again and drinking alcohol nightmares , recurring images of the burning buildings and the ashes human ashes , she feared floating over the east river onto her clothes , kept her awake her doctors wanted to admit her to the hospital she could barely function at work and had to reduce her hours to part time she is convinced that her neighborhood , in astoria , queens , is going to be blown up by terrorists any day i'm afraid of everything , ms simon said recently i'm afraid of my own shadow then there are people with substance abuse problems or histories of trauma , like incest and domestic violence , whose troubles worsened dramatically after sept 11
vero beach , fla it breaks your heart it is designed to break your heart that was bart giamatti s take on the game he loved he was the baseball commissioner for only five months during the 1989 season in that time he presided over the investigation of whether pete rose gambled on baseball when the investigation concluded , bart s heart was broken the evidence collected by the commissioner s office betting slips in mr rose s handwriting , the testimony of his bookie seemed overwhelming mr rose , the alltime leader in hits , had bet on his own team repeatedly he committed baseball s capital crime but mr rose would admit nothing , so bart was left with no choice mr rose was banished from the game and placed on the permanently ineligible list eight days later , a heart attack claimed bart s life and now there s talk of mr rose cutting a deal with the current commissioner , bud selig , so that he may return to baseball , possibly in the job he had when he was thrown out manager of the cincinnati reds i was bart s deputy in 1989 , and from my seat i see no reason why mr rose should be allowed back in the game on talk radio people say , thirteen years is punishment enough no , it s not nothing has changed in 13 years mr selig knows this well he was the owner of the milwaukee brewers when bart outlined what mr rose needed to do to return to the game admit publicly to his gambling and to reconfigure his life mr rose has admitted to nothing and remains a habitu of the better dog tracks he s a gambler the rose case is not about what is best or fair for peter edward rose the vital issue is what is best for baseball the commissioner must act in the best interests of the game gambling on baseball by baseball personnel undermines the sport the deterrent , the risk of lifetime banishment , works everyone in baseball knows with certainty that betting on a game in which you have an interest will lead to a lifetime ban to dilute that deeply felt fear the present commissioner must conclude that all previous commissioners were wrong after all , none of us was willing to reinstate shoeless joe jackson mr rose can be very likable i remember when he came into our first meeting to discuss the gambling allegations he arrived in a shiny green suit , and he charmed us the public loved his headfirst game and , if the polls can be believed , overwhelmingly support his reinstatement bid today they believe , as mr rose has argued , that he has suffered enough and that he deserves another chance another chance to do what \? to earn the sevenfigure salaries managers receive today \? for bud selig , a close friend and admirer of bart s , this must be a very difficult decision my advice , unsolicited , is for him to move cautiously maybe mr selig wishes to appease the public by permitting mr rose to be eligible for the hall of fame , but only if he admits to betting on the reds \( at present , players on the permanently ineligible list may not appear on the hall of fame ballot \) but mr selig should not permit mr rose to manage again , unless the bar is raised even higher to get back in the game , mr rose would have to admit that he bet on his team , demonstrate a reconfigured life and dedicate himself to public service on behalf of baseball of course , if it were up to me the ban would stand i accept the ancient dictum to temper justice with mercy but to readmit mr rose now , with only a pressrelease apology , would exhibit too much mercy to a single man and not enough respect for the game he played and the fans who pay to watch it it is mr rose who has yet to accept the justice of his situation he had 4 , 256 hits and one colossal whiff
washington , feb 5 lawyers for john walker lindh , the american captured with antiamerican forces in afghanistan , said today that mr lindh had been treated harshly in highly coercive conditions by his american captors after being abused by forces friendly to the united states as a federal grand jury indicted mr lindh on 10 criminal charges today , his lawyers filed an unusual statement with the court that offered mr lindh s harrowing account of his treatment after he was captured in november near mazarisharif , following what his lawyers said was a 50mile trek through mountains with little food or water the statement , signed by george c harris , one of several lawyers representing mr lindh , was part of an effort to win mr lindh s release on bail it said mr lindh , who converted to islam in his teens , narrowly escaped death at the hands of americanbacked antitaliban forces during an uprising at the qala jangi fortress his lawyers said mr lindh , 20 , was abused by his american captors , who bound him to a stretcher with heavy tape , placed him in a windowless metal container , gave him little food or medical attention and refused to allow him to speak with a lawyer at a news conference , attorney general john ashcroft expressed little sympathy for mr lindh the united states is a country that cherishes religious tolerance , political democracy and equality between men and women mr ashcroft said by his own account , john walker lindh allied himself with terrorists who reject these values the 10 charges accuse mr lindh of training to fight with osama bin laden s terror network and then conspiring with the taliban to kill americans in afghanistan john walker lindh chose to train with al qaeda , chose to fight with the taliban , chose to be led by osama bin laden , mr ashcroft said the reasons for his choices may never be fully known to us , but the fact of these choices is clear mr lindh s lawyers said in their statement that their client was with other prisoners in a dank basement while under arrest by antitaliban forces commanded by gen abdul rashid dostum , now the deputy defense minister of the interim government of afghanistan during the uprising , mr lindh s captors threw grenades and fired rockets down ventilator shafts , killing prisoners below at one point , general dostum s men poured oil and diesel fuel down a duct and lighted the fuel , starting a fire that killed many prisoners , the statement said at the end of a week , the antitaliban troops poured ice water through the ducts into the basement as the water rose , the statement said , mr lindh was able to stand up with the help of other prisoners to avoid drowning around mr lindh other prisoners who could not stand up were drowned today , mr lindh s lawyers said the government had produced nothing that showed mr lindh had engaged in any violent acts there are no allegations and no evidence that he ever so much as fired a shot , even at northern alliance soldiers , the lawyers said in their court filing none of the charges against mr lindh could bring the death penalty but if convicted of all the charges , he faces a maximum sentence of three life terms , plus additional 10year and 30year terms in prison he would not be eligible for early release on any of the counts mr lindh was first charged on jan 15 in a sixcount criminal complaint that was superseded by the new indictment , which included four fresh charges of aiding the taliban and al qaeda the charges were brought in alexandria , va , a suburb of washington where mr lindh will be tried in federal district court he is being held , under heavy security , in the county jail mr lindh has a hearing on wednesday on his request for bail and is scheduled to be arraigned on monday in the court before judge t s ellis he has not entered a plea , but his father , frank lindh , has said he is innocent the indictment today had been expected under federal rules , prosecutors were required to replace the complaint with an indictment to avoid a preliminary hearing , which had been set for wednesday mr lindh is still scheduled to appear in federal court on wednesday , but the hearing before magistrate w curtis sewell will consider only the issue of whether he should be released on bail until his trial mr lindh s lawyers said today that their client should be released into the custody of his father they said that mr lindh was not a flight risk and that he did not represent a danger to others moreover , the defense lawyers said , there is no evidence that mr lindh played any part in the prison riot by captured taliban and qaeda fighters that resulted in the death of johnny micheal spann , a central intelligence agency officer killed in the uprising even according to the facts alleged in the affidavit , however , the only services ever provided by mr lindh were as a foot soldier for the taliban , the filing said , although it provided no details of his activities in afghanistan or an explanation of his motives the indictment described mr lindh as a committed taliban fighter it said said that in may or june last year , he agreed to travel to a qaeda training camp knowing that america and its citizens were the enemies of bin laden and al qaeda and that a principal purpose of al qaeda was to fight and kill americans after the sept 11 attacks , the indictment said , mr lindh remained with his taliban unit , despite having been told that bin laden had ordered the attacks , that additional terrorist attacks were planned and that additional al qaeda personnel were being sent from training camps to the front lines to protect bin laden and defend against an anticipated military response from the united states the indictment repeated much of the information on which the earlier charges were based most of that information in those accusations came from statements that mr lindh made to fbi agents in interviews on dec 9 and 10 in afghanistan today , mr lindh s lawyers attacked the legality of the interviews , saying they were conducted under highly coercive conditions after eight days of harsh confinement in freezing weather mr ashcroft and other justice department officials have said , however , that mr lindh voluntarily agreed to answer questions and signed an agreement waiving his right to a lawyer during the interviews at each step in this process , mr ashcroft said , walker lindh s rights , including his rights not to incriminate himself and to be represented by counsel , have been carefully , scrupulously honored photo

it s not often you see the swaggering eminem thrown off his game but when he bumped into the soul singer indiaarie backstage at bet s afterschool show , 106 and park top ten live one afternoon last month , he stopped dead in his tracks eminem s homophobic , misogynistic and violent rap lyrics have made him the scourge of the pta and the politically correct ms arie s spiritual ballads and anthems of selfesteem have made her a beacon for those who believe that popular music must be an agent for positive change now , unexpectedly , they were face to face and eminem suddenly looked like a schoolboy caught smoking behind the gym by the principal ms arie broke the silence i think you 're brilliant , she said , resting her hand on eminem s arm we need to talk i 'd like to do something with you eminem s features softened and his lips curled into a smile definitely , he said he then told ms arie that he liked her debut album , acoustic soul a photographer snapped pictures of this unlikely pair , and then they each turned to leave suddenly ms arie whirled around and called out wait a minute , wait a minute ! when s your birthday \? october 17th , eminem said , amused you 're a libra ! ms arie exclaimed with a wide smile , as if a mystery had been solved taking her seat in the van that was transporting her and her small entourage around the city , she said that goes down in my book as today s information eminem s a libra if you have n't already guessed , ms arie is a libra , too , along with sting , john lennon and mahatma gandhi , she pointed out \( the proximity of her birthday to gandhi s is the source of ms arie s first name \) and the principal characteristic of that sign is honesty , she said , a virtue ms arie has in great supply on acoustic soul , which came out last year and earned her seven grammy nominations , ms arie , who is 26 , articulated a vision of africanamerican physical beauty that has proved inspirational to a large , passionate audience of young women i'm not the average girl from your video , she sang on the hit song video and i ai n't built like a supermodel but i learned to love myself unconditionally because i am a queen even more tellingly , in a modern update of the 60 s declaration that black is beautiful , her seductive song brown skin , a tribute to a lover , was heard as a paean to black men and women whose dark coloring and broad features , like ms arie s own , do n't conform to white standards of beauty rane , a female disc jockey for radio station wpgc in washington , raised the issue directly with ms arie in an interview backstage at rehearsals for mtv s video music awards show , shortly after the singer s encounter with eminem it s a lot of sisters out here who admire you , the dj said , especially a lot of darkskinned sisters we always have this conversation at the station about chocolate sisters and how few there are in the music industry do you think it s been harder for you being darker than a paper bag \? ms arie laughed knowingly at the reference to an infamous measure of africanamerican beauty it might have been a hard thing for me in high school or junior high , not being the prom queen or whatever , she responded but i know for certain that god made us the way we 're supposed to be , and i love everything about myself , the way i look , my nose , my skin ms arie s music only further enhanced her reputation as an artist of substance centering on her acoustic guitar and confident but restrained vocals , it recalls such soul masters as stevie wonder and roberta flack ms arie s new album , voyage to india , which is to be released on tuesday by motown , might be considered the next chapter in the story she began to tell on acoustic soul the title is borrowed from an instrumental on mr wonder s 1979 album , journey through the secret life of plants and like her first album , voyage combines songs of selfencouragement \( little things , slow down \) , declarations of faith \( god is real \) and sensitive explorations of the bonds between men and women \( talk to her , can i walk with you , complicated melody \) so why , then , would this woman think eminem is brilliant \? you see , there s two different sides to that , she explained over dinner at the candle cafe , a funky healthfood restaurant on the upper east side of manhattan i have an opinion about his effect on minds that are young and impressionable , obviously on the other side of it , i love great art and loving words , rhyme schemes and stories the way that i do , eminem is brilliant i'm just newly realizing that about him and jayz too i used to just think , 'those words are irresponsible , and it s not good for children' but i'm grownup , and i can deal with it and when you look at the art of it , it s great ms arie is also aware that the highmindedness of her music has created an image of her that is reserved and serious , even somewhat schoolmarmish she is nothing like that in real life , however like her idol , mr wonder , she is prone to burst into song whenever melodies float through her mind , as they often do and when young fans approach her , as they did when she entered the lobby of mtv to do a taping earlier in the day , she outdid them in her enthusiasm her eyes rolling with delight , she twirled , waved her arms and danced in her bright yellow shirt and headwrap , she was a sight to see be sure not to tell everybody i'm so silly , she playfully warned at one point i'm supposed to be deep then she laughed and shouted , destroy the misconception !
davos , switzerland , jan 30 as the world economic forum , in all its pomp and glitter , gets under way on thursday at the waldorfastoria , this remote alpine ski resort is in shell shock the hotel seehof , which has been host to yasir arafat and shimon peres , not to mention bill gates and hillary clinton , is begging for customers and cutting its rates by half at christ , a jewelry store that sells piaget and chopard watches for up to 13 , 000 , big signs announce that selected items have been reduced by up to 50 percent for 32 years , this small town was home to what is now the world s biggest annual extravaganza of the rich and powerful davos evolved from being the name of just another swiss ski resort into a word that conjured glamour , wealth and power now there is an uncomfortable feeling here that davos may have chased away the goose that lays its golden eggs the davoser zeitung , the local daily newspaper , summarized the anxiety in a headline quoting one local leader as saying the city would watch how new york handles our conference davos is really just a small town with some spectacular mountain views and good skiing , but fairly bleak architecture the town has a only a handful of fivestar hotels , and more than 100 that range from mediocre to downright dingy the davos congress center , which is usually the hub of the world economic forum , is bleak and gray but the allure of the world economic forum had become so powerful that none of that mattered wealthy executives contented themselves with cramped rooms in threestar hotels and paid 200 a night for the privilege for one week a year , this little town becomes a global village , it becomes the center of what is happening in the world , said hanspeter angerer , the owner of a sporting goods store here and head of the davos tourism board it s something we got used to , and of course it s something we miss last year many residents , alarmed that the conference began attracting violent protests against globalization , became fed up with the world economic forum parents fretted that the protesters had made the town too dangerous for their children shopkeepers complained that security measures had turned the village into an armed fortress , where the wealthy guests could barely go out and shop it was like being in a prison , all barbedwire , police with machine guns and blockades , said max berthoud , who owns a small antique shop called coccodrillo i am happy to have the world economic forum return here , but not if it is like that estimated security costs for the conference soared to 72 million , prompting a fight among swiss politicians at the national level last week , after months of debate , the swiss cabinet promised to pay 80 percent of the costs of protecting foreign leaders until at least 2005 klaus schwab , the former professor who founded the world economic forum , agreed to bring the meeting back to davos next year , but did not make any promises beyond that but even if the forum returns here next year , many local residents are pessimistic i do n't think it will stay here for much longer , said franz kaufmann , who owns a tool shop here and leads a trio that played 12foot alpine horns at the opening of the world economic forum i think they will find there are advantages in new york city , and they will either stay there or start looking for other locations most business owners and local political leaders desperately want to get the gathering to return to davos and stay to help lobby for the cause , city officials and business leaders are flying to new york , bringing mr kaufmann s horn trio with them but some townspeople admit that they have grown a little weary of the world economic forum shopkeepers and innkeepers complained that the gathering changed as the number of participants soared into the thousands and more highprofile political leaders came they come in their helicopters , spend all day going from one thing to the next and then they 're gone , complained boris bossi , owner of paar senn , a sports clothing store they do n't have any time to shop or go skiing anymore the arrival of antiglobalization protesters made things much more difficult two years ago , protesters smashed a local mcdonald s and began attacking the police who tried to restrain them two police officers were injured last year , town officials tried to block protesters from getting into town they also erected barbedwire barriers around the conference center and in parts of town where foreign political leaders were staying mr bossi s store was trapped behind the police barricades and was forced to shut down for most of the four days of the conference even so , protesters blocked roads leading into town , disrupting the arrival of conference participants we are a tourist destination and our livelihood comes from tourism , said stephan staub , the city s legal counsel but we do n't want people to destroy our houses and shops mr schwab and his conference organizers have been frustrated by the reluctance of swiss leaders to support him on security costs they have also grumbled for years that davos needs more topquality hotel rooms felix hubli , owner of hubli s landhaus , an inn in a nearby village that sits nearly empty this year , said davos and the world economic forum were in a tired marriage he said he hoped the onetime separation would do both sides some good maybe after being in new york , the wife they have had for the past 30 years will end up looking a lot better than before , he said map of switzerland highlighting davos davos has become synonymous with glamour , wealth and power
pam and barry levy had often thought about selling their house in merrick , but after 37 years , it was hard to let it go their final decision was made easier during a snowstorm , when they were returning home from manhattan and got stuck in their driveway that did it , mrs levy said the kids were grown and on their own , and i did n't want to think about the responsibilities of a house anymore for linda and myron teitelbaum , who owned their house in lawrence for 17 years , it was the steps that did it we had three stories , and i was constantly going up and down , mrs teitelbaum said when the stairs started getting on my nerves , i knew it was time to move after 20 years of pursuing separate hobbies , lon and fredda goldstein discovered that they both loved boating , enough to invest in a boat of their own they decided that once their younger daughter left for college , they would sell their house in muttontown , where they had lived for 20 years , and move closer to the water for these empty nesters , the decision to sell their homes was motivated by the promise of new and different lives but it was not made without moments of uncertainty my older daughter felt like we betrayed her , mr goldstein said we were taking her childhood home away from her for mrs teitelbaum , who moved from a large house on more than an acre to a gated community of smaller homes in glen cove , the most difficult thing was letting go of the local vendors when i went to the cleaners or the fish store , everybody knew me on a firstname basis , she said it was hard to break away from those familiar faces for a long time , i kept driving from the north shore to the south shore to get my hair cut and colored but then one day i told myself that i had to be a big girl and make the break selling a home after many years of living in it is almost never easy , said kathleen hamburger , an associate broker at daniel gale , a real estate company that has 12 offices on the north shore it s often a roller coaster of emotions , she said a lot of planning goes into the decision , and most people think for a long time about their options before selling their primary home they may not care anymore about being in a good school district because their kids are out of the house but want instead to be in a waterfront community or in a fullservice complex with a clubhouse and pool simplicity was the word often used by empty nesters to describe the decision to sell their homes i did n't want to worry anymore about a gardener or taking care of shoveling snow , mrs teitelbaum said for terri and richard elias , it took two moves to get to that simpler life when we decided to sell our house in syosset , my husband wanted something grand and luxurious that would be suitable for entertaining and that would be spacious enough for future grandchildren , she said so we bought another house nearby in oyster bay cove that was twice as large , with two driveways , four entrances , a foyer that could seat 50 for dinner parties and bedrooms dispersed throughout the house but it did n't work we realized that the kids have their own lives our 29yearold son lives in new york city and works 14 hours a day , our 27yearold daughter now lives in san francisco , and our 22yearold son is finishing college in manhattan none had any time or interest in our big house furthermore , the privacy was isolating , and we discovered that we would n't be entertaining as we had planned because our friends preferred to go out to restaurants after rethinking their priorities , the eliases decided that what they really wanted was a luxurious environment that would allow them more freedom with less space to maintain their search led them to a townhouse complex on the border of glen cove and locust valley , with three ponds , a pool , tennis courts , a golf course and a beach minutes away their threebedroom town house still has room for future grandchildren , but mr and mrs elias have made the space fit their present needs , too this time , we took down the kids' soccer trophies and converted one of the bedrooms into a library , which is something we had always wanted to do , she said bonnie doran , the corporate director for business development at daniel gale , said that empty nesters tend to move in one of two directions when it comes to factoring their grown children into the equation some plan with their children and grandchildren in mind , she said they look for new homes that are spacious , maybe even of greater magnitude than what they left behind others , however , are looking to downsize they do n't want the upkeep or expenses of their former homes but something that s easier to take care of they may also have an apartment in manhattan or a second vacation home , and they seek a lifestyle that s freer but even though they want to scale down , they do n't want to throw away the memories she herself has not been able to make up her mind about what to do since selling her house in glen head she plans to rent until she figures out what she wants to do photo fredda and lon goldstein , who have discovered boating , at their new house in huntington bay

on the day after , labor negotiators for baseball s clubs and players met twice yesterday and discussed an assortment of topics , none of them the strikeladen issue of a luxury tax on payrolls the topic of conversation away from the bargaining table , though , centered on the tax and remarks made about it by tom hicks , the texas rangers' owner gene orza , the union s associate general counsel , characterized hicks s remarks as a good indication that what the owners want is not salary compression but salary depression it was a day after the players said they would walk out after games of aug 29 , and the owners had begun to turn up the rhetoric , which had been noticeably absent from the talks to get an agreement and avert the game s ninth work stoppage in nine negotiations , the two sides will have to reach an agreement on the tax on payrolls they are far apart on tax rates and the thresholds over which the tax would take effect management negotiators have denied that they want the threshold to serve as a payroll cap , but those who read or heard about hicks s comments believe they betrayed management s real aims every team in baseball that has any kind of business sense would try to manage its payroll to stay under that tax threshold , hicks told the dallas morning news there might be one or two that would n't , but that s a decision those teams have to make certainly , i can assure you , the texas rangers would n't be among them if this system is implemented , the texas rangers will be under the threshold a year and a half ago hicks gave alex rodriguez a 252 million contract , richest by far in baseball history and 100 million more than the next highest offer for him hicks s team also has the second highest payroll for luxury tax purposes , 1314 million , trailing only the yankees' 1712 if the owners' tax proposal were in place this season , a 375 percent tax for the portion of payroll over 102 million , the rangers would pay an 11 million tax i think a majority of owners , including me , would probably like to have even stronger cost containment than we 're talking about right now , hicks told the dallas newspaper he added i think a lot of owners would have a preference for a hard salary cap like football has that would probably be better for baseball , but that s not what we 're negotiating this time the owners' desire for a payroll cap produced the 199495 strike , the longest in pro sports history negotiators plan to take today off and resume bargaining tomorrow
renhui tian wept tears of happiness last year at kennedy international airport when he saw two of his sons for the first time since they were infants xiaoxian and xiaoqin , then 5 and 7 , were born in manhattan s chinatown but they were arriving from fujian , a rural province in southeastern china , because mr tian , in a practice common among illegal chinese immigrants , sent them there as infants to be raised by their grandparents as illegal immigrants who owed smugglers more than 40 , 000 , mr tian and his wife could not afford to take time off from sevendayaweek jobs in restaurants and garment factories to care for their sons or spend the 700 a month asked by chinatown s day care centers but the tian boys' reunion with their parents has been difficult , even though the boys are old enough to go to school indeed , children like the tian boys pose a significant challenge for new york city s public schools speaking only fujianese , a dialect that few teachers even chineselanguage bilingual teachers can understand , raised by doting but often illiterate grandparents who neglected their early schooling , sometimes sick with contagious diseases , the fujianese children frequently lag behind academically at schools , fujianese children are placed with other students in regular classes or bilingual classes taught in mandarin or cantonese since fujianese students understand none of these languages , they often keep quiet , talk among themselves in fujianese , or simply look lost fujianese is as different from cantonese or mandarin , the two languages that new york s bilingual teachers of chinese speak , as yiddish is from german the fujianese children in general have very poor academic backgrounds , said lily woo , principal of public school 130 on baxter street it s very hard for us to help them , because they speak only fujianese in fujian , most grandparents do not send their americanborn grandchildren to local schools , even if the children stay in fujian until they are 9 or 10 , said peter kwong , a professor of asianamerican studies at hunter college who has studied fujianese immigrants for many years their grandparents are very soft on them , said dr kwong , noting that the grandparents know the children will return to the united states the grandparents believe these kids , who are american citizens , have it made already they also think america s education is different why bother teaching them stuff in fujian \? as a result , he said , many fujianese children fail to grasp some of the basic concepts that other children have mastered by the time they enter elementary school , like the ability to count to 10 jeannie lau , a caseworker at lower east side family union who is herself a child of fujianese immigrants , said that after the children return to new york , when their parents want to discipline them , the fujianese kids' attitude in general is , 'who the heck are you \? you were never there , and all of a sudden you are giving me orders \? ' in addition , american schools are disorienting for these children ms woo said they get scared at school , they cry , and they do n't feel they can turn to anyone , not even their own parents the people who took care of them when they were little are gone in a way , the challenge posed to the board of education by the shifting waves of chinese immigrants reflects the fact that administrators are always one step behind immigration trends more fujianese children are returning to new york every year the enrollment trend at ps 184 on east broadway is similar to the other halfdozen schools in the chinatown area in 1998 , onefifth of all new students at ps 184 were categorized as fujianese in 1999 and 2000 , their number increased to onethird , and last year , it was half based on figures provided by principals , more than 1 , 000 fujianese students attend chinatown s elementary schools the board of education , which now supplies enough cantonesespeaking bilingual teachers two decades after large waves of cantonesespeaking children entered the city s public school system does not yet offer fujianese as an option on the survey forms it sends to parents about languages spoken at home mr tian laments that his sons' scores on tests in their kindergarten and firstgrade classes are in the 50 s and 60 s he also said that neither of the pair liked their cramped new home much , and that each cried for at least a month , asking for their grandparents they did n't know we are their parents , mr tian said , speaking mandarin they thought grandma and grandpa were mom and dad many parents seem at a loss about how to deal with children who are not entirely familiar to them just the other day , my son came home and lied to me , said mrs chen , whose 7yearold child returned from fujian last year and now attends ps 184 \( mrs chen would not give her first name because of her illegal status in america \) he told me he did n't have homework , but he actually did i wanted to hit him , but he said he would call acs and send me to jail , fumed the mother , referring to the administration for children s services calling acs , that s the first thing he learned here occasionally , fujianese children face problems that go beyond schooling some fujianese children return to new york sick with tuberculosis or hepatitis b , both endemic in rural china , where health care is inadequate the mom would come to me with her sick child and cry , saying she should never have sent the child back , said selina chan , the head nurse of the chinatown clinic of st vincent s manhattan hospital often , they are overweight or too skinny , because their grandparents did not enforce balanced diets after years of unremitting work , mr tian has his family together , almost he toiled 12 hours a day as a cook at chinese restaurants and his wife equally long hours as a seamstress they paid their last installment to the smuggler last year , 12 years after mr tian arrived , and later in the year , they sent for xiaoji , 4 , after his older brothers settled in but their oldest children , 13 and 14 , are still living in fujian with mr tian s parents mr tian crossed the border of southern china to cambodia , where he made it to thailand , almost 13 years ago he was caught by the thai police and beaten in jail , he said , but he eventually flew to the united states on a fake passport two years ago , mr tian successfully applied for political asylum in a new york court , claiming he feared prosecution under china s onechild policy mr tian , laid off from his job as a cook after sept 11 , is looking for ways to apply for governmentsubsidized housing sharing a 400squarefoot twobedroom apartment with another family in a tenement on east broadway , mr tian , his wife and their three sons sleep on a fullsize bunk bed the lower layer of the bed doubles as a desk for xiaoxian during the day mr tian s grueling life here has made him desperate for his children to succeed on a recent tuesday evening , mr tian went to the weekly parents' class at ps 184 , which teaches the chinese parents some basic english and a few american customs mr tian , who had never attended school , stared at the principal , confused , as the other parents hesitantly followed her to pronounce the word horse i want my sons to make it here , mr tian , 35 , said , smiling apologetically living as i do is too hard photos renhui tian , his wife and three sons sleep in a fullsize bunk bed they share a twobedroom apartment in chinatown with another family from left , xiaoji , mr tian , xiaoqin and xiaoxian two sons are still in china \( angel franco the new york times \) \( pg b4 \) renhui tian s sons , from left , xiaoxian , xiaoqin and xiaoji , came to new york last year from fujian , in china \( angel franco the new york times \) \( pg b1 \)
rome , feb 26 american and italian investigators demonstrated today that terrorists might have been able to make their way through more than a mile of tunnels to the american embassy here and place a chemical bomb in the water pipes starting from a manhole at the piazza della repubblica where a discarded ladder and pair of overalls recently aroused suspicions , the investigators made their way to a spot under the street in front of the diplomatic compound a city public works official said the investigators had no trouble reaching the place near the embassy where a suspicious hole , big enough for a person , was recently dug through a threefoot protective concrete cap on the utility tunnel outside the american embassy that tunnel is filled with water pipes as well as phone and electrical lines into the embassy , the city technician said it is not clear who dug into the utility tunnel or when the findings today add weight to a police theory that a group of moroccan men arrested here recently might have been planning an underground attack on the embassy the men were found with nine pounds of a potentially dangerous cyanide compound and a detailed map of the utility tunnels under the embassy the city official interviewed today said a chemical attack through either the water lines or the other pipes around the american embassy compound would have been difficult , but not impossible if you knew what you were doing the police had been wondering , given tight security around the embassy , how anyone could have gotten under the street to drill the hole into the embassy s utility tunnel we knew you could n't get in through a manhole on via veneto in front of the embassy , the official said , or you 'd be surrounded by police in three seconds but this morning , with the american experts , we did a test , starting one kilometer away , at the piazza della repubblica , and arrived at the embassy , right where the hole is the hole , which the official had inspected several times in recent days , could only have been dug by professionals , he said it measured about two feet across and more than a foot high , and created an uninterrupted passageway around the embassy , he said the last time he saw the concrete cap on the tunnel intact was on jan 26 he also said that , contrary to recent statements by embassy officials who have played down the threat , a chemical bomb placed in the tunnel on the other side of the newly chiseled hole could have sent poison gas or water into the embassy neither embassy officials nor the italian police were available for comment tonight but earlier in the day , one italian official close to the case also suggested that the threat to the embassy was far more serious than embassy officials and some other italian investigators had indicated adding to anxieties , a bomb exploded early this morning near the italian interior ministry , destroying several cars and smashing some shop windows the ministry in downtown rome is the headquarters for italy s national police and security services there were no injuries , and officials said they did not believe that the bomb , which exploded at 4 am and was apparently attached to a motor scooter , was the work of islamic or any other international terrorists similar incidents over last couple of years have been attributed to anarchists but in the context of recent events , this latest bombing was particularly unnerving police have not spoken on the record about the embassy case , and were initially furious that news of it had gotten out , saying the investigation had been compromised by the leaks embassy officials , meanwhile , have said they are taking the threat seriously but are not sure that any such plan could have been carried out the italian official who spoke today said that the suspects had not been linked to osama bin laden s terror network or any other terrorist group but he said the investigation , which he expected to go on for some time , was only beginning all nine men , who have denied knowledge of any plot , remain in custody they were arrested here over the last two weeks four were found with the cyanide compound , the maps and about 10 pounds of firecrackers that could have been used to ignite the compound the substance , potassium ferrocyanide , is not in itself dangerous and is commonly used by gardeners but scientists have said that if heated , it can emit hydrocyanic acid , which is highly toxic a judge has denied bail in the case , saying the men , who have been charged with subversive association , were working together to form one single group , to whom the poisonous substance belonged after the arrests , the police checked the tunnels around the embassy and discovered the hole in the concrete leading to the tunnel the concrete was poured as a security measure several years ago , specifically to block access to the pipes leading into the embassy , the city official said embassy officials said on monday that there were no water pipes in the tunnel , only electrical and phone wires but the city official , who has worked in the tunnels for years , said the embassy officials were mistaken on that point or , rather , they were technically correct in saying water lines in the tunnel do not go straight into the embassy , he said but they are the general water lines for the whole area , including the embassy he also said that because there is space around the protective wiring on the electrical and phone cables , fumes from a chemical bomb placed in the tunnel might theoretically have reached the embassy as well the city supervisor also disputed the suggestion by embassy officials that the hole might have been cut by workers for an innocuous purpose like passing tools back and forth if you wanted to put a hole there , you would need to apply to us for a permit , and there was none , he said photo a bomb exploded near italy s interior ministry in rome early yesterday destroying several cars and smashing windows no one was injured \( associated press \)
london the tourists on ischia , a small volcanic island northwest of capri in the bay of naples , tend to be elderly germans , there for mudbath treatments the austrian maestro herbert von karajan was a devotee and that would exhaust the island s claim to musical fame but for the existence of a fabulous exotic garden domain might be a better word that runs in terraces along a valley densely planted , and cooled by rock pools , waterfalls and fountains , it offers panoramic views that stretch from the extinct volcano \( or so everyone hopes \) out to the sea the garden is called la mortella \( the place of myrtles \) , and it s open to the public predominantly germans , who , knowing nothing of the history of the place , are undoubtedly dumbfounded by the english coronation music they hear filtering through the trees from a building called the tea house trudging on through sweltering heat , they find a small but beautifully appointed concert room , cut deep into a cliff face , and a small museum to the memory of the english composer william walton , whose remains are buried in the summit of the cliff above them walton s legacy has been slow to penetrate the consciousness of mainland europe but englishspeaking cultures are another matter , and any doubts about his enduring significance in british musical life have been swept aside by the interest in his 100th birthday , which fell in march there have been big centenary events at the south bank center , the barbican , the national film theater and westminster abbey here and on bbc radio \( a daylong tribute on easter sunday \) he was the most prominently featured composer in the bbc proms concerts , with major works presented in the first concert , in july , and the last , yesterday walton comes home , a festival throughout the north of england , begins on sept 28 and runs to middecember and four waltonrelated books have appeared in quick succession a biography , a volume of letters , a lifeinpictures and a handsome coffeetable tome about the garden in america the source of some of walton s largerscale orchestral commissions , like the violin concerto \( written for cleveland \) and the cello concerto \( for boston \) there has been no shortage of activity either and it continues on oct 18 and 19 with events at yale university , including a performance of facade , narrated by susana , walton s widow most of his manuscripts are now housed there at the beinecke rare book and manuscript library centenaries , though , are times for reappraisal and in britain , some have inevitably asked , why the fuss \? this was , they say , a minor master working on a local scale and overwhelmed by the greater genius of the younger benjamin britten , with which he could n't compete hence his retreat from england to a lazy exile in the bay of naples he was , they say , a conservative , a bygone , writing in a lateromantic language that was dead and buried long before he followed it to the grave in 1983 his work failed to develop , and how could it do so \? for he was not much more than a relic of the gentlemanamateur tradition in english music , largely selftaught and writing by the sweat of his brow without the technical facility , the sheer professionalism , of britten and the generations next in line there is a grain of truth in these complaints walton himself admitted in an interview that , by comparison with britten , the trouble is , i was n't properly trained it made the process of composition laborious , leaving him with a lifelong sense of insecurity walton s output might be described with the favorite english real estate broker s phrase , deceptively large though in fact rather small , it was given an appearance of size by the composer s habit of adapting and recycling his original ideas scarcely a major score escaped revision in the case of his most celebrated work , facade , which appeared in 1922 , he tampered with the content and instrumentation until the 1950 s and added one final tweak in 1977 some of these rewritings were simply for financial gain facade was popular , a money spinner , and it spun more money in its secondary lives as ballet score , orchestral suite , piano solo and duet other revisions were products of a selfdoubt that grew to crisis level halfway through walton s life the pattern of his creativity through more than 60 years suggests a forced flower blooming early , with most of his bestloved work completed before he was 33 , and fading fast to critics it suggests the less attractive image of a light that failed but even if it did fail \( and the odd late work of stature argues otherwise \) , it shone brilliantly enough to generate at least a halfdozen scores of genius , which were recognized as such almost immediately in the 1920 s and 30 s , walton was mentioned alongside bartok and stravinsky , commissioned by jascha heifetz , championed by george szell this was not a local talent to achieve such fame so early was the more remarkable given walton s background he was born in oldham , an industrial town near manchester that was famous for cotton mills and is now famous for race riots solid , northern , workingclass and none too lovely , it is the sort of town that these days would lend credibility to a composer harrison birtwistle and peter maxwell davies have made good use of their gritty northern origins but for someone born in 1902 into a more socially prescriptive world , it was less productive when people asked walton why he became a composer , he liked to say that it was to get away from oldham , and his wry smile hid a desperate truth that ruled his life this was a life spent on the run his escape from his origins was swift , and its details are legendary
raleigh , nc atheists , secularists and rationalists might want to visit a museum show in raleigh before deciding that there is no vengeful god who punishes the wicked with eternal suffering and rewards the righteous with heavenly bliss the north carolina museum of art is showing works by a littleknown painter who was born in 1888 , trained in new york and london as a portraitist , spent most of his life as an evangelical preacher , and then , in his 70 s , began producing astonishingly vivid works depicting the torments of hell and the rewards of heaven the emergence of this artist , mckendree robbins long , whose paintings have just come to public notice a quartercentury after his death , has sent a ripple of excitement through the community of scholars who study southern culture his work is made even more remarkable by a strain of sensuality , reflected in many depictions of voluptuous women , that apparently came from his lifelong guilt over a brief love affair with a mysterious lady who is now known only as the woman in red those of us in this field have learned to expect the unexpected , and he definitely is unexpected , said william ferris , a former chairman of the national endowment for the humanities , who has spent years as a folklorist in the south i think he s quite important , because he s so unusual the presbyterian calvinist culture he came out of generally frowns on visual art , and he is really almost unique in his effort to express the essence of that culture in paintings when you combine that with his very sensual depictions of large , wellendowed women , plus the power of his sermons , you come up with a figure who does n't fit into any of our established categories countless novels , short stories , plays , films and songs depict aspects of what is sometimes called the southern gothic culture and approach to life , including such themes as mystery , fantasy , hidden passions and the macabre perhaps no one , however , has depicted it on canvas as richly and disturbingly as long did he was a great character who could have come straight out of a flannery o'connor story , said david steel , a cocurator of the show some people are asking us 'why is your museum doing this \? is it really art \? ' but long tells you more about southern culture of a particular time than just about any other painter he had no truck with modern civilization , and he really thought the apocalypse was coming but at the same time , he knew human frailty all too well he felt the edge from both sides the picture that mr steel describes as long s masterpiece , called apocalyptic scene with philosophers and historical figures , recalls the work of breughel and embraces many of long s themes it is a sprawling panorama , but balanced and composed with a skill that reflects long s artistic training on the left side of the picture , naked figures , many of them female , fall headlong into the pit of hell , where devils wait to burn and flog them among those already being tormented are stalin , hitler and mao observing from the shore of this lake of fire , evidently contemplating their responsibility for the cataclysm , are a rogue s gallery of humanistic thinkers , among them marx , freud , descartes , nietzsche and einstein scantily clad women , one of whom looks like marlene dietrich in the blue angel , watch in horror as a skeleton points their way to the pit from a vantage point above , the painter himself watches , smiling and chatting with none other than dante , who also warned humanity about the perils that await sinners after death he was a paradox of wellheeled intellectualism and fistshaking , footstomping southern fundamentalism , brad thomas , a cocurator of the show , writes in the catalog his early training in the tradition of academic portraiture provided him the skill to realistically render anything he could imagine on canvas yet he would turn his back on many of the tenets of his academic training to forge a highly personal , even eccentric style that would express his fundamental beliefs about mankind s need for salvation and the pernicious influence of secular culture this catalog is the first published monograph about long , and the show is the first major retrospective of his work it will be on view through aug 25 , and then over the following 10 months it will travel to three other north carolina museums the north carolina museum of art will close the show with a seminar on aug 25 at which several authors and commentators will discuss long s relationship to southern literature , politics and culture long had an extraordinary and probably unique career he was born into a prominent family in statesville , nc , and after two years at davidson college he resolved to become a painter he enrolled in art courses at the university of virginia , won a scholarship to the art students league in new york and then another for two years of study in london portraits he made in 1912 show him perfecting his technique and seeking to emulate giants of the age like john singer sargent
tokyo , aug 12 with the temperature 96 degrees in the shade , veterans of this concrete jungle braced themselves recently as they opened a door to an apartment building roof but instead of confronting a wall of dry heat , they felt their faces cooled by moist air , carrying a light scent of soil and fresh grass tile by tile , workers were laying a new form of ultralight and ultracheap roof garden with a lowmaintenance variety of grass growing in four inches of vermiculite , a mineral substance often used in gardening , this carpet of cooling green weighed only 16 pounds per square foot if a roof is rated to take people , which most are , it can easily take a roof garden , takaharu yoshioka , environmental director of greenich garden , a landscape design company , said stepping onto the emerald lawn last year we did only 50 roof gardens so far this year we have already had 200 orders the realization that tokyo is becoming a vast heat island is behind the boom in roof gardens here , centuries of gradual climate change are telescoping into decades over the last century , tokyo temperatures have increased five times as fast as global warming , said takehiro mikami , a professor of climatology at tokyo metropolitan university while the world s average mean temperature has increased by one degree fahrenheit since 1900 , tokyo s has increased by 52 degrees the findings parallel recent research by nasa scientists using satellites to monitor mexico city , atlanta and dozens of other growing metropolises around the world they found that cities tend to have temperatures far warmer than the surrounding landscape , in many cases up to 10 degrees warmer often the heat changes the weather itself , causing more storms downwind of cities , the scientists found this month , during a twoweek heat wave , tokyo salarymen staggered down noonday sidewalks , their black suit jackets folded over their forearms women sprouted parasols to ward off the unrelenting sun heat stroke felled 16 members of a high school soccer team for the northern hemisphere , the first half of this year was the warmest in 143 years , britain s meteorological office announced on aug 1 in tokyo the most dramatic temperature changes have taken place when people notice it the least from midnight to 5 am , average tokyo temperatures have risen by 72 degrees over the last century in tokyo , a seaport in a traditionally temperate zone , weather experts define a tropical night as a night when thermometers never drop below 77 degrees fahrenheit a century ago the number of tropical nights was zero to five in a summer , said professor mikami now the number of such nights reaches 30 or 40 by 2010 it will increase to 50 or 60 with this summer s heat , tokyo and a northern suburb have received 18 smog alerts , onethird more than normal chiba , an eastern suburb , has received two smog warnings , more dangerous than an alert , the first such warnings in 17 years though it is of little concern to city dwellers battling august heat , winters are also milder , with night temperatures rarely dipping below freezing snow is increasingly rare none fell here last winter while scientists worry about climate change on a global scale , it is evident in tokyo today leaves used to start turning their colors in the end of november , said shinsuke hagiwara , chief researcher of national institute for nature study now they only start in middecember this spring , cherry blossoms came so early that when prime minister junichiro koizumi held the government s annual cherry blossom viewing party in april , there were no blossoms left a type of mosquito carrying dengue fever , usually found in warmer places , has expanded its range to 60 miles north of tokyo in the last three years , said mutsuo kobayashi , a medical entomologist palm trees and wild parakeets are increasingly common subtropical plants are taking the place of temperate plants here , mr hagiwara said referring to his institute s botanical reserve , he said palm trees started growing naturally in the forest in the mid1950 s compressing centuries of ecological change into decades could have disastrous consequences if something unexpected would occur , like a sudden cold year , mr hagiwara said , the newcomers would easily die out reflecting rising concern , the phrase heat island has entered japanese vocabulary city officials are wrestling with the concept of thermal pollution increasingly , modern tokyo is viewed as a huge , multifaceted radiator during the day the sun s heat is absorbed by acres of black asphalt , by car bodies , by black rooftops and by buildings made of concrete rather than the older , cooler materials of wood and brick at night these surfaces discharge heat , preventing the city from cooling at the same time , new earthquake mitigation techniques are allowing tokyo to go vertical , with new highrise buildings blocking cooling sea breezes as temperatures rise , residents respond by simply twisting the dials on now universal air conditioners , expelling even more hot air into the atmosphere
it is a rite of spring as perennially young as a seventeen cover model , yet it taps into a tradition that every jane austen heroine would have understood the search for a prom dress is one of those retail experiences that , at its best , defines one of life s transformations after all , the girlmeetsperfectgown scene is just as crucial to the fairy tale as the prince , and every high school girl looks for the dress that will , in an instant , turn her into the woman she hopes to become in pursuit of such transformations , a group of seniors from the bronx high school of science waited by the dressing room in bloomingdale s secondfloor formal gowns department one recent saturday overhead hung a glitterencrusted sign that said prom nights a disco ball threw off flecks of light the line the girls were part of snaked past the 25 percent off rack all the way through the motherofthebride section although the girls have been friends since ninth grade , shopping is not something they normally do together at bronx science , whose 679 seniors held their prom wednesday at tavern on the green , the overall look of girls is fairly serious there s just not much emphasis on clothes or makeup , said yoon ji kim , who lives in rego park , queens most girls do n't wear it at all so for a lot of people , the prom is a big deal it s the first time everyone will see them all gussied up mavis martin , from the kensington neighborhood of brooklyn , added you want something that s sexy , fitted , maybe with a bit of a trail at the back but not princessy that s very important her friend jeanie goto , a fencing team member from the upper west side who recently represented new york in the national shakespeare competition with a monologue from king john , sighed the trouble with coming to bloomingdale s , she complained , is that everyone comes here you know that out of our whole class , someone is going to have your same dress this actually happened to one of the girls i went to prom last year , and i had the same dress as another girl , said brandi stewart , who lives on the upper west side i felt really bad for her i was just a junior , so it was n't even my prom having the same dress that s always the nightmare finally , a dressing room attendant beckoned the group in they began trying on their choices , most of which carried price tags of 250 to 350 , hopping between dressing rooms for second and third and fourth opinions jeanie emerged wearing a pink dress with small feathery ribbons stitched all over it i like this , she said , but it s the same color as the one i wore last year mavis pirouetted in a red chiffon number with yellow flowers this is the tacky one , the sunday brunchy one , she said if this is the way it goes , i'm going to prom in jeans as the girls left the dressing room , the conversation turned to the question of whether to put any dresses on hold we need to put things on hold for parental approval , yoon ji explained it s also so we can pay for them none of us have credit cards usually , she said , there is little disagreement over a girl s choice of dress then she giggled unless it s really skanky katherine zoepf photos brandi stewart , girl on a quest at bloomingdale s , left , yoon ji kim , brandi stewart and mavis martin looked for the right look above , jeanie goto \( photographs by andrea mohin the new york times \)

we knew we had stepped into a time warp when our waitress at tivoli ristorante in norwalk asked if we had come for the 595 pasta dinner it was a thursday night and that s our pasta night , she said , quickly adding that we did not have to order the special which could be any pasta we desired , with a ubiquitous onesaucefitsall marinara sauce that includes salad , too tivoli is situated in a private club called sons of italy , which is up a steep hill off route 123 in the broad river section we had passed the signs for the club and for tivoli many times and finally decided to investigate on three nights a week the club is open to the public for dinner only or you can join the club , our waitress said you do n't have to be italian her friendliness was one of the pleasing aspects of this modest place tuning in to the short menu , there was pasta , pasta , everywhere in baked form in a choice of lasagne , manicotti or cannelloni at 1095 , or in the regular style with ziti , spaghetti , linguine or capellini , available with any of five different sauces \( pomodoro or marinara at 995 , bolognese or pesto at 1095 or clam sauce at 1295 \) baked manicotti was a nobrainer for me it brought back memories of a childhood favorite veal cacciatore was our other entree choice at 1595 it was near the top of tivoli s price range , surpassed only by the beef pizzaiola and the grilled sirloin at 1895 anticipating hefty portions \( after eyeing the huge pizzaiola platter at another table \) , we decided to share a starter of fried calamari at 695 , it was more than enough for two people with the platter of deepfried squid rings \( few legs \) came a soupbowlsize dish of marinara sauce as a dip the squid were piping hot and chewy not tough , but not really tender either help yourselves to salad , our waitress said and we did while the salad was fairly predictable canned black olives , cherry tomatoes , bacobits there were several additions wedges of mozzarella , chick peas and a mix of greens , not just iceberg a basket of italian bread slices , along with foil butter pats , awaited us on the table when we returned from the salad bar after our massive appetizer , we were prepared for the huge entree platters the manicotti three long tubes bulging with ricotta and covered generously with melted mozzarella and marinara sauce was hearty fare , tasty and satisfying no tastebud surprises , but we had not expected any veal cacciatore was another mountainous portion , a zesty mix of tender veal in chunky pieces mixed with tomatoes , mushrooms , onions and herbs , enveloped by a mildly seasoned tomato sauce desserts none of them made on the premises were displayed on racks in a refrigerator by the salad bar we were invited to peek before deciding there were only four choices , three variations of cheesecake and a chocolate mousse cake our chocolate mousse cake and plain cheesecake were sweettooth satisfying and filling , nothing more yet for a bill of 40 , before tax , tip or drinks , we had few complaints add 1 for a cup of coffee , cappuccino \( a mistake , it was flat , more like thin cocoa with a coffee flavor \) at 250 and a 10 bottle of la vendemmia pinot grigio , tax and tip , and we had a startlingly inexpensive meal not a great meal , to be sure , but on par with many of the italian restaurants that can be found in every neighborhood in the state and at twothirds the price tivoli offers plain , oldfashioned italian neighborhood family dining , the kind of place to take the children or grandchildren for a casual dinner the prices bring on as strong a rush of nostalgia as does the food tivoli ristorante 162 new canaan avenue , norwalk \( 203 \) 8490675 satisfactory atmosphere a large , impersonal room with posters of italy on knotty pine walls , brass colonialtype chandeliers , and tables covered with maroon cloths under glass a separate bar fencedin flagstone terrace with tables for outdoor dining in warm weather noise level comfortable service friendly and quick recommended dishes fried calamari , baked pastas , veal cacciatore price range dinner entrees 595 1895 credit cards most cards accepted hours dinner 5 30 pm9 pm thursday , 5 30 pm10 pm friday and saturday only reservations accepted wheelchair accessibility ground level for dining room , bar and restrooms
plays , and maybe comedies in particular , are delicate enough organisms that sometimes a production just a little bit out of sync is more painful than an outandout disaster such is the case with the off broadway revival of threecornered moon , an obscure but not unappealing period piece from 1933 whose balance of screwball comedy and earnest , depressionera philosophy fits well within the lovablyeccentricfamily tradition of american entertainment it is , however , a piece that requires , well , what s the appropriate buzz word \? chemistry will do and anyone who wonders why that s important would do well to visit the blue heron theater , where the play opened yesterday , because chemistry is what is conspicuously absent among the ensemble of actors put together by the keen company and the show s director , carl forsman the script is of the snappy , loopy , occasionally frenetic and even nonsensical sort , from the same comedy store as you ca n't take it with you , the man who came to dinner and the front page , all of which it predates , even if it does n't reach those heights but mostly lacking are the ingredients that the company needs to supply comic delivery that keeps dialogue ricocheting like a pinball , hyperbolic idiosyncrasies that somehow coalesce into credible characterizations , simple charm in a play that relies on timing and wit in its performances , dead spots are especially deadly , laugh lines that do n't get laughs become especially sore points the company , which is full of experienced actors , just seems to be defeated by this oldfashioned brand of material the play has an odd provenance its author , gertrude tonkonogy , was 24 and working as a stenographer for a theater producer when she wrote it , a response , according to the program notes , to the awful scripts she was reading in the office drawing on her large and evidently kooky family , she wrote the play in three weeks set in brooklyn , it concerns what happens to the large and kooky rimplegar clan , a batty mom and four selfinvolved adult children , when the family fortune goes down the tubes in the stock market crash among the four siblings , three are male , and the play s central figure , as you might expect , is their sister , elizabeth \( maggie lacey \) , an intelligent but moonily romantic young woman who is in love with an aspiring novelist named donald \( christopher duva \) , a man who encourages her to join him in renouncing earthly concerns and concentrate on supporting his art donald s rival for maggie s affections is alan stevens \( andrew mcginn \) , a doctor and pragmatic family friend who takes a room in the rimplegars' house maggie s move toward selfdiscipline and responsibility is the main plot in threecornered moon , and in one of many curious moments that suggest times have changed , alan wins her affection for good when he slaps her across the face to calm her down i do n't like hysterical women , he says sternly that s the earnest side of the play , but the author s preaching on the virtues of personal responsibility and the proper relations between the sexes takes place in the context of a family circus of the brothers , relentlessly competitive with and annoying to one another , the eldest , kenneth \( nick toren \) is the most significant character he s a harvard grad , working in a law office , and he has just taken the bar exam , which , if he passes , will help pull the family from its financial doldrums he s a prig , a bit of a dandy he s also hopelessly in love with a woman named kitty , with whom he is constantly arguing on the phone and who , when she finally makes an entrance in the second act proves to be a flouncing , busty blockhead , and as played by kathleen kaefer , a very funny one the brief sequence when she settles on the floor with a book is a wonderfully original bit of slapstick there is , unfortunately , all too little of that mr forsman and his cast are mostly very timid in their approach to the play s gags and physical energy none of the principals seem out there enough mikel sarah lambert plays the dotty mrs rimplegar in a vague ruth gordonish fashion , which , since gordon played elizabeth in the show s broadway incarnation , would be a reasonable homage if she could crank it up a little even dressed in a turban and a robe , she s not much of a presence mr toren does better , but he s a straight man here mr mcginn makes alan every bit the straitlaced fellow he s supposed to be , but he remains a bit of a drip what he does n't project is the inner life , the light alan keeps under a bushel that would explain elizabeth s attraction to him the most glaring difficulties among the cast , however , are those of ms lacey and mr duva , who simply do n't have a grip on the material mr duva s donald is not just selfcentered and overly sensitive he s whiney , spineless and without appeal and ms lacey is n't up to what is really a very difficult role , that of the selfpossessed , intelligent , witty young woman who is aware that something needs adjusting in her life it s the lighthearted aspect of the character that she has no chops for her line readings and body language strain for comic grace it s unfair to invoke katharine hepburn or rosalind russell , but ms lacey would do well to watch the philadelphia story or his girl friday to see what s required here but that s what is missing throughout the production in a telltale scene just before intermission , the initial panic over the family s financial ruin is acted out at the dinner table as behind the rimplegars and oblivious to them , donald is stringing cord for a mechanism that will serve to kill him and elizabeth , the fulfillment of their absurdly conceived suicide pact the scene ought to have the lunatic quality of the marx brothers , but it achieves the comic energy of the cleavers threecornered moon by gertrude tonkonogy directed by carl forsman stage

paris , may 6 moving quickly to capitalize on his landslide reelection victory on sunday , president jacques chirac of france selected a centerright prime minister , jeanpierre raffarin , today to restore his conservative base and lead his party into the crucial legislative elections next month mr chirac made the appointment after the socialist prime minister , lionel jospin , officially handed in his resignation today mr jospin said he would retire last month after being knocked out of the first round of the presidential vote by the surprising showing of the rightwing extremist jeanmarie le pen in choosing mr raffarin , mr chirac , who defeated mr le pen on sunday by the widest margin in french history , signaled that he had heard the anger of french voters at the parisbased government elite mr raffarin , 53 , an affable and littleknown former junior minister for small businesses , is not even a member of mr chirac s party , but a lowprofile senator and the head of a regional council in western france political analysts saw mr raffarin as a shrewd choice he is a man from a freemarket party , in touch with the grass roots and potentially capable of bringing back into the conservative fold many of the small entrepreneurs who had defected to mr le pen over fears of unemployment and crime with the presidential election over , mr chirac is now on tricky ground a broad coalition , from the left and right , had assembled behind him to show the world that france would have none of mr le pen s extreme views on immigration and the european union yet that support has already evaporated mr chirac now has only six weeks to persuade the french to give him a majority in the parliamentary election without it , he could face another period of cohabitation , when the president and prime minister are from different parties and often working at crosspurposes or even worse , in the unlikely event that mr le pen s party picks up enough seats , the assembly could end up divided into three rival blocks , setting off a constitutional crisis chirac s task now is very difficult , said jean d'omersson , a historian and columnist for le figaro he has just 30 days to prove that he can do what the people have made clear they want he must , at once , give them big changes in policy , act on crime and at the same time reassure them that they are safe and things are under control france is still in many ways reeling from the shock of having mr le pen in the final round of presidential elections the margin of mr chirac s victory may have helped ease the shame many felt at mr le pen s surprise entry into final round of voting on sunday but the problems that fueled mr le pen s popularity and the uncertainty of what comes next still loom large even the rightleaning daily le figaro tempered its glee at mr chirac s victory though the president of the republic yesterday got the vote of four out of five voters , its editorial said today , rarely has national cohesion seemed so weak , rarely has the future of the country seemed so uncertain france could hardly fail to notice that while mr le pen suffered a staggering loss , he still managed to increase his support between the first and the second rounds , by about one million votes in the end , about one in five french citizens cast their ballots for the 73yearold former paratrooper , whose campaign was anchored in attacks on immigration , corruption and the european union mr le pen has made clear he intends to fight hard to convert his popularity into seats in parliament for members of his national front party today , the party met in private and issued a statement urging voters who want to change things to stand behind the party clearly trying to build on mr le pen s success in painting himself as a champion of the everyman , the party said , more than ever , the national front is representative of the france that works , that suffers and that hopes the left continued today to try to pull itself together after the devastating blow of the firstround election , trying to consolidate its lists so as not to split the left vote in the parliamentary elections as for mr chirac , political analysts say that in coming weeks he must retool his image as a high roller who plays fast and loose with the rules and who has been tarnished by corruption accusations he has to convince people that he is a new man , said dominique moisi of the french institute for international relations he needs to tell the french , i understood you and he has to reinvent himself as a statesman and get to work mr chirac did not make any public appearances today , sending the secretary general of the elys e palace , dominique de villepin , to announce the appointment of mr raffarin , who is a member of the liberal democracy party , a centerright party that is close to mr chirac s rally of the republic party later , mr raffarin was seen entering the prime minister s headquarters with a highlevel police official at his side , suggesting that he was already at work forming a plan to deal with the rising crime rate mr raffarin told reporters that he would appoint his cabinet on tuesday , adding that he had not forgotten the unhappiness the french expressed in the firstround elections mr raffarin will serve for six weeks and then may continue in the post if mr chirac wins the parliamentary elections two polls have suggested that france s conservative parties would win the legislative elections next month , albeit by a small majority one poll by the csa institute said the right would win 295 seats and the left 258 another survey by the sofres institute indicated that the right would get 271 to 331 seats , while the left would get 232 to 272 seats both polls said mr le pen would capture only 1 to 3 seats despite the wide margin in the election on sunday , which was seen as a referendum on mr le pen s extreme views , the firstround voting showed tepid support for mr chirac in the next vote , if he fails to get a majority in the parliament , there are likely to be calls for a new french constitution the fifth republic was created nearly 50 years ago by charles de gaulle , who envisioned a president elected by the people , with a prime minister who worked at his will apparently mr de gaulle never foresaw what would happen if another party held the majority in parliament before the firstround voting , both the left and the right condemned the political cohabitation between mr chirac and mr jospin as unwieldy but the left is now in the awkward position of trying to reinstate it should that happen , mr moisi and others say , the country could find itself looking at a real movement to draw up a sixth republic photo president jacques chirac , right , with prime minister lionel jospin yesterday after mr jospin resigned \( reuters \) chart map adding it up votes gained despite losing by the largest margin in france s history , jeanmarie le pen gained

they may be the last people in america to have experienced welfare as we used to know it 2 , 400 connecticut families randomly assigned in 1996 to get public aid under old welfare rules , as a control group for one of the nation s most ambitious welfare reform experiments but during four years of economic boom , without any of the work requirements , time limits or extra subsidies used to push or lure their counterparts off public aid , 81 percent left welfare for jobs and at the end of the research just before the economy began to sour 72 percent were still off the rolls those results are among the more startling findings in an unusually rigorous welfare study released this week as congress begins debating the reauthorization of the 1996 federal welfare overhaul law the connecticut study did find that recipients assigned to the state s jobs first welfare reform program were more likely to leave welfare for work than those in the control group but the differences between the groups were modest 5 percent more jobs first participants took jobs at some point , and 9 percent fewer were on the rolls after four years the cost of those differences was 4 , 100 per person more in subsidies and services in jobs first the manpower demonstration research corporation , a nonpartisan research organization , conducted the evaluation of the jobs first program under a contract with the state state officials said the study results confirmed that connecticut s welfare reform program had succeeded in replacing a culture of welfare with a culture of employment but dan bloom , an author of the study , disagreed it shows that a lot of what we 've been talking about in the last few years would have happened without welfare reform , he said in the end , the similarities between the two groups were striking both sets of families remained poor , with low wages and high levels of hardship , like lacking money to buy food one small but statistically significant difference was particularly troubling 26 percent of jobs first participants became homeless in the study s third year a percentage point more than in the control group the connecticut study , which followed 4 , 800 parents on welfare mostly single mothers in new haven and manchester , is one of the first detailed evaluations of a state program with the three key features of the national welfare overhaul stricter work requirements , financial incentives and time limits patricia a wilsoncoker , commissioner of the connecticut department of social services , said the study only reinforced her belief in the state s welfaretowork efforts it shows that the message spilled into the control group , she said there was a real culture change that took place unless you were going to put somebody in a test tube , it would be difficult to insulate them the connecticut study echoes similar findings from earlier control groups around the country a recent national comparison of 11 welfare reform experiments held between 1991 and 1999 , in places as diverse as atlanta , detroit , portland , ore , and riverside , calif , found that over a fiveyear followup period , in the absence of any welfaretowork programs , about threequarters of welfare recipients in the control groups found jobs at some point , and in the end more than half had left the rolls few of the programs improved substantially on those rates , the federal study found some saved the government money on welfare , and many modestly added to the number of months when some people held jobs , increasing overall earnings but none made its enrollees better off financially in the long run , and several left the poorest participants significantly worse off , according to the national study , released by the united states department of health and human services in november that study , which focused on comparing welfare reform approaches , drew little attention to the high rates of work in the control groups most states disbanded such control groups by 1997 , when the national welfare overhaul went into effect connecticut s was one of the last mr bloom said the connecticut findings underscore concerns about how poor families will fare in a recession if they have exhausted their federal welfare benefits and lose their jobs our study largely ends where the recession starts , he said the connecticut program set one of the nation s shortest time limits on benefits 21 months and one of the most generous financial incentives to take a job recipients who went to work were generally allowed to keep their full welfare allotment in addition to their earnings the state hoped to increase the chance that they would find steady work it seemed to pay off , as 60 , 000 families left the rolls but the study indicates that much of the shrinkage would have taken place anyway moreover , because the new rules encouraged jobs first participants to keep collecting welfare in addition to their earnings , many exhausted their benefits quickly during the economic boom , welfare extensions were available to those making a goodfaith effort to comply with the rules but last year , the state toughened the rules to save money even before the changes , the study indicates , housing was a greater problem for jobs first participants by the third year , 355 percent of the jobs first participants were unable to pay the full rent or mortgage they owed , 42 percent more than in the control group nearly 10 percent 35 percent more than in the control group had moved in with friends or family and among the 4 , 800 study participants , the statistics on homelessness translated into 62 homeless families in jobs first , compared with 36 homeless families among the control group shelley geballe , an official with

washington , oct 17 the federal bureau of investigation paid 7 million to a former russian intelligence officer to smuggle out of moscow a secret kgb file that unmasked a veteran fbi agent as a spy for russia , according to a new book about the case although it had long been known that the fbi obtained the file from a russian source , it was not known how much the bureau spent to find the agent , robert p hanssen , or that the former kgb officer , whose name is not disclosed in the book , was secretly relocated to the united states the payment to the former kgb officer and other new details about the hanssen case are disclosed in spy , the inside story of how the fbi s robert hanssen betrayed america the book was written by david wise , an author of several espionage books , and will be published on oct 22 by random house asked to comment on the book , an fbi official said the bureau would not discuss the payment but other officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , confirmed the amount of the payment and the relocation of the former kgb officer to the united states mr hanssen , who held senior counterintelligence posts in his more than two decades at the bureau , pleaded guilty in july 2001 to spying for moscow under a plea agreement , he promised to cooperate with the authorities , and in return , the government agreed not to seek a death sentence for years before mr hanssen s arrest in february 2001 , the fbi and the central intelligence agency realized that someone in the american government was turning over vital secrets to the russians the investigation centered on brian kelley , a cia officer , who was cleared when mr hanssen was arrested mr wise s book is the first to identify mr kelley by name the cia sought unsuccessfully to keep mr kelley s name from being published but the mole was not mr kelley it was mr hanssen , who began a 22year secret life in 1979 , working for the gru , soviet military intelligence for the kgb , and later for its successor spy service in an early phase of espionage he betrayed one of the most important agents for the united states , gen dmitri polyakov of the gru general polyakov had been spying for the united states since the early 1960 s , but soon after mr hanssen told the russians of this , general polyakov was forced to retire and was later executed during his spying career , mr hanssen revealed to the kgb the existence of an eavesdropping tunnel built by the fbi and the national security agency under the soviet embassy in washington , and compromised dozens of fbi technical operations and surveillance techniques mr wise writes that in exchange for the money paid to the former kgb officer , the fbi received a suitcasesized trove of documents none of the documents identified mr hanssen by name , but the material referred to dates when the unknown spy mentioned promotions and assignment changes the documents , some on computer disks , said the spy had on at least two occasions used an offcolor quote attributed to gen george s patton one bureau analyst immediately associated the quote with mr hanssen , who had used the phrase in conversations at the bureau other pieces quickly fell into place the mole s career track matched mr hanssen s progress through the bureau and a tape recording included in the material , dated july 21 , 1986 , contained a telephone conversation between the mole and a kgb officer one voice was that of mr hanssen it remained unclear when the file , whose entries ended in 1991 , was taken out of the russian archives but mr wise writes that the russians quickly figured out who had stolen their hanssen file after his arrest by then the former official was out of moscow along with several relatives the former kgb official who supplied the file was pleased with the deal he had struck with the american government he was very satisfied with the financial arrangement , mr wise quoted neil gallagher , a former top fbi official , as saying

edward f stancik , who as chief investigator of the new york city school system over the last 12 years gained a reputation as a relentless some school officials said overzealous pursuer of corruption and misconduct , died yesterday in manhattan he was 47 the cause was not disclosed mr stancik , who was under care at new york university medical center , had chronic heart problems during his tenure , mr stancik helped bring about some important systemwide changes , including a state law that diminished the powers of local school boards , several of which he exposed as corrupt yet sometimes , cases that he publicized in dramatic news conferences later proved not as outrageous as he had made them out to be until mr stancik was appointed special commissioner of investigation for the city schools in 1990 , the board s own investigative division was the only check on corruption in the schools , and was considered too cozy with those it was supposed to keep honest in contrast , mr stancik operated independently of the board , rankling a succession of schools chancellors who sometimes accused him of overdramatizing cases to enhance his own reputation none , however , could force him out , since mr stancik could be removed only by the city s commissioner of investigation , who reports to the mayor mr stancik s office was created in 1990 as an outgrowth of the gill commission , which was appointed during the koch administration to investigate patronage , politics and corruption in the school system the commission concluded that the board s investigative arm was reminiscent of the keystone kops , persuading mayor david n dinkins to create the independent investigator s post during his 12year tenure , mr stancik released hundreds of scathing reports that accused everyone from teachers to custodians to community school board members of flouting the law in scandalous fashion he was especially relentless in uncovering sexual abuse of students , and some education officials complained that his headlinegrabbing expos s made the problem seem far more prevalent than it was last year , however , after several sexabuse complaints against teachers and administrators were widely publicized , schools chancellor harold o levy joined mr stancik in pressuring school officials to report cases that , in past years , might not have prompted any action in 1992 , mr stancik released a report detailing chronic financial abuses by custodians and the failure of the school system to stop them some custodians , he said , had created fake jobs for nonexistent assistants and then collected the salaries , and many spent most of their working hours at other jobs or otherwise away from work the report led to a state law that allowed stricter oversight of custodians in 1997 , after mr stancik released a stinging report on gangs , rudy crew , then the chancellor , bitterly accused mr stancik of producing exaggerated reports that unfairly damaged the reputation of the school system and its employees despite his contempt for mr stancik , dr crew used his investigations of corrupt local school boards to help persuade the state legislature to strip the boards of much of their hiring and firing powers in 1996 that change was considered one of the most significant in the school system in decades , as it sharply increased the chancellor s powers mr stancik s many reports on violence in schools helped bolster mayor rudolph w giuliani s argument that the division of schools safety , then run by the board of education , should be taken over by the city police department the board agreed to that change in 1998 mr stancik , who headed a staff of 60 , had the power to subpoena , take testimony under oath and arrest , but not to prosecute if he found evidence of criminal action , he turned it over to the appropriate district attorney for prosecution of 196 criminal arrests by mr stancik s office since it was created , 132 have led to guilty pleas and 8 to convictions twentythree cases are pending some of his investigations did not live up to their promise in 1999 , he accused 52 teachers , principals and other educators of helping students ratchet up scores on standardized tests in what was described as one of the biggest cheating scandals in american public schools but a year later , roughly half of those accused had been reinstated , either because the evidence was insufficient or such punishment was deemed unwarranted edward francis stancik was born on dec 2 , 1954 , in chicago , and grew up in a suburb he was an only child , whose mother died when he was 14 his father , a printer , helped put him through the university of illinois , where he majored in economics he went on to columbia law school , where he was managing editor of the law review after graduating from law school in 1979 , he worked for the manhattan district attorney , robert m morgenthau , for 11 years he rose to deputy chief of the rackets bureau , earning a reputation as a discerning administrator and a skillful trial lawyer mr stancik , who lived in tribeca , underwent openheart surgery in 1995 and again in 1997 , to replace damaged heart valves although he was intensely private about his health problems , his increasingly gaunt appearance made it clear that they continued to plague him mr stancik , who is survived by his father , edward , and stepmother , therese , often said that his outsider status was the best tool for illuminating and ending corruption that might otherwise be overlooked or even tolerated within the clannish school system there is a sort of culture at the board of education that is difficult to pierce , he said in an interview when trouble develops , the attitude should be 'let s get to the bottom of this' at the board of education , the attitude often is 'let s get our friends out of this' photo edward f stancik testified last year at a city council committee s hearing on sex abuse in

here in point guard city , the buzz is about the smaller guys who handle the ball is jason kidd accurate enough \? is stephon marbury fitting in \? can jason williams be a star in the pros \? in the town where every jaywalker is a point guard waiting to be discovered , the knicks have three point guards but not much buzz oh , the knicks did win a game wednesday night in toronto and last night they shocked marbury and the phoenix suns with a 9691 comeback victory in madison square garden but there is n't much longrange hope , even when they play a decent game this is not stephon marbury s problem he grew up in coney island and the knicks were always his team when he came into the garden with lincoln high in the public schools athletic league final , he was home now he is with his third pro team , and he plays the garden only once a year last night he ran his team to a 19point lead , but he was also handling the ball when they frittered it all away we ran out of gas , said the phoenix coach , scott skiles that was not exactly praise but nevertheless a nicer assessment than don chaney made monday after the knicks lost by 43 chaney said his team quit we got relaxed , marbury said last night point guards always try to keep the home team from getting back into a game marbury has seen too many games in the world s most famous arena in which the knicks \( and sometimes st john s university \) have hustled and pressed and even hacked their way back on his onceayear homecoming , marbury had it happen to him they started to get rolling was all he could say the suns have now won 21 of 42 games since the big trade that exchanged kidd for marbury the nets , meanwhile , have won 29 of 42 after their 10398 victory at houston marbury knows people are doing the math i do n't know what would have happened , marbury said , meaning if the trade had not been made things happen for a reason when he played across the river , marbury had a hard time hiding his smirks and shrugs and sighs when his mates seemed unable to keep up with him now the nets are in first place with kidd tossing them alleyoop passes jason kidd is a great point guard , marbury said he does n't need to score that much because he is a great passer he praised the nets' head coach , byron scott , for blending the players and he praised the assistant , eddie jordan , for running the offense and marbury added , with no edge at all , that keith van horn , kenyon martin and kerry kittles were all healthy marbury has n't been to the playoffs since his first two springs in minnesota in 1997 and 1998 he said he was still blending in with his phoenix teammates it takes a while for a point guard , he said you know somebody for six months but you 're still learning things about him for all that , marbury s current team has a better shot than the team of his childhood why would i care \? he asked , politely the knicks are caught in a morass of guaranteed contracts , bad chemistry on the court , managerial mistakes and inept ownership by the dolans \( channel 2 still flutters on my home cablevision , by the way \) right now , mark jackson still has eyes behind his head like a true new york point guard , but has always been in trouble against speed there is reason to think the knicks' best hope is winning the draft lottery the way they did with patrick ewing a generation ago then they could go after jason williams , the point guard from duke and new jersey , who is surely turning professional he s the best player in college , marbury said it s not even fair it will be easy for him he s very well coached williams has had three years under mike krzyzewski , whereas marbury had only one year at georgia tech under bobby cremins i was n't as strong as he is , marbury said he s had three years of college ball he s very aggressive none of this is marbury s business he plays in phoenix he took advantage of a day in town to visit his daughter , stephanie , in brooklyn yesterday , and his maturing face took on a paternal smile when he talked about her she s in the first grade and she made the honor roll , he said he wants to make the honor roll , also known as the playoffs he has a better chance out in the desert , coming home only once a season to point guard city photo stephon marbury \( barton silverman \)
two paintings by j m w turner , britain s greatest romantic landscape artist , have been returned to the tate gallery in london eight years after they were stolen from an exhibition in germany the works , shade and darkness the evening of the deluge and light and color \( goethe s theory \) the morning after the deluge were stolen on july 28 , 1994 from the schirn kunsthalle in frankfurt a third stolen painting , nebelschwaden , by caspar david friedrich , on loan from the kunsthalle in hamburg , has still not been recovered the tate disclosed that shade and darkness was actually found in germany two years ago , but its discovery was kept secret while german and british authorities continued their investigation for fear that publicity would jeopardize efforts to find the second turner light and color was recovered on monday , and two days later both works were returned to london sir nicholas serota , director of the tate , said yesterday that both turners were in very good condition , with no significant damage , although they had been removed from their frames sandy nairne , the tate s former director of programs , and roy perry , its head of conservation , have both seen the paintings , and both men have said they are genuine we are absolutely delighted with this outcome , sir nicholas said what a christmas present officials of the financially strapped museum have reason to be doubly delighted , because under the terms of the insurance settlement and subsequent negotiations , the turners have brought in a muchneeded infusion of cash the paintings will go on view at the tate on jan 8 , after the police complete a series of forensic tests four men were arrested in 1995 and convicted in germany four years later tate officials said yesterday that details of the investigation would remain secret in hopes of tracking the missing friedrich the two turners , both about 31 inches wide and painted toward the end of the artist s life , when he tended to approach his subject matter more abstractly , are based on the biblical description of the flood turner created them partly as a retort to goethe s theory of color , which he read in charles eastlake s translation when shade and darkness was first shown at the royal academy in london in 1843 , the times of london referred to it as a ridiculous daub now both paintings are thought to be among the most significant works of the artist s final decade they are amazing pictures , sir nicholas said both are intimately connected with goethe s color theories , showing turner at the forefront of european intellectual inquiry the turners had been on display as part of an exhibition called goethe and the visual arts a condition of the loan called for insuring each painting for about 192 million the insurers paid the tate the full 385 million under the settlement , title passed to the insurers , though the tate had first option to repurchase them if they were recovered when the paintings had not been by found by 1998 , however , the tate s trustees struck a deal to buy back title to the paintings for 128 million the rest was placed in a special bank account recently the fund made a loan of 112 million to the tate enabling it to purchase its main storage facility in the southwark section of london , not far from the tate modern at a time when cutbacks in government funding have driven museum officials to seek money from private sources , tate officials were careful to say that none of the remaining funds were used for the capital costs of creating the twoyearold tate modern or for tate britain , which last year completed a 24 million renovation and expansion the remaining money is now freed up , at a time when the tate is leading a campaign to raise the 16 million needed to stop the sale of omai , sir joshua reynolds s portrait of the first south sea islander to visit britain , to a collector in ireland but sir nicholas said yesterday that he would be surprised if the trustees would want to spend the money for just one work of art it s too early to say what we 'll do with it , sir nicholas said it will probably be used to set up an endowment for the care and strengthening of the collection
lake grove , ny barry schlachtus , an optometrist in the smith haven mall here , can correct your myopia and set you up with a nice pair of glasses but he has no eye for art mr schlachtus has worked at the sterling optical shop for about 10 years , taking his lunch break in the food court more often than not but he had no idea why it was called the calder court and he never looked twice at the brightly painted sheetmetal sculpture on three spindly legs that soared nearly 26 feet toward the skylight i never thought that had any value at all , said mr schlachtus , told the contraption had recently been auctioned by sotheby s for 1 , 765 , 750 it is gone now , and with it the last vestige of a most unusual moment in time , when a marriage was made between high art and low commerce , between downtown whereit sat and suburban nowheresville , and the matchmaker was none other than the girl of the year a new indoor shopping mall anywhere was still a big deal in 1969 , and the smith haven mall was one of the nation s biggest when it opened on a 102acre former potato patch in this eastern long island village the developer was the n k winston corporation and an executive there , leonard holzer , happened to be married to one jane holzer better known , then and forevermore , as baby jane holzer , the socialiteacolyte of andy warhol , lionmaned star of his underground films , fixture at his factory ms holzer , whom tom wolfe had immortalized as the girl of the year in 1964 , prevailed upon her husband to set aside 350 , 000 in the mall s budget to commission sculptures and paintings by eight artists , including larry rivers , jim dine and robert grosvenor the centerpiece was to be a standing mobile by alexander calder my grandfather wanted to make a fountain , said alexander s c rower , director of the calder foundation and grandson of the artist , who died in 1976 but she had the idea of a classical , expected calder mobile she did n't want a fountain , she wanted a calder she became very frustrated baby jane got her way ms holzer , on a visit to calder s studio in france , pointed to a small piece and asked that it be the model for a much larger one calder obliged and the resulting work a tall , curved , pointed tripod base , at the tip of which balances an arm , from one end of which dangle triangles and disks was installed in a pool in the central crossing of the xshaped , onestory mall calder called it janey waney like one of warhol s happenings , however , the mallasmuseum concept did n't last it is unclear where or when the rest of ms holzer s commissions went , but the calder was removed from the central pool in 1972 , according to newsday , its moving parts packed away and soon lost for years afterward , the base of the calder sat outside in the parking lot , badly bent , its paint peeling like the mall itself , the calder deteriorated until 1986 , when a new owner finally got around to renovating the property some detective work turned up the plans for the sculpture then , at a blacktie gala marking the mall s facelift , a rebuilt janey waney was unveiled at the center of a spanking new food court ms holzer , who now sells real estate , remains scornful of those who mistreated the calder but she said its post1986 milieu a sea of chairs and tables ringed by sbarro pizza , nathan s hot dogs and carvel ice cream was as fine a place as any for it , and in keeping with her initial idea bringing art to the masses maybe while somebody was chewing on a pizza , she said , they might 've looked up and said , 'you know , there might be something here' maybe somebody did but a sampling of the masses the other day suggested they remained largely unmoved roberta luniewski speculated that she 'd never noticed the calder because she would never have expected to find something of such value in such a faded surrounding in roosevelt field , maybe , said lorraine mancuso , nodding but not here then there are those who are simply out of art s reach that little stupid thing \? said chris hurley , a manager at sbarro s i thought it was a weather vane i did n't like it , said ever jurado , behind the counter next to mr hurley i never understood it and one day i was walking and i hit my head on it after that , i liked it less than before
nancy temple must be surprised to discover that by giving her employer routine legal advice she made it guilty of a felony the jury that found arthur andersen guilty of obstructing the securities and exchange commission s investigation into the enron collapse was not persuaded by the firm s wholesale document destruction instead jurors say they based their verdict on an email message that ms temple , an andersen lawyer , wrote last october , in which she advised her client not to put something in writing the kind of advice lawyers give clients all the time so unremarkable was ms temple s message that none of the trial lawyers seem to have paid much attention to it even congress , by giving lawyers special protection when they advise clients , has explicitly recognized the difference between legal advice and obstruction the government charged andersen under the federal law that makes it a crime if a person corruptly persuades another person to alter documents to make them unavailable at an official proceeding at trial , the government focused on memos from ms temple and others that told andersen employees to comply with the company s documentretention policies the government claimed that these instructions were coded signals to begin destroying documents related to andersen s work for enron , which was then facing an imminent sec investigation the government had a strong case because huge amounts of enronrelated documents were shredded soon afterward anyone at andersen , including its lawyers , who encouraged others to destroy existing documents in order to impede the sec s investigation would be guilty of obstruction , and andersen would also be guilty as that person s employer but the jury was unimpressed with the government s theory and came up with its own in an email message to david duncan , an andersen partner , last october , ms temple suggested changes to a draft memo that mr duncan was writing and had circulated for comment the draft recounted his advice to an enron official that a forthcoming enron press release should not describe certain losses as nonrecurring because the term could be misunderstood \( enron ignored mr duncan s advice and issued its press release with the nonrecurring language \) ms temple s message said the draft memo should omit references to andersen s legal group and to her in order to protect the attorneyclient privilege and reduce the chances that she would have to be a witness nothing wrong with that lawyers must protect attorneyclient privilege and generally avoid becoming witnesses second , ms temple said she would consult with other andersen lawyers to see whether we should do anything more to protect ourselves from securitieslaw liability nothing wrong with that , either consulting and protecting is what lawyers are supposed to do last , ms temple recommended deleting some language that might suggest we have concluded the release is misleading this is the sentence that finally sank the company of course do n't put it in writing is advice lawyers give every day to protect clients from creating documents that may be used , or often misused , to their detriment whatever the wisdom of ms temple s advice , it was a kind that all lawyers will recognize as standard lawyers can be as valuable for what they edit out of a document as for what they put in indeed , a provision in the very law that the government used to prosecute andersen states that the obstruction statutes do not prohibit or punish the providing of lawful , bona fide , legal representation services in connection with an anticipated proceeding citing this provision last year , the federal appeals court in atlanta held that it provides a complete defense because a lawyer giving bona fide legal representation cannot have the improper purpose necessary to prove obstruction of justice nancy temple s email message was not a crime she was giving bona fide legal advice to a client who was writing a standard file memo , the kind of advice lawyers routinely give that undermines the basis for andersen s conviction the case against andersen was worth prosecuting , but the jury s flawed theory gives the government a victory that is hard to accept
washington , oct 15 all but one of this area s local television stations broke into their regular programming today to broadcast yet another sniper news conference by chief charles a moose of the montgomery county police the problem was , there was no news that did not stop the stations from bumping the daytime soaps and carrying chief moose live for most if not all of a desultory 40 minutes at the microphones but it did prompt some analysts to question the nature of news at a time when the public appetite seems insatiable for information about the sniper who has killed nine people in 14 days steven d hammel , vice president for news for wjlatv , the local abc affiliate , defended the decision to broadcast as much information about the sniper as possible people are trying to hang on to every word that is being discussed on this topic because there is a considerable amount of concern , mr hammel said and for some people , it s not the worst thing in the world to have nothing earthshattering said david roberts , vice president for news at wusa , the local cbs affiliate , agreed , saying the impact of this story is extremely strong the reason is , when you have random killings , you have no idea what might happen next as a result , news anchors , local and national , have descended on the encampment at police headquarters in rockville , md , where the multiagency task force is based today , there were 18 satellite trucks , 20 news tents , two power generators , 42 lighting rigs and wires crisscrossing in every direction the sniper story led the broadcast networks' evening newscasts tonight all of the cable news networks have bumped their blanket coverage of the war dance with iraq the fox news cable channel , for one , has moved some of its bestknown correspondents geraldo rivera , greta van susteren , shepard smith to the scene for live coverage of the spree connie chung anchored her cnn program tonight from washington instead of new york on friday night , on the record with ms van susteren drew an average audience of 13 million people at 10 pm by reporting on the sniper case , far larger than the audience of 859 , 000 for newsnight with aaron brown on cnn , which , after an initial nod to the story , went on to cover the california governor s race and the 40th anniversary of the cuban missile crisis on monday night , mr brown devoted almost his entire program to the sniper and drew an audience of about 17 million people nielsen media research data showed that he briefly lost some viewers when he switched from sniper coverage for five minutes to report on the terrorist attack in bali i think viewers wanted to know everything we knew , mr brown said if it was repetitive , it was ok almost alone in bucking the tide was wrc , the nbc affiliate here , which skipped the chief s briefing at 1 pm today and stayed with days of our lives robert long , vice president of news and operations , said , we had no reason to think any news was going to come out of it , and none did tom rosenstiel , director of project for excellence in journalism , a research group on news standards , said , the amount of new information so trails behind the demand for new information that you get this hollow , repetitive nothingnew kind of coverage but it s a tough call to say we should not be on the air because we have nothing new to say photo television journalists held up for their cameras photographs of the latest shooting victim , linda franklin \( vincent laforet the new york times \)
the creditors of global crossing have reached a deal with two asian companies interested in acquiring its assets , with the accord expected to open the way for more bidders the agreement , reached over the weekend after more than a month of negotiations , was submitted yesterday to judge robert gerber of the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york judge gerber approved the deal without requesting any changes global crossing , which is in bankruptcy proceedings , could now be auctioned by early july the deal makes a liquidation of global crossing s assets more remote and eases concern over that possibility among employees and some creditors hutchison whampoa of hong kong and singapore technologies telemedia ltd have until may 21 to turn their letter of intent to buy global crossing , submitted as part of the bankruptcy filing in late january , into a definitive agreement to acquire the company hutchison and st telemedia , a unit of singapore technologies , also agreed to lower their breakup fee to 30 million from 40 million if they reach a formal agreement to buy global crossing and that deal is then thwarted by a rival bid the termination fee was at the heart of a dispute between the asian companies and creditors we 're quite pleased with the results of this deal , edward weisfelner , a spokesman for the creditors , said in an interview yesterday global crossing s bankruptcy advisers have approached some 40 companies that have shown interest in bidding for global crossing s assets , which include undersea and transcontinental fiber optic cables and ships used to lay cable along ocean floors still , none of these companies have submitted a formal letter of intent needed to begin the process of preparing a concrete bid for global crossing hutchison and st telemedia also agreed to extend the bidding period to 180 days , potentially making it easier for rival offers to their 750 million bid to materialize or for a standalone restructuring plan to be put together under the deal approved yesterday , hutchison and st telemedia , still stand to walk away with 5 million to cover their expenses even if they do not submit a formal offer for global crossing this would be separate from the breakup fee the companies could collect another 5 million if they do reach a deal but that offer is thwarted by a rival bidder
if new jersey is serious about eradicating racial profiling , the legislature must abolish consent searches last year , the state senate judiciary committee investigation into racial profiling revealed that minority drivers were subjected to a disproportionately high number of cases in which police officers asked permission to search cars moreover , these consent searches were less likely to result in the seizure of contraband than stops in which officers felt there was cause to make searches , according to the testimony of john farmer , then the attorney general notwithstanding the glare of public scrutiny and presumably the best intentions of the police , the most recent statistics have once again confirmed that people of color are twice as likely as caucasian drivers to be pulled over and searched by state troopers on the new jersey turnpike contrary to popular belief , a law banning consent searches will not unduly limit the ability of the police to patrol our roadways data from the state police independent monitors reported that 80 percent of consent searches revealed no incriminating evidence of wrongdoing , confirming that effective law enforcement does not require such action a decision last month by the state supreme court limiting consent searches to times when police officers have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity , further underlined the fact that the practice serves little law enforcement purpose , disproportionately targets minority drivers and yields little evidence of wrongdoing abolishing consent searches will not impair the ability of law enforcement officers to protect themselves in the course of duty when faced with a reasonable threat to their safety and wellbeing , police officers are justified in investigating further , including performing a patdown or frisk in such a situation , there is no need to request consent for a search similarly , the ability of law enforcement officers to protect society and investigate terrorism and crime would not be impaired by the prohibition of consent searches since sept 11 , there has been an increased willingness by citizens to sacrifice certain personal liberties , and convenience when necessary , for the sake of increased security i join in that sentiment however , consent searches are not an effective or productive tool in this endeavor the abolition of consent searches will not affect the ability to conduct roadside vehicle stops , to put up roadblocks , checkpoints and other public safety measures again , where sufficient cause exists , law enforcement is justified in conducting a thorough investigation some argue that no change in the laws is necessary because drivers can simply deny a police officer access to their vehicles while this is theoretically true , the reality is that when requested to by a law enforcement officer , motorists overwhelmingly consent to a search , either because of ignorance of their right to refuse , inherent respect for law enforcement or intimidation this is supported by data from other states like ohio and maryland , where evidence suggests that drivers do not fully understand that they may refuse to grant consent in new jersey , the state police independent monitor reported that between may and october of 2001 , 95 percent of detained motorists agreed to consent searches at a minimum , this creates a tense environment between the police and citizens in addition it creates a class of citizens who unknowingly sacrifice their own civil liberties members of the law enforcement community will agree that society has a right to determine how it is to be policed none of us would consent to warrantless searches of our homes or offices why should we be subjected to such searches in our motor vehicles \? legislation banning consent searches is the right thing for new jersey my proposal , cosponsored by 29 members of the assembly , would prohibit motor vehicle searches without probable cause a companion bill has been introduced in the state senate these measures will prevent abuse and protect our civil liberties and they will not hamper law enforcement the events of sept 11 served as a reminder of the efforts of everyday heroes who wear a police uniform , and eased the sense of divisiveness created by racial profiling as shown by the recent statistics , however , racial profiling is still occurring let us take swift and definitive action in eradicating the potential for division among us while sacrificing little drawing \( tom bloom \)
thanks to israeli and palestinian intransigence , secretary of state colin powell headed home yesterday with almost nothing tangible to show for his 10day exercise in middle eastern diplomacy president bush now faces not only the prospect of continued bloodshed in the region , but also diminished american clout rarely have washington s calls for restraint been so rudely rebuffed by israeli and palestinian leaders the simple truth is that both prime minister ariel sharon and yasir arafat , the palestinian leader , brushed off the american effort to end the violence as secretary powell dryly put it , ceasefire is not a relevant term at the moment mr sharon s new promise to withdraw israeli troops from most palestinian areas within a week was late and inadequate mr bush asked him to pull back immediately more than a week ago , as mr powell was beginning his mission , a time when israeli cooperation would have been most helpful by dragging the fighting out , and vowing to conduct future military operations in palestinian communities as they see fit , israeli leaders make talk of a truce virtually meaningless the shortterm security gains israel has realized with its military sweep through the west bank will not eradicate the threat of more suicide bombings and its actions have hurt its political cause , hardening palestinian anger at the occupation of the west bank and reinforcing animosity toward israel throughout the arab world israel s theory that it is waging a common war against terrorism with america does not hold up when its tanks and bulldozers demolish palestinian neighborhoods secretary powell got equally little help from the palestinians and their arab benefactors aside from a condemnation of suicide attacks by mr arafat , which means little if he and other palestinian leaders fail to act , there was no sign that the palestinians are ready to end the violence and move back to peace talks arab leaders , who could lean on the palestinian leadership to curb the bombings , greeted mr powell with polite but empty gestures of support it is not obvious where the peace track goes from this low point george tenet , the director of central intelligence , may travel to the middle east soon in hopes of restarting the talks between israeli and palestinian security forces that he led last year mr tenet s work produced a plan for cooperative steps that , in theory , could reduce the violence and open the way to renewed political discussions there is also talk , recently supported by mr sharon , of convening an internal peace conference on the middle east none of these ideas are likely to go very far as long as israeli forces maintain a stranglehold on palestinian communities in the west bank and palestinian bombers are dispatched on their homicidal missions by terror groups like hamas and al aksa martyrs brigades the bush administration bears some responsibility for this depressing state of affairs mr sharon and mr arafat may be improbable partners for peacemaking , but the administration let the violence grow into a conflagration before it intervened forcefully by then even american influence was no match for the anger and bloodshed american power has not been enhanced by the spectacle of mr sharon brazenly ignoring mr bush s call for an immediate withdrawal we would like nothing more than to affirm mr bush s declaration yesterday that secretary powell made progress toward peace , but right now we do n't see much reason for optimism
the seattle mariners have 26 victories this season , but none of them include their local ratings triumphs in prime time over dramas and comedies like west wing , frasier \( the seattle radio shrink who would not know where safeco field is \) and survivor playing in a popular new ballpark before a wellheeled populace and featuring a group of likable players that includes the hitter known as ichiro , the mariners are the toprated team in major league baseball , far higher than the yankees , mets , dodgers or cubs their 157 cable rating on fox sports northwest is 69 percent better than the 93 rating for the no 2 team , the cleveland indians the city stops for a game , said tracy dolgin , president of fox sports net , which includes fox sports northwest among its 21 regional affiliates the only equivalent is the packers in green bay remarkably , although the seattle market is less than onequarter the size of new york , mariners games are drawing more households a game than the mets or yankees the mariners are , in essence , a daily reality series starring lou piniella , as the wise former hellraiser from tampa , fla ichiro suzuki , as the mysterious , lovable superstar hitter whose utterances in japanese are examined for their profundity and ruben sierra as an odysseuslike character , returned from his travels with his batting skills restored the mariners are as real as mtv s osbournes they live at safeco field , which is about the same size as the house ozzy et famille inhabit in beverly hills , calif the mariners deftly wield bats that are swung ozzy once ate bats that fly we used to get pretty good ratings when people tuned in to see how badly they could screw up , said dave niehaus , who has called nearly all mariners games on radio or television since their creation in 1977 the mariners' ratings potency was on vivid display last tuesday , when they lost to toronto , 41 the game rated a 161 \( or 265 , 204 households \) the broadcast network program closest to it , frasier , produced a 136 on the local nbc station last wednesday , the mariners rallied in the bottom of the 10th inning to beat the blue jays , 54 the game generated a 191 rating \( which equals 314 , 950 households \) nbc s west wing , its closest pursuer , was 68 percent behind , with an 116 locally on that night in the new york metropolitan area , the giantsmets game on the msg network received a 21 rating , or 154 , 782 households , which was dwarfed in its time period by a 162 for west wing , and a 169 for law order on the local nbc station one of the highestrated mariners games of this season , on april 17 against oakland , produced a 192 locally the no 2 program , law order , drew a meager 96 each seattle market rating point equals 16 , 472 cable households regardless of the time the mariners play , they invariably win their time slot when they played the yankees in new york on may 5 a 10 am starting time in the pacific time zone the game chalked up a 172 fox sport northwest is paying dearly to carry the mariners a new deal that began last season paid the team 37 million , one of the steepest payments in baseball the previous year , the fee was 18 million the cable channel carries 107 games a broadcast channel , kirotv , is showing 35 at least a good thing happened when we paid this , dolgin said they invested it in the club exactly why the mariners are such a dominant television attraction is not a feat of magic , merely of alchemy the team , except for losing years in 1998 and 1999 , has been improving , enough to weather losing randy johnson , ken griffey jr and alex rodriguez and it got well in time for the opening of safeco field in mid1999 , then seemed to be touched by fairy dust when suzuki joined the team last season suzuki s stellar rookie season was the main engine for the 59 percent rise in last season s ratings there s a huge japaneseamerican population here , said mark shuken , general manager of fox sports northwest , which sold a package of home games to japan s nhk network because of suzuki and is working on a deal to beam games to hawaii the team does not break out the demographics of its japanese , japaneseamerican or asianamerican fan base about half of its fans come from outside king county , where seattle is located and where 10 percent of the population is asian we work with japanese travel companies now , howard lincoln , the chairman of the mariners , said until this started , when the typical japanese tourist thought of going to the us , it was san francisco or los angeles now , we 're getting a huge number of japanese tourists , and the reason is the seattle broadcasts and , the mariners have become the baseball team of the northwest , with games also seen in portland , ore , and vancouver , british columbia they have no baseball competition to the north , and nothing to the east for 500 miles , rick burton , the director of the warsaw sports management center at the university of oregon , said and there s no team to the south until you get to san francisco their appeal has a really wide circle but even within its local circle , the mariners have the advantage of being in a less cluttered market than new york , which has one of the wealthiest populations in the country with the seahawks and supersonics , there are only three major league teams in seattle but the market is strongly collegiate with the washington huskies and washington state cougars it s been huskies town , not a seahawks town , rodney fort , an economics professor at washington state , in pullman , said when you go to husky stadium , you see that they expect the rose bowl but now , with the mariners' renown surpassing anything the entertainer danny kaye and his partners could have envisioned when they acquired the expansion franchise in 1976 , lincoln said , the mariners are the most popular team in the region because we play every day bigger than the huskies' football team , which won the 2001 rose bowl lincoln could be partly right compare the mariners' 157 average to some of last year s huskies games on abc the local rating when the huskies played michigan last sept 8 was a 147 the oct 13 game at ucla rated a mere 71 while a nov 17 washingtonwashington state game matchup produced a 197 seattle is a wonderfully supportive sports town , gary barta , the senior associate athletic director at washington , said given their success , it s no surprise the mariners are getting the support they 're getting and that support , especially on television , would be the envy of george steinbrenner , the principal owner of the yankees on his new yes network still without a deal with cablevision and its three million households the games are getting a 22 rating , or 160 , 623 homes on that score , the mariners own the yankees photos the announcers dave niehaus , left , and ron fairly are part of baseball s toprated cable broadcasts \( otto greule getty images \)

sometime between the stage debut of john osborne s look back in anger and the arrival seven years later of the rolling stones at the crawdaddy club in the richmond section of london in 1963 , mary quant , the daughter of british schoolteachers , married alexander plunket greene , an art school classmate who was ecumenical in his interests precisely when their union was legitimized or even vaguely when ms quant could not recollect during a visit to new york a few weeks ago do you remember \? she asked , turning to her assistant on the fourth floor of henri bendel , before answering her own question it was sometime during the early 60 s , ms quant estimated i'm not sure when because , you know , so much happened during the 60 s records indicate that ms quant married in 1957 she had one child with mr plunket greene , a son , who she will tell you is now 29 or 30 ms quant s career and her great contribution to fashion history the popularization of the miniskirt evolved , of course , during a period in which the societal premium placed on marriage and motherhood came under no small degree of scrutiny it was a time long before magazines like martha stewart weddings emerged as their own kind of pornography the specific social circumstances surrounding the mini s birth and life seem worth recalling right now , when the runways have tried to resurrect the exceedingly abbreviated hemline the spring 2003 collections in new york , milan and paris offered miniskirts and dresses that barely grazed the upper thigh , in bulk quantities not seen since laughin in milan especially where even prada , the fashion world s foremost purveyor of sexual remove , succumbed to the mood with hot pants models were sent down runways looking as if the designers had determined that grown women suddenly wanted to look like aging competitive figure skaters , loose of virtue meanwhile , ms quant herself has returned to fashion with a line of girlish clothes , about 30 looks , mostly in jersey , that include her comparatively quaint versions of the miniskirt and dress four years ago , ms quant received backing from a japanese company and has since opened more than 50 cosmetics shops in japan and one in new york her new line of garments will make their debut in this country at henri bendel in two weeks the clothes have the familiar whimsical feel of her past work about a year ago , i was talking to people in the vintage business , ed burstell , the general manager of bendel s , explained and they said 'guess what s being snatched up \? mary quant' then you look at what s happening on the runway , and it really seemed like the moment but can the mini s currency ever be truly revitalized \? in recent weeks , sale racks in manhattan have been lined with the relatively few versions that designers turned out for fall and many stores do not plan to stock them for spring in proportion to the space they occupied on runways at stanley korshak in dallas , for instance , skirts were bought sparingly , with very specific customers in mind miniskirts are simply never going to sell as well as something above the knee , said robert burke , the fashion director of bergdorf goodman what s interesting , he added , is who buys them and who buys them , as ikram goldman , the owner of ikram , a chicago boutique , explained , are women in their 30 s , 40 s and 50 s she recently sold three azzedine ala a minis to such women , all of whom intended to wear them over leggings or pants when miniskirts captured the world s attention in the 60 s , even becoming the subject of a tennessee court case as late as 1969 , when high school girls fought suspension for wearing them , it was teenagers and very young girls who advocated the lengths that put legs on display ms quant said that not long after she introduced skirts that fell just above the knee at her fabled shop , bazaar , on king s road , young women began demanding more diminutive versions if i did n't make them short enough , the chelsea girls , who had wonderful legs , would get out the scissors and shorten the skirts themselves , she recalled eventually , ms quant s skirts , which arrived in the united states through a partnership with j c penney in the mid60 s , were reduced to a microsize of about five inches , to capitulate to demand in ms quant s interpretation , though , as well as that of andr courr ges and pierre cardin \( haute couture s progenitors of the mini \) , short , typically aline skirts worn with heavy tights rendered the female body prepubescently geometric , androgynous in the last decade or so , feminist theorists like linda benn delibero , among others , have come to view the mini \( along with the shapeless body type it idealized \) not simply as a signifier of sexual liberation but as an agent of rebellion against the mature female form and the cultural imperative that forced women into childbearing i grew up not wanting to grow up , ms quant once said growing up seemed terrible to me , it was awful children were free and sane , and grownups were hideous what is perhaps most striking about the miniskirt s declared revival today is its neartotal absence in teenage life , despite an unprecedented acceptance of bare skin even in good skirt years , we do n't sell them , said chris edgar , the chief executive of delia s , the popular retailer of clothing for adolescent girls and emily leslie , a junior at bronxville high school in bronxville , ny , confirmed observations that adults often make during weekend visits to malls girls wear tight pants and skimpy shirts , she said they show cleavage , but none of my friends wear short skirts young adults , under the tutelage of britney spears , have disavowed the leg and created an erogenous zone out of the stomach , with tank tops that rest well above the hip and thongrevealing jeans that sit considerably south of the hip the effect is completely at odds with the original mini s intent the body is left looking pneumatic , womanly , fertile it should not go unremarked that this style has come to prevail at a time when books urging women to marry early \( barbara dafoe whitehead s why there are no good men left , most recently \) land in stores with the regularity of the full moon , and television shows with women competing for husbands command astonishing ratings you see fashion trying to recycle the mini over and over , said valerie steele , the acting director of the museum at the fashion institute of technology but the cultural moment is over we 've stepped in that river already photos early versions of the quant miniskirt , worn with ankle boots mary quant , who popularized the miniskirt in the 1960 s thighhigh aline minidress from the 1960 s by mary quant belowthehip miniskirt and stretch top from versace for spring 2003 \( franco origlia getty images \) micromini for spring 2003 by karl lagerfeld for chanel sheer minidress over a corset , by nicolas ghesquiere for balenciaga for spring lowslung appliqu d mini from prada for 2003 \( jeanluce hur for the new york times \) \( associated press \)
saratoga springs , ny , aug 23 for 20 years now , marion russell , jack farrell , jim purgerson and more than 15 other dedicated racing fans have come from massachusetts and kentucky , connecticut and illinois , and have taken up residence in the 10room brunswick bed breakfast the reason can be seen from the shaded porch where they spend most of their time across union avenue is saratoga race course , horse heaven none of them knew the others when they followed their passion for horse racing to this village of victorian houses , one that triples its population of 25 , 000 when the thoroughbreds take up residence from the last week of july through labor day as it is for national thoroughbred racing , the travers stakes on saturday is the centerpiece for the crew that meets at the brunswick but friends are easy to make if you do not mind sipping coffee in the morning and talking about the horses you are going to bet that day , or tumbling a drink in hand come evening and reliving the afternoon just as the new york racing association depends on the low and high rollers to pass through the gates a record 1 , 011 , 669 over the 36day meet last year and plunk down enough bets to average more than 15 million in daily handle , the denizens of the brunswick count on one another to renourish souls starved from too little horse racing for much of the year and too much of the everyday grind none of us are big bettors we 're here to see the horses work in the mornings and renew the friendships we 've developed over the years , said purgerson , 56 , a president of the chamber of commerce in ashland , ky the simple fact is we 're horse crazy the crew , along with the innkeepers alinda and kirk nichols , has watched its community sprout new members , as well as age ever so gracefully vincent and anita hitchcock have evolved from the young couple upstairs to the dad and mom who balanced toddlers and daily racing forms on the porch s rocking chairs now that beth , 12 , and steven , 9 , have become acute enough horse enthusiasts to offer an opinion or two on the day s card , the hitchcocks have moved downstairs to a bigger room the original draw was just being around topcaliber horse racing and doing nothing but living it 24 hours a day , said vincent hitchcock , a financial analyst for allstate in glencoe , ill but there is always such a buzz around the house , and over the years this bond of personal trust took over much of the banter , of course , is about exacta boxes and ways to beat the favorite or what prognosticator picked what on channel 12 , the allhorseracingallthetime station but marion russell keeps them all abreast of what is doing on the social circuit she first heard of the spa through the pages of women s wear daily while running an ice cream parlor with her husband , jack , a police detective , in salem , mass when they retired about 20 years ago , jack wanted to pursue his love of the ponies marion wanted to see all that she was missing in the upper echelon of the horse set the first one i went to was for the hospital and it was so lovely , marion russell said of the balls at saratoga then , once i got on that guest list , the invitations started coming in basically , all you have to do to go is pay your money and russell loves the saratoga social scene i'm a 20yearold in an 81yearold s body , she said nine years ago in july , jack russell died after 50 years of marriage , marion instantly knew the best way to honor his memory i came right up here as planned , she said we had a wonderful life , and the most wonderful times happened right here jack russell is not the only brunswick regular commemorated the centerpiece of the group s stay is competition for the la ma bowl , the travers day competition to crown the inn s best handicapper at least for a year it is the brainchild of purgerson and jack farrell , an ebullient 72yearold retiree from boston , who is quick to point out a picture of himself in the inn s foyer as a 5yearold in a cowboy hat atop a pony the rules are straightforward whoever picks the most winners on the day s card is declared champion the la ma was intended to honor its creators , as purgerson is a louisiana native and farrell is from massachusetts but they needed a trophy the winner of the whitney , the travers , they all get a bowl or something , farrell said with a mischievous twinkle in his eye so farrell commissioned a work that can best be described as eyecatching a gold medal plaque with a toilet seat at its center lift it , and the name of each year s winner is engraved inside it , too , hangs in the inn s foyer so far six winners on a 10race card is the record , a number hitchcock was the latest to nail last year more memorabilia will be added to the brunswick , and the regulars will have another piece of lore to pass on saturday when t c karmel reads a poem to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the competition it is the poem s final lines that may say the most about a special friendship among a group of people inexplicably drawn to a oneofakind place through the gates past the stands cross ovals of grass and dirt , where tomorrow at 1 in rain or sun we 'll be back to lose our shirt photos jack farrell of boston , left , and jim purgerson of ashland , ky , in the clubhouse at saratoga the simple fact is we 're horse crazy , purgerson said \( tim roske for the new york times \) \( pg d1 \) the racing meet at saratoga draws thousands of fans to the track , and thousands to the village , which triples in size during the summer \( tim roske for the new york times \) \( pg d4 \)
it is to be a summer of synergy , we are told , between the promotion of movies and the marketing of merchandise product commercials will push films , and films will trumpet brand names you may have already seen the latest television commercial for lexus or is it for minority report , the hot new futuristic film starring tom cruise and directed by steven spielberg \? minority report , as it happens , raises another question , not unrelated might there be some role for classical music in all of this mutual backscratching \? quaint notion not that films or , for that matter , car commercials are allergic to classical music quite the contrary but its appointed role nowadays , it seems , is simply to be used , if not abused john williams s evocative , thoroughly modern score for minority report , spare , dark and moody , is interlaced with striking snippets of masterworks the big second theme from schubert s unfinished symphony , which was admitted into mainstream culture so long ago , it s now dated even as a pop item an organ arrangement of the bach chorale known to classical and crossover audiences alike as jesu , joy of man s desiring , from cantata no 147 the lopsided waltz in 5 4 from tchaikovsky s path tique symphony and the minuet from a haydn string quartet \( op 64 , no 1 \) even by the cautious standards of modernday classical programming , these examples from the 18th and 19th centuries are a staid lot they seem especially odd in the context of a glossy action film set in 2054 , with a score to suit you feel it more than you hear it , mr spielberg says of mr williams s music in notes about the production he calls it mr williams s first blackandwhite score more experimental but the ear clings to the strains of bach , haydn , schubert and tchaikovsky , even though the average filmgoer may not recognize them or know that they are classical music why are they here at all \? to support mr spielberg s black and white conceit by dint of their very antiquity \? for sheer novelty value , to tickle jaded ears \? to add ironic warmth to the cool , cruel climate of a society in which a hightech precrime police division discovers and arrests potential murderers before they can act \? to evoke timehonored humanistic values of the kind that ultimately prevail over authoritarian tendencies in the film , if not in the philip k dick story on which it is based \? or , perversely , are they intended to abrade contemporary sensibilities in the same way that classical music is used at the port authority bus terminal and pennsylvania station , to repel vagrants by driving them to distraction \? i do n't have the answers , mr williams said in a recent interview he went on to explain that in keeping with standard hollywood practice , he had no hand in selecting most of the source music , as such extraneous pieces are called , whether pop or classical to anyone not immersed in film lore , this must come as an astounding revelation in itself that even so canny and consummate a master of his craft as mr williams is not consulted in the choice of music that will butt against his mr williams did choose the haydn , he added , to give the sense of a radio playing in the greenhouse of the dowdy dr iris hineman \( lois smith \) , the scientist whose work gave rise to the precrime unit it seemed to me to be the kind of thing a woman like this would play on the radio , he said \( by what can only be coincidence , another haydn string quartet , the chase , reportedly figures in the new adam sandlerwinona ryder comedy mr deeds , directed by steven brill , with music by teddy castellucci \) for the rest , mr williams could only speculate as to the rationale the working script , he said , depicted the cruise character , chief john anderton , as someone who liked to listen to classical music and to work to it \( the script mentioned strauss , he added , without specifying richard , johann or any other \) and it is true that the schubert appears , twice , as anderton is deeply involved in case analyses , scrubbing holographic images projected by his gloves with gestures vaguely resembling a conductor s the bach is also woven into the plot , supposedly played by the jailer , gideon \( tim blake nelson \) , on the organ of the mausoleumlike prison the tchaikovsky \? who knows \? they are some writer s conception of what this character might have listened to , mr williams said of the various pieces and ultimately , the choice must have been mr spielberg s for whatever reasons they 're there , those worthy composers do their bit , as so often , without complaint but what , in a synergistic world , is in it for them and for the field they represent \? common wisdom nowadays says that classical music , starved for young listeners and new audiences , should be grateful for whatever bone popular culture sees fit to toss its way this is the constant refrain of marketers of cheesy crossover records and stadium concerts maybe classical music can sneak in under the radar , subtly inject itself and infect the listener someone hearing one of these pieces \( more typically , part of one of these pieces \) for the first time may be grabbed and moved to explore the original work complete , and eventually others , too
irish on the inside in search of the soul of irish america by tom hayden 312 pp new york verso 25 i am a believer in invisible ancestral influences , tom hayden writes in irish on the inside , and i imagine that few people of irish heritage anywhere in the world do not share that belief , at least privately this book by the onetime new left leader is a daring and sometimes awkward quest in the most ambitious irish manner a memoir , a confession , a catalog of invisible influences , an alternative history of irish america and a call for its cultural and spiritual renewal many readers will no doubt take issue with hayden s conclusions , but few will be able to dismiss them entirely where the trail of evidence disappears , where intellect fails , hayden says , one must rely on imagination , on possibilities that are technically unprovable indeed , for all hayden s historical research and despite his delicately handled account of the painful birth of the contemporary peace process in northern ireland much of which he witnessed firsthand as a human rights observer this is primarily and unapologetically a work of the poetic imagination in the book s first and most adventurous section , hayden rambles through the fields of irish and american history , as well as his own life story , making connections and drawing inferences wherever he can a child of the fully assimilated irishamerican middle class whose parish priest in suburban detroit was none other than father coughlin , the infamous antisemitic radio orator hayden did not discover until he was a grown man that he had been named for the irish rebel thomas emmet \( the name had been handed down in his family , its significance forgotten \) in examining the career of emmet , a protestant renegade who immigrated to america in 1804 , became attorney general of new york and worked for both the cause of irish freedom and the abolition of slavery , hayden begins to uncover what he calls his irish radical past this heritage includes the san patricios , irish famine immigrants who deserted the united states army and fought for the mexicans during the mexicanamerican war the molly maguires , the legendary saboteurs of the pennsylvania coal fields and the land league of the 1870 s , which sought to unite the irish peasantry with the american labor movement needless to say , these are not the protagonists of conventional upbythebootstraps histories of the irish in america , those miserable and despised immigrants who , as hayden puts it , became white , became conservative , became superpatriotic , and who in turn inflicted an ugly history of racist violence upon africanamericans , the only group below them on the social ladder when hayden went south in the early 1960 s to join the civil rights movement , he was enlisting , he believes , in the alternate tradition of his radical irish forebears without knowing it my irishness was a hidden magnet drawing me towards dreams , underdogs , lost causes and crusades , to acts of defiance against hopelessness in telling the story of his rediscovery of his roots , this greatgrandson of famine immigrants from county monaghan has an urgent message to deliver the essential mythic and romantic qualities of the irish character , he writes , are in danger of being destroyed , to be replaced by a middleclass roboculture and an 'old country' that is marketed as a theme park for tourism , as well as an office park for multinational capital when hayden labors to expose the hidden irishness of such leftwing heroes as che guevara and c wright mills , he is working too hard when he claims that his own preference for blond , blueeyed women is evidence that he was sexually colonized by anglosaxon standards of attractiveness , one can only hope his tongue is planted firmly in his cheek but his central question what role irish identity can play in the age of a multicultural america , a united europe and a globalized economy is one well worth exploring authentic irishness , hayden argues , has to mean something more than getting drunk on st patrick s day , attending mass on easter sunday and rooting for notre dame \( or , to cite a more contemporary version of irishamerican nostalgia , practicing a celtic new age spirituality of dubious provenance \) instead , he advocates a new global irish identity that bypasses the clich s of assimilation , neither clinging to parochial catholic nationalist pride nor blending meekly into the englishspeaking world hayden finds something of this new identity in contemporary northern ireland , which he has visited on numerous occasions and discusses eloquently here few americans , and in fact few observers of any nationality , have written about that tormented province with such sympathy and clarity , and it s a relief to encounter someone halfway respectable taking the american political and journalistic establishment to task for its probritish bias i share hayden s belief that sinn fein , the political movement associated with the nowdecommissioned irish republican army , has the potential to become a transformative force in peacetime irish politics but he seems distressingly reluctant to criticize any aspect of the ira s campaign of violence , and barely acknowledges the extent to which it was bankrolled by precisely the kind of sentimental and illinformed irishamericans he deplores ultimately , hayden never quite defines his vision of global irishness , although he writes his way around it in often lovely , imagistic prose essentially , he hopes that the recent groundswell of interest in irish culture and heritage will breed a new generation of dissenters from what he sees as the anglocentric myth of the american melting pot , from global corporate capitalism and even from the racial category of whiteness itself \( in filling out his 2000 census form , hayden reports , he angrily crossed out the white , nonhispanic category and wrote in irish , born in the united states , american citizen \) this may be too much dissent to hope for on the other hand , any irishamerican who has ever flown to ireland will recognize hayden s enthralled account of his 1971 voyage on aer lingus , whose noisy , convivial passengers did n't exactly seem white to him , but did n't seem alien either hayden stepped onto irish soil for the first time feeling enchanted then the irish police , unimpressed by his invisible ancestors , identified him as a dangerous radical and put him on the next plane back to new york
albany , aug 12 george e pataki returned campaign cash from worldcom , but not adelphia communications , tyco international or global crossing h carl mccall gave up imclone systems money , but not global crossing money andrew m cuomo hedged on enron , returning some but keeping most in the current wave of corporate scandal and collapse , the old question of which campaign contributions a politician should or should not keep has taken on a new urgency democrats have made it a central part of their national strategy in this year s congressional races to tie republicans to the most notorious corporate failures on saturday , senators hillary rodham clinton and charles e schumer , as well as mr mccall , announced that they would donate to charity the money they had received from samuel d waksal , the indicted imclone chief , and members of his family but nowhere have such questions been raised more loudly than in the race for governor of new york , thanks to mr cuomo , the democratic former federal housing secretary who is trying to make this the campaign s defining issue he has demanded for weeks that his opponents return money linked to troubled corporations , but when it comes to his own campaign collections , his judgments have not been so clearcut mr mccall , the democratic state comptroller , has come under particularly intense criticism , both because he has been the main focus of mr cuomo s attacks , and because , as the head of the state s pension funds , he has invested public money in some of the crumbling corporations today , at a meeting in manhattan of states' finance officers that was meant to signal that he and his counterparts were getting tough on corporate misdeeds , mr mccall fended off reporters' questions about his fundraising in the absence of rules , it falls to each politician to invent guidelines for accepting or returning contributions and to determine degrees of guilt is global crossing as bad as , say , worldcom \? when is a corporate board member tainted \? what about a separate but related corporate entity \? mr cuomo has fewer donations from scandalplagued companies than mr mccall or mr pataki , the republican incumbent governor that gives him the luxury of painting all such contributions with the same brush , even when the donor is a step removed from the transgressions cuomo may not be entirely fair in the way he s casting it , but to his credit , he s raising the issue , said blair horner , legislative director of the new york public interest research group the candidate likeliest to benefit from the issue , political analysts say , is b thomas golisano , the rochester billionaire making a thirdparty run with his own money to gain an advantage on this issue , you have to clearly differentiate yourself from the others , and i do n't know if cuomo can do that , said jeff stonecash , a pollster and political science professor at syracuse university voters see both democrats and republicans as having a serious problem with money from tainted sources golisano obviously is different , but i do n't know how much traction that gives him mr cuomo and his campaign have repeatedly charged that mr mccall and mr pataki have each taken more than 135 , 000 in what the cuomo camp calls dirty money that is not quite true , but a look at the contributions cited raises some questions that are hard to answer about onethird of the total that the cuomo camp attributes to mr pataki went to the state republican party , which the governor effectively controls more than half the contributions to mr mccall cited by the cuomo campaign 69 , 000 came not from one of the failed companies , but from an investment firm , alliance capital , and its executives a former alliance executive , frank savage , sat on enron s board , and alliance has come under fire for investing in enron as it was sinking florida s state pension funds have stopped investing through alliance mr mccall continues to do so and investors have sued the firm but alliance has not been linked to enron s fraudulent accounting or other criminal conduct the cuomo campaign lumps global crossing together with companies like adelphia and tyco global , its subsidiaries and its executives gave mr pataki 65 , 000 and mr mccall 27 , 000 , which they have kept but financial analysts say that so far , global crossing appears not to be in a league with the other fallen giants its accounting practices are under federal investigation , but there have been no revelations of billiondollar phony profit reports , and none of its executives have been indicted all of these are legitimate to include as examples of mccall s dirty money , said josh isay , mr cuomo s campaign manager mccall , as head of the pension fund , is suing global crossing and it is the subject of an sec investigation alliance capital is accused of serious misdeeds these are fair comparisons the cuomo campaign also lists contributions mr mccall received from executives of pacific capital group , a venture capital fund , as contributions from global crossing pacific is headed by gary winnick , the chairman of global crossing , who at one time urged global executives to give to mr mccall steven greenberg , a spokesman for the mccall campaign , said , the parallels they make , especially the inclusion of alliance , are outrageous and misleading mr mccall returned 35 , 000 from mr waksal of imclone , and his daughter , but kept 1 , 000 from worldcom mr pataki last week sent back 12 , 000 from worldcom , but not 13 , 000 he received from tyco , adelphia and their executives both campaigns refused to explain how they made such distinctions the mccall campaign has accused mr cuomo of hypocrisy , noting that mr cuomo returned 1 , 000 from enron , but has refused to send back 135 , 500 from robert a belfer , an enron board member , and members of his family they were victims in the enron scandal , mr isay said , they lost a lot of money , and they have never been accused of doing anything wrong
chicago , april 30 chad reeser sneaked around his school like a member of the paparazzi , hiding out in vacant stairwells , peering through the small square glass of the gymnasium door reeser , a 20yearold student at moody bible institute , was like the rest of the curiosity seekers who lined the corridors of this downtown private college on the day of yao ming s first audition with the nba , reeser wanted to catch of glimpse of the 7foot5 center from china i just want to see if he can dunk the ball without jumping , reeser said he is so big not just his height his calves are big he s huge earlier , hotel maids clamored for space in the lobby as he left for his clandestine workout with the knicks this afternoon , walking beside him with mouths agape yao had to duck in the elevator and contort himself into the passenger seat of a lincoln navigator he does not plan to speak with reporters during his workouts here , a trip set up to ensure yao is considered among the first three selections in the june draft but his size and skill have already spoken for him we felt fortunate that we were able to spend time with him , scott layden , the knicks' president and general manager , said after a brief 25minute workout and an extended conversation with yao through an interpreter i think yao ming has special potential he really does he is highly skilled and he s a guy that i think will work and improve i think he 'll be great for the league the knicks are one of only two teams to be granted a private workout , along with the chicago bulls who are expected to conduct a workout with yao on thursday yao will have a 45minute workout on wednesday at loyola university with 25 other teams jeff van gundy , the former knicks coach , was going to be in charge of the workout but the knicks , who still hold van gundy s contractual rights , protested van gundy being a part of a showcase for the rest of the nba p j carlesimo will replace van gundy , and yao will work out with oregon s chris christoffersen yao traveled from shanghai with li yao min , the general manager of the shanghai sharks , and ye li , a translator who works for the team s television station he was met here by eric zhang , a distant cousin of yao s who is his representative li said not too much should be made of yao granting the knicks a private workout , given that the team has only a 44 percent chance of winning the draft lottery yao ming does n't belong to any team , li said he belongs to the world one of yao s interpreters maintained that he has no distinct preference where he wants to play , saying , yao thinks the nba picks me , i do n't pick them but , the interpreter said , he would feel more comfortable in a major metropolitan area with chinese influences than somewhere completely foreign to his homeland none of yao s entourage seemed to think either economics or politics would hold yao back from joining the league this season he is free to join any team after sept 8 , when the world basketball championships end in indianapolis his first day in chicago was filled with commitments in the morning , yao paid a visit to the chinese consulate in the early afternoon , he met with bill walton , the hall of fame center who told the 22yearold yao what to expect in the nba after presenting him with tiedyed apparel promoting walton s 30day tour of the league you look very young in your tshirt , yao told walton , who laughed yao finally made his way to moody , where his rolling hooks fell softly through the net the stride had more grace and lan to it than awkwardness in a bit of a sneak preview , yao gave the knicks and their 12member contingent a brief glimpse of his skill and talent prior to working out for nearly every nba team today the scene was a sight to behold gym personnel cleared the premises of students no one was allowed to witness the workout , unless you peered through a door in the back of the gym outside , a fleet of black town cars lined the back of the gymnasium , idling as if they were about to whisk some diplomat to the airport for a worldaltering decision yao s arrival may not be that significant , but he has already swung the pendulum of the nba draft the knicks were coy in their assessment , but clearly believed he had a chance to be a bona fide center in the league very soon yao s supporters were even more encouraging waiting for their country s beloved basketball star to emerge from the gymnasium and pose with the sears tower in the background , li spoke of potential yao will be better than shaquille o'neal , especially now in the free throw , he said , smiling if they bet steak for free throw , shaquille o'neal will invite yao ming every time the knicks have scouted yao three times , with layden making two trips they even flew out coach don chaney and allan houston to meet with him houston said he was impressed with yao s skills at one point , houston encouraged yao to take a 3pointer yao shot back in chinese , laughing the interpreter told houston , he said patrick ewing does n't take threes the nba is concerned whether the chinese government and the many support systems in yao s career would hamper his arrival already , yao must give back a significant portion of his salary in accordance with rules governing athletes supported by the state system people surrounding yao today were hopeful that he would clear the hurdles to play next year in the nba
trenton comfort food has eclipsed its chichi cousins to fill our plates , one food touching another and gravy over most of it but comfort food is not just meatloaf and mashed potatoes it is almost anything warm and filling , at its best a link between generations and cultures any talk about comfort food in central new jersey must include the food of blue danube , an oldtimey restaurant where the knickknacks are layered , the flowers are silk and the glasses do n't match but the softfocus food hugs you from the inside blue danube is all about cabbage and pirogi , wiener schnitzel and goulash , sp tzle and mititei , plus the requisite chicken parmigiana and steak au poivre \( as well as meatloaf and mashed potatoes on mondays \) this eastern europeancontinental formula is a recipe for success peter and margaret pulhac have owned and operated the restaurant for 11 years and were recently offering complimentary glasses of champagne to celebrate peter pulhac , 43 , learned the restaurant business the oldfashioned way as a dishwasher after he came to the united states in 1978 after fleeing from romania he worked his way around the northeast , eventually finding an apartment above the transylvania inn in trenton and a job at macedonia restaurant in bordentown , where he met margaret , now 37 we were having dinner here and we thought it would be nice to buy the place , and here we are , he said of the restaurant below his former apartment they are there seven days a week , serving food made from recipes his mother back home gives him , plus a few dishes that mr pulhac learned to make at other restaurants mrs pulhac works the front of the house with the help of her sister , darlene weir their menu has evolved backward when the restaurant was new , they offered sandwiches , but customers who missed the transylvania inn asked for their old favorites , and mr pulhac obliged the restaurant s main door opens to a small bar , though the stools are more likely to seat someone eating dinner and watching television than a patron quaffing a cold one i like the bar because the specials board is along one wall , so while i'm waiting for a table , i can find out whether i 'll be dining on mr pulhac s frisky little stuffed hot cherry peppers and light crab pirogi or something hungarianromanian \( tuesdays \) or germanpolish \( thursdays \) , or whether i 'll stick with the menu not that the menu is limited in size it goes on for pages but if you 're in mood for mesclun and artisanal goat cheese with balsamic vinaigrette , do n't go to blue danube trendy it s not comfort starts with the appetizers , but skip the pallid soups in favor of the mamaliga , an oldstyle romanian polenta dish that mr pulhac s mother used to serve him and his nine siblings his restaurant s version is rich with mild feta and mozzarella cheeses , bacon and mititei , a housemade pork sausage , but his frugal mother s was simple cornmeal , salt and water the appetizer sampler includes generous portions of stuffed cabbage , rather heavy pirogi stuffed with potato and cheese , mild housemade romanian sausages , and noodles fried with cabbage the potato pancakes are as light and refreshing as fried food can be , especially when eaten warm , topped with standard issue applesauce that is served alongside though soup or salad is included in the price of the very reasonable entrees , an extra 7 buys you a foothillsize greek salad that will serve and satisfy at least two as an appetizer course , its mound of lettuce buried beneath crumbled feta cheese , greek olives , a few anchovy fillets and a couple of flavorful stuffed grape leaves imported from greece meat , seafood and poultry dishes are uniformly well cooked mr pulhac knows the way of all flesh chicken is tender and moist sauerbraten is fallingapart tender , and shrimp arrived only very slightly overcooked mr pulhac s paprikas dishes are soothing and tender versions of the paprikaspiced classics that , for best flavor , require heating paprika in oil for about a minute before proceeding with the recipe mr pulhac dispenses with that step , choosing instead to add the paprika to a housemade chicken or beef stock with sour cream , which mutes the flavor beef goulash is similarly soothing in texture and creaminess , though the sauce is overwhelmed by the flavor of caraway seeds , which mr pulhac grinds himself his wiener schnitzel is pounded thin and is fairly tender , and though he spices the crackermeal coating with garlic before frying the medallions , it remains plain and uninteresting not so with the sp tzle , my favorite alternative pasta though his mother makes it with only flour and water , mr pulhac adds eggs , which turn a usually chewy side dish tender and light and close to addictive the vegetables , a long list from which diners choose two , are n't as interesting only a diehard carrot lover could choke down the carrots that need only the touch of a fork to deconstruct to baby food other offerings taste as if they 've recently been poured from the can comfort food does include vegetables , though , and mr pulhac would do well to practice the art of crisptender carrots and barely wilted spinach desserts , too , could use some finesse the apple strudel suffers from soggy pastry the dish is best served only on the day it s made and should be warmed only in a traditional oven the tiramis is sloppy and too sweet the savarina , a rumsoaked sponge cake topped with strawberries , ice cream and whipped cream , needs a better cake base and less topping my favorite dessert is a simple rice pudding of mr pulhac s devising , with soft grains of rice gently flavored with cinnamon it s a comforting dessert marred only by too much whipped cream , and that is my main issue with blue danube too much soft stuff and not enough flavor if mr pulhac can focus the flavors of his traditional eastern european dishes , use the lessismore approach to cooking

in the latest regulatory setback for a biotechnology company , the corixa corporation said yesterday that its drug for nonhodgkin s lymphoma would not win approval anytime soon its shares fell 36 percent the company , based in seattle , said it was told by the food and drug administration that it had not adequately demonstrated the safety and clinical benefit of the drug , bexxar , and that new clinical trials would be required analysts said that could delay approval by two years or more bexxar , which is being developed with glaxosmithkline , is a new type of drug that links an antibody to a radioactive isotope to deliver lethal radiation directly to tumors the first such drug , zevalin , was approved last month , also for nonhodgkin s lymphoma now , zevalin s developer , idec pharmaceuticals of san diego , will have the market to itself the setback also calls into question corixa s decision in 2000 to acquire coulter pharmaceutical , the developer of bexxar , for stock then valued at 900 million shares of corixa , which traded at 44 when the acquisition of coulter was announced , fell to 615 yesterday , down 348 idec rose 293 , to 6931 just last week , the fda said it would not approve sepracor s allergy drug because the company had not provided enough evidence to rule out cardiac side effects and imclone systems' application to sell a cancer drug was not accepted for review by the fda some biotechnology analysts and executives said the fda was being overly cautious or not giving clear enough guidance others say that companies are just not conducting adequate clinical trials the biotechnology industry organization said yesterday that the fda had agreed to improve communications with companies and to allow independent consultants to take part in its discussions with biotechnology companies about designing clinical trials the agreement was part of a broader one related to renewal of a law that assesses fees on drug companies to enable the fda to hire more drug reviewers bexxar has had a troubled regulatory history in 1999 , the fda declined even to review coulter s application it was resubmitted a year later , just before corixa bought coulter but last march the agency said more data would be needed corixa and glaxosmithkline submitted new data in september , saying they thought they had answered all the fda s questions some analysts said yesterday s decision was a shock this is extremely surprising given that the fda has had a year to tell them to run a new clinical trial , said thomas j dietz of pacific growth equities in san francisco steven gillis , chief executive of corixa , said he was extremely disappointed he would not disclose what the fda said in its letter about why it thought the company s data was inadequate he said corixa hoped to meet with the fda in the next 45 days to try to understand the agency s reasoning and what new trials would be needed corixa and glaxosmithkline have 10 days to tell the agency whether they will appeal the decision , amend their application or withdraw it john mccamant , editor of the medical technology stock letter in berkeley , calif , said it was unlikely that corixa would drop the drug because new clinical trials were already in progress corixa had been counting on bexxar as its first big product while it has several other products in development , none are likely to reach the market for several years other than immune stimulants that would be part of other companies' vaccines corixa s other leading product , a vaccine to treat a type of skin cancer , has also been set back , with the company having to conduct a new trial requiring years
washington , march 9 in setting forth major changes in the kinds of nuclear weapons the united states builds , and in their kinds of targets , a secret report to congress describes in detail the military gains the pentagon is seeking but it says much less about the diplomatic price the pentagon is willing to pay the supposed gains will take years to achieve , since it takes time to design , test and deploy any new weapon , nuclear or conventional the diplomatic fallout , on the other hand , may be immediate , affecting vice president dick cheney s reception on a 10day trip to europe and the middle east that begins sunday his mission , in part , is to build support for the administration s war on terror and to build pressure on iraq , which the administration accuses of developing weapons of mass destruction now his audiences in europe and the islamic world are likely to find the report unsettling , the europeans from an armscontrol perspective , the arabs because it includes iraq , syria , libya and iran among the nations that might be hit by nuclear weapons in some speculative crisis not that a strike would be lightly undertaken far from it the pentagon s chief use for nuclear weapons has long been to deter , not defeat , an enemy , and that remains the policy the report , a comprehensive nuclear posture review required by congress , does much to weave conventional weapons into the nuclear mix in a way that leaves commanders alternatives to even a limited nuclear strike but unlike the old strategic formula of mutual assured destruction , or mad , in which nuclear superpowers deter each other into a d tente , the pentagon s new saberrattling is meant to signal something different that is a unilateral assured destruction , so that no dictator could seek safety for himself or his weapons of mass destruction in some deep bunker where no conventional weapon could destroy them critics are bound to argue that mr bush is making a radical and dangerous shift to a firststrike policy but in the nuclear standoff of the cold war , the united states never declared a nofirststrike policy against its nuclear adversaries it simply made massive retaliation a credible threat by building a triad of air , land and sea weapons , enough of which , in theory , would survive any plausible first strike by the soviet union , the only real strategic threat that the united states faced now that threat is gone , replaced by new ones , and the pentagon is describing its plan as a new triad comprising a smaller number of nuclear weapons , a new generation of advanced conventional weapons , and defenses against weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear missiles even though a preemptive , limited nuclear strike might be contemplated in an unexpected emergency , it would probably be a last resort otherwise , anyone considering such a strike would be open to scorn as some sort of latterday dr strangelove embracing the bomb the united states and allied interests may not warrant nuclear use , and potential targets may not require nuclear strikes , the report says indeed , the united states has not gone so far as to renounce its pledge made similarly by all the other big nuclear powers not to make a nuclear attack on any country that has none but the pentagon s plans to build nuclear weapons expressly for such an attack , just in case , undermines the credibility of that pledge , which underpins the nonproliferation treaty the pentagon s nuclear force will continue to shrink both in numbers , and in megatonnage , as some of the new weapons would carry small specialpurpose warheads that does not alter the bush administration s unapologetic premise that the quilt of arms control agreements stitched together in the negotiations of the cold war era should be consigned to the reliquary that old process is incompatible with the flexibility us planning and forces now require , the report says of the old arms control process of the 20th century why was the pentagon untroubled by the diplomatic objections that may quickly follow from allies and adversaries alike \? partly because it never expected that the document describing its plan to congress would become public partly because some of the countries it names as adversaries have few allies with which to share their predictable outrage at being listed for attack in cases of immediate , potential and unexpected contingencies and partly because a nuclear superpower is always thinking the unthinkable , and often building weapons that can do the unthinkable deterrence ultimately requires both the right kind of weapons to do the job and the expressed willingness to use them the assets most valued by the spectrum of potential adversaries in the new security environment may be diverse and , in some cases , us understanding of what an adversary values may evolve , the pentagon report explains nuclear attack options that vary in scale , scope , and purpose will complement other military capabilities the combination can provide the range of options needed to pose a credible deterrent to adversaries whose values and calculations of risk and gain and loss may be very diferent from and more difficult to discern than those of past adversaries photo vice president dick cheney begins a 10day trip abroad today \( reuters \) \( pg 13 \)
this is a love story but there is no princess , no white knight do not expect a dozen red roses , or dinner at daniel there are , however , hearts , aches and letters lots of letters for much of the past year , melania , 42 , has lived in a small , dark house in richmond hill , queens , with three middleaged peruvian women she shared a bed with one of the three sisters , their room filled with fake flowers and stuffed teddy bears , some wrapped in plastic , and none of it belonging to melania more than 3 , 000 miles away , in her native peru , her husband of 26 years , antonio , and three of their four daughters live in one of the most crowded districts of lima their modest but tidy concrete house sits atop a hill cut by narrow , unpaved streets they have running water from midnight until noon there is never hot water for a bath they cannot pay their bills in january 2001 , melania , hoping to ease her family s finances , boarded a flight from lima to washington she wondered during the 10hour journey where she was going sometimes i imagined buildings filled with light , all of glass , she said i imagined the ground shining like mirrors one year , two cities , an expired tourist visa , four apartments and several jobs later , melania has a more earthbound vision of the united states and of new york now peru seems to be the lighter , more fantastic place she keeps letters from her family , which she reads every week she handles them gently , these easter eggs , hello kitties , happy birthdays , merry christmases , powerpuff girls , roughcut hearts , poems in childish script they spill like leaves from her hands pledges of love and devotion pour from the pages it is an intimacy of superlatives , as if adjectives can make up for miles millions of kisses , the best , the most beautiful her youngest daughter , andrea , sent a math problem mamita , i'm giving you this problem as your homework 109 99 in the blank , melania wrote 208 it s my punishment for not being in peru , she said of the homework melania is not a pioneer the archetypal immigrant tale features a man striking out across the sea , establishing himself and eventually sending for his family but immigration has increasingly become an equal opportunity endeavor today , most legal immigrants are women , said guillermina jasso , a sociology professor at new york university according to government data , women have made up the majority of new legal immigrants 21 to 65 years old almost every year from 1972 through 1998 that figure does not count those who became legal residents under the provisions of the immigration reform and control act of 1986 although data for illegal immigrants are fuzzier , some estimates are that the malefemale ratio among the illegal is 60 percent male to 40 percent female melania is not alone some 700 , 000 of the nation s 85 million illegal immigrants live in new york state , most of them in new york city increased border security in the last five years , coupled with heightened vigilance by the government since sept 11 , have made it harder for illegal immigrants to come and go increasingly , they must choose between an old world and a new one if she leaves now , they may take note that she overstayed her visa , and they may be less likely to issue her a new one than they would have presept 11 , said jeffrey passell , a demographer at the urban institute so , melania stays she and her family speak several times a week on the phone , but they have no idea when they will meet again antonio is a husband without a wife , melania a mother without children they all share a love that is both sharpened and distorted by distance they are a family in mourning with each other , for each other like many in peru , antonio and melania have spent their lives slipping in and out of work , sometimes driven to the scrappy world of informal commerce more than half of peru s population lives in poverty i am typical of those little girls who become strong at a very young age , said melania , who started working at 6 , soon after her mother died at 9 , she sold coffee and sandwiches on lima s streets after two companies antonio worked for went out of business , he started driving an unofficial taxi melania worked from home , sewing , teaching , making and selling stuffed animals , and babysitting five years ago , she opened a pastry shop called la reina , but when the peruvian economy slumped in 199899 , the business failed we prepared the pastries to throw them out , she said nothing sold the school bills 100 each annually for rosalyn , studying to be an accountant , and liz , studying to be a nurse , and 50 a month for 8yearold andrea were impossible there was a pile of debt the house , the car , medical bills the oldest daughter , nathaly , does not live at home today , the family s monthly budget is 450 antonio earns between 270 and 400 a month , driving his cab and working occasionally as an electrician we are a mature couple , so we made a decision , antonio said during a recent interview a very painful one he would stay in lima , but melania would join the small army of peruvian expatriates who in 1999 sent home 819 million i was more courageous , melania said nathaly and andrea , who is shy , did n't see their mother off
ever since the augusta national golf club , host of the masters tournament , came under attack for its refusal to admit women as members , cbs has been silent on the issue , apparently hoping that the complaints of one women s group will be smothered by public indifference or by a backlash against what even some women shrug off as an archaic feminist principle the event is followed passionately around the world and offers the network enormous prestige , if only a modest financial gain cbs , which has broadcast the event for 46 years , considers the masters so crucial that it accepts an unusually deferential position with the golf club the network allows augusta national to choose the sponsors , decide how many commercial minutes are included in a broadcast and select how many holes are televised the club also has a veto over the selection of commentators another measure of how precious the tournament is to cbs was that no current company executive agreed to comment on the matter , even behind a cloak of anonymity the network appears to be resisting the argument that it can do something to alter the club s policy walking away from the tournament , the network s supporters say , would be a futile gesture because another network would snap it up the moment it became available the fact is , cbs does not have any power or leverage here , said neal pilson , a former president of cbs sports augusta national has it all mostly , the network wants to make it to april relatively unscathed and move on we think we can ride it out , is how one employee put it the battle began last summer after martha burk , chairwoman of the national council of women s organizations , wrote privately to the club s chairman , william johnson , asking the club to rescind its membership ban on women \( women may play the augusta national course sandra day o'connor has been a guest and is often mentioned as a possible first woman to join \) mr johnson publicly retorted in an angry letter that the club would not make changes at the point of a bayonet when ms burk began lobbying the event s corporate sponsors , mr johnson squashed a potential boycott by announcing that he was eliminating all advertising for the coming masters telecast ms burk then began pressing cbs to pull out so far , at least , public pressure on cbs to take a stand has been glancing twothirds of the men and half of the women interviewed in a new york times poll conducted wednesday through saturday said they did not believe that the pga tour , the governing body of men s professional golf , should withdraw its recognition of the masters , even though a majority of men and women said they thought menonly private clubs were wrong the survey of 846 adults nationwide , which had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points , indicated that a plurality of americans think it is unfair to force a private club to accept women men feel more strongly 55 percent of the men said they opposed any requirement that a private club change its policies among women , the result was a statistical dead heat 44 percent said it would be unfair , 43 percent said it would not , and 13 percent had no opinion even within the women s movement , a younger group of postfeminists dismisses the issue as discarded ordnance from a battle won long ago one such is amy richards , cofounder of the third wave foundation , a feminist association in new york , who is coauthor of the book manifesta young women , feminism and the future \( farrar straus giroux , 2000 \) not a lot of our members are golf players , she said being shut out of an exclusive men s golf club is not the same thing as being told they ca n't watch mtv while the 46year partnership between cbs and augusta national is one of the oldest in television , cbs has always been a silent partner the network has never disputed any of the club s edicts in 1994 , when the club demanded that cbs remove the commentator gary mccord after he said the course s greens looked cut as if smoothed with bikini wax , cbs complied mr mccord remains a cbs golf commentator but has never been back to cover the masters the network was never really pressured to exert influence on the club s exclusion of black members in the 1980 s it just was n't an issue , mr pilson recalled it was one of those 'do n't ask , do n't tell' things then , in 1990 , another event , the pga championship , was threatened with boycotts by civil rights groups because it was held at the whitesonly shoal creek country club in birmingham , ala shoal creek was pressured into recruiting an honorary black member that year augusta national then accepted its first black member , ron townsend , a television executive cbs sees no wave of protest on the women s issue at this point still , some people are baffled over why club officials who finally welcomed black members a decade ago are mounting so fierce a resistance to women one reason , executives who know the club s history said , is augusta national s membersonly tournaments and parties that spark bohemian grovestyle bonding over bourbon , cigars and ribaldry in this sheltered world , blacks tapped from the highest corporate echelons fit in women , these executives explain , might spoil the fun another factor could be southern psychology no prominent , powerful business leader can afford to be labeled a racist in those quarters , there is far less resistance to being called a sexist
we boomers not only make our own lives more difficult by harping on the notion of selfesteem , but we pass it along to our children as well , in the guise of a concept of fairness \( lauren slater , feb 3 \) after an olympicstyle field day full of athletic activities and contests at my children s elementary school , all the medals won individually \( by the fastest runner , highest jumper , etc \) were collected and the children were given a chance to pick medals out of a bag so that none would feel bad about losing my daughter , who won nearly every race , came home with a bronze , and my sons , who won nothing , actually came home with two medals apiece what does this teach them about working hard \? how does this teach them that some are better at athletics than others \? maggi hill hopewell , nj
about a month after the attacks of sept 11 , firefighters' widows began showing up at an obscure investment firm on long island called goldis financial group some arrived in small groups , escorted by members of the uniformed firefighters association some went on their own , assured by union officials that goldis was a trustworthy source of financial advice the company promised the widows a refuge from the financial planners who had begun hounding them as soon as they started collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars in charity and death benefits but the firm s record over the past decade has been tarnished by questionable and , in some cases , illegal conduct by some of its employees and business associates , regulators and federal prosecutors say in 2000 , two veteran goldis brokers went to prison on federal charges in new york for taking bribes to sell an inflated stock to goldis clients according to the federal bureau of investigation , the stock promoter who paid the bribes was associated with the gambino crime family for years , financial records show , the firm joined forces with some of the industry s most notorious boiler rooms to sell highrisk securities known as penny stocks and goldis has repeatedly hired brokers from those penny stock firms , including one key member of the goldis unit advising the widows , the firm s executives acknowledged in interviews this week the executives said goldis no longer hires from suspect firms , but had simply been giving brokers a fresh start we believed and maybe mistakenly a number of times that people want to change , said wendy goldis castaldy , vice president and coowner of the firm as for its lengthy foray into the penny stock business , mrs castaldy said , just because it s sleazy in some places did n't mean it would be sleazy here nonetheless , she said , goldis has since completely pulled out of that business the whole industry , she said , was n't what we thought it was in an interview yesterday , leaders of the firefighters' union expressed surprise at goldis s history they said that they had never checked any aspect of the company s record , nor , they said , were they ever informed about the criminal prosecutions against goldis brokers if you are asking me if we are very uncomfortable , you can bet your bottom dollar , said michael a carter , the union s vice president he said that he and other union leaders would meet soon to discuss the union s relationship with goldis there is no evidence that money from any of the 65 or so widows who have sought advice from goldis has been put at risk but since sept 11 , relief officials have worried that the families who have received so much charity and government aid might fall prey to mischief or bad advice suze orman , a radio and television commentator on personal finance who met recently at a hotel with about 75 families of firefighters , said she came away from the session seriously worried about how vulnerable the families seemed one widow has been carrying around 900 , 000 in uncashed checks , she said another ruefully confessed to spending 15 , 000 on designer clothes a firefighter s father told her he simply wanted to give away the 500 , 000 he has collected they hate this money , she said they want to get rid of it officials from the uniformed firefighters association , which represents about 9 , 000 firefighters , said that they had hoped to protect their widows from financial scams by referring them to goldis the widows are being advised mainly by two goldis brokers john j hurley , a retired new york city police officer , and george j duignan , a firefighter and union delegate who is also a goldis broker and financial planner we sit , we hold hands with them , mr hurley said no one , he said , is a number with us a firefighter and broker the union s faith in goldis , officials said , was rooted in large part in mr duignan , who is assigned to engine company 9 in lower manhattan but also keeps an office at goldis georgie duignan is a personal friend , said thomas lamacchia , the treasurer of the union in an interview , mr duignan said his relationship with goldis goes back about 15 years i was looking for somebody who was n't too big and who was willing to work with me , with my circumstances as a firefighter mr duignan said he has honed his investment expertise through years of offduty education and financial training i have three master s degrees , he said in one case , however , mr duignan s choice of investment backfired in the early 1990 s , according to state court records in queens , mr duignan and his wife invested thousands of dollars in what turned out to be a 3 million ponzi scheme orchestrated by a mortgage broker named leonard b fishman , who was prosecuted and sent to jail by the new york attorney general s office asked about the experience , mr duignan said that his wife made the investment on the advice of a friend sometimes your wife does n't tell you everything that s going on , he said
determined to hold down labor costs in a weak and uncertain economy , the nation s employers slashed hours in july , cut overtime and limited hiring to a bare minimum , the labor department reported yesterday the latest data raised fresh questions about the faltering economic recovery , suggesting that growth will be modest at best the unemployment rate remained at 59 percent , the same as june , as 86 , 000 people who might have been listed as unemployed and job hunting dropped out of the labor force instead the number of temporary workers , which had been growing in earlier months and usually rises as the economy is beginning to improve , shrank in july total employment , based on a survey of companies , rose a bare 6 , 000 an almost imperceptible gain still , july was the third consecutive month in which employment went up instead of down the real question i have is whether the labor market is beginning to turn around or whether the stock market will shortcircuit that process , said william dudley , director of domestic research at goldman sachs alongside the net hiring in july , there were more than enough signs that were disturbing employers cut the average workweek by an unusually large threetenths of an hour , to a flat 34 hours not since the labor department began to track the average workweek in 1964 has it been as short , except in two unusual months january of 1996 when a blizzard struck the east coast , and october of last year , in the aftermath of sept 11 the glum labor report , which helped send the stock market down again , came as a number of economists moved from expecting a strong recovery in the second half of the year to concern that the economy might face a longer period of weak growth reinforcing that impression , the commerce department reported yesterday that factory orders fell sharply in june , indicating a setback in industrial output after several months of improvement consumers , however , continued to sustain the recovery , as they have for months their spending rose in june by the largest amount in two years and personal incomes increased by a similarly smart amount , the commerce department reported yesterday but here , too , the signals were mixed while the commerce department s report covers an array of personal income , even counting as income the health insurance premiums that companies pay on behalf of their employees , the labor department focuses only on the average hourly wage of the nation s 90 million workers outside the ranks of management it rose in july by 4 cents , to 1479 an hour , but from a 12month perspective , the annual increase through july was 32 percent that has edged down from 4 percent in january manufacturers , construction companies and state and local governments all shed workers a total of 53 , 000 , seasonally adjusted but none as many as the temporary help industry there , employment declined by 35 , 000 as the economy recovers from recession , employers often hire temporary workers before committing themselves to permanent hires , and that had seemed to be happening until july , temporary employment had risen for four consecutive months , a total increase of 145 , 000 jobs the setback last month made a considerable dent in that gain if the august employment report turns out to be similar to july s , we would be worried that the economy was at best in a sideways waffle , said chris varvares , president of macroeconomic advisers , a st louis forecasting and research firm by that , he meant an annual growth rate for the economy of 1 percent or less , far below the 3 percent or more that most economists consider necessary to generate jobs month after month and keep unemployment from rising the government reported on wednesday that overall economic activity in the second quarter advanced at an annual rate of just 11 percent , down from a 5 percent rate in the first quarter the bush administration gave the july job numbers an optimistic interpretation the good news is that july s unemployment rate was essentially unchanged from the previous month , the secretary of labor , elaine l chao , said in a statement she also said that longterm unemployment people out of work and collecting jobless pay for 15 weeks or more had declined in july after rising continuously for more than a year but several of wall street s forecasters saw enough bad news in the employment report to predict , for the first time , that the federal reserve would cut interest rates by the end of the year until now , they have argued that the fed would probably postpone a rate increase until late in the year , when they expected the economy to be growing strongly enough to make it necessary for the fed to begin moving to keep inflation under control economists at goldman sachs even went so far as to predict yesterday that before the end of the year the fed would cut the key shortterm rate it controls by threequarters of a percentage point , to only 1 percent the economy is growing well below trend , mr dudley said in that environment , does the fed want to risk a japanesestyle outcome \? no they 'll take out insurance to prevent that for all the gloom in the jobs numbers , there were significant strengths employment rose in retailing , wholesaling , transportation , mortgage banking , real estate , auto

in the washington area in two weeks there was no official confirmation that the shooting was the work of the sniper , but the police proceeded on the assumption that it was as they broadcast a lookout alarm for someone in flight , carrying a semiautomatic weapon and driving a van similar to the one sought in the earlier shootings the gunman was reported heading east on route 50 from the crime scene at a shopping mall in the seven corners section of falls church , va , 10 miles west of washington with helicopters and roaring patrol cars , the police moved through the area the woman was hit by a

said screaming , yelling , people started running in his news conference tonight , chief tom manger of the fairfax county police said he knew the question on everyone s mind it s too early to tell , he continued however , we are working it , investigating it with that in mind chief manger spoke of several witnesses being interviewed because they were near the shooting , which occurred about 9 15 pm the police said some witnesses may have been as close as a few yards from where the woman fell she was at her vehicle , the chief said , describing the victim as white and noting that there was no sign of robbery chief manger said the vehicle bulletin was for a creamcolored chevrolet astro van with a broken left rear taillight and a silver ladder rack on top each shooting has increased the alarm and sense of mystery about the sniper , who is reported to have left a message at one shooting scene , a tarot death card inscribed , dear policeman , i am god the latest shooting occurred as the woman , who was not immediately identified , loaded packages into her car in the bottom of a twolevel parking structure near a home depot store in the seven corners shopping center the center included a michaels craft store two earlier shootings occurred near stores in the michaels chain investigators who are part the regional hunt for the sniper , which is based here in rockville , rushed

according to a report on news channel 8 witnesses , the report added , talked of a possible second car suddenly backing up and racing from the scene it was described as a dark , latemodel chevrolet or chrysler the shooting ended a threeday ceasefire of sorts by the sniper , if indeed the woman proves to be his victim investigators in the manhunt had talked of making progress during the day , but

continued to focus on two vehicles a white chevrolet astro van with roof ladder rack in virginia and a larger white cargo truck in maryland that witnesses reported leaving crime scenes , possibly with two people inside earlier today , police officials deflected questions about reports that investigators had shown some witnesses they interviewed a graphic representation of a potential suspect none of the things that you described came from us , chief charles a moose of the montgomery county police department , who is leading the task force , told reporters , careful not to offer a flat denial of reports that detectives might have developed such a rendering chief moose said today that detectives had tracked and questioned several witnesses at different scenes he also said the police had

adirondack state park , ny robert e james straps a kevlar canoe to his back and sets out for the most remote places under the most trying conditions glaring heat , bloodsucking flies , even a cracked rib or two mr james , a retired high school science teacher , is one of a growing army of birdwatchers , known as the loon rangers , who are issued gold plastic badges and sworn to protect the wild loons of the adirondacks for the audubon society of new york state they have plenty of company the bird s striking good looks velvety black head and ruby eyes and its haunting , ethereal cries have endeared it to vacationers and scientists alike , and have fueled a spreading conservation movement these days , the birds may not need all the help in the northeast , where loon protection dates to the 1970 s , the population seems to be stable or even increasing in places like the adirondacks , despite threats from acid rain , mercury , lead fishing sinkers and shoreline development but you would hardly know it from the flurry of efforts to save the loons , and the way the birds have flocked into the affections of americans i look forward to being out on the ponds with the loons more than anything else , said mr james , 75 long a symbol of the wilderness , the common loon is attracting the kind of public following and scientific attention once reserved for more exotic species like bald eagles , gray wolves and whales loons are popping up on coffee mugs and license plates , starring in books and videos , and helping to sell everything from environmental causes to alternative rock music from a seattle band i have nothing against the elk or the moose , but if you 're painting a picture of the wilderness , the loon is sexier , said neil f woodworth , deputy executive director of the adirondack mountain club , which has asked its 40 , 000 members to keep track of the loons that they see during their outings in the adirondacks , nearly 10 , 000 anglers have traded in their lead sinkers for steel ones since memorial day as part of a campaign to protect loons from lead poisoning wildlife and environmental groups led efforts to pass a state law this spring that will ban the sale of small lead sinkers as of 2004 more than 300 volunteers , including the loon rangers , traveled to lakes and ponds in july to count the birds for the second annual loon census by some estimates , there are more than 1 , 000 loons in the state protecttheloon signs have been posted throughout the adirondacks people really like loons , said dr nina schoch , coordinator of the adirondack cooperative loon program , which monitors the birds so they want to help them any way they can even if the population does n't need help in truth , the loons may be helping people more than vice versa since the birds feed primarily on fish , pollutants like mercury are likely to accumulate in their tissues and because loons return to the same territory year after year , they can serve as barometers of pollution , like canaries in a coal mine people are realizing more than ever that loons are a good indicator of the environment , said david evers , executive director of the biodiversity research institute , a group in maine that studies loons as a graduate student in 1989 , dr evers pioneered a way to capture the skittish birds by mesmerizing them with a bright spotlight at night so they could be scooped up with a net since then , he has tested loons for mercury exposure in 11 states , including new york the highest levels of mercury have been found in the northeast these findings prompted dr schoch , a veterinarian , to start the adirondack cooperative loon program in 2001 , with donations from the wildlife conservation society , which runs the bronx zoo , and other groups her program has tested dozens of birds for a longterm mercury study in new york , loons are labeled a species of special concern , a category below endangered or threatened , because they once seemed to be disappearing from parts of the northeast field surveys and anecdotal evidence suggest that is no longer the case , though experts say it is impossible to be sure it may appear that they 're stable now , said john ozard , a state wildlife biologist but we may have an increasing problem with mercury that will impact the population in 10 years in any event , the savetheloon movement cannot be explained by science alone loons stand out in a crowded animal kingdom because , quite simply , they have charisma built for water , the birds dive and swim like fish but can barely stand on land they woo their mates in the open , not unlike characters in a soap opera , and often carry their young on their backs those idiosyncrasies have won over researchers and environmentalists the fish got the attention of people like trout unlimited , said john f sheehan , a spokesman for the adirondack council , an advocacy group for the park but there is a much bigger affinity for loons , mainly because they 're perceived as being more cuddly his group adopted the bird as its logo years ago and added a recording of loon calls to its web site s home page \( www adirondackcouncil org \) it has also bestowed handcarved wooden loons on those it honors as conservationists of the year one recipient , gov george e pataki , keeps his on a coffee table in his office the loons have long brought out the romance and passion in people the canadian government sent a specially commissioned watercolor of loons to prince charles and diana spencer as a wedding present the novelist e l doctorow was so inspired by a sign for loon lake , in the adirondacks , that he used the name as a book title in possibly the most famous loon moment of all , katharine hepburn s character in the 1981 movie on golden pond fancied that the loons were actually talking to her the loons , the loons , they 're welcoming us back , she exclaimed with delight her cantankerous husband , played by henry fonda , had none of that romance left in him i do n't hear a thing , he grumbled and how many other animals receive top billing in a band \? jonathan kochmer , a yaletrained biologist turned musician , and his longtime partner , sarah scott , named their alternative rock band two loons for tea they 're fiercely loyal to each other , and we 've been through a lot together , he said but it s not just personally that we identify with the loons our music does as well it has that shimmering , ethereal , sensual , nocturnal quality the delicatelooking loons even have their very own protectors the ranks of the loon rangers in the adirondacks have swelled to 165 , with nearly onethird joining in the last three years , said fred realbuto , director of the audubon society of new york state the loon rangers program dispatches the volunteers every summer to watch over loons and compile field reports for whatever reason , the interest in loons is escalating , he said maybe we 're just working our way down the chain we started with the big stuff , and pretty soon we 'll be working on the spotted lizard photos lucas savoy and heidi kretser , of the adirondack cooperative loon program ,

some five years ago , stephen earnhart and victoria ford were looking for some local color to inject into a music video they were shooting in mayport , fla , outside jacksonville a friend of a friend suggested that they get in touch with beanie andrew , a neighborhood character whom mr earnhart describes as the moses of the trailer park , because people follow him an upbeat former shrimper in his 60 s , mr andrew was also a recovering alcoholic and an aspiring singer and musician who had for years nursed an inexplicable desire to star in a movie as a gorilla crawling out of the mud mr earnhart , a former miramax executive , and ms ford , a cinematographer on independent movies , were enchanted and when mr andrew introduced them to his friends , the filmmakers agreed that they deserved to be in a movie the result is mule skinner blues , which documents this eccentric and colorful group of wouldbe entertainers as well as their homemade horror short in which , yes , mr andrew crawls out of the mud in a gorilla suit i saw them as mirrors of ourselves , people struggling to create their art and do their thing , ms ford said of the film s characters it appealed to me in a weird way that there was this similarity between us mule skinner blues , which opens on friday in new york , is the latest in a string of documentaries brother s keeper , gates of heaven and crumb are others about , er , unusual characters but it is also a commentary on outsider art and it uses highly subjective techniques pioneered by filmmakers like errol morris there s been a liberation in the documentary genre , mr earnhart said they do n't have to be boring and dry , and they can actually be fun we want to find and explore people who are n't like ourselves ms ford added it s just not a tribe in africa it s people in your own backyard more than anything , however , mule skinner blues is a funny and compassionate look at people trying to create art against all odds the strivers include miss jeanie , a 70ish country singer who writes songs like dui blues \( i do n't ever want another dui , runs the chorus \) and who admits , my voice gets better with schnapps there s steve walker , an emaciated , scarylooking vietnam veteran and alcoholic who writes tender love songs , has been married five times and says i want a woman that will take me for what i am i'm a drunk musician with a future larry parrot , who wrote the horror filmwithinafilm with mr andrew , is a portly , phlegmatic man with a mailorder bride from the philippines , a small cleaning business and a drawer full of unpublished horror stories and annabelle lea usher is a collegetrained artist who designs hardwood floors , has a storage room filled with period costumes \( including a gorilla suit \) and keeps her dead bulldog in a backyard freezer they may sound like grotesques , but mr earnhart and ms ford treat them with respect , no doubt because of the collaborative nature of the project after mr andrew appeared in their music video , they arranged to lend him a video camera mr andrew began making what were essentially audition tapes of his friends and sent them to mr earnhart and ms ford in new york mr earnhart was negotiating to make a horror film at the time , and mr andrew wanted him to come back to jacksonville to shoot it when the project fell through , the filmmaking partners turned their attention to mr andrew and his buddies what s inspiring to me when i saw beanie s videos , mr earnhart said , is that they are n't held back by the confines of what art should be there s such a lack of pretension but instead of just dogging mr andrew and his friends with a video camera , mr earnhart and ms ford encouraged them to make a horror film as a sort of community project , one that would include a scene in which mr andrew fulfilled his fondest showbiz dream they made a deal if the floridians made the film , the new yorkers would help them as little or as much as they wanted they wound up doing only the editing a heisenberg effect was operating here by observing a process that they had themselves set in motion , mr earnhart and ms ford were changing the way it evolved and they employed some nondocumentary techniques recreations , superimposed images , stopmotion animation to record it they even shot dui blues as a music video and they are unapologetic about their methods every night i thought , 'what is my role as a documentarian \? ' mr earnhart said i had this huge crisis and in the end i decided to say 'we ca n't hide , and i do n't want to hide i'm going to see this more as collaboration rather than just observation' ms ford added every documentary filmmaker chooses where they 're going to interview their person their kitchen , their library , their back porch i do n't think there s anything different , it s just a lot more overt it seemed completely right mule skinner blues ends with the premiere of turnabout is fair play , the group s 17minute horror film , at a community theater outside jacksonville the short wo n't win any oscars , but that s not the point mule skinner blues clearly wants to say something about the value of artistic achievement , whether it comes from mr andrew and his friends or acknowledged masters i was n't thinking about outsider art when i went down and met these people , ms ford said but i suppose they are creating their own world of art outside conventional society i was really more inspired by their desire to do , just create mule skinner blues is not without a downbeat side the film took four years to shoot because of financing problems , and during that time the film s subjects had to deal with divorce , homelessness and illness mr andrew fell off the wagon , spent time living in the woods and eventually entered a 12step program but none of this erodes their spirit at the end , their dreams are still with them or as mr andrew puts it cryptically in the movie if you fall down in the mud , you might come back as a gorilla photo steve walker as himself in mule skinner blues \( steel carrot \)
under the big top , even in the warm , dim hours before a show , before the crowds arrive , expectation hangs in the air colored spotlights zigzag wildly trapezes , swaying lightly in the breeze , wait for women in glittering outfits it is hard not to feel a slight heart flutter at the sight soon the 3 , 000 empty folding chairs will hold squirming , squealing children and parents laden with snacks and souvenirs they will gasp as a siamese cat leaps from a 37foot ledge onto small pillow , screech when clowns spray the crowd with water and cheer for zena the tiger , balancing on her hind legs atop a mirrored ball after the crowds go home , the clyde beattycole brothers circus , a caravan of trucks and trailers , will pack up too , moving from webb field in greenburgh to its next engagement in connecticut if the town of greenburgh has anything to say about it , the circus will not be back despite the evident popularity of circuses and the county s longtime history with them the bailey family , of barnum bailey fame , was based in somers officials in westchester s largest town voted last month to ban all entertainment acts using exotic animals as of july 1 greenburgh is the 22nd municipality in the nation to do so their reasons ranged from safety and liability fears animal advocacy groups say that 57 people in the united states have been killed or injured by rampaging circus elephants in the last 10 years to ethical concerns about the lives of wild creatures held for show this was not a lowkey , local debate a hearing before greenburgh s town supervisor , paul j feiner drew more than 150 people and attention from animal rights advocates as far away as maine , florida and england circuses , speaker after speaker said , were little more than a tradition of sanctioned animal abuse what \? are they nuts \? asked lynn goodman of north white plains , standing outside the cole brothers tent before the last afternoon show has everyone gone crazy \? the circus is great animal advocates say it is impossible to create spectacles like elephants standing on their heads or tigers leaping through hoops of fire without terrifying the animals into submission these performances , they contend , are only a tiny piece of life for a circus animal , most of which is spent in chains , or riding from town to town in cages the size of a hyundai i'm certainly for circuses , but i'm opposed to cruelty , said eddie mae barnes , a member of the greenburgh town board who voted for the ban performers , trainers and circus supporters , however , insist that theirs is venerable family entertainment that safely exposes children to exotic animals while protecting the creatures from threats they face in the wild like poachers and rapidly vanishing natural habitat further , they say , most circus animals today have been bred in captivity primarily for circus work not ripped from the jungles since federal laws outlawing their import were passed in the 1970 s the growing debate has not swayed audiences in westchester and rockland counties the big apple circus has an 18day engagement in nyack that began last thursday it has already sold 20 percent more tickets than at this time last year and more than 17 , 000 people turned out to see the royal hanneford circus when it appeared last february at the county center in white plains , despite efforts by a small group of animal rights advocates to deter the crowds robert reno , who manages the county center , said a woman identifying herself only as an animal rights advocate left a voicemail message last year , saying that whoever had booked the show would have his throat cut from ear to ear even worse , mr reno said , were the protesters' more public tactics my favorite is when they give out animal abuse coloring books to children , he said it s pretty graphic stuff animals being abused , gashes in their legs for children , i found that to be very offensive still , the animal rights advocates think they are making a difference last year , a handful stood in the rain for three days protesting rodeo shows in mount vernon , and officials there have not rehired the act , though they said the condition of the field afterward was the main reason historic hudson valley recently ended elephant rides at van cortlandt manor in crotononhudson despite their popularity , citing increased costs among other reasons i n greenburgh , the protesters' presence at cole brothers circus was negligible three women , wearing signs that few people read , stood on central park avenue several yards from the crowd their leaflets fluttered across the grass on the breeze nothing is instant , said anita soldatos , a member of people for the ethical treatment of animals , who was wearing one of the signs all change is gradual but we 're working on it in 20 years i think people will look at circuses the way we see images of slavery in the old south they 'll say , 'our parents did n't know any better' behind ms soldatos , members of the dads' club , a greenburgh civic group , were already discussing ways to reverse the town s decision for five years the club has used circuses as fundraisers , putting the money toward sports leagues for children the cole brothers circus this year , the club s most popular to date , netted 6 , 500 for the group
los angeles , aug 6 so who will it be this time , an anglo \? another africanamerican \? maybe a hispanic for the first time \? but from where , inside the department or outside \? from the city s urban core or the valley \? for a real change , how about a woman \? los angeles is about to pick another police chief after the forced resignation of bernard c parks four months ago at least 50 candidates have applied , and it is hard to imagine that mayor james k hahn , elected 14 months ago , could face a more sensitive decision than choosing from among three finalists to be recommended by the police commission by early next month what might be harder to imagine is that shifting demographics in the nation s secondlargest city and the inglorious departure of the last chief have not so far , at least collided to make the selection process any rowdier than it has been beyond a few expressions of concern by various interest groups , the process is playing out with reasonable calm , suggesting that residents even if grudgingly might embrace mr hahn s choice as best qualified for the job , regardless of race , sex or geographical bearing to the credit of residents throughout the city , people on the street as well as elected leaders , i have not heard that much that the next chief of police needs to be latino , africanamerican or anything else , alex padilla , president of the city council , said in an interview the spirit of the message i'm hearing is that people just want someone who is going to do the job and do it well ethnic politics are not the sole major consideration for mr hahn the choice could also bear on secession votes in november in which residents will decide whether hollywood and the vast collection of neighborhoods known as the san fernando valley should become separate cities residents of both regions have cited inadequate police response as one reason for independence a chief who understands the differences between policing strategies in city neighborhoods and suburbs might help keep the city map intact that requires someone with certain instincts , said jack weiss , a city council member who opposes secession you ca n't just parachute in , mr weiss said , citing two vastly different communities you have to know the difference between pacoima and palms the search for a chief began after chief parks , the highestranking black in city government , resigned after a vote by the police commission , a civilian board that oversees the department , not to offer him an additional fiveyear contract , a decision that mr hahn supported chief parks , who succeeded the city s first chief who was black , willie l williams , ran afoul of the commission and mr hahn for being reluctant to institute reforms after a scandal over planting evidence , for low department morale and for the widespread perception that he managed with a deaf ear to city leaders his dismissal angered many blacks who felt betrayed after supporting mr hahn last year in his election over antonio villaraigosa , the former assembly speaker mr villaraigosa , a hispanic politician , had strong support among hispanic voters , who represent the largest ethnic group in the city , with 45 percent of the population nate holden , a council member who is black and is a vocal supporter of chief parks , said many blacks remained angry but the vacancy , combined with the growing power of hispanic voters , has given hispanic areas sufficient grounds to argue that the city is ready for its first hispanic police chief in june , the latin american law enforcement association , a group that represents hispanic police officers , called a news conference where the president , detective art placencia , reminded reporters that onethird of the 8 , 900 rankandfile officers were hispanic , that the hispanic percentage among recruits was even higher and that 12 percent of the command staff was hispanic we are not here today to demand that the next chief of the los angeles police department be latino , detective placencia said but we are here to demand that the process by which the new chief is chosen be open , fair and inclusive as an additional sign of hispanic support , two other groups , one that represents black officers and the other hispanic officers , joined last week to endorse cmdr george gascon , a hispanic 18year veteran of the force sgt ronnie cato , president of the black group , the oscar joel bryant foundation , said commander gascon had demonstrated exemplary leadership and a willingness to run a division that mirrored the city s diversity if the new chief is not sensitive to minority communities , sergeant cato said , this city is going to explode again the foundation might have put its support behind a leading black candidate from the force , but sergeant cato said none had emerged africanamericans feel like they got stabbed in the heart when chief parks was dismissed , he said no one trusts mayor hahn to whatever degree lobbying efforts continue , city officials say they are heartened that so many candidates have expressed interest in a position that has often brought the holder uncommon attention , even for unfortunate reasons chief williams was nudged aside after one fiveyear term by mayor richard j riordan for his management style , free casinosponsored trips to las vegas and lack of rankandfile support chief williams s predecessor , daryl f gates , retired in 1992 under pressure after the beating of rodney king and the response to the riots that followed the list of applicants includes insiders like commander gascon and two deputy chiefs , david gascon , who is not related , and peg york , as well as outsiders like former police commissioner william j bratton of new york chief mark a kroeker of portland , ore and chief art lopez of oxnard with so many candidates , the commission has hired consultants to help reduce the list to 12 or so for interviews before the finalists are submitted to mr hahn
washington , june 5 the government painted a chilling portrait of john walker lindh this week , describing him in pretrial motions as someone who bears some responsibility for the sept 11 attacks and for the death of johnny micheal spann , a central intelligence agency officer , in a prison uprising in afghanistan contrary to the depiction of mr lindh , 21 , originally from california , as an innocent abroad by his defense team , the government said that he was aware of plans for suicide attacks even worse than those of sept 11 , that he could have alerted mr spann that his life was in danger but instead chose silence and that he knew he was in league with a group of individuals dedicated to the murder of americans prosecutors also said mr lindh knew that future terrorist acts were planned , that these were likely to be even worse than the events of sept 11 and that these were targeted against his fellow americans they suggested that they learned the extent of mr lindh s knowledge when the fbi interviewed him in december , after he had been seized in afghanistan mr lindh s team is seeking to suppress the interview , saying it was held under duress they do not want it used against him in his trial , which starts on aug 26 as early as june 2001 , the prosecutors said in papers filed in federal district court in alexandria , va , lindh also knew that terrorist acts specifically 20 suicide operations involving 50 operatives were being planned by his al qaeda associates and that his fellow americans might well be the targets of those attacks the government conceded that it did not have evidence that mr lindh was directly involved in mr spann s death , but it suggested that mr lindh bore some responsibility for it the fact that we do not have evidence that lindh wielded the weapon that fired the bullet that killed spann has been taken by the defense as an admission that lindh was an innocent bystander , the prosecution said he was neither a bystander nor in any respect can he be described as innocent the government argued that none of the charges should be dismissed nor , it says , should the trial be moved from the washington metropolitan region , as the defense seeks judge t s ellis iii has set hearings on the motions for this month in a 10count indictment on feb 5 , mr lindh was charged with conspiracy to murder americans and providing services to the taliban and al qaeda , among other counts he faces the possibility of life in prison without parole

everyone wanted to know what bonds would utter about swinging for the 314foot fence in right , about chasing hank aaron s career home run record and , of course , about steroids what would bonds say about this ongoing and delicate subject , baseball s dirty , little secret that is no secret anymore it would have been great if bonds said that he did not do steroids , but he did not say that and has never said it publicly it would have been nice if bonds addressed questions by stressing that any rumors about him and steroids were baseless instead , bonds took the predictable route and blamed the news media for exacerbating the situation he avoided the message and took a vicious hack at the messengers i think that s all you guys do is overblow everything , bonds said that s how you make a living it s unfortunate that i had to put it that way , but it s true it s the more blood you can drain , the more successful you can be unfortunately , you say we cheat and lie look at yourself a little bit some of the stories you write , you need to look at yourselves in the mirror because i think it s bad and sad what is worse is blaming reporters while ignoring the problem steroids can cause horrible side effects like liver damage and heart and circulatory problems so questions about them are valid and should have been posed much earlier bonds was reminded that two former players , jose canseco and ken caminiti , have helped inflame the steroid issue recently with their admissions of steroid use caminiti told sports illustrated that he used steroids and that he thought 50 percent of players did canseco guessed that the number was 85 percent the wall street journal reported that canseco had admitted that he used steroids and that , as he shopped a book , he told publishers he would name other major leaguers who used bonds , who is also planning an autobiography , was asked about canseco s charges and his answer sounded like a deposition i never hung out with jose canseco , bonds said i consider him a friend because we never had any problems , just hello and goodbye and i never played in the same league with him we never really crossed paths at any time later , bonds , who had to endure a smattering of fans chanting , barry s on 'roids , made a curious remark about players who used steroids possibly outing others by saying , i hope whoever does it does n't start pointing the fingers at the wrong people because they 're going to be in serious trouble bonds is an incredible player who has 587 career homers and had his best season as a 37yearold , smashing 73 homers in 2001 bonds spends five hours a day conditioning during the offseason and was in the weight room with his personal trainer at the stadium yesterday there are several reasons to applaud what bonds has done and may do while bonds said it was unfair to accuse other players of having used steroids because of what two players said , he eventually condemned usage and said players who use should be worried about their lives but then bonds wondered if reporters were so concerned about lives , how come they were unconcerned about cancer victims or homeless people \? i do n't hear you talking about that , bonds said , painting reporters with the same sweeping brush that he asked not to have used on him then bonds must have thought reporters were na ve as well when he suggested that no athletes would object to drug testing none \? maybe bonds should phone don fehr for a reminder about his opinion on testing of course , bonds said testing would clear up the matter , but you guys would find something else we guys , always the villains bonds must know that reporters would rather write about the games and fans would rather read about them , not who might be using steroids while bonds does not like discussing steroids , the issue is entrenched now the most appropriate shirt to wear yesterday would have said what should barry do \? the answer would be for him to say that he does not use steroids say it so high school players will not recklessly take them and hope their 270foot fly balls become 330foot bullets that is what barry should do photo barry bonds went 2 for 3 , including a strikeout in the fourth inning \( richard perry the new york times \)
the email advertisement said , forget aging and dieting forever ! ditto for exercise turn back your body s biological time clock 1020 years in six months of usage ! ! ! thinking that i could sure use a few good extra years to finally learn to program my vcr , i kept reading but the pitch was a little vague on what exactly would accomplish this i was invited to click to a web site for free information and a free onemonth supply of what was only referred to as hgh as i suspected , hgh turned out to be human growth hormone sort of what the web site is actually selling is something called a human growth hormone releaser , which is supposed to stimulate the pituitary gland to produce and distribute youthful levels of hgh this , the site goes on , will prevent biological aging and reverse a broad range of aging symptoms from wrinkles to failing sexual performance ads like this , as well as the hormone itself , are at the epicenter of a continuing nasty battle between the gerontological medical establishment and proponents of what are known as antiaging medicines , estimated to be a multibilliondollarayear business human growth hormone is a prescription drug that must be injected for any results some doctors operate antiaging clinics that may charge 1 , 000 or more a month to give such injections to people trying to turn back the clock some medical researchers warn that these treatments are unproved and potentially dangerous results of a clinical study published last month in the journal of the american medical association showed that human growth hormone did increase lean muscle mass and fat loss in test subjects , but that the gains were accompanied by adverse side effects in nearly half the cases the side effects included prediabetes , diabetes , aching joints and swollen tissues dr s mitchell harman , director of the kronos longevity research institute in phoenix and an author of the study , says he believes that medical science may someday be able to take 20 years off your age but we sure as hell ca n't now , dr harman said anyone who says they can is of the p t barnum school dr tom perls , an associate professor at boston university medical school and director of the new england centenarian study , hopes the human growth hormone study will be the death knell for the hormone s use as an antiaging agent before this , we did n't have that much armor to attack these guys , he said but dr ronald klatz , president of the american academy of antiaging medicine in chicago and a leading proponent of human growth hormone , contends that the side effects of dr harman s study were hyped he said they were a result of doses of the hormone that were too big they used inappropriately high doses that were two to three times higher than they need to be for antiaging or rejuvenation purposes , he said with our lower doses , we see almost none of these side effects when we do , we adjust the doses down and the side effects go away dr harman responded you know , it is possible they are right reduced doses and more frequent dosing could dilute out the adverse effects and still produce some beneficial effects but the problem is , no one has studied this there are no data there are just the anecdotal reports of these clinics and the people they serve , or disserve , as the case may be he added that he planned to propose that some of these clinics allow him to study their patients to find out if what they 're doing really works but he said he doubted that the antiaging doctors would cooperate they never get back to me , he said they do n't want to know dr klatz responded with an unprintable expletive i'm not sure how keen these dueling doctors may be on taking advice from someone who flunked college biology , but here goes if there s any hope that this stuff can work at lower doses , then stop fighting and get together and test it history is rich with stories of new ideas and treatments that had a tough time getting past establishment resistance it was n't so long ago that surgeons scoffed at washing their hands before operating on people the doctor who linked blood levels of homocysteine to heart disease in 1969 was virtually booted out of harvard medical school only to be proved right years later the atkins diet , nearly universally condemned 25 years ago , now has a degree of mainstream medical acceptance jay olshansky , an epidemiology professor at the university of illinois at chicago and a critic of antiaging medicine , said many doctors confuse the manifestations of aging with aging itself even if we cured heart disease , cancer and stroke , we would n't have altered aging , he said the cellular process of aging will continue and people will get old and die but research scientists are on track to alter the biological rate of aging we think it s going to happen in our lifetime professor olshansky agreed that the dosage controversy over the hormone should be tested using standard scientific methods but the antiaging proponents will be critical of anything that comes up with conclusions that are not consistent with what they 're doing , he added i warned you that this was a nasty battle

a daring young man a biography of william saroyan by john leggett illustrated 462 pages alfred a knopf 30 william saroyan could write a play in a day and a short story in two hours months before his death in 1981 , at 73 , he claimed to have 50 published books , 50 unpublished manuscripts and 50 years' worth of journal entries to his credit so it is astounding to find no firsthand evidence of the saroyan voice in john leggett s paraphrasefilled new biography , a daring young man this is not to say that mr leggett , longtime director of the writers' workshop at the university of iowa and a former book editor , has not done his homework though his notes are sketchy and his bibliography mystifyingly brief \( listing only three books not written by members of the saroyan family \) , he has obvious feeling for his subject he grasps the larger , selfdestructive misanthropy in saroyan s life , as well as much of the minutiae \( at the level of family quarrels , real estate transactions and gambling debts \) but his book is hurt from the outset by an apparent lack of permission to use mr saroyan s own words , and a lack of candor about that shortcoming in its necessarily roundabout way , a daring young man does shape a detailed portrait of a memorably irascible man with a lover like this , humanity needs no enemy , a reviewer for time magazine once wrote about saroyan , the ostensibly bighearted author of the human comedy , the daring young man on the flying trapeze , my heart s in the highlands and many other books and plays even among the ranks of famously difficult , hardliving literary prodigies , saroyan stood out as a hard case awarded the pulitzer prize in drama for the time of your life in 1940 , saroyan refused the honor , complaining that it should have come sooner the saroyan gall , as mr leggett describes it , was spectacular it did not escape this playwright s notice that he had the same initials as william shakespeare nor did he doubt the brilliance of his own work , the wisdom of his own advice or the superiority of his armenian ancestry he was able to hear but one voice , mr leggett observes , his own a daring young man traces some of its subject s hubris to his traumatic childhood stay at an orphanage after the death of his father a source of more arrogance \( why do i identify with this bitter and ultimately lonely human being \? mr leggett asks himself \) was early popular success after his first book s publication in 1934 , it had been a miraculously short trip from worthlessness to worthiness , and saroyan developed vast confidence in his own talents , even though , as a review by nelson algren once put it , saroyan is a man who says a great deal that washes nothing but his own laundry world war ii found him at his most highhanded bill saroyan simply could n't handle the idea of rank , mr leggett writes , which certainly was a liability when he found himself drafted in a personal manifesto about wartime , he delivered an argument that freed him of any broader commitment than that of his own ambition and showed no awareness of the social contract whose freedoms he so enjoyed and for which others had served and died as a member of the signal corps stationed in astoria , queens , he spent much of his time at the lombardy hotel in manhattan , refusing to take telephone calls from army personnel saroyan s two volatile marriages to carol marcus , whom he met in 1942 , are described in all their stormy detail \( though without the cattiness that truman capote brought to writing about carol and friends lunching at la c te basque , material that goes unmentioned here \) also addressed is his suspicion that his wife was jewish he left her when he learned that was the case so are the endless gambling and drinking exploits that punctuated their life together , and saroyan s enormously fractious relations with his two children although mr leggett mentions a cache of letters sold by aram saroyan , william and carol s son , to the university of california at los angeles and acknowledges the many years he spent in the reading room of the bancroft library at the university , he is reduced to awkwardly reiterating the letters' content bill was surprised by the young saroyans' indifference to the dozens of flies with which they shared their house , the book typically notes about aram , his wife and children , and he thought they served very expensive food it s also possible that such an observation is drawn out and denatured from the huge , candid journal to which mr leggett initially refers for all the pettiness and rancor that are described here , a daring young man is essentially a sympathetic portrait in early saroyan writings , mr leggett finds that under the sense of man s tragedy lay a big joy he sees how the pride that kept saroyan squabbling with editors , publishers and film executives increasingly damaged his prospects when it came to books , broadway and hollywood , the common factor in the three experiences was bill s failure to root and grow in the medium , he astutely observes apprenticeship was humbling , and he could not learn from the people around him older , sadder , gripped by hypochondria as well as real illness , the saroyan found late in this book is a wrenching victim of his own anger he still sought acclaim as a writer but he had turned away from other roles , as husband , father , friend and citizen , and had none to rely on in those final years in describing the long , painful process by which saroyan reached this juncture , mr leggett s book lives up to an assessment in this biography s introduction the saroyan story , he writes , so gallantly begun , becomes a tragedy of rage and rejection we can feel pity and fear for him and the catharsis these are said to bring in gratitude for being spared ourselves photo william saroyan , around 1934 \( sonya noskowiak arthur noskowiak \)
in a hardfought victory for microsoft , a federal judge yesterday approved the company s antitrust settlement with the justice department and rejected virtually all of the stiffer sanctions sought by a coalition of state attorneys general the ruling brought at least a temporary close to the landmark case filed nearly five years ago while putting new responsibilities on microsoft , this settlement also gives us the freedom to keep innovating for our customers , microsoft s chairman , bill gates , said at a news conference at the company s headquarters in redmond , wash we 're pleased to put another step of this case behind us judge colleen kollarkotelly of federal district court in washington did impose some new obligations on microsoft that were not included in the settlement last november , requiring the software maker to disclose more information to competitors about its windows operating system and to install a compliance committee made up of microsoft board members but taking a narrow view of the case , the judge imposed few new restrictions that would slow microsoft s aggressive push into new markets news analysis , page c1 she largely dismissed the contention by nine states that broader restrictions on microsoft were necessary to restore competition in the computer software industry instead , judge kollarkotelly criticized the states for suggesting that microsoft should be punished for actions beyond those a federal appeals court found it liable for last year this suit , however remarkable , is not the vehicle through which plaintiffs can resolve all existing allegations of anticompetitive conduct which have not been proved or for which liability has not been ascribed , judge kollarkotelly wrote excerpts , page c4 the justice department , which along with nine other states settled the case last november , hailed the decision as a victory for consumers attorney general john ashcroft said the ruling will allow the approved settlement to provide certainty and stability in a vital sector of america s economy but for many of the economists , legal scholars and rival software developers who have been involved in the longrunning case , the judge s decision falls far short of preventing microsoft from abusing its market power in the future we urged the court to look ahead , to expand the doctrine into new business areas , said bill lockyer , the california state attorney general who helped lead and finance the states' challenge after the federal settlement the court said , 'i ca n't do that , if you want that you need to file a new lawsuit' that obviously remains an option the longanticipated ruling on how the court would restrict microsoft s behavior comes more than a year after a federal appeals court found that microsoft had repeatedly violated antitrust laws the case has been widely viewed as the most important antitrust action since the government s attack on standard oil at the turn of the last century when it was announced last november , the bush administration s consent decree in a case that it inherited from its predecessor was widely viewed by competitors and antitrust scholars as an ineffective slap on the wrist the settlement gives computer makers greater freedom to feature rival software on their machines and prohibits microsoft from retaliating against those who choose nonmicrosoft products in a nod to the dissenting states , judge kollarkotelly ordered microsoft to refrain from threatening retaliation as well and in what could be a significant step , she allowed that the restrictions on microsoft should apply to the server operating systems that are central to most business networks , in addition to personal computer operating systems still , she granted almost none of the core proposals the states raised during an eightweek trial last spring i'm sort of stunned by it , said andrew gavil , an antitrust law professor at howard university who has been critical of the justice department settlement i ca n't imagine a more sweeping victory for the approach that the government and microsoft took and the states could n't get less out of it than they did microsoft has long argued that it needs to be free to construct its software however it sees fit , mr gavil said she bought into microsoft s longstanding argument that there was very little relation between microsoft s anticompetitive acts and their dominant position he said there was not much room for an appeal , and that it would be very difficult to convince the court of appeals that she abused her discretion the dissenting states had argued that the court should impose sanctions that would prevent the company from abusing its market power in new areas of technology as well as blocking the specific illegal practices identified by the appeals court they asked for greater disclosure of microsoft s code to allow rival software to work better with windows they also wanted microsoft to provide a pareddown version of windows that would make it easier for competitors to supply programs like internet browsers and email software and they asked for the company to publish the source code for its internet explorer browser , which zoomed ahead of netscape s onetime dominant navigator browser partly as a result of microsoft s illegal acts
bagram air base , afghanistan , may 7 canadian troops and american criminal investigators have exhumed 23 bodies from a grave site in the tora bora mountains that they suspect are the remains of al qaeda fighters , perhaps a security contingent for osama bin laden the bodies , buried in graves near the village of alikhel , may be those of senior lieutenants or security guards of mr bin laden who were killed in an airstrike on dec 15 while they were fleeing the area , said lt col patrick stogran , the canadian commander of the search operation i am hopeful that it was bin laden himself , but the chances are he was n't there , colonel stogran said after he and his troops returned to bagram air base , north of kabul i think the best we can hope for is that they were some of his key players , some of his senior lieutenants villagers told the soldiers that they had collected the bodies from the floor of a valley after the airstrikes and buried them on a small knoll near the village the villagers said there was one very big man among them , who had been buried in the most prominent position and wired with explosives but the canadians , who spent sunday and monday digging up the remains , were disappointed by what they found american investigators from the federal bureau of investigation and the army s criminal investigation command measured the shrouded bodies , also taking hair samples for dna testing mr bin laden is known to be over 6 feet tall , and none of the bodies appeared to match that height , said capt philip nicholson , the commander at the site all the bodies were swept for booby traps the bodies were reburied where they were found the dna samples will be sent to the united states for analysis , colonel stogran said the size of the canadianled operation indicated that the hunt for mr bin laden and his top fighters was still under way four hundred troops of the princess patricia s canadian light infantry spent four days scouring the high ridges of the tora bora range , opening caves sealed by earlier bombing to look for bodies american special forces troops and a number of local afghan soldiers were involved in the operation also present were an fbi agent , mike forsee , who has been on mr bin laden s trail for four years , and several men from the army investigating unit the tora bora mountains , in eastern afghanistan toward the border with pakistan , were the scene of two weeks of heavy fighting and aerial bombing in december it is the last place that united states intelligence has placed mr bin laden radio intercepts detected him directing troops , according to reports at the time he was then rumored to have escaped to pakistan , along with hundreds of his fighters pakistan s leaders have said they think that mr bin laden is dead on dec 15 a group of qaeda fighters were spotted fleeing alikhel village and making their way down to the valley american planes fired on the group and killed a number of them , captain nicholson said the people were fleeing away from a battle , he said they were caught in the village by afghan forces and a us air raid bin laden was located in the area at approximately the same time , according to very reliable intelligence , captain nicholson said some of the bodies disinterred were wearing military fatigues or webbing , said sgt jason cooper , one of the digging team most were probably killed by shrapnel or percussion bombs , captain nicholson said the canadian soldiers spent three days blasting a mountain of rock and dirt that they believed had fallen in front of one cave entrance as a result of bombing the engineers eventually decided there was nothing there but colonel stogran said they might have simply failed to find the opening we moved tons of earth , he said , but i think if we were to go back we would have to bring more sophisticated seismic equipment it was by chance that allied forces learned about the grave site , when they ran into a pilgrim from pakistan who had come to pray at the graves muslims killed fighting in a jihad , or holy war , are considered holy martyrs and many pilgrims visit their graves , in particular the sick , in the hope of a cure photo soldiers from canada and the united states pull a body from a grave in the tora bora mountains of afghanistan military officials say they think the grave site contains the remains of 23 members of al qaeda \( joe raedle getty images \)
