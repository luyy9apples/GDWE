'the whole shootin' match' one of the finest films to play in new york this year was made on a shoestring budget in and around austin , tex , almost three decades ago the whole shootin' match was written , directed , photographed and edited by a grievously undersung independent talent named eagle pennell , who died in 2002 at 49 , mostly forgotten after years of swimming and all but drowning in booze mr pennell was just 25 and a film school dropout when he made shootin' match in 1978 for an estimated 20 , 000 shot in blackandwhite 16 millimeter in a quasidocumentary visual style , with sensitive framing and attentively handheld camerawork , the film follows the tragiccomic though more often than not comictragic adventures of two bosom buddies , lloyd and frank , wonderfully played by lou perryman \( above , left , in a scene from the film \) and sonny davis chronically just a few dollars away from broke , lloyd and frank spend their days dreaming and scheming , and occasionally working , angling for a way to get a leg up on fate , on luck and their aimless , rootless lives nights are reserved for boozing , philosophizing and nuzzling available women , as well as periodic barroom fisticuffs filled with hilarious observations and digressions , both verbal and visual , and characterized by a deeply felt and livedin sense of place , the whole shootin' match is an exemplar of american regional filmmaking or what roger ebert , in his glowing review , nicely called woodburning cinema the film had other champions it was shown at the 1979 new directors new films festival , where it received overthemoon praise from vincent canby in this paper it also apparently helped inspire robert redford to found the sundance film festival none of this seemed to have done much good for mr pennell , who , after a ritualistic and predictably disappointing hollywood stopover , faded from view in 1999 steve mcvicker wrote a lengthy and terribly sad account of mr pennell s rise and fall for the houston press , which you can still read online at houstonpresscom newly preserved , the whole shootin' match will hit dvd soon , but catch it now in its bigscreen glory \( through wednesday , walter reade theater , 165 west 65th street , lincoln center , 2124963809 , filmlincorg 11 \) manohla dargis photo \( photograph by jim rexrode \)
washington , april 14 the first deadline for to shut down and seal its main facility for manufacturing nuclear weapons fuel expired saturday with no apparent action by the north to fulfill its commitments , while china asked angry officials in the bush administration to show patience the inaction leaves president bush vulnerable to attacks from hawks in his own party , who have argued that it was a mistake to return 25 million in frozen funds to the north koreans much of it believed to be from illicit sales of counterfeit currency and missiles and who doubt that the north koreans will stop producing bomb fuel as well as give up all of its existing weapons the white house was silent about the missed deadline , but the chief american negotiator dealing with the north , christopher r hill , told reporters in beijing , we do n't have a lot of momentum right now that is for sure mr hill has traveled over the past week to japan , south korea and , most recently , china , where officials urged him to allow a little time for the north koreans to fulfill the accord but in washington , officials said they did not know if the chinese had any independent indications from the north that compliance was forthcoming , or if the north was simply trying to buy some time north korean officials told a visiting american delegation earlier this week that they would begin the process of shutting down their reactor at yongbyon , where for years they have produced plutonium from spent nuclear fuel , as soon as the 25 million was returned the process has taken far longer than american officials expected , in part because the legal mechanisms for returning the money turned out to be enormously complicated , leading the bush administration to give up its demand that all illicit funds had to be used for some kind of humanitarian purpose but the agreement that mr hill signed with north korea on feb 13 in talks that also included china , russia , japan and south korea gave the north 60 days to deactivate and seal its main plant at yongbyon , invite back international inspectors and provide a preliminary accounting of how much plutonium it has produced the country had apparently taken none of those steps by saturday during a visit to north korea this week by gov bill richardson of new mexico , who is seeking the democratic nomination for president , officials in pyongyang said they would fulfill those obligations within 30 days of receiving the money that was held in accounts of banco delta asia , in macao investigators from the united states treasury and american intelligence agencies pored through records of the frozen accounts , mapped the banking activities of stateowned companies , arms traders and the leaders surrounding president kim jongil this was the first thing we ever did that got the north koreans' attention , a senior white house official said in an interview this week , declining to speculate how the administration would react if the north koreans missed the first deadlines for shutting its facilities in fact , some administration officials acknowledge that they have few good options with the money cleared for return , the macao accounts no longer provide diplomatic leverage that leaves the administration more dependent than ever on pressure from china , the north s main supplier of energy and aid , to force north korea to live up to the agreement nicholas eberstadt , a scholar at the american enterprise institute , said that turning the money back to the north complicates the logic of the proliferation security initiative , the administration s plan to stop countries from illicit shipments of weapons , because it is allowing the north to retrieve its profits from those activities it also goes contrary to the security council resolution passed at washington s urging after north korea s nuclear test on oct 9 , he said the test was something of a fizzle , a subkiloton explosion , but it was enough to win unanimous passage of a resolution that imposes new economic sanctions on the north now , mr eberstadt said , the north koreans can force the bush administration into continuing , humiliating reversals of its policy but administration officials dispute that view , arguing that mr bush never reversed his policy they contend that he simply waited for the right moment to strike the deal , after the nuclear test angered china s leaders enough to move them from a neutral arbiter in the talks to a source of pressure on the north north korea reached the deal , they argue , because both china and south korea cut aid in public statements , both secretary of state condoleezza rice and the national security adviser , stephen j hadley , have defended the accord as far more effective than an agreement signed between north korea and president bill clinton in 1994 , freezing the yongbyon plant what you are hearing , one senior official said , are the complaints of a lot of people who simply do n't think we should be dealing with the north koreans at all among those who have objected , though , are former bush administration officials who believe that the president has been so eager for a diplomatic coup that he has given up his principles and is perpetuating mr kim s rule mr bush s former ambassador to the united nations , john r bolton , recently expressed the hope that the north koreans would violate the feb 13 agreement and give mr bush an excuse to renounce the deal one sign of whether we are in trouble is whether the administration will call this a violation' or use words like noncompliance , mr bolton said recently , anticipating that north korea would miss the saturday deadline assuming that the north allows in international inspectors and seals the yongbyon plant and the nearby nuclear reprocessing facility where it turns spent nuclear fuel into bombgrade plutonium , it would then have to move on to the hardest part of the agreement it is required to disable the nuclear facilities , a term that the agreement does not define ultimately , it would have to account for , and surrender , all of its nuclear weapons , an arsenal that american intelligence agencies believe has grown from enough fuel for one or two weapons when mr bush took office , to fuel for somewhere between a halfdozen and a dozen weapons
after the first set tie breaker , it was over and while the scoreboard read , 76 \( 3 \) , 61 , the real score is justine henin 3 , serena williams 0 when williams dumped a forehand into the net , the topseeded henin won their third straight matchup in a grand slam quarterfinal this year henin , who will face the winner of tomorrow s venus williamsjelena jankovic match , had 30 winners against 22 errors , while serena had only 17 winners but 28 errors a more telling stat henin was 11 of 14 at the net , while the eighthseeded williams was 5 of 14 the first set lasted 61 minutes , the second , 36 in a match delayed by novak djokovic s fourhour victory , both players had chances to win the opening set before it even reached the tie breaker henin served for it at 54 , and williams had a set point at 56 the tie breaker was on serve at 22 until williams mishit a henin return that painted the line a couple of big henin forehands helped the belgian keep the advantage , and the set ended when williams put a forehand into the net henin , last years open finalist , took a 20 lead in the second set with a winning return off a williams second serve henin broke in the opening game of the match and maintained an early lead as errors , including two big misses on swinging volleys , hampered williams but with henin serving for the set , williams found the range on her backhand at adout , williams s backhand return down the line evened the set the 55 game was a rollercoaster , with henin earning a break point after scampering right and left for a passing shot but williams used her big serve to get out of trouble and get ahead on the scoreboard for the first time all night serving at 56 , henin let a 300 slip away , served a couple of double faults and faced a set point \( saved with a service winner \) before holding on to the game and reaching the tie breaker henin looked to her box for coaching and help on challenges \( but she ignored it on one in which the coach clearly says challenge \) it s not up there with last year s sharapova banana guidance , but does seem a little unnecessary for a woman so talented and determined i had originally written more unsettling is that none of the commentators criticized henin s behavior , condoning a practice allowed at some wta events but not in grand slams one wonders if williams , rafael nadal or nikolay davydenko received coaching , would the announcers be as forgiving \? one reader says the announcers were indeed more critical than i heard , which is possible , but i believe henin deserves some flak for being told when to strike that beautiful backhand of hers and to prove no one s playing favorites here , williams s postmatch news conference lasted less than five testy minutes first question can you explain what went wrong out there tonight \? answer no , i can t i m sorry any more questions \? it went downhill from there when asked whether her level dropped in the second set , she repied no i just think she played better i just think she made a lot of lucky shots , and i made a lot of errors i don t think my level dropped q isn t it making errors when your level drops \? williams i guess it is in a way , maybe my level did drop i definitely made a lot of errors i think she just played a litttle more aggressive and started hitting really , really hard balls , later in the news conference came the following exchange q you seem much more disappointed than in paris or london where she also lost to henin williams do i \? q you do williams go figure perhaps the hype got into with both women s minds the two have already left their mark in tennis , making this and every grand slam matchup special williams came into the open with eighth slam titles including a comeback victory at this year s australian open henin has six , including her third straight at the french in may they had played 11 times before the match , five coming at grand slams including this year s french open and wimbledon , each time won by henin henin and serena had each won their earlier matches in straight sets , but henin had spent a lot less time on court 3 hours 59 minutes compared with williams s 5 49 but williams had played higherquality opponents , with an average ranking of no 45 compared to henin s no 112
compared with the other democrats who plan to run for president in 2008 , senator is the most battletested , has the biggest fundraising network and can walk into the job with a unique set of skills and perspectives gleaned from eight years in the white house as first lady yet none of that guarantees mrs clinton will steamroll her opponents , or manage and master the issues that have long vexed her , like the war in iraq and universal health insurance far from it she has told friends that she is more worried about winning the than winning a general election against a republican with this presidential campaign starting far earlier than any in history , mrs clinton , senator barack obama of illinois and their five democratic rivals find themselves facing 400 more days before the nomination is sealed up each of those days could bring a surprise or flub or senate vote or controversy that might change their political fortunes the field is still growing , too gov bill richardson of new mexico is expected to jump in today and whither john kerry \? wesley clark \? al gore \? given the high velocity of the campaign at this early stage , it s incredible to think what the race will look like a year from now , and who will be standing out , said steve elmendorf , a democratic political consultant who supports mrs clinton mrs clinton has also told friends that she does not think of herself as the democratic frontrunner , nor does she like the word which are both things that frontrunners tend to say , political analysts note \( her new campaign wasted no time yesterday sending an email message about giving mrs clinton a 24 percentage point lead over her closest rival , mr obama \) still , unlike 1988 , when the socalled seven dwarves were running for the democratic nomination , the current field is full of heavy hitters , and mrs clinton faces formidable challenges mr obama is mrs clinton s strongest rival thus far in attracting crowds of screaming fans john edwards , the former senator from north carolina , was the 2004 vice presidential nominee , and has staked out a clear antiwar position and senators joseph r biden jr of delaware and christopher j dodd of connecticut are seasoned lawmakers who lead powerful committees , giving them access to donors and the media spotlight democrats are going to have a real opportunity to see some of the best and brightest in the party , said kathy sullivan , the chairwoman of the new hampshire democratic party we 're a waitandsee state , and while a lot of people are very excited about senator clinton including me very few people have made up their minds mrs clinton s advisers say she knows full well , from long and sometimes painful experience , the challenges to come she will have to convince people that another clinton in the white house will bring more of the successes , and fewer of the shadows and scandals , that marked her husband s administration , her advisers say she will have to figure out the role that mr clinton will play , a question that republicans will almost certainly highlight i have never been afraid to stand up for what i believe in or to face down the republican machine , mrs clinton said in a statement on her new campaign web site after nearly 70 million spent against my campaigns in new york and two landslide wins , i can say i know how washington republicans think , how they operate , and how to beat them in her statement , she also called for bold but practical changes in national policy , a fourword formulation that her advisers said was carefully chosen , given that she has sought to portray herself as both a pragmatist and someone who thinks big some democrats dismiss the latter image , finding her too cautious yet her pledge of boldness reflects her wellknown desire to disprove the notion that she is hesitant or calculating and she will have to show people that she is not the person her critics describe radically liberal , ruthlessly ambitious , or ethically compromised her friends say she is none of these some of them still chide her for being the goldwater girl of her youth political analysts say that part of her challenge will be letting voters see the full her and not just a rehearsed politician , no easy task for such a private person people consider her to be capable and smart , even those who hate her , but have taken issue over the years with her hardness and lack of warmth , said ruth sherman , a political communications specialist who spent time yesterday watching mrs clinton s video announcement on the campaign web site if she can keep it up and persuade people it is authentic , they will have a hard time remembering the hillary they loved to hate mrs clinton will also have to persuade enough people to trust a woman as commander in chief at a time of war , and to view her as a steady , forwardthinking critic of the iraq war and not as indecisive her years on the senate armed services committee , and her ties to military leaders on new york bases and in washington , should help , advisers say i would say she is more qualified to be commander in chief than any other democrat or republican running , given her years of international experience and her work with the military , said ellen r malcolm , the president of emily s list , a political and fundraising organization that endorsed mrs clinton yesterday indeed , one reason mrs clinton chose to make her announcement on a saturday morning , when the political world is usually in slumber , was to dominate the news cycle , her advisers said , and contrast herself vividly as a leader with president bush before his state of the union speech on tuesday night they waved off the appearance that she was announcing to catch up with mr obama , who declared his plans to run on tuesday they said they had determined in middecember that , if mrs clinton decided to run , they would announce the decision on the saturday before the state of the union address mrs clinton spent yesterday at home in chappaqua with mr clinton , making calls to crucial democratic officials across the country , including michael gronstal , the majority leader of the iowa state senate , as well as to some supporters she plans to attend mr bush s speech on tuesday and hit the campaign trail for the first time soon after , traveling next weekend to iowa , the site of the first presidential caucuses in january 2008 after that , she will visit the early primary state of new hampshire , where mr obama and mr edwards have been recently mr dodd and former gov tom vilsack of iowa have visited the state in the last few days
this week s sunday shows offer up a pretty interesting array of presidential candidates following one of those weeks that reminds us that autumn is here i m not totally sure how any of our caucus readers feel about this tumult running toward the height of the nominating contests but it seems to me that the slide toward the stillunsettled primary dates in early winter tumbles the calendar days faster than the leaves are changing colors \( though we re in washington , where the oranges and reds are just arriving new hampshire s leafpeeping undoubtedly draws the crowds right now \) so onto the lineup for your viewing on sunday george stephanopoulos of this week at abc news spent time on the campaign trail with senator joe biden , democratic candidate from delaware and he ll be talking to him , at least according to the promos , about his candidacy and his path toward the presidential nomination the times s jeff zeleny just posted today that senator biden garnered the first iowa newspaper endorsement for his presidential bid from the storm lake times storm lake , as jeff notes , calls itself city beautiful the editorial itself winds through mr biden s personal life , his young years as a stutterer , reciting yeats and seamus heaney , etc , through personal tragedies and then onto the next stages of his life it s definitely worth a read , just for the take on how the newspaper made this decision on the republican side , cbs news bob schieffer promises an interview on his program , face the nation , with mitt romney , the former massachusetts governor , who is fresh off his address before religious conservatives here on friday night among the republicans campaigning in iowa , mr romney has run a wellorganized , ontheground campaign , while his top rival , rudy giuliani , spends little time there because his strategy banks on the bigstates tsunami primary on feb 5 on fox news sunday , two of the republican presidential candidates are slated to appear senator john mccain of arizona and former arkansas gov mike huckabee the cable network s chris wallace will be chatting with both of them , in a preview of yes , another debate sunday night , among the republicans , that fox is sponsoring we ll be back for that cnn s sunday with wolf blitzer promises a lot of guests representatives jane harman , democrat of california , and peter hoekstra , republican of michigan lebanese parliamentarian walid jumblatt robert zoellick , the former trade representative for the bush administration who has replaced paul wolfowitz at the world bank and of course , more from iraq its government spokesman ali aldabbag will be on the spot cspan promises an interview with him , too oh oh and lest we forget , but of course we haven t tim russert , on nbc s meet the press , will deal with the latent , probably spoofing , candidacy of none other than stephen colbert , of comedy central , who will be mr russert s guest yeah , maybe we should ve given that top billing , since everybody among our readers loves his gig mtp also has other pundits on board to talk about the week s candidate news but we d bet some talk will be a riotous sendup of mr colbert , or at least resound with a few tilts of the head at what has become kind of , where do you get your news from \? mr colbert and jon stewart \? \? \? some would say , uh , yeah now we re headed back outside , where another fall day requires our attention to the falling leaves \( we re not actually supposed to talk about the squirrels burying acorns in our yard and digging up , just digging up so many bulbs and plants \) it is autumn , you can feel it in the air and you can sense it by the candidates headlong rush into the early nominating states and beyond \( and truth be told , by the squirrels literally flying through the trees \) like i said , we ll be back for the gop debate tomorrow night , and perhaps earlier , with news from the trail
to all appearances the orchestra found another conductor to love last week opening the carnegie hall season , the ensemble had come to new york as an exclusive creature of claudio abbado , but a seriously ill mr abbado had to stay behind after david robertson led beethoven s ninth symphony on wednesday and thursday , took over in mahler s third symphony on saturday night and produced magic with this visit the orchestra hoped to waft a breeze of publicity toward the festival , but partly because of mr abbado s unfortunate cancellation it blew up a whirlwind many know by now that the orchestra , an international assemblage that includes a number of established soloists and chamber musicians , gathers at the swiss festival every summer out of respect and affection for mr abbado some of the musicians had probably never played for another conductor mr boulez was a natural choice he has a connection to the lucerne festival , having created an academy of contemporary music there and he has shown himself a master of a certain kind of mahler interpretation over the decades , in the process convincing many mahlerians that his approach is among the most illuminating not having heard either of mr abbado s performances of the work in lucerne in august , a listener could not be sure how much this reading owed to mr abbado and how much to mr boulez suffice it to say that it was classic boulezian mahler mr boulez avoids sentimentality in mahler s music , applying an intense focus and logic to the score and letting sentiment take care of itself , as , in a detailed reading of mahler s meticulous scoring , it almost invariably does mr boulez took the epic first movement with extreme deliberation , yet for all the builtin stops and starts , nothing dragged or seemed out of place , and the ending , reached by exquisitely calculated degrees , was stunning the other bookend , the lyrical effusion of a finale , stepped ahead more resolutely without ever seeming rushed or casual , building to another overwhelming conclusion none of which would have counted for so much without superb execution from the players the corporate sound , though polished and blended , teemed with individual voices and character , and standout moments were too many and varied to mention the string tremolos had an energy seldom heard outside vienna or berlin though the deep well of sonority that comes mainly through years of communal experience and molding was necessarily lacking at times , sheer brilliance and power carried the day in climaxes anna larsson sang the alto aria beautifully , though without any great earthiness or sense of mystery the wind players behind her did their best to summon mahler s nature sounds , raw and elemental and the american boychoir and women of the westminster symphonic choir joined ms larsson to properly bouncy effect in the penultimate movement to set up that ineffable , timeless finale it was disconcerting the morning after to realize that that magnificent instrument of an orchestra in effect no longer existed , having to await the ministrations of mr abbado \( one hopes \) , mr boulez or someone else to pull it back together next year in any case saturday s performance proved conclusively that even as a parttime band , it could be a mighty machine
trying to define the politics of robin hood , reformer of sherwood forest , in terms of contemporary classifications seems a bit like trying to figure out whether aristophanes was funny like woody allen or funny like carol burnett it is a rather pointless exercise , but potentially quite fun nevertheless what makes robin hood , a new series on bbc america beginning tomorrow night , amount to such a good time is that it effortlessly prompts you to try was robin hood a john edwards populist \? certainly he built his brand speaking out against the injustice that was the two nottinghams but would he have considered calling for universal tax increases , even if the tax money would finance a universal health care system and combat , say , the plague and all those poisonings from grainbased fungal infections \? arguably , he would n't have allowed himself versions of the robin hood legend have been legion , and though nearly all have focused on his distaste for inequality , fewer have made such emphatic use of his views on tax policy this british series is briskly paced and amusingly corny \( wandering horseman have i shot the sheriff \? respondent no , you shot the deputy \) it also situates the medieval vigilante among history s most aggressive taxation antagonists he is a grover norquist in tights the series begins with robin hood \( jonas armstrong \) as a public servant who is a great deal more than the sum of his charitable instincts , returning home from fighting in the crusades he owned an estate , but it is no longer his still he retains his sense of noblesse oblige he hates the taxes levied on the poor and he hates the tax collectors who go after his inadequately sheltered and fed countrymen he uses more of his time going after evil bureaucrats and their policies of terror than he does redistributing wealth from the well off to the less fortunate he is not a biggovernment guy what he wants , after all , is a lot less sheriff of nottingham , not a lot more sheriff of nottingham the series presents a robin hood perfectly suited to tony blairera centrism , hardly a character who could read as an easy metaphor for the expansion of the welfare state in the 1950s british television produced a robin hood series in tune with what was then britain s prevailing spirit of economic largess played by richard greene , robin hood was above all a paternalistic agent of right mr armstrong s is less obviously so , an individualist concerned with the opinions of his citizenry , someone who would have paid close attention to his poll numbers had gallup established itself some 800 years ago marian \( lucy griffiths \) keeps his ego from overwhelming him she is reason and rationality against his budding selfinfatuation she sees that he wants not only to do good , but also to gain recognition for all the good that he is doing what is it , she asks him , about men and glory \? she seeks none of it for herself she is beautiful and impassioned at night she disguises herself and doles out food to the poor she wants to work within the confines of government to make a better world , and in another of the show s sly nods to modernity , she suffers as a beleaguered single career woman , pitied for living as an unmarried she is n't really frustrated by the horrors of the feudal world , she is told she is frustrated because she cannot find a husband and robin , in another characterization of the show that feels , let s say , ripped from the headlines , lacks the sincerity you hope for in a suitor even when you look at me in anger , i can feel you , he says to marian at one point even after all this time , you can still see into my soul she is not moved five years you 're still peddling the same old drivel directed by richard standeven and john mckay dominic minghella and foz allan , executive producers written by mr minghella , julian mitchell , paul cornell , mark wadlow , debbie oates , joe turner , richard kurti and bev doyle a tiger aspect production for bbc and bbc america with jonas armstrong \( robin hood \) , keith allen \( sheriff of nottingham \) , richard armitage \( guy of gisborne \) , lucy griffiths \( marian \) , sam troughton \( much \) , gordon kennedy \( little john \) , harry lloyd \( will scarlett \) , joe armstrong \( allanadale \) , william beck \( roy \) , anjali jay \( djaq \) and michael elwyn \( edward \)
phoenix , nov 13 was not the ' starting point guard tuesday , and it was not clear when , or if , he would be again that his future was even in question was a startling sign of how badly his oncepromising career has eroded nearly four years ago , , the knicks' president , acquired marbury to reinvigorate the franchise now the coach , thomas will no longer tie his fate to marbury , which is why marbury went missing tuesday the two are clashing over marbury s performance and his role , and possibly a threat to remove him from the starting lineup so marbury left the team tuesday morning , hours before the knicks' shootaround , and skipped tuesday night s game , a 113102 loss to the phoenix suns thomas declined to say whether marbury left of his own volition or was asked to leave , or if he was subject to any discipline thomas called it an inhouse matter , a phrase he invoked 12 times in a sevenminute interview after the shootaround thomas repeatedly stressed that marbury was welcome to return , though he would not specify what role marbury would have we want him as a member of this team , thomas said marbury , a coney island native , traveled with the team from new york to phoenix on monday , but returned to new york early tuesday morning he did not return messages left on his cellphone but in a text message sent to the new york post , marbury said that he received permission to leave thomas would neither confirm nor deny that marbury also told the post that he did not expect to be with the team for wednesday s game against the clippers in los angeles tension between marbury and thomas , who was once his chief backer , stems from the knicks' poor start and marbury s listless play he has been indifferent on defense and erratic on offense , most notably in the final minutes of sunday s 7572 loss to the miami heat , which dropped the knicks' record to 23 we need leadership from that position at the point guard , and we also need defense , thomas said and those are two things that he s definitely capable of doing and when he returns , that s what i expect out of him leadership and defense have never been considered marbury s strengths he has been renowned as a scoring point guard , but never as a heady playmaker during his stints with minnesota , the nets , phoenix and the knicks and his mercurial personality has been an irritant to teammates and coaches more important , marbury has never led a team out of the first round of the playoffs thomas said that none of his starters should feel secure , and he specifically called out center eddy curry and guard jamal crawford for failing to deliver both started tuesday s game while thomas , who has considered himself a mentor to marbury , said he still wanted him on the team , he stopped short of committing to him as a starter if he does the things that i want him to do , yes , thomas said he would not specifically say that marbury s absence was related to a change in his role mardy collins , a firstround draft pick in 2006 , started at point guard against the suns , with nate robinson as his backup the knicks have been preparing for a transition at point guard , but they did not expect it to occur this quickly marbury , who turns 31 in february , is slowing down after 11 seasons in the nba thomas selected robinson and collins in successive drafts , presumably to groom them as marbury s successors the timetable accelerated over the summer when marbury , in an announcement that surprised the team , declared his intent to play in italy in 2009 , after his contract expires the knicks treated the matter with ambivalence they have made no attempts to extend marbury s contract thomas seemed unconcerned about losing a player he once promoted as the key to the team s future asked last month about marbury s plans to play in italy , thomas said , that s an opportunity that may be available to him marbury and thomas were key figures this summer in a sexualharassment trial that ended with an 116 million judgment against madison square garden thomas was accused by a former team executive of hostile treatment marbury testified about having sex with a team employee , a revelation that might have damaged the garden s defense team officials were also concerned and mystified by a series of erratic interviews conducted by marbury over the summer while he has never lived up to his hefty contract or his proclamation in january 2005 that he was the best point guard in the nba marbury remains a potent scorer trading marbury is a near impossibility he is owed 42 million over the next two seasons thomas explored trades involving marbury as far back as the summer of 2005 , and again at the trading deadline in 2006 , but found little interest a buyout of marbury s contract would be daunting but not inconceivable for a franchise that has spent tens of millions of dollars to unload unwanted players all indications are that the knicks and marbury have not yet reached that critical point a year ago , in his first season as coach , thomas clashed with marbury in the early part of the season , benching him for long stretches of two games marbury was out of shape at the time , but reported to camp in good condition this season it seems like he and i kind of go through this every november , thomas said , and then a couple of weeks goes by and we kind of kiss and make up and we get back to the business of trying to win basketball games hopefully , in the next couple days , this will be resolved and we 'll do as we did before marbury responded to the tough love last season , becoming a more dedicated defender and a more judicious point guard thomas called it one of the best years that he s played in this league speaking about marbury s future , thomas said we 're not talking about replacing him we 're talking about the things that we need for our team to move forward and become better and he s capable of doing those things over and over , thomas spoke in terms of marbury returning , eventually , in some role we 'll weather this little storm , thomas said , and we 'll move on
projections in baseball are overused and meaningless it s just plain foolish to say or think that because alex rodriguez hit 14 home runs in the ' first 18 games that he s going to hit 126 home runs this season not even barry bonds , in his bodyboggling prime , could have done that but here is one projection that could actually have some potential as a barometer even better , it could create some fun at the rate at which the yankees are slashing into boston s lead in the american league east , they will pass the in the standings by july 4 if that happens , can you imagine the fireworks in the red sox' front office , their dugout , their clubhouse , at fenway park \? fenway would become a pyrotechnic pit fenway fans , burned once more , might torch their season tickets impossible , you say \? there s no way the yankees could catch the red sox in the next three months , let alone the next three weeks \? curb your skepticism and look at the facts only 10 days ago , the red sox led the yankees by 13 games today , their lead is 9 beginning with their stunning 65 victory over boston on june 3 , a game that might have turned their season around , the yankees sliced three games from the red sox' lead in four days another four days and another game was gone in the standings four games in eight days and remember , it was n't long ago may 29 , in fact that the red sox' advantage was 14 games , half a game larger than the largest lead the red sox held over the yankees in 1978 , the year of boston s unforgettable collapse which prompts a thought now that the red sox have won another world series and expunged 1918 from their vocabulary , perhaps the next time yankees fans see the red sox they can greet them with a new chant nineteenseventyeight , nineteenseventyeight on aug 28 , the day that these teams next meet on the field , fans can adorn yankee stadium with signs in big numbers saying 1978 in fact , it s easy to change the old signs that taunted the red sox just make the second 1 in 1918 into a 7 speaking of 1978 , the yankees did n't eradicate their 14game deficit overnight they went quickly from 14 to 10 in only four days , then picked up two more games during the following fourday period but from july 27 on it was a slow process a month later , the yankees had sliced only half a game from their deficit , meaning that they lagged seven and a half games behind boston with five weeks left in the season  the point is that even if the yankees do n't continue to slash gobs of games from boston s lead in the coming days or weeks , it does n't mean that the red sox are safe sixteen weeks remain in the season , which is plenty of time for dramatic events to occur this seems to be a good point for a disclaimer lest anyone think i am rooting for the yankees to win the division championship , be assured that i do n't care which team wins the new york times company owns 17 percent of the red sox , but my continued employment by the times does not depend on my allegiance to company products contrary to what any number of red sox fans think , i am not a yankees fan either i have never been a yankees fan as a reporter who covered the yankees for more than 16 years , i could not have survived had i also been a fan but while i am not a fan of either team , i do root for a good story , and having lightning strike a second time would be a good story obviously , certain factors would have to contribute to lightning strike ii probably the most critical factor will be the yankees' pitching it has to be good enough to sustain winning streaks it was n't good enough in the first two months , but now the key starters are all healthy , and the rotation has been fortified by the addition of  clemens , chienming wang , andy pettitte and mike mussina should be good enough to match the boston starters that rotation has an unbeaten josh beckett \( 90 \) , but it also has two pitchers , tim wakefield and juli n tav rez , who have losing records on a team that has the best record in the major leagues the yankees' starting pitchers have hardly been overwhelming , but with the hitters now hitting the way they had been expected to hit , maybe the pitchers will be inspired to raise their level of performance  meanwhile , having clemens in the rotation with the yankees now making a move makes a lot more sense than having him pitch for a team going nowhere with the yankees , until recently , looking like a hopeless team , people had begun questioning the wisdom of signing clemens to a 28 million contract , the richest oneyear baseball contract ever but if it helps produce that second lightning strike , no one will question it is clemens worth 28 million , or even the prorated 174 million he will earn \? worth is in the mind of the beholder the yankees were desperate for an established pitcher none were available in a trade , and the freeagent market is n't open during the season clemens was the only established pitcher available in the economic world of supply and demand , when there is great demand and little supply , the seller has a huge advantage clemens s agent said 28 million , and the yankees said , where do we sign \? and if clemens can keep pitching the way he did last saturday against pittsburgh , he will be worth the money and lightning strike ii might just become a reality
us weekly has nothing on us here at the quad , where we can land celebrity interviews with the best of them in this week s edition of the qa , we sat down with college football s most popular couple ,  as you likely recall , ian capped boise state s thrilling fiesta bowl victory last year suddenly , an epic game had a transcendent pop culture hook that thrust ian and chrissy into the american mainstream in a whirlwind , they found themselves on good morning america and getting recognized by paris hilton and peyton manning they got hitched in july , but needed six police officers in attendance because of a barrage of racist threats from people who were against their mixedrace marriage the wedding went perfectly , though , and the two are happily living in boise ian is having a strong junior year for the underrated broncos and chrissy is working full time , as ian jokingly refers to her as his sugar mama here s a wide ranging interview that covers meth labs , corn snakes , keith urban , dance dance revolution , blue license plates , plumbing , monkeys , appalachian state , pedicures , kids , autograph seekers , drinking , mortgages , agents , biffing , racism , prairie dogs , football , metrosexuals , chelsea soccer and , of course , lightning striking on the night that ian and chrissy met tell me a bit about your animal obsession ian i got another cat as an endoftwoadays present from her we have two their names are biff and bella biff is from the movie back to the future chrissy biff is part from the movie and part because when we got him he was the clumsiest cat ever everywhere he went he would fall i he biffs it all of the time it s a phrase that i learned when i got to boise biff it means fall biff is the old one and bella is the new one i m really into animals , so anything she ll let me get , i m taking when i first got to boise state i had four snakes my freshman year i went through four i had a bull snake it mimics a rattlesnake it s got a little tail that shakes and hisses at you they re mean i had two corn snakes those ones are so nice then i had a python they were all nice guys then i moved in with one of the football players , bush hamdan , and i had the snakes for a while , i moved in with these snakes bush was like , ij , you can move in , but no snakes i was like , ok , and i hid them in my closet for a long time everyone thought this was a funny joke there were five guys living in the house and we were all playing around with these snakes , except when bush was around i finally got someone to come buy them , and he showed up when i wasn t there he said , hey , bush , what s up , i m coming to get the snakes bush was like , what snakes \?

c hawaii i i ll tell the story so we re in hawaii and we had never really met before we d crossed paths but it was one of those things where you just see people the whole entire time at the game , my family was there so i never went out with my friends she hung out with some of my friends the last night after the game , we re released until we have to be on the plane i finally go out none of us were 21 , so we were walking around honolulu we re just walking around and the first thing we do is see some girls across the way i didn t know that we were meeting up with them but i saw her and was like , wow i thought , it d be super to hang out with them the next thing i know , we re all getting introduced to each other and hanging out it was like , wow , this is crazy then we split off some guys started walking off me and dave shields , who was my roommate at the time , were walking behind them and singing some country , keith urban it was a breakup song me and dave were singing as loud as we could it s just some sad song she was just so surprised to see two black guys singing country music at the top of their lungs in honolulu so , eventually we ended up just mingling together and talking she and i started talking we just jelled and we were goofing around the entire night c we were walking down the street and we looked around and all of a sudden , all of our friends were gone i i guess it s just us now c then we went to game world and played dance dance revolution well , he did it and i just watched i ddr i used to have the pads at my house so i showed off my skills then we ended up swimming on the beach at like 3 am c we met back up with everyone and all went down to the beach it was awesome there was a strike of lightning off in the distance it was the best setting ever to meet the one that i was going to marry i after that night we kind went our separate ways i wanted to , but i never asked for her number i kind of just figured , i just met a great person , but i m never going to see her again c that s exactly what i thought my friends said , he s a football player , forget about it i we ran into each other the next morning and just kind of caught each other staring the entire time c it was so awkward then he chucked a pillow behind him i was a couple of rows behind him on the plane he was getting a little restless i i threw it at her on purpose when we got back to boise , she tried to find me one of the things that i told her was that my cousin worked at hollister it s a store at the mall , kind of like abercrombie she actually goes looking for my cousin and can t find him c its turns out he hasn t worked there for like a year i the next thing that you know , dave has birthday party he lives with us when you open the door to my bedroom , there s a bathroom door i literally open the door to my bedroom and she opens the bathroom door i said , hey , whoa , where did you come from c i ran up to him and gave him the biggest hug and said , i ve been trying to find you i it was like two weeks after we met that night , we just hung out the whole entire night we just talked until 4 am c we sat on the couch and made fun of the people drinking because we don t drink neither of you drink \? i i m 20 , so it would be illegal , so that s a big part of it she was raised not to and a lot of her friends don t how seriously did you guys take the racial threats you received before your wedding this summer \? i we were probably in the dark about them for a good month or a month in a half they weren t coming to us become i m unlisted c my last name was popadics , we re the only people in idaho with that name i her parents were getting them only my parents are unlisted so people looked up her parents they found them and were sending them a lot of letter there was a number of things one person sent five letters c my mom was so angry , she was burning them she d never experienced anything like that before i it s extremely sad it was worse because i brought them into the situation because the way i did my proposal they were so distraught , they ended up getting caller id they d get these calls that would say , are you soandso , and then they would just start yelling at them they d say , i can t believe that you d support this and what kind of father are you they d get mail it was from all across the country once people started figuring out what we were using for our venues we were going to use the art museum for our venue we were going to have a certain number of police officers at the art museum and a bomb dog come in and sniff it the threats that they received were so significant that they requested that we do that or else they weren t going to allow us to have our wedding there so we had to spend a couple thousand dollars on security we had to pay the police officers overtime rates and the dog alone was going to cost 150 for 30 minutes of work you have to pay for the dog and the guy it was so ridiculous i had to sit down and actually do an escape plan for my wedding , if something was to go wrong c you didn t tell me that i i didn t want to scare you that was when it became real they asked , which would you rather prefer , would you prefer us making a circle around you and getting you to the limo and following you out with police cars or would you prefer us running you to the clubhouse and then barricade two doors between you and having us stand at the only entrance and line up six police officers at the only entrance \? c i had no idea about any of this until right now i we even opened up an fbi case what we do now , anything we get we forward on to them unopened they even found one of the guys they charged him with harassment and gave him a couple thousand dollar fine c the date of the wedding got out we had news people at our wedding at 6 am setting up we got married in a big cathedral downtown and the country club was in eagle , about 30 minutes away the country club was really private we invited family only to that the news found out about it by 10 pm and showed up we were in the middle of dancing and didn t want them in it was a circus they were interviewing people outside the church there was a guy on a bike with no shirt on taking pictures on his cellphone camera i we took enough precaution to where we were set up there were only two entrances to the country club when you came in , you couldn t help know that there was police presence there if someone was going to do something , they were going to get caught we had two police officers shadowing us at all times , unmarked how many police total \? c there were only two i no actually there were two unmarked following us there were two in the cars at one entrance two in the cars at another entrance i went over this with them there were six total c there were only two i no , there were six , we didn t want to freak you out on your wedding day c good , i was stressed out enough what do you think about living up here \? i i grew up outside of anaheim and would go to disney land , and i m right near the beach i m definitely from around a lot of different cultures so when i got here , the biggest thing was , wow , there s a very vanilla culture here you can t go into the city and not be able to speak the same language it s not just spanish there s korean and japanese here , you just came in and everyone was just so nice its something else you don t get in california people are so nice that it s obnoxious sometimes people were so nice and genuine one of the big things for my parents with me coming up to idaho is that they didn t know what it was going to be like i m mixed race , and you hear all of the stories about the aryan nation being from idaho my mom actually came up with me on my recruiting trip she was like , they re going to show you the glitz and the glamor they re going to sell you i m want to be sold myself she went out and was mingling and walking around and at the park she was sitting down and some dude came up with his dogs and sat down next to her and started talking to her for an hour she said that it wouldn t happen in california she said this was not just a good place for sports , but it s a good place to be a good person c \( appetizers had just landed on the table , including bruschetta \) sorry to interrupt , but you may want to note that he ate tomatoes i i just tried tomatoes and i don t really eat tomatoes she wants to make sure that everyone knows when i eat something i m very finicky i like very plain stuff i eat a hamburger with ketchup that s it back to boise i we got here and it wasn t as small as i thought it was as i ve come to live here , it s really a growing town it has a lot of things that other cities have to offer there s just not a hundred of them it really is a great place to raise a family as i was getting more mature , i don t think i want my kids to grow up in california around here , there aren t as many negative influences you can kind of mold your children to the life you want them to lead without so many outside influences it s definitely a great place the people have been so great and the town is so supportive of the sports teams they have that whole bluecollar thing with everything they do if football works out for you professionally , you re still going to live here \? i yeah , even if it was like what derek schouman is doing he has a condo in buffalo where he s playing in the nfl , and has his house here that he rents out i d keep my small house here well , my parents bought the house , and we re renting it from them we pay the mortgage what s it like where you live \? i we don t live in the best neighborhood c yeah , there s a couple of meth labs on our street i we went out to taco bell one night and came home and there s swat vans everywhere there s a swat van in our driveway dudes are running around in the black masks with huge guns it was like , what s going on \? all i wanted was to get a cheesy gordita crunch the next thing you know , the guy pulls up his mask and says , hey ian , i didn t know that you lived here c seriously , this all happened then he started asking if ian could knit them a swat team beanie i they wanted me to make boise special swat beanies they want us to making suo beanies , special unit officers they re not technically a swat team c we always have really weird , random things happen to us how did you start plumbing \? i debest , the plumbing company , is one of the few places that s lenient with their hours they always need someone to do the muscle work anytime a journeyman could do the muscle work for them , they d do it during the summer , every football player needs a job i got here and missed out my first year on being a plumber i was like , i don t want to be a plumber , that job stinks and then the next thing you know , i m working park lot security and everyone else is loving their job you re digging , you re goofing off with other players , you re throwing water on players , you re throwing shovels of dirt , you re playing around with your hard hat on the next year , one of the older guys said , let s get this job let s get on it early as soon as football season was over , we got on this job and i stayed there for a year and a half and worked there during the season last year it was flexible enough with hours and i showed up there in the morning how many hours a week did you work during the season \? you led the country in touchdowns and finished eighth in the heisman balloting i it was about 20 hours a week it was to the point where i couldn t be an apprentice because you needed to take the classes at night , i was actually learning the trade i d go out with any of the journeymen without an apprentice there i d take out the chop saw and start cutting pieces i had a tape measure that i was so proud of but it got to the point where the two jobs were getting to be too much i got a better offer at a different job , working for an investment group how did you go from plumbing to investing \? it doesn t seem like a natural progression i someone i knew in the football program , i told him i needed a new job someone he knew was coming up to boise to fire part of his staff my guy told him he knew someone looking for some job experience and his major in entrepreneurial management he told him to bring me in and see what he can do it was about may , and i got on this job it was actually like a real job i had an office and everything it s called the trada group what they do is that they re an investment , development and management group they find investors for whatever their current project is they develop the land i was on the construction site and do warranty coordinating i d basically go in there and look at apartment complexes and go through and make sure everything covered under our warranty before they were up , the subcontractors would come in and fix just making sure before they close these buildings , before they become our liability , that everything is up to our standards and our investor s standards are you doing it now \? i i m on break from it now during football season , i m not going to be able to do it they re 100 percent ok with me coming back after the season that s actually one of my job opportunities if football goes awry i can join in and do this as a fulltime job and making really good money c i was looking for a fulltime job in may they found out that my degree is going to be in marketing they needed an additional person here at one of the properties here in boise in property management in their marketing department i m working there fulltime in the spring i m going to take classes parttime i m in upperdivision classes and they don t have what i need at the times that i need them i m not taking classes at all right now i she s taking the semester off so she can be my sugar mama , because i m not cheap \( laughter from both \) she wanted to be able to take care of the finances without having to worry five hundred and fifty dollars a months isn t enough to get a college student by that s your scholarship check \? i now it s up a little bit more since we got married it went up 100 when rent was 325 and i would eat a few hundred dollars , it would get a little thin i love your license plate , ilvmy41 \( 41 is johnson s jersey number \) c thank you i my car is cianrun , which i got in high school that s actually a very big bull seye when i m driving around cj when we park it in the driveway , people know exactly where we live kids come and knock on the door and say , hi , um , is ian here \? what s your life been like the past eight months \? i we really got thrown on the scene last year starting with oregon state until last year , i was a redshirt freshman who played a little bit once in a while , someone would recognize me and say , you should have played more or something the hardcore football fan would recognize me if they saw the 41 on my jacket i could wear my boise state stuff out and rarely be noticed now it s to the point where i went out with a captain jack sparrow wig , a hat and a hood on and a little kid came up and said , ij , why are you wearing a wig \? oh , man , if a 6yearold can pick me out with all that on , there s no getting around it now , people recognize her when people go out , we expect we ll be out an extra two or three hours if we don t have enough energy to give people an honest ian and chrissy , we just don t go out we don t want to go out and be rude to anyone c we were trying to celebrate our twoyear anniversary the other day we both were exhausted and we were like , we can t go out we might as well sit home and watch tv or rent a movie we love renting movies its not that we re rude i every once in a while , you feel you deserve a moment to yourself and you want to be out and do it but we know that this town has given so much to us that when they do ask anything of you , you want to give them everything if you want an autograph while we re eating dinner , no problem the times that we re not willing to do it , we don t go out c we don t want to give anyone the wrong impression but there was one time , when i think that i gave the dirtiest look in the world to this woman we had bowed our heads to pray before dinner , and we were sitting there in the middle of our prayer she was like , oh , they re not doing anything , can you sign this for my son \? i was like , wow , she did not just do that he hates going to church because in the middle of prayers at church , people will pull on his shirt or pass a program over to be autographed there s a time and a place for everything i think people get so starstruck they forget where they re at or what they re doing what happened to you the other day \? i oh , i was on the phone with my dad and talking about our insurance i was in the middle of an important call and someone walked up to me was like , hey , hey , hey , talk to my friend on the phone i was like , what \? there s a bunch of random stuff , and if you look at it the wrong way it can take away from the experience but we re real good at looking at things with a positive attitude one of the biggest things we love about boise state is how much they love their team that love doesn t die when the fourth quarter ends that loves continues monday through friday while they re waiting for the game c when we got back from the espn awards , i had a totally different perspective of when people come up to us i m a huge hilary duff fan i saw her and i was like , this is my only chance , i ve got to go up and say hi to her i was so shy , but i went up and got a picture with her she was so , so sweet and i got a totally different perspective of it because she deals with this stuff all the time did any celebrities recognize you guys \? c i think paris hilton figured out who we were i it was really cool that was one of the biggest things for us we realized we can always give a positive attitude no matter what we re going through because we met so many people there were a lot of people at the espy awards that were a little rude we re not going to name anyone , but they had a rep and that just confirmed it but there were so many people there who had no reason to give two seconds to us and were so nice c like the rock i there were so many people that were amazing peyton manning was amazing danica patrick sat there and talked to us for like 45 minutes tony dungy was amazing that whole colts team was great c i did not want to go home i was in heaven i the big thing for me was the next week i m a huge soccer fan we went down to see chelsea play against the la galaxy and we had a little bit of a relationship going on between me and their striker , didier drogba we had done a sports illustrated article together and he had us come down after the game we went out there and met him and he gave me a jersey with my own name on it he was truly genuine to us this guy has a relationship with me their captain , john terry , he s the captain of the english team , has no ties to me whatsoever he came up to me and all my buddies and start talking to us and invites us to the locker room after the game the next day it was like , ok , it s beyond you to come and talk to us now you re inviting us down to the locker room after the game , the lady who was mediating the whole thing told us that we could only bring one person down , and that was me i so was going to bring stuff for all my friends to get signed i m down there and john terry comes up to me and says , hey , where are all of your friends \? he s sitting there in just shorts , no socks , no shirt and runs out he said , call them on the phone , we re going to get them all down here right now i m calling all my buddies , there s seven of us , two were in the bathroom and missed out he s picking five guys out of this huge crowd of thousands and he s just like , this is john terry , captain of the english football team , you will let these guys down he got all my buddies down onto the field it was so amazing that someone not only from a different country , but that i have no ties to , would be so genuinely nice to someone that they don t know it was like , wow , the next time that anyone asks for anything i m going that extra mile i want to make sure that they felt the way that i feel right now have there ever been twinges of regret that with everything being so public \? i no , never there are things and responsibilities that come with what you want if you re so lucky to have people be of fan of you or to have your jersey in the shop what small price is there \? am i willing to be interrupted in the middle of a meal \? yes i never regretted this being so public and televised c i think it puts him and i in a good place being a role model we re of a young age we don t go out and party and don t do that sort of thing i think that we re a good role model for children and even adults , too it always helps a little bit when you want to do something bad it s like , hey , people are watching i it s like , i m going to spit on the sidewalk uh , no it really did help mold us if i was just a regular college football player , who knows what i d be doing right now i d be hanging out with all my buddies , trying to sneak into bars instead we re thrown into this at the perfect time instead , i m exactly what i wanted to be growing up personalitywise with my morals and everything i also happen to have some glitz and glamour and have gotten to do things if someone said , you get to go to the espys , but every other day you have to be bothered my someone i ll trade it but it s so much more than that when did you first realize things were different \? i we got off the plane in new york people were like , boise state we d walk through airports and see our face on usa today and we were like , what s going on \? we went home for spring break and went to san diego , which was two hours from where i live we were wearing regular street clothes and there s people coming out of their shops saying , hey , boise state i have a somewhat common face in a crowd there s nothing real distinct about me it was gloomy outside i don t wear boise state attire because i try and not draw attention to myself it was so crazy it was three months after it happened and people were still picking us out it was like , wow , this is really different its not just idaho we say that bronco nation is growing it really has grown c my family in new jersey say that they wear their boise state stuff all the time and have people coming up to them my little cousin s optimist football team are all boise state fans now how are things different on the field now \? i that cinderella period is over and i mean last year was a great year for us even though we did everything in our power to make sure we didn t ride on last year , i mean , you couldn t help but say , we worked hard and did all this stuff we could not help but think that someone would step up and do what happened last year someone is going to step up and be that fire we may even have better talent it was like , bam , washington happened now we re back in it now we ve got to realize that what was four years in the making last year , we ve got to be the hungry ones no one is going to give it to us we ve got to earn what we get no one is giving us anything we ve always liked being in that position we love going into hostile environments , with people saying we don t deserve to be there what did you think about appalachian state \? i i just loved seeing guys put it together you can honestly just go in there and say , this is michigan , we have every right to lose let s go out and play a quarter and say that i tackled mike hart they put it together and got it in their heads and said , let s see what we can do the talent level isn t that different anymore between the top teams and what you would consider midmajors and division iaa or whatever they call it now now teams realize that there s just as good talent across the board it comes down to making it happen , eliminating mistakes and controlling the ball and not turning it over and making plays when they have a chance there s great players all over place that s one of the things that boise state has always been about we re not going to get a guy who is a great player and 6foot7 we re going to get a guy who is 6foot2 who plays like he s 6foot7 and you get a few of those together and they realize their potential and all of a sudden , size is just size it really comes down to making guys believe just being bigger isn t enough anymore you have to be better at what you do you can beat a big guy with speed and angles you can beat a fast guy by making him over pursue when someone brought up the nfl draft to you in the locker room at the fiesta bowl you laughed and said no one had talked to you about it do you plan on being here the next two years i the way i look at it is right now , no one has talked to me my goal is to stay here , get a degree and be able to provide for my family if there s a better deal that comes across if someone says , hey , you are a firstdayofthedrafttype guy and you can sign a contract without bouncing around my decision isn t going to be that i m going to leave early and try and make a practice squad and bounce around because now i m thinking for two the last thing i m going to do is leave for a dream whatever i have to do , it has to be for sure even if it s next year , if someone says i have to work out for six months to try and get one for an unsigned free agent , that s not for me i love football , but i made a commitment to take care of my family c hey , i m all for moving around i m totally laid back i ll do anything i i want to start a family and i want to have kids when you re trying to make a practice squad , there s so much uncertainty in that if you sign a contract , ok , that s great you can sit down and use your money to get a little house without a certain level of certainty , i could be here two more years and be done with football that s fine because my goal growing up in life wasn t that i wanted to be an nfl player i never thought that i d make it to college and i never thought that i d make it to the pros i don t base my life on if i m going to do that , that s not my success failure my success failure is if i m a good husband , and whether or not i can provide for my family my goal growing up was to have a white picket fence , a monkey and a wife and kids not necessarily in that order i have to make the best decision for what happens with my family if i can sign a milliondollar contract , a million dollars is a lot of money and that s not something that you can just pass up now , if that doesn t happen , ok , let s play another year i m in no hurry to go anywhere i want to be settled and say , chris , we can start having kids in two years whatever i do , i want to be stable i admire the guys that will sit there and beat at it three years on a practice squad and finally make that team those three years for me , on and off teams , moving from washington to tampa bay i don t know if i could do it , on practice squads and camptocamp pay there s other things in the world i want more i m not going to sacrifice the security i have with her c whatever you do , you know i ll be there i i just told what my dreams are c as long as in the long run i get my kids , i ll be happy about agents i remember alex smith telling me that after he had a big game the first week of his junior year a guy who looked like a used car salesman knocked on his door of his house and wanted to be his agent you haven t had any contact with agents \? i the guy in boise who signs all the guys who try and go as free agents has talked to me but they are really like local sales guys drew rosenhaus hasn t called you yet \? i i don t even know who that is that s probably bad you seem at peace with your limitations , footballwise i i definitely know what i m good at , and what i can and can t do you can always get a little bit faster and a little bit stronger i m 510 and 198 pounds i can go up to 215 i run what i run i ve run 44s my freshman year i ran a 443 there s a number of guys when we line up and race , they ll beat me but i know that when we put on pads , i know what i can do on the field numbers aren t always it for me have you had to learn to run differently this year \? i one of the things last year we were able to do i knew exactly what we had we had an amazing tight end who was basically a sixth offensive lineman he could line up against a 300pound defensive end and basically stalemate him now that he s gone , and we re going to get the eight and nineman box we need to learn how to play the edge even though we run between the tackles so much , that edge block dictates where i m going now that we kind of understand how it s going to be and how it s not going to be sometimes and i definitely had to change from a straightup sevenman box and we re going to have these kinds of numbers , so i can wait for my blocks now there s two extra guys in there , if you wait for them they re going to come get you there s only so many people to block we may be out the window with this whole being patient and waiting for blocks no one thinks we can throw when i get tackled , guys say , you are never going to run on us that is our one thing go for the deep ball guys will tell you that they ll be laying on top of me and say , i don t care what happens , you re not going to get another yard southern miss said that washington , the first thing they said was , you re not going to get 50 yards rushing it s definitely a different world out there this year we don t have that supporting cast that everyone remembers from last year we rode into the year with these wide receivers who could burn you on routes and then discovered we had a running back who knew \? now we ve got the running back and those wide receivers are gone we ve got some good guys and some good recruits but they haven t seen anything , nothing that will make you sit and play four guys back they re still going to drop the safety down a bit and have our corners play insideout and they re reading run how much have you seen city and program evolve in four years \? i the city itself , aside from football , it has grown so much when i was plumbing , we were always building new construction just from that point , wow we went from just having a mall to now there s just so many other things here to see the school itself , two additional parking structures , the indoor facility , we ve got the stadium expansion going on right now we ve got two new dorms we ve got a new interactive learning center on campus we ve got an engineering program when we got here , we wanted to be a metropolitan university of distinction and its happening there s so much going on with the team , bigtime businesses like hp and oreida there s so many things going on this team is growing at almost the same rate as the city is growing c my mom teaches at boise state and says there s so many students coming in from all over the place she asks what they re doing here and a lot of them say the football team attracted them to it then they found out what a great school that boise state is he would never say it , but the football team is seriously growing that school and the other athletics , too i we should have blue license plates that would be great i ll talk to the governor , butch otter he d probably do it he s that kind of a guy c instead of famous potatoes it should say , famous blue turf \( everyone laughs \) have things gotten back to normal for you guys \? i i wouldn t say that it s back to normal i would say that this is our new normal its definitely died down a little bit from everyone being all about the fiesta bowl it s still been very much the same since the fiesta bowl if we go out to anywhere this is an upscale restaurant , so people aren t going to mess with us but if we still go out and people will pull up next to us you ll go somewhere and people will be following you around you ll sit at a mcdonald s and people will be doing the prairie dog thing \( johnson hunches down in his seat and then pops up and opens his eyes wide he repeats the motion a few times , looking like , well , a prairie dog \) people still think that we re deaf , dumb and blind they ll be sitting right next to me and say , hey , you re ian johnson it s like , i can hear you c our new thing to say to each other is , yes , we re deaf coach petersen told me today that he knew you were different from the day you walked on campus when i asked why , he said he could tell by what you were wearing do you remember what you were wearing \? i i m from california and i m from a suburban area and i m a beach guy so i had the tight jeans , i actually had a pedicure i was wearing sandals , even though it was cold i had a blue muscle tshirt with a blue apple cap on i was matching 100 percent i definitely had a style that no one had seen in idaho i think we might see it in a couple of years when things finally catch up what s an apple cap \? i you ll see guys with a lot of hair wearing them its like a beanie with a brim on it i had a lot of hair it wasn t an afro because i relaxed it i had these huge curls it was kind of bushy i could spike it it was that curly , but almost straight if you want to say it was bushy , it was it was a real california look i came in with a air of confidence with what i was wearing the typical guy that comes in here from california is a secondchance guy or a guy from innercity la or sacramento area i m from the suburbs there was the word metrosexual thrown around a lot then , i d get bored in meetings and i started to crochet then guys were like , you re not metro , you might be a little iffy they definitely thought that i was weird i ate nine bananas a day in meetings to stay awake during twoadays in the summer those things added up to me being a different quote , unquote kind of person i didn t listen to rap music everyone else listens to rap music from my area , we listen to localbandtype guys i listen to hardcore punk music stuff with screaming these guys were not having it everything i did , these guys were just laying into me i m a big video game nerd i just had a lot going how do you remember that well what you were wearing \? i its not that i ll remember a lot of times when we get a new coach or a new person , they ll be like , ian , you re a little weird and someone will say , well , you should have seen him the first day that he was here it s gotten so outofhand that i wasn t wearing a blue shirt anymore , i was wearing a fishnet shirt with my hair slicked back and my nails painted with french tips it s like , wow , how far can this story go with your career at boise state , you ve already written a good story but for you , there s still a lot of golf left to play what do you hope your ultimate legacy is here \? i my ultimate legacy here , i want to say that i ended whatever happened on a positive note whatever i do in the end whether it s to end or do whatever and do it and not just save face , but end with a positive attitude and continue on to something better not just float around i don t want be that guy who is doing commercials for larry miller honda or whatever i want to be a guy who played here and then made a decision to move on and live the rest of his life with his wife or do something great at the next level then that legacy ends and my next legacy begins with me as a father and a husband when you picked boise , who did it come down to \? i the sad part is , i had no other offers that s another part of my story , you could say in high school , i went to a big school that was a college prep school , but we didn t send a lot of guys to the next level for football we were in that area where usc and ucla wouldn t go that far not a lot of teams go into california looking i was allcif , i put up decent numbers my senior year , i found out that during my junior year my coach had actually blackballed me when teams would come , he d tell coaches , nah , he s a nutcase i had a 35 gpa and i ve never had any suspensions or been in any trouble he ended up blackballing me when coaches would come he s say , nah , he s a nutcase , but look at this wide receiver that coach ended up being fired when they cleaned out his office , there was a box of letters requesting game tape and film or asking if i d come to this camp by the time i got to respond to them , it was my senior year and i called teams and they said they were told that i wasn t interested they already had the list of guys they were looking at i had letters from ivy leagues to a number of pac10 schools , washington and ucla is this something that s been written \? i it s been written locally it s something that i don t harbor any anger about whatever his anger was , it got me to where i am now the path i ve taken has molded me to where i am now and to a life that i m not complaining about so , for me to sit there and tell you about this guy who was a jerk to me back in high school , that would be rude my senior year , my coach came in and was commuting from northern california he said he d give us all the resources we needed to get recruited , but couldn t do it personally because he was moving his family down from california so it was me sitting there with two vcrs recording my own stuff and it ended up being a very pooratbest highlight film it was me and my mom personally calling teams , asking if they wanted to take a look at me i had given up and was going to go jc and boise was recruiting a guy from rancho cucamonga , patrick chung they were recruiting him at safety they showed his film and said , who is this running back that you re playing against he said , that s ian johnson from damien they said , is it worth me going down there and looking at him \? he had all the power in the world to say , nah but he was like , he s definitely worth your time he gave us tons of problems so they came and said they loved the film and asked for another one within two weeks they d offered me an official visit and the day before i left on my visit they d offered me a full ride within three days i figured out that not only could i come here , but i could be happy here even if i wasn t playing football and it was a sold deal
mr blitzer so let s meet the candidates we 've asked for no opening statements however , i 'd like to ask each candidate to in one short sentence , about five seconds or so , to introduce themselves to the voters of new hampshire let me begin with an example i'm wolf blitzer , and i'm with cnn \( laughter \) let s start across the stage , and we 'll begin with tom tancredo rep tancredo hi i'm tom tancredo i'm a member of congress , have been for 10 years thank you for letting me join you here this evening mr thompson my name is thompson , tommy i'm the candidate , not the actor \( laughter \) i was governor for 14 years and secretary for health and human services in bush s cabinet sen brownback i'm sam brownback i was raised on a farm near parker , kansas my wife , mary , and i have five children we live in topeka i'm a us senator in my third term mr romney my name is mitt romney i'm a husband , a father , a grandfather , a neighbor and formerly governor of the commonwealth of massachusetts mr giuliani i'm rudy giuliani i agree with the motto of your state , live free or die and i think it would be a pretty good one for our time sen mccain i'm john mccain i 've had the honor of serving my country all of my life mr huckabee i'm mike huckabee for 10 and a half years , i was governor of arkansas i'm from the small town of hope you may have heard of it all i ask you is , give us one more chance \( laughter \) rep hunter i'm duncan hunter , four years chairman of the armed services committee and in congress 26 years and i stand for a strong national defense , an enforceable border , bringing back american jobs mr gilmore i'm jim gilmore , the former governor of the commonwealth of virginia , former chairman of the national commission for the united states government on terrorism and weapons of mass destruction rep paul i'm ron paul i'm a congressman from texas , serving in my 10th term i am the champion of the constitution mr blitzer gentlemen , thank you very much for those brief selfintroductions let s begin our questioning right now , tom fahey of the new hampshire union leader with the first question mr fahey thanks , wolf governor romney , i wanted to start by asking you a question on which every american has formed an opinion we 've lost 3 , 400 troops civilian casualties are even higher , and the iraqi government does not appear ready to provide for the security of its own country knowing everything you know right now , was it a mistake for us to invade iraq \? mr romney well , the question is kind of a non sequitur , if you will , and what i mean by that or a null set and that is that if you 're saying let s turn back the clock , and saddam hussein had opened up his country to iaea inspectors , and they 'd come in and they 'd found that there were no weapons of mass destruction , had saddam hussein , therefore , not violated united nations resolutions , we would n't be in the conflict we 're in but he did n't do those things , and we knew what we knew at the point we made the decision to get in i supported the president s decision based on what we knew at that time i think we were underprepared and underplanned for what came after we knocked down saddam hussein by the way , harry reid was wrong we did not lose the war in iraq and that s not the sort of thing you say when you have men and women in harm s way we did , however , not do a great job after we knocked down saddam hussein and won the war to take him down , and his military and at this stage , the right thing for us to do is to see if we can possibly stabilize the central government in iraq so that they can have stability and so we can bring our troops home as soon as possible not to do that adds an enormous potential risk that the whole region could be embroiled in a regional conflict mr blitzer governor , thank you , but the question was , knowing what you know right now not what you knew then , what you know right now was it a mistake for the united states to invade iraq \? mr romney well , i answered the question by saying it s a it s a non sequitur , it s a null set kind of question , because you can go back and say , if we knew then what we know now , by virtue of inspectors having been let in and giving us that information , by virtue of if saddam hussein had followed the un resolutions , we would n't be having this this discussion so it s a hypothetical that i think is an unreasonable hypothetical and the answer is , we did what we did we did the right thing based on what we knew at that time i think we made mistakes following the conduct or the collapse of saddam s government mr blitzer mayor giuliani , same question to you was it knowing what you know right now , was it a good decision \? mr giuliani absolutely the right thing to do it s unthinkable that you would leave saddam hussein in charge of iraq and be able to fight the war on terror and the problem is that we see iraq in a vacuum iraq should not be seen in a vacuum iraq is part of the overall terrorist war against the united states the problem the democrats make is they 're in denial that s why you hear things like you heard in the debate the other night , that , you know , iran really is n't dangerous it s 10 years away from nuclear weapons iran is not 10 years away from nuclear weapons , and the danger to us is not just missiles , the danger to us is a state like iran handing nuclear weapons over to terrorists , so it has to be seen in that light , and we have to be successful in iraq mr blitzer senator mccain , arguably , going to war is the most important decision a member of the senate can make did you read the national intelligence estimate , which included all the caveats , on whether or not there were weapons of mass destruction in iraq \? sen mccain i did not read that particular document i received hundreds of briefings , tens and hundreds of hours of study and background and information on it and the fact is , that the sanctions were breaking down the sanctions were not going to hold we had a multibilliondollar scandal in the form of oilforfood the fact is that saddam hussein had used weapons of mass destruction before on his own people and on his enemies , and if he 'd gotten them again , he 'd have used them again that was his commitment and his belief that he was going to , and he did the right thing the problem was the mismanagement of the conflict mr blitzer thank you , senator senator brownback , you 're also a member of the united states senate did you read that classified national intelligence estimate \? sen brownback i do n't remember that report i had a number of briefings and i held a number of committee hearings at that time , i was chairing the middle east subcommittee on foreign relations and we held hearings on this topic and what was taking place and what saddam was doing but the issue is , is that we 've got to put forward now a political plan and that s something i'm going to introduce tomorrow , a political plan to create a threestate solution in iraq a kurdish state , a sunni state , a shi'a state because iraq is more three groups held together by exterior forces mr blitzer all right sen brownback and that s what we 've lacked , is a political plan to get us moving forward and success mr blitzer thank you thank you , senator governor gilmore , let me go to you you chaired this commission do you think it was appropriate that members of congress would authorize the president to go to war without reading that national intelligence estimate \? mr gilmore well , you know , i think the people who are in congress who are responsible for sending this country to war , with the enormous dangers that it has geopolitically and strategically , ought to read at least that kind of material i know they get a lot of stuff and they ca n't read everything but you know what , wolf , i think the true business is this the interest of the united states is in creating as much stability as possible in the middle east there is a very great danger to this country our interests in israel , our interests in energy , and in other ways there s a giant danger of the middle east becoming an unstable place saddam hussein was unstable , and so taking him out was good there , but we certainly did n't anticipate the further instability that was to come out mr blitzer we 're going to bring all of you in , but i want to go to scott spradling of wmur for the next question mr spradling thanks , wolf senator mccain , we 've just spent a few minutes looking back i 'd ask you to look forward now , if you will since june 1st , there have been at least 17 confirmed deaths of american soldiers in iraq approximately , 100 us troops are dying there every month if our top military commander in iraq , general petraeus , reports back to congress this september that the surge has n't significantly improved the situation on the ground , what then \? sen mccain well , let me say , first of all , i know how frustrated and saddened all americans are this morning i was with the family of matthew stanley of wolfeboro , who sacrificed his life , and our hearts and our sympathy goes out to all those who have sacrificed their lives in this conflict i , one , think this strategy needs to be given a chance to succeed we have n't barely gotten the fifth brigade over there , which is part of this strategy i am convinced that if we fail and we have to withdraw , they will follow us home it will be a base for al qaeda , and we will be facing greater challenges and greater sacrifices than that already made by matthew stanley and his family there is no doubt in my mind that this will become a base for terrorism , there will be chaos in the region and when senator clinton says this is mr bush s war , that this is president bush s war when president clinton was in power , i did n't say that bosnia , our intervention there was president clinton s war when we intervened in kosovo , i did n't say it was president clinton s war mr blitzer senator sen mccain what he what senator clinton does n't understand , that presidents do n't lose wars , political parties do n't lose wars nations lose wars and nations lose the have the consequences of failure mr blitzer senator sen mccain we must succeed in this conflict mr blitzer the question was , if general petraeus says \( applause \) it s not working so far in september , what do you do then \? sen mccain then you have to examine the options and i 'll tell you the options one is the division that sam described you would have to divide bedrooms in baghdad , because sunni and shi'a are married to each other you have 2 million sunni and 4 million shi'a living in baghdad together you would have to you withdraw to the borders and watch genocide take place inside baghdad you watch the destabilization of jordan you see further jeopardy of israel because of the threats of hezbollah and iranian hegemony in the region all of the options i could run through with you my friend , none of them are good that s why we must succeed and give it a chance to succeed mr blitzer all right let me bring in governor thompson go ahead , same question to you if general petraeus says it s not working in september , what should the us do then \? mr thompson the first thing the president should do is demand the almaliki government to vote as to whether or not they want the united states to stay in iraq we 've been there four years give the government the responsibility of voting if they vote yes , how are they going to help us win this war \? and if they vote no , we should redeploy our forces outside secondly , there are 18 territories in iraq , geographically defined those 18 territories , just like 50 states in america , should elect their state leaders and if they do so , the shi'ites will elect shi'ites , sunnis will elect sunnis , kurds will elect kurds and you know something \? people will go to those particular territories and you get rid of the civil war , internecine number three mr blitzer all right , we 've mr thompson i would like to have the oil revenue proceeds very quickly mr blitzer all right mr thompson oil revenue proceeds split one third to the federal government , one third to the states , and one third to every man woman and child , and that will get everybody a stake in their country mr blitzer let me bring in congressman duncan hunter congressman , if it s not working at that point , how much longer should the united states stay \? rep hunter well , wolf , you know , i read that nie report , and i held the briefings before we made the vote to go in i 'd invited everybody , democrat and republican , to get the classified information and this depends the turnover of the security apparatus depends on one thing reliable iraqi forces you got 129 iraq battalions we 've trained them up we 've got a lot of them in the fight over the next three to four months , we need to get them all in the fight , get them that combat capability when they 're combat hardened , we rotate them in , we displace american heavy combat forces off that battlefield , and americans come home and , wolf mr blitzer thank you rep hunter i can tell you , as the chairman of the armed services committee for the last four years , i have the credentials to leave iraq the right way mr blitzer congressman ron paul , how much longer should the united states stay in iraq \? mr paul the sooner we come home , the better if they declare there s no progress in september , we should come home it was a mistake to go , so it s a mistake to stay if we made the wrong diagnosis , we should change the treatment so we 're not making progress there and we should come home the weapons were n't there , and we went in under un resolutions and our national security was not threatened we 're more threatened now by staying \( applause \) mr blitzer governor huckabee , do you have confidence in the government of iraq , the government of prime minister nouri almaliki , that he s going to do what needs to be done \? mr huckabee i think there s some real doubt about that , wolf but i want to remind all of us on this stage and the people in the audience that there s a reason that this is such a struggle and i think we miss it over here in the west today s the birthday of ronald reagan we all would believe that ronald reagan is the one who ended the cold war , and ronald reagan is the one who helped bring about the collapse of the soviet union but there s a group of people who do n't believe that , and that s the taliban they believe they brought about the demise of the soviet union because of the way they fought in afghanistan and what i want to just mention is that it is not the size of the dog in the fight it is the size of the fight in the dog and we underestimate , grossly underestimate how fierce this dog and how determined they are to destroy every last one of us mr blitzer all right congressman tom tancredo , what do you say \? rep tancredo i 'll tell you this that if it comes to that point in time that you describe , that the surge is apparent that it is not working i did not support it i hope to god it does work i hope i'm wrong i hope we pacify iraq however , if it is apparent that we cannot , then we have to do and tell the iraqis the exact same thing that benjamin franklin said when he came out of the convention in 1787 and somebody said to him , dr franklin , what have you given us \? and he said , a republic , if you can keep it it is exactly that time and it is exactly that thing that we have to say to the iraqi government we have given you this we bought it with our blood and sweat it is now up to you to keep it and i want the iraqis to be in fact patrolling baghdad if they need vehicles , you let them have the vehicles but i want them patrolling their city and putting their lives at risk mr blitzer thank you well rep tancredo then we move out mr blitzer thank you , congressman i want to go to the next question \( applause \) i want to go back to tom tom , go ahead mr fahey thanks senator brownback , president bush has stated that states that sponsor terrorism are no different than terrorists themselves yet secretary of state condoleezza rice recently met with iranian officials to discuss security in iraq iran is a known supporter of hezbollah , hamas did president bush make the right call in opening a dialogue with iran \? sen brownback i think he made a right call on saying that about terrorist states , particularly iran but i think we have to at times talk with them in different situations , like before we went into afghanistan , we talked with iran it was n't we were negotiating we did n't open up formal diplomatic relations , and we should n't iran is the lead sponsor of terrorism ahmadinejad just this past week called for the destruction of israel , continues to call for attacking of the united states on iraq , i think we need to talk with him i think we have to confront them aggressively for what they are , which is the lead sponsor of terrorism in the world i think we need to push the sanctions forward more aggressively i think we need to more equip the labor union movement that s developing inside of iran they had a bus driver strike that recently took place and i think we have to show that purpose and resolve that we 're going to confront these guys , and we 're going to stand with our allies like israel , we 're going to stand against them oppressing and pushing us and trying to fund terrorists against us mr blitzer thank you , congressman congressman hunter , let me bring sen brownback senator , if you do n't mind mr blitzer excuse me senator sen brownback that s okay mr blitzer congressman hunter , let me bring you back in do you agree with senator brownback that president bush made the right decision in opening a direct dialogue with iran \? rep hunter with two conditions , and i think that you do have a dialogue with everybody , whether they 're adversaries or friends the two conditions are number one , they are moving deadly equipment across the border that is killing americans in iraq we have license to utilize anything that we want to use special operations , intelligence , whatever it takes to stop that deadly equipment from moving across the border and hitting americans in iraq , and we do n't give that up with these talks secondly , they 've got about a thousand centrifuges now working , enriching the materials that can make at some point a nuclear device the united states reserves the right to preempt , and we may have to preempt that nuclear weapons program we cannot allow them to have a nuclear device with those two caveats , talk to your enemies mr blitzer if it came down to a preemptive us strike against iran s nuclear facility , if necessary would you authorize as president the use of tactical nuclear weapons \? rep hunter i would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons if there was no other way to preempt those particular centrifuges when the osirak reactor that was hit `86 , when the six f18s came over the horizon and knocked that out , they did n't need anything but conventional weapons probably it s going to take a little more than that i do n't think it s going to take tactical nukes mr blitzer what do you think , mayor \? do you think if you were president of the united states and it came down to iran having a nuclear bomb , which you say is unacceptable , you would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons \? mr giuliani part of the premise of talking to iran has to be that they have to know very clearly that it is unacceptable to the united states that they have nuclear power i think it could be done with conventional weapons , but you ca n't rule out anything and you should n't take any option off the table and during the debate the other night , the democrats seemed to be back in the 1990s they do n't seem to have gotten beyond the cold war iran is a threat , a nuclear threat , not just because they can deliver a nuclear warhead with missiles they 're a nuclear threat because they are the biggest state sponsor of terrorism and they can hand nuclear materials to terrorists and we saw just last week in new york an attempt by islamic terrorists to attack jfk airport three weeks ago , an attempt to attack fort dix mr blitzer thank you mr giuliani these are real problems this war is not a bumper sticker this war is a real war mr blitzer thank you , mayor \( applause \) let me bring governor gilmore in what do you say about the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons if that s what it takes to go deep underground and destroy those iraqi facilities \? mr gilmore one of the central problems of the middle east is the desire for iran to dominate that portion of the world because of what they are doing and that is why i believe that they are seeking this kind of nuclear capacity that is one of the reasons why we are , in fact , in iraq and that s why our soldiers , when they fight and die there , are , in fact , serving the interests of the united states nobody ought to have any doubt about that with respect to iran , the policy i would follow would be dual number one , we need to work with our european allies in order to put in appropriate sanctions we need to communicate directly with the iranians that we are going to offer them an opportunity to work with us but we 're also going to say that having a nuclear weapon is unacceptable they need to understand it and all options are on the table by the united states in that instance mr blitzer all right , thank you , governor governor romney , i want to get you on the record do you agree with the mayor , the governor , others here , that the use of tactical nuclear weapons , potentially , would be possible if that were the only way to stop iran from developing a nuclear bomb \? mr romney you do n't take options off the table but what you do is stand back and say , what s going on here \? do you see what s happening in sudan and afghanistan , in iraq and iraq \? all over the world we 're seeing the same thing happening , and that is , people are testing the united states of america and we have to make sure they understand that we 're not arrogant we have resolve and we have the strength to protect our interests and to protect people who love liberty for that to happen , we 're going to have not just to attack each one of these problems one by one , but say , how do we help move the world of islam so that the moderate muslims can reject the extreme \? and for that to happen , we 're going to have to have a strong military and an effort to combine with our allies in such a way mr blitzer thank you mr romney that we combine for an effort to help move islam towards modernity that s what we 're going to have to do instead of looking at each theater one by one and saying we 'll bomb here , we 'll attack here , we 'll go to sudan mr blitzer thank you mr romney i watched the democrats they do n't think there s a war on terror mr blitzer thank you mr romney there is a war going on , and we need a broad response to make sure that these people have a different vision mr blitzer all right thank you , governor \( applause \) all of you are going to have an opportunity to weigh in on all of these questions as well if you 're hearing some sounds out there , it s lightning here in manchester , new hampshire those are the crackling sounds that you 're hearing let s go back to scott mr spradling thanks , wolf congressman tancredo , let s talk  rep tancredo okay mr spradling you opposed the immigration reform compromise calling it , quote , the worst piece of legislation to come down the pike in a long time just this morning , in manchester , you vowed to oust any senator who supports the bill , including possibly new hampshire s senior senator , judd gregg , who s undecided , and says to your comments that you are part of the no nothing wing of the political spectrum in the meantime , the president says his plan is the last best chance for serious immigration reform he s criticized conservatives for being obstructionists with that tension at stake , if this becomes law , what are the consequences for the country \? rep tancredo they are incredible and they are disastrous and that is exactly why i have said what i 've said , and that is why i have consistently tried to impress upon the american public the seriousness of this issue we 're not just talking about the number of jobs that we may be losing , or the number of kids that are in our schools and impacting our school system , or the number of people that are abusing our hospital system and taking advantage of the welfare system in this country we 're not just talking about that we 're talking about something that goes to the very heart of this nation whether or not we will actually survive as a nation and here s what i mean by that what we 're doing here in this immigration battle is testing our willingness to actually hold together as a nation or split apart into a lot of balkanized pieces we are testing our willingness to actually hold on to something called the english language , something that is the glue that is supposed to hold us together as a nation we are becoming a bilingual nation , and that is not good and that is the fearful part of this it has the ramifications are much , much more significant than any that we 've been discussing so far and so yes , i have said dramatic things and yes , i am willing to do what is ever \( sic \) necessary to try to stop this piece of legislation , and that includes go after any republican that votes for it , because the can stop this mr blitzer thank you thank you , congressman \( applause \) mayor giuliani , what do you think the consequences for the nation are if this immigration plan proposed by president bush goes through \? mr giuliani the problem with this immigration plan is it has no real unifying purpose it s a typical washington mess it s everybody compromises , four or five compromises , and the compromises leave you with the following conclusion the litmus test you should have for legislation is , is it going to make things better \? and when you look at these compromise , it is quite possible it will make things worse the organizing purpose should be that our immigration laws should allow us to identify everyone who is in this country that comes here from a foreign country they should have a tamperproof id card it should be in a database that allows you to figure out who they are , why they 're here , make sure they 're not illegal immigrants coming here for a bad purpose , and then to be able to throw out the ones who are not in that database we can do that credit card companies mr blitzer thank you mr giuliani take care of data that is greater than that mr blitzer thank you , mayor i want to get to senator mccain in a moment but first , governor romney , senator mccain has accused you of flipflopping on this issue , in effect yesterday in miami , he said the following pandering for votes on this issue while offering no solution to the problem amounts to doing nothing , and doing nothing is silent amnesty what do you say to senator mccain \? mr romney well , he s my friend he campaigned for me two times and i consider him a friend i'm not going to make this a matter of personal politics it s an issue that s way too important for that my view is that we should enforce immigration laws and this bill , unfortunately , has at least one provision that s a real problem it s the z visa and what it allows is people who 've come here illegally to stay here for the rest of their lives not necessarily as citizens they have to wait 13 years to become citizens that s not the point the point is , every illegal alien , almost every one , under this bill gets to stay here that s not fair to the millions and millions of people around the world that would love to come here mr blitzer all right mr romney and join with family members , bring skill and education that we need it s simply not fair to say those people get put ahead in the line of all the people who 've been waiting legally to come to this country mr blitzer all right \( applause \) senator or mccain , this is your chance i 'd like you i 'd like you to respond as someone who is the coauthor of this legislation sen mccain well , first of all , i agree with judd gregg he s a great senator \( applause \) second of all , rudy you just described our legislation , so i 'd be glad to have further conversation with you because it does account for people who are here illegally , it does have an employment verification system , and it weeds out those who should n't be here , and it gives others a chance to remain in this country look , this is a national security issue first and foremost ever since 9 11 it s a national security issue people came to fort dix , new jersey from across our southern border and tried to kill our soldiers for us to do nothing is silent and defacto amnesty what we have done is what you expect us to do , my friends , and that s come together with the president of the united states , the leader of our party , democrat and republican , conservative republicans like jon kyl , johnny isakson , saxby chambliss and trent lott , and sit down and figure out an approach to this problem and it is a serious national security problem we need to act , my friends , and if someone else has a better idea , i 'd love to have them give it to us \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer thank you , senator hold on sen rep mr i have a better idea sen mccain that that will get the support of enough people so that we can pass legislation this is n't the bill that i would have written , but it does mr blitzer all right thank you sen mccain it does satisfy our national security challenges , which are severe and intense , and we can not allow 12 million people mr blitzer thank you sen mccain washing around america illegally , my friends and i hope you 'll examine the legislation mr blitzer okay thank you , senator sen mccain and i hope we can move forward with it , and we can make it better mr blitzer all right sen mccain but it s our job to do the hard things , not the easy things \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer mayor , go ahead mr giuliani i 've read the 400 pages , and this is part of the problem in washington they say things and then it s not in the legislation there are four or five different methods of identification , not one it does not provide information about who exited the united states now tell me how you 're going to figure out who s in the united states , if you ca n't figure out who s left the united states and finally , it does n't provide for a uniform database many countries have this the united states does n't have it on september 11th , when we tried to figure out who was in this country , it took weeks to figure out who were the right people and who were n't , because there is n't such a database mr blitzer mayor , thank you mr giuliani and that is a fatal flaw in this legislation , and wishing it away does n't make it possible mr blitzer thank you \( applause \) governor romney , what would you do with the 12 million or so illegal immigrants who are right now in this country \? mr romney well , one is to enforce the law as it exists the law that was passed in 1986 \( applause \) the law passed in 1986 asked for us to secure the border and said also to put in place an employment verification system neither one of those was done so let s make sure that we enforce the law as it exists and if you want to improve this bill , well , one thing you could do to make it better is to take that z visa and make it temporary , instead of a permanent right to stay in america that s simply just not fair \( applause \) mr blitzer i want to stay on immigration everybody s going to have a chance to weigh in but let s go back to tom for another question on immigration mr fahey thank you congressman hunter , whether we like it or not , in cities across america , in counties across america , including your district in san diego , illegal immigrants are doing jobs that american citizens do n't want working on farms , in hotels , restaurants if you have your way and they all leave this country , who s going to fill those jobs \? rep hunter well , first , i disagree with that premise , because when they made the sweep on the swift plants those were the meat packaging plants in iowa took out some 850 people who were working there illegally several months ago , there were american citizens lined up the next day to get their jobs back at 18 bucks an hour now and let me tell you , this is a disastrous bill and if john mccain is right in saying that this is a national security issue and it is , border enforcement then the hunter bill , which was signed by the president on the 26th of october , mandating 854 miles of double fence not that scraggly little fence you show on cnn all the time , wolf , that people get across so easily if they get across my fence , we sign them up for the olympics immediately \( laughter \) we 've got a big fence but 854 miles of double border fence was mandated to be constructed homeland security has a billion bucks , cash on hand it s been six months , and they 've done 11 miles so administration has a case of the slows and i think they slowed the fence down so that they could come out with the amnesty at the same time , put the two together , and the bushmccainkennedy bill would then be accepted by conservatives and liberals alike mr blitzer thank you , congressman rep hunter it s a bad bill mr blitzer thank you , congressman \( applause \) senator brownback , what do you say about this notion of a pathway towards citizenship for these 12 million illegal immigrants who are in the country right now \? under what circumstances would you let them begin that path \? sen brownback i do n't think you create any new paths to citizenship but i also think you allow them to be able to use paths they would currently qualify for , and to be able to get in the back of the line and that s part of leadership and getting something resolved i think you know , we can go on a lot of slogans here and i 've been around this issue for a while i was in congress in 1994 , elected then we did the first immigration bill i was involved in then , in 1996 you know what , that was as enforcementonly bill in 1996 , and we had 7 million undocumented in the country then we 're at 12 \( million \) to 20 million now the point of saying that and my colleagues and people up here , everybody is concerned that we get something done and get something right i think if you do exterior enforcement , border enforcement , you do aggressive interior enforcement , and then you work on a comprehensive solution interior , that s something that a lot of people are going to be upset with , but that can work and move us forward and it s better than not doing anything mr blitzer thank you so you support this pending compromise legislation \? sen brownback if we can hold together those things in it , those things have to be in it mr blitzer so with you 're with you 're with senator mccain \? sen brownback if those things are in it mr blitzer what about you , governor thompson \? mr thompson wolf , the first thing you have to do is you got to secure the border mr he did n't say yes \( chuckles \) mr thompson securing the border is going to allow everything else to follow but unless you secure the border , it is not right to give 12 million individuals who have illegal rights into this country status before that border is protected there should be no amnesty and this bill , no matter how you cover it , is an amnesty bill and the people in this country do not believe in that bill , and they believe very much that the best hope for us is to have a secure border , just like congressman hunter has been talking about mr blitzer thank you mr thompson and every other republican up here have a secure border , then move on , but do n't do it the other way mr blitzer thank you , governor congressman paul , i want you to weigh in on this as well i believe and correct me if i'm wrong you voted o support that 700mile fence along the border between the united states and mexico did you \? rep paul i did mr blitzer what about canada \? is there a need for a similar fence along the border between the united states and canada \? rep paul no no , because that bill probably the fence was my weakest reason for doing that , but for other reasons to enforce the law was important , and border security is important and we 've talked about amnesty , which i'm positively opposed to but one thing that has not been mentioned here , which i think is very , very important if you subsidize something , you get more of it so we subsidize illegal immigration , we reward it by easy citizenship , either birthright or amnesty but we force our states and our local communities to pay for the health care and pay for the education why would n't they bring their families \? and because of our economic conditions , we do need workers but if we had a truly free market economy , the illegal immigrants would not be the scapegoat we would probably need them and they would be acceptable , but because of economic conditions , they have become the scapegoat mr blitzer okay thank you , congressman \( applause \) the other night sunday night , i asked the eight democratic presidential candidates whether or not they thought english should be the official language of the united states only one of them said english should be the official language of the united states if there s someone here who does n't believe english should be the official language of the united states , please speak up right now sen mccain \( laughs \) i think it s fine i would like to remind you that we made treaties with native americans , such as the navajos in my state , where we respect their sovereignty and they use their native language in their deliberations it s not a big deal but native americans are important to me in my state everybody knows that english has to be learned if anyone ever wants to move up the economic ladder that is obvious and part of our legislation , by the way , is a requirement to learn english and by the way , 30 percent of the people who are in this country illegally never came across our borders , my friends they overstayed their visas that s why it has to be a comprehensive approach and i'm proud of the support of the president and his brother , governor jeb bush , who was governor of the state of florida people who have to deal with this issue every day understand we have to act , my friends and we can have our own ways to improve it , but if we do n't address this issue , we are going to pay a heavy price because something bad could happen when 12 million people are in this country illegally two million of them having committed serious crimes \( applause \) mr blitzer i see people raising their hands but the question was , i 'd only like those to speak up who believe that english should not necessarily be the official language of the united states mr giuliani \( inaudible \) sen mccain \( inaudible \) mr blitzer is there anyone else who stands with senator mccain specifically on that question \? mr giuliani \( laughs \) \( i'm not going to give an answer \? \) mr blitzer all right we 're going to go back to scott rep hunter wolf , can i speak mr blitzer go ahead , scott \( cross talk \) rep hunter wolf \( off mike \) mr blitzer scott , go ahead rep hunter in my district can i speak up also \? mr blitzer you 'll have an opportunity go ahead , scott mr spradling okay this question s for governor gilmore conservative credentials is the topic , sir you 've gotten a lot of mileage out of lumping misters giuliani , mccain and romney together by calling them rudy mcromney now with former senator fred thompson likely to join you at the next debate , in your opinion is he conservative enough for america , or are we changing the name now to rudy mcromneyson \? \( laughter \) mr gilmore well , we 've gotten a little mileage out of rudy mcromney i know the mayor one time said that it would make a good ticket and it would , but it is n't a conservative ticket and we do n't know what fred thompson is either i think he s a fine man he served in the senate a term and a half let s see exactly what his views are i'm coming forward and offering my views as a 40year battler for conservative values and conservative principles on behalf of the people of the united states , and i have the record to back it up i 've been a prosecutor i 've been an attorney general i 've been a governor i governed as a conservative i cut taxes for the people of the commonwealth of virginia i 've stood by these principles for years and years the question is , when fred thompson comes into the race , as i believe he will , and maybe even speaker gingrich may come into the race , they will have to stand on their records and stand on their credentials and offer their ideas the same way that every person here on the stage is doing i look forward to that day , and i look forward to the debate mr blitzer thank you , governor governor thompson , is there a need for another thompson in this race \? \( laughter \) mr thompson i think that anybody with the thompson name should get involved if they want to get involved it s a great name , he s a great candidate , and i think it will help the republican party to have him in i just would like to say that if you 're talking about conservatism and that s what you 're talking about there is n't a candidate on either side of the aisle that has had as many vetoes as i have nobody has reduced taxes as much as i have and if you 're talking about a reliable conservative , it is this thompson tommy thompson , not the actor mr blitzer thank you thank you , governor mr thompson that s the conservative \( laughter \) mr blitzer thank you , governor mayor giuliani , there was some news here today a catholic bishop in rhode island said some words about your position on , suggesting that it was similar to pontius pilate s personal opposition to jesus christ s crucifixion but allowing it to happen anyway how does that make you feel when you hear words like that from a catholic bishop \? mr giuliani well , you know well , a catholic bishop \( off mike \) mr blitzer that s the lightning that s having an affect on mr giuliani \( laughs \) yeah , i know mr blitzer our system \( laughter , applause \) \( cross talk \) mr giuliani look , for someone who went to parochial schools all his life , this is a very frightening thing that s happening right now \( laughter \) but the reality is , i respect , you know , the opinion of catholic \( off mike \) religious leaders of all kinds religion is very important to me , it s a very important part of my life but ultimately , as a \( off mike \) i 've been in public life most of my life and taken oaths of office to enforce the law , i 've got to make the decisions that i think are the right ones in a country like ours and my view on abortion is that it s wrong , but that ultimately government should not be enforcing that decision on a woman that s that is my view that i i consult my religion , i consult my reading of the constitution , i consult my views of what i think are important in a pluralistic society , and the reality that we have to respect the fact that there are people that are equally as religious , equally as moral that make a different decision about this and should government put them in jail \? mr blitzer you made , governor romney , this decision on abortion , opposing abortion , relatively recently why should conservatives out there , people who oppose abortion believe you \? mr romney well , people can look at my record i'm not going to apologize for the fact that i became prolife i served as governor as i was governor , as we were debating cloning and as we were debating also embryo farming , i said roe v wade has gone too far i want to make it very clear that i'm prolife people here in new hampshire have seen that i 've fought for life i fought also for a traditional marriage , to keep taxes down , to have education in our schools that includes abstinence education i 've fought for english immersion in our schools i know that i 've got conservative credentials , and that s one of the things that brings me to this race but there s something bigger in conservatism that i do n't think we 've spoken about , and that is that america is a land of opportunity , and our future is going to be far brighter than our past , not just as we overcome these challenges , but as we take advantage of the new opportunity of the 21st century mr blitzer thank you very much , governor \( applause \) let s go back to tom for the next question mr fahey thank you governor huckabee , at a previous debate , you and two of your colleagues indicated that you do not believe in evolution you 're an ordained minister what do you believe \? is it the story of creation as it is reported in the bible or described in the bible \? mr huckabee it s interesting that that question would even be asked of somebody running for president i'm not planning on writing the curriculum for an eighthgrade science book i'm asking for the opportunity to be president of the united states but you 've raised the question , so let me answer it in the beginning , god created the heavens and the earth to me it s pretty simple , a person either believes that god created this process or believes that it was an accident and that it just happened all on its own and the basic question was an unfair question because it simply asks us in a simplistic manner whether or not we believed in my view whether there s a god or not well let me be very clear i believe there is a god i believe there is a god who was active in the creation process now , how did he do it , and when did he do it , and how long did he take \? i do n't honestly know , and i do n't think knowing that would make me a better or a worse president but i 'll tell you what i can tell the country if they want a president who does n't believe in god , there s probably plenty of choices but if i'm selected as president of this country , they 'll have one who believes in those words that god did create and as the words of martin luther , here i stand i can do no other and i will not take that back mr blitzer governor , but but \( applause \) i think the specific question the specific question is do you believe literally it was done in six days and it occurred 6 , 000 years ago \? mr huckabee no , i did answer that , wolf i said i do n't know my point is , i do n't know i was n't there \( laughter \) but i believe whether god did it in six days or whether he did it in six days that represented periods of time , he did it , and that s what s important but , you know , if anybody wants to believe that they are the descendants of a primate , they are certainly welcome to do it i do n't know how far they will march that back but i believe that all of us in this room are the unique creations of a god who knows us and loves us and who created us for his own purpose mr blitzer senator brownback , you \( applause \) recently elaborated on your position on this and i wonder if you 'd want to spend 30 seconds and tell our audience out there where you stand on the issue of evolution sen brownback i 'd be happy to and it s interesting that we 're doing this here , at st anselm s , who this that saint had a philosophy of faith seeking reason and that s the issue that s missing here , if i could highlight that point , is that i believe that we are created in the image of god for a particular purpose and i believe that with all my heart and i'm somebody i 've had cancer in the past i 've had a season to really look at this and study it and think about the end of life and i am fully convinced there s a god of the universe that loves us very much and was involved in the process how he did it , i do n't know one of the problems we have with our society today is that we put faith and science at odds with each other they are n't at odds with each other if they are , check your faith or check your science and we should have a discussion mr blitzer thank you sen brownback and we should engage faith and reason , like saint anselm did mr blitzer thank you sen brownback that s something we should do mr blitzer thank you , senator brownback \( applause \) senator mccain , do you believe creationism should be taught alongside evolution in the nation s schools \? sen mccain no , i believe that s up to the school districts but i think that every american should be exposed to all theories but i ca n't say it more eloquently than pastor huckabee governor huckabee just did , and i admire his description , because i hold that view the point is that the time before time there s no doubt in my mind that the hand of god was in what we are today and i do believe that we are unique , and i believe that god loves us but i also believe that all of our children in school can be taught different views on different issues but i leave the curricula up to the school boards mr blitzer thank you , senator , for that governor romney , there was a recent poll here in new hampshire ten percent said they would n't vote for you because you 're a mormon and last week we saw that picture of that man who refused to shake your hand because you are a mormon what would you like to say to the voters out there tonight about your faith , about yourself and about god \? mr romney well , president kennedy some time ago said he was not a catholic running for president he was an american running for president and i'm happy a proud member of my faith you know , i think it s a fair question for people to ask , what do you believe \? and i think , as you want to understand what i believe , you could recognize that the values that i have are the same values you 'll find in faiths across this country i believe in god , believe in the bible , believe jesus christ is my savior i believe that god created man in his image i believe that the freedoms of man derive from inalienable rights that were given to us by god and i also believe that there are some pundits out there that are hoping that i 'll distance myself from my church so that that 'll help me politically , and that s not going to happen \( applause \) mr blitzer thank you , governor , for that congressman paul , you ran for president once before as a libertarian what do you say about this whole issue of church and state and these issues that are coming forward right now \? rep paul well , i think we should read the first amendment , where it says , congress shall write no law and we should write a lot less laws regarding this matter it should n't be a matter of the president or the congress it should be local people , local officials the state should determine so many of these things that we just do n't need more laws determining religious things or prayer in school we should allow people at the local level that s what the constitution tells us we do n't need somebody in washington telling us what we can do , because we do n't have perfect knowledge and that s the magnificence of our constitution and our republic we sort out the difficult problems at local levels and we do n't have one case fit all , because you have a supreme court ruling like on roe versus wade it \( ruined \? \) it for the whole country mr blitzer thank you rep paul and that s why we should n't have it at a central level mr blitzer thank you , congressman let s go back to another question from tom mr fahey mayor giuliani , sea levels around the world are rising average temperatures are increasing a un report written by scientists from 113 countries recently said that is very likely manmade and may affect us for centuries to come is science wrong on global warming \? and what , if any , steps would you take as president to address the issue of climate change \? mr giuliani i think we have to accept the view that scientists have that there is global warming and that human operation , human condition , contributes to that and the fact is that there is a way to deal with it and to address it in a way that we can also accomplish energy independence , which we need as a matter of national security it s frustrating and really dangerous for us to see money going to our enemies because we have to buy oil from certain countries we should be supporting all the alternatives we need a project similar to putting a man on the moon that project started with eisenhower it was carried out by kennedy and then johnson and then nixon and that was two democrats and two republicans working \( audio difficulties \) working in the national interest mr blitzer thank you , mayor i want governor romney to weigh in as well there s a perception , at least among some , that republicans are at least the republican party very close to big oil a lot of americans are suffering now from the price of gasoline , the high price of gasoline what do you say to that the audience out there who believes that there s too much of an alliance , if you will , between the big oil companies and republicans \? mr romney well , first of all , rudy giuliani is right in terms of an apollo project to get us energy independent , and the effects of that on global warming are positive it s a noregrets policy it s a great idea secondly , with regards to big oil , big oil is making a lot of money right now , and i 'd like to see them using that money to invest in refineries do n't forget that when companies earn profit , that money is supposed to be reinvested in growth and our refineries are old someone said to me matt simons , an investment banker down in houston , he said our refineries today are rust with paint holding them up and we need to see these companies , if they 're making that kind of money , reinvest in capital equipment but let s not forget , where the money is being made this year is not just throughout these years is not just in exxon and shell and the major oil companies , it s in the countries that own this oil russia last year took in 500 billion by selling oil ahmadinejad , putin , chavez these people are getting rich off of people buying too much oil and that s why we have to pursue , as a strategic imperative , energy independence for america and it takes that apollo project it also takes biodiesel , biofuel , ethanol mr blitzer thank you mr romney cellulosic ethanol , nuclear power , more drilling in anwr we have to be serious also about efficiency mr blitzer thank you , governor mr romney and that s going to allow us to become energy independent mr blitzer senator mccain , do you have a problem at this time with these oil companies making these huge profits \? sen mccain sure , i think we all do and they ought to be reinvesting it and one of the areas that they ought to be involved in is nuclear power nuclear power is safe , nuclear power is green does not green emit greenhouse gases nuclear power is used on navy ships which have sailed around the world for 60 years without an accident and of course we ought to be investing in alternate energy sources recently there was a group of retired military officers who said that climate change an energy independence is a national security issue it is we 've got to reduce our dependence on imported oil we can do it through a wide variety of alternative fuels but we have to be serious about it , and we 're going to have to go places where we have never gone before and nuclear power is one of the major issues , but also all kinds of ethanol as well , so mr blitzer thank you thank you , senator let me bring congressman paul back into this conversation in 2005 , president bush signed an energy bill that provided billions of dollars in tax breaks , subsidies to the oil companies with the goal of boosting domestic production at a time of these record profits do you believe these companies need a helping hand from the federal government \? rep paul i do n't think the profits is the issue the profits are okay if they 're legitimately earned in a free market what i object to are subsidies to big corporations when we subsidize them and give them rd money i do n't think that should be that way they should take it out of the funds that they earn but i'm also you ca n't discuss energy without discussing our foreign policy why why do we go to the middle east \? you know that oil is very important about the middle east and why we 're there why did we , our government , help overthrow mossadeq in 1953 \? it had to do with oil so our foreign policy is designed to protect our oil interests the profits that s not the problem it s the problem that we succumb to the temptation to protect oil interests by literally going out and fighting wars over oil mr blitzer governor gilmore , you agree \? mr gilmore i agree that if you make profits in the open marketplace that that s an appropriate thing to do i also believe that they should be going in , putting this additional money into additional drilling , into additional exploration , but it s going to have to be bigger than that we 're going to have to in fact look to all sources ethanol , biomass , all coal , clean coal , the opportunities for natural gas , and nuclear power and by the way , nuclear power will help this whole issue of global warming and one more point in direct answer to your question , the kyoto treaty was in fact fatally flawed that was a treaty that in fact was going to basically just transfer money directly to russia for nothing because they were going to get credits because simply that their economy had declined the truth is , we 're going to have to get a program in place , an international diplomatic answer that is going to include every nation of the world in this entire project , and that includes china and india \( applause \) mr blitzer thank you , governor scott let me bring scott back for the next question mr spradling congressman paul , a question for you most of our closest allies , including great britain and israel , allow gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military is it time to end do n't ask , do n't tell policy and allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the us military \? rep paul i think the current policy is a decent policy and the problem that we have with dealing with this subject is we see people as groups , as they belong to certain groups and that they derive their rights as belonging to groups we do n't get our rights because we 're gays or women or minorities we get our rights from our creator as individuals so every individual should be treated the same way so if there is homosexual behavior in the military that is disruptive , it should be dealt with but if there s heterosexual sexual behavior that is disruptive , it should be dealt with so it is n't the issue of homosexuality , it s the concept and the understanding of individual rights if we understood that , we would not be dealing with this very important problem mr blitzer governor huckabee , i want you to weigh in as well \( applause \) do you believe it s time to allow homosexuals to serve openly in the united states military \? mr huckabee wolf , i think it s already covered by the uniform code of military conduct i think that s what congressman paul was saying it s about conduct , it s not about attitude but i 'd like to ask you you said a moment ago that you were going to all give us a chance to deal with the issue of immigration mr blitzer we 're going to come back to that mr huckabee and i hope you 'll do that mr blitzer we will we 'll come back to immigration mr huckabee you 've held us to it i want to hold you to it mr blitzer all right mr huckabee so if you 'll give us that opportunity mr blitzer you 're going to come back we 're going to come back we 're going to come back to immigration but right now we 're talking about allowing gays to serve openly in the military but you 're opposed to that mr huckabee i just said i think it s a matter it s not you do n't punish people for their attitudes you punish them if their behavior creates a problem and it s already covered by the uniform code of military conduct that s mr blitzer so you would n't change you would n't change existing policy mr huckabee i what \? mr blitzer you would n't change existing policy mr huckabee i do n't think that i would i think it s already covered by the existing policy that we do have , in fact mr blitzer mayor giuliani , recently we 've learned that several talented , trained linguists arabic speakers , farsi speakers , urdu speakers trained by the us government to learn those languages to help us in the war on terrorism were dismissed from the military because they announced they were gays or lesbians is that , in your mind , appropriate \? mr giuliani this is not the time to deal with disruptive issues like this back in 1994 we went through this and it created a tremendous amount of disruption colin powell , i think , was still the head of the joint chiefs of staff before he left at the beginning of the clinton administration he came to the view that this was a good policy and i think in time of war , in a time where we 're trying to deal with this transition to a new kind of warfare that we have to be fighting and we have n't gotten all the way there yet , we need a hybrid army , we need to look at nationbuilding as part of what we have to teach our military i do n't think this would be the right time to raise these issues mr blitzer thank you mr giuliani and i think we should rely on the judgment of our commanders in a situation like this they know what s disruptive and what s not and at a time of war , you do n't make fundamental changes like this mr blitzer thank you , mayor governor romney , the mayor referred to the do n't ask , do n't tell policy , which was implemented during the clinton administration , after bill clinton became president in 1994 you were quoted as saying that you advocated gays being able to serve openly and honestly in our nation s military the question to you is , do you still feel that way \? mr romney no , actually , when i first heard of the do n't ask , do n't tell policy , i thought it sounded awfully silly i did n't think that would be very effective and i turned out to be wrong it s been the policy now in the military for what , 10 , 15 years , and it seems to be working and i agree with what mayor giuliani said that this is not the time to put in place a major change , a social experiment , in the middle of a war going on i would n't change it at this point we can look at down the road but it does seem to me that we have much bigger issues as a nation we ought to be talking about than that policy right now mr blitzer senator mccain , you 've been involved in military matters your virtually your whole life what do you say \? sen mccain we have the besttrained , most professional , best equipped , most efficient , most wonderful military in the history of this country , and i'm proud of every one of them \( applause \) there just are n't enough of them so i have to rely on our military leadership , who in whom we place the responsibility to lead these brave young americans in combat as we speak so i think it would be a terrific mistake to even reopen the issue it is working , my friends the policy is working and i am convinced that that s the way we can maintain this greatest military as much as revere the greatest generation , as much as love my own generation , this is the very best let s not tamper with them mr blitzer is there anyone here who believes gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve openly in the united states military \? if you do , speak up now \( silence \) scott , go ahead with your question mr spradling gentlemen , last night \( sic \) we asked democrats , if they were elected , what role would they use former president clinton i'm not going to ask you that \( laughter \) sen brownback thank you mr spradling but governor thompson , i 'd like to know , seeing as how you were a member of president bush s cabinet as health and human services secretary , how would you use george w bush in your administration \? mr thompson i certainly would not send him to the united nations \( laughter \) i believe george w bush has tremendous characteristics he s very honest , he s very straightforward i would put him out on a lecture series talking to the youth of america about honesty , integrity , perseverance , passion , and serving the public george w bush believes very much in public service , as does his father , as does his brothers , as does his mother i think he could be a wonderful spokesperson making sure that young people realize that public service is a very noble cause and something that young people should aspire here , like all the young people here on this campus should also have the opportunity to serve in public life mr blitzer senator brownback , same question to you if you 're elected president , what would you ask your predecessor to do \? sen brownback well , i would talk with him about it first and i would ask him about it i think he would probably take a position the way his dad did , saying , you know , i think you need to have your time in the limelight , and i 'll be willing to help out if you have a tragedy overseas his father s been excellent the tsunami that hit sri lanka and other places in helping fundraising he s been a wonderful ambassador in those sorts of situations and frankly , i think that s the right role for an expresident and i really think in many respects president clinton has not assumed the right role of an expresident , where he s injected himself a lot more on policy issues that have n't been appropriate , and he really should defer more to the person that s in the job there s one person that s president at a time , and that s the way it should be mr blitzer congressman tancredo , i see you anxious to weigh in rep tancredo thank you some time ago , 2003 i think it was , i got a call from karl rove who told me that because of my criticism of the president , i should never darken the doorstep of the white house i have been so disappointed in the president in so many ways since his actually for the last several years , not just the immigration issue , but several other things , including the no child left behind and the massive increase in government that we call prescription drug medicare prescription drug , that i'm afraid i would have to tell the president of the united states i mean as president , i would have to tell george bush exactly the same thing karl rove told me mr blitzer thank you , congressman \( applause \) governor huckabee , you served , as you reminded us , a long time as a governor , republican governor , of arkansas your old job is now in democratic hands here in new hampshire the gop has suffered some significant losses as well , and the republicans lost the majority in the house and the senate , as you well know simple question what s happened to the gop \? mr huckabee lost credibility because we did n't do what we were hired to do when you 're elected , you 're hired to do a job you 're hired to cut spending , lower taxes , bring more government back to the local people we did the polar opposite , and the people fired us and i think in many ways , although there are some good people that got caught up in the tsunami of the 2006 elections , the republican party as a whole deserved to get beat we 've lost credibility the way we bungled katrina , the fact that there was corruption that was unchecked in washington , and the fact that there was a feeling that there was not a proper handling of the iraqi war in all of these details , and the indifference to people pouring over our borders and let me just add this , wolf , there are a lot of people for whom the immigration issue is like a \( lot of them \? \) they see washington not taking the kind of positions to build a fence , and they know that when they go to the airport to get on an airplane they have to show photo id , they have to go through layers of security , and they do n't understand why someone coming across an international border does n't have to do the same thing mr blitzer thank you thank you , governor \( applause \) congressman hunter , i want to just did he raise the issue he raised the issue of corruption do you think it would be appropriate for president bush to pardon lewis scooter libby , who was sentenced today to 30 months in prison for his role in the cia leak case \? rep hunter you know , i think , wolf , to make a determination on that , you 'd have to look at the transcript i 'll tell you a couple transcripts i have looked it , and that s the agents , compean and ramos , who were given 11 and 12 years respectively for stopping a drug dealer bringing 750 pounds of drugs across the border i 've looked at their transcript i would pardon compean and ramos right now and let me say \( interrupted by applause \) and let me say with respect to what mike said , we got to bring back the reagan democrats to this party because we need the reagan democrats , republican leadership to work , and we 're going to have to get a good trade bill that brings jobs back to this country we 're going to have to stop china from cheating on trade build the middle class , build jobs , wolf that s what strengthens the republican party mr blitzer all right thank you , congressman i just want to do a quick yes or no , and i'm going to go down the rest of the group and let everybody just tell me yes or no , would you pardon scooter libby \? rep paul no mr gilmore no i'm steeped in the law i would n't do that rep hunter no , not without reading the transcript mr huckabee not without reading the transcript sen mccain he s going through an appeal process we 've got to see what happens here mr giuliani i think the sentence was way out of line i mean , the sentence was grossly excessive in a situation in which at the beginning , the prosecutor knew who the leak was mr blitzer so yes or no , would you pardon him \? mr giuliani and he knew a crime was n't committed i recommended over a thousand pardons to president reagan when i was associate attorney general i would see if it fit the criteria for pardon i 'd wait for the appeal i think what the judge did today argues more in favor of a pardon mr blitzer thank you mr giuliani because this is excessive punishment mr blitzer all right mr giuliani when you consider i 've prosecuted 5 , 000 cases mr blitzer i'm trying to get a yes or no \( laughter \) mr giuliani well , this is a very important issue this is a very , very important a man s life is at stake and the reality is , this is an incomprehensible situation they knew who the leak was mr say , wolf , can i explain \( off mike \) mr giuliani and ultimately , there was no underlying crime involved mr blitzer all right mr romney this is one of those situations where i go back to my record as governor i did n't pardon anybody as governor because i did n't want to overturn a jury but in this case , you have a prosecutor who clearly abused prosecutorial discretion by going after somebody when he already knew that the source of the leak was richard armitage he 'd been told that so he went on a political vendetta mr blitzer so is that a yes \? mr romney it s worth looking at that i will study it very closely , if i'm lucky enough to be president , and i 'd keep that option open mr blitzer senator \? sen brownback yes the basic crime here did n't happen mr blitzer all right sen brownback what they were saying was that the identity of an agent was revealed mr blitzer governor \? sen brownback but that agent has to be in the field for that to be a crime that did n't occur mr blitzer governor \? mr thompson bill clinton committed perjury in a grand jury lost his law license scooter libby got 30 months to me , it s not fair at all but i would make sure the appeal was done properly , and then i would examine the record mr blitzer congressman \? rep tancredo yes mr blitzer yes all right we heard from all of them \( applause \) we 're ready to take go into part two of tonight s debate right now where voters from new hampshire will have an opportunity to ask their questions we have some work to do here on the stage while we move some chairs around , move out the podiums , while we do all that and you 'll be able to see it viewers of wmur are going to go back to their studios for the rest of you , i'm going to bring in my colleagues larry king and anderson cooper , part of the best political team on television , to give us a sense of this debate so far our debate here will resume in about three minutes larry \? \( break \) mr blitzer thanks very much , guys we 're now set here for our voters to ask questions , our pool of voters who are either registered republicans or independents , but they 're likely , likely to vote republican in new hampshire s firstin thenation primary we brought them together with the help from the new hampshire political library and the new hampshire institute of politics cnn producers have interviewed all of them working with me in this half of the debate is jennifer vaughn from our partner wmurtv jennifer , who has the first question \? ms vaughn thank you , wolf and good evening to you all tonight i have erin flanagan with me tonight hi , erin q hi , jennifer ms vaughn you live in bedford , new hampshire q i do ms vaughn you have a question about the war in iraq , which is something that is deeply personal to you q it is unfortunately , my beloved little brother , 1st lieutenant michael joseph cleary , was killed in action in taji , iraq , eight days before he was to return home , on december 20th of 2005 he was the best of the best , and answered the call to serve our country my family has been devastated by the loss as a member of an american family who has suffered so greatly at the choices made by the current administration , i desperately would like to know what you , as commander in chief , would do , both in the halls of the american government to bring the parties together , as well as on the desert sands of the middle east , to bring this conflict to a point at which we can safely bring our troops home thank you ms vaughn erin , thank you congressman hunter , let s begin with you on that rep hunter okay , absolutely the key to leaving and incidentally , thank you for his service and i want to let you know \( interrupted by applause \) i want you to know that my son , duncan , the day after 9 11 , joined the marine corps quit his job , did two tours in iraq he s in afghanistan right now first , i want you to know that it s worth it \( applause \) what he did was worth it and if we can achieve a country in iraq that will not be a state sponsor of terrorism for the next five , to 10 to 20 years that will be a friend , not an enemy of the united states that will have a modicum of freedom , that is in the national interest of the united states , just like establishing a free japan on the other side of the pacific was in our interest after world war ii , just like providing freedom and a protective shield for salvador in central america was in our interest so what i would do and what we need to do right now and we are doing is standing up the iraqi army there s 129 battalions of iraqis that we 've trained and equipped we need to start moving them into the combat zones , where they displace the heavy american combat forces then we can pull our forces out , we can bring them home mr blitzer thank you rep hunter or send them wherever uncle sam needs them again mr blitzer thank you rep hunter that s how we leave iraq the right way mr blitzer thank you , congressman senator brownback , i 'd like you to weighin sen brownback if i could , and thank you for your family s service and what your brother did that s incredible and an incredible gift that he and your family have given us and i think you identified the right thing it s not about leaving and it s not about being defeated it s about getting the situation to a point that we can turn it over to iraqis and then us pull back from the front of the line that s why i'm putting forward tomorrow a bill and this would be about a threestate solution in iraq a kurdish state , a sunni state , a shi'a state with baghdad as the federal city , in a loose , weak , federated system , oil revenues equally divided , and it s a bipartisan bill we will have bipartisan support we 've got to pull together here to win over there mr blitzer senator sen brownback and we can do this together , but we have n't put yet forward , this administration , a political solution that we can like mr blitzer thank you sen brownback that will be long term and durable mr blitzer thank you , senator sen brownback that s what we 've got to do mr blitzer senator mccain , is that a good idea to divide up iraq into three separate sen brownback it s not divided mr blitzer three states sen brownback three states , one country sen mccain it s not , and i want to tell you , thank you for your brother s service and sacrifice to our country we are proud of you and your endurance , and we 're proud of your sacrifice this war i'm going to give you a little straight talk this war was very badly mismanaged for a long time , and americans have made great sacrifices , some of which were unnecessary because of this management of the mismanagement of this conflict i believe we have a fine general i believe we have a strategy which can succeed , so that the sacrifice of your brother would not be in vain that a whole 20 or 30 million people would have a chance to live a free life in an open society and practice their religion no matter what those differences are and i believe if we fail , it will become a center of terrorism , and we will ask more young americans to sacrifice , as your brother did this is long and hard and tough , but i think we can succeed and god bless you mr blitzer thank you , senator \( applause \) jennifer , go ahead with your next question ms vaughn cynthia kiernan is here with us tonight cynthia , you live in merrimack , new hampshire you can go ahead and stand up you brought your husband with you ms kiernan yes michael served in iraq and we have a question regarding the government in iraq everyone s talking about pull our troops out , pull our troops out well , considering they 've lived under a dictatorship for the last 30 years or so , what are we going to do to make sure they have a government in place before we do pull our troops out and they 're able to help themselves \? otherwise we 're just putting them in a position to accept another terrorist leader ms vaughn congressman paul \? rep paul well , we 've had four years to do this and it has n't worked the biggest incentive for them to take upon themselves the responsibility is just for us to leave we do n't need to lose 100 men and women every month , more than 1 , 000 per year and so you want it done you want them to take over you 've got to give them an incentive so i think we should immediately stop patrolling the streets that s a policeman s job it s not the work of the army we 're not fighting a military battle we 're in a different type of warfare right now so the sooner we recognize that , the sooner we can make sure that no more americans will die we have a lot of goodness in this country and we should promote it , but never through the barrel of a gun we should do it by setting good standards , motivating people , and have them want to emulate us but you ca n't enforce our goodness like the neocons preach with an armed force it does n't work woodrow wilson was telling us about that in promoting democracy a long time ago mr blitzer thank you rep paul it does n't work , and we have to admit it mr blitzer thank you , congressman \( applause \) let me bring mayor giuliani in i do n't know if you consider yourself a neocon , but go ahead and respond to what congressman paul said mr giuliani \( laughs \) michael , thank you very much for serving us , and thank your family for their tremendous sacrifice i 'd like to put it in a slightly different context i believe that your service for us and your brother s sacrifice is one of the reasons we 're safe now in the united states i believe that this terrorist war began way back in the 1970s they attacked us in 1993 in new york they attacked us again in 2001 in a horrible way and i believe that what we 're doing in iraq , if we can get it right , is going to help reduce the risk for this country and if we get it wrong , it s going to be much , much worse for us and part of what we have to do , and we have n't done right , is take on that responsibility of nationbuilding we created that responsibility for ourselves when we overthrew saddam hussein , which we did very effectively it was one of the greatest military actions in american history overthrowing saddam hussein but we did n't accomplish the second step people can only embrace democracy when they have an orderly existence , and we have to help province that we did n't want that role , but it is our role we have to train our military to do it we should probably have an iraq stat program , in which we measure how many people are going to school , how many factories are open , how many people are going to back to work we had to get into the nittygritty of putting an orderly society together in iraq it is not too late to do it and i 'd just like to ask the one question i did n't get to ask before when you said if general petraeus comes back in september and reports that things are n't going well , what are we going to do \? but suppose general petraeus comes back in september and reports that things are going pretty well are we going to report that with the same amount of attention that we report the negative news \? \( applause \) mr blitzer jennifer , go ahead ms vaughn kysa crusco is here with us tonight hi , kysa q hi ms vaughn you live in manchester , new hampshire you are an attorney q i am ms vaughn okay what s your question tonight \? q my question is whether you believe that a conservative platform can also include a conservationist agenda , and if so , how ms vaughn governor gilmore mr gilmore the question was whether or not a conservative agenda can also have a conservation agenda and i think that it can certainly when i was governor of the state of virginia , we worked very hard in order to make virginia a beautiful place and a place where we could in fact be welcoming to people and that it would be a nice community for people to visit but at the end of the day , this is going to come down to the question of whether or not conservatism can match up with energy independence , which is a national security issue and it is the fundamental part of conservatism conservatism means empowering people it means cutting taxes and controlling government spending it also means national security and national security means a lot of different elements right at this time and we 're discussing some of them tonight and i can assure the people who are families here tonight , there are young people , younger men and women , who are on the battle lines , and people who are committing their lives they are in fact serving the national interests of this country in a time of major crisis the other two issues , however , would also go to the issue of the immigration issue , which i want to come back to at some point , but also energy independence and energy independence also can serve the interests of conservation , particularly if we use nuclear power and other clean forms of energy so that we can in fact make this a clean society that is also safe and secure for the nation mr blitzer all right thank you very much , governor congressman tancredo , do you believe true conservatives should be doing more to protect the environment \? rep tancredo yeah the i think that that s absolutely imperative , and i think so because frankly , you 've got a conservative model to pick from i mean , you know , teddy roosevelt after all put the stamp on that the whole issue of conserving the environment , creating the national parks system there is nothing anti conservative about doing anything like that and you know what else you can do in order to foster that , you do it through conservative principles you make it profitable for people to do exactly that to put to make conservation an issue that is it hurts people in the pocketbook , or they can profit by getting involved in conservation that s one way the free market really works perfectly we 've seen it happen all over the world we can see and we will put conservation to work conservation practices to work in the united states through conservative principles we have a lock on that mr blitzer thank you , congressman jennifer , go ahead ms vaughn good evening , sir you are doug hall doug hall yes ms vaughn i understand that you 're the town moderator for chichester , new hampshire mr hall i am ms vaughn what s your question tonight \? mr hall i know a business owner in northern new hampshire who was on vacation in spain last year for about three weeks while he was there he had to buy refills for prescription drugs brandname drugs and he discovered in buying those drugs that he could buy his refills there for 600 less than he could by them here in new hampshire so since then , he s said he is going to take a trip over to spain and get his vacation paid for to buy his drugs my question to you is , why is this \? and if you are elected president , is there anything you would do to address it \? ms vaughn mayor giuliani \? mr giuliani what i would do is change the whole model that we have for health insurance in this country the problem with our health insurance is it s government and employerdominated people do n't make individual choices it s your health you should own your health insurance we should be giving you a major tax deduction 15 , 000 for a family so you can buy your own health insurance if you buy health insurance for 8 , 000 \( dollars \) or 9 , 000 \( dollars \) , you 'll save five \( thousand dollars \) or 6 , 000 in taxfree money then we should have a health savings account in which you can put some money aside to pay for your ordinary medical expenses health insurance should become like homeowners insurance or like car insurance you do n't cover everything in your homeowners policy if you have a slight accident in your house , if you need to refill your oil with your car , you do n't cover that with insurance but that is covered in many of the insurance policies because they 're government dominated and they 're employer dominated what the democrats suggested on this stage two nights ago was socialized medicine there s a man in california who said to me , when we make health insurance free , just wait and see how expensive it will become and the reality is that we need a free market we need 100 million americans making different decisions that will bring down the cost of health insurance , it will bring down the cost of prescription medicines freemarket principles are the only things that reduce cost and improve quality socialized medicine will ruin medicine in the united states \( applause \) mr blitzer thank you , mayor congressman hunter , you live on the border , san diego not far from mexico a lot of americans go to mexico to buy cheaper prescription drugs a lot of americans in this part of the country go to canada to buy cheaper prescription drugs what should we here in the united states be doing to bring down the price of prescription drugs \? rep hunter and wolf , the fabulous grampy \( sp \) , my fatherin law , who lives with us , is one of those people that trots down and goes through the border at yuma and does that so lots of americans do that but here s what happens eighty percent of the new drugs and new inventions that save our lives , that help preserve the lives of the relatives of everyone who s in this particular room right now , 80 percent of those inventions are made in the united states because we have free enterprise , where people can go out , invest , and maybe they drill three dry holes in trying to produce a good drug that will save somebody s life , then maybe they hit the jackpot and they produce something that will save people and help their health they then recover their money in the united states , and what they have left over in terms of market , they put into the third world but third world countries like mexico could never provide the amount of money that it takes to make those inventions otherwise , they would here s what we have to do we need o be able to buy our health care insurance across state lines , wolf right now the same single policy that can be purchased in long beach for 73 costs 334 in new jersey the states lock up the insurance industry they wo n't let americans buy across state lines just like they do everything else if we 're able to do that , we 're going to bring down the cost of health insurance mr blitzer thank you , congressman jennifer , let s go back to another question ms vaughn also on the topic of health care tonight , this is a question from our wmur blogger , who is joshua williamson joshua asks millions of americans are dissatisfied with the current state of our health care system , and us employers are at a disadvantage due to the high cost of health insurance but that is covered in many of the insurance policies because they 're government dominated and they 're employer dominated what the democrats suggested on this stage two nights ago was socialized medicine there s a man in california who said to me , when we make health insurance free , just wait and see how expensive it will become and the reality is that we need a free market we need 100 million americans making different decisions it will bring down the cost of health insurance it will bring down the cost of prescription medicines freemarket principles are the only things that reduce cost and improve quality socialized medicine will ruin medicine in the united states \( applause \) mr blitzer thank you , mayor congressman hunter , you live on the border , san diego , not far from mexico a lot of americans go to mexico to buy cheaper prescription drugs a lot of americans in this part of the country go to canada to buy cheaper prescription drugs what should we here in the united states be doing to bring down the price of prescription drugs \? rep hunter and wolf , the fabulous grampy , my fatherinlaw , who lives with us , is one of those people that trots down and goes through the border at yuma and does that so lots of americans do that but here s what happens eighty percent of the new drugs and new inventions that save our lives , that help preserve the lives of the relatives of everyone who s in this particular room right now , 80 percent of those inventions are made in the united states because we have free enterprise , where people can go out , invest , and maybe they drill three dry holes in trying to produce a good drug that will save somebody s life , then maybe they hit the jackpot and they produce something that will save people and help their health they then recover their money in the united states , and what they have left over in terms of market , they put into the third world but third world countries like mexico could never provide the amount of money that it takes to make those inventions otherwise , they would here s what we have to do we need to be able to buy our health care insurance across state lines , wolf right now the same single policy that can be purchased in long beach for 73 costs 334 in new jersey the states lock up the insurance industry they wo n't let americans buy across state lines just like they do everything else if we 're able to do that , we 're going to bring down the cost of health insurance mr blitzer thank you , congressman jennifer , let s go back to another question ms vaughn also on the topic of health care tonight , this is a question from our blogger , who is joshua williamson joshua asks millions of americans are dissatisfied with the current state of our health care system , and us employers are at a disadvantage due to the high cost of health insurance what would you do to fix the health care system \? and would you support implementing a singlepayer system in which the government acts as the insurer in order to save enough money to cover the millions of uninsured and to lower premiums for the rest of the us population \? governor thompson , let s have you weighin on that mr thompson you know , i 've been here for two debates we never had one question on health care thank that person for talking about health care number one , we spend 2 trillion on health care that s 16 percent of the gross national product ninetythree percent of the cost of health care goes into waiting until after you become sick only 7 percent of the money is used to keep you well in the first place we got to completely transform the health care system , make it a wellness system , and make it a prevention system secondly , we have 125 million americans that have one or more chronic illnesses in order to change this we have to educate the american people about tobacco , about diabetes , about cardiovascular and about obesity you do that , you 'll be able to change health care the third thing , 25 percent of americans use twothirds of the cost of health care if you manage those diseases , you can reduce that down to 50 percent and save lots of money fourth , information technology electronic medical records , a patient bill of rights , and be able to have eprescribing , and if you do that , you 're going to be able to save billions of dollars if you just go paperless , ladies and gentlemen , you will save 10 percent of the cost of health care mr blitzer thank you , governor , very much \( applause \) governor romney , you worked with the democrats in the state legislature in your home state , the commonwealth of massachusetts you worked with ted kennedy to come up with a program that provides some that mandates , in effect , the individual health insurance coverage some conservatives say this is simply big government , more liberal involvement in people s lives what do you say to those conservatives who are critical of the way you handled this issue in massachusetts \? mr romney well , i want to talk to the people , not just to those conservatives who are critical , and the people of this country recognize that they got some real concerns in health care and i learned after i was governor a short of period of time , i talked to people , and they say , if i lose my job , i'm worried i 'll lose my insurance , and my insurance premiums are getting higher and higher and higher and i talked to small business people , and they said , i ca n't afford the policies anymore and we said you know what \? we got to find a way to get everybody insured and the last thing we want is to have the government take over health care , because anything they take over gets worse , not better we 're not going to turn to washington , because washington makes a mess washington s all talk we said we need to find a way to get everybody in our state insured with private insurance the half a million who did n't have insurance , all the people worried that if they lost their job , they 'd lose insurance we said we got to find a way to get them insured without raising taxes , without a government takeover , and that s what we did mr blitzer \( off mike \) thank you mr romney it relies on personal responsibility this is a big issue for this country every democrat up there s talking about a form of socialized medicine , government takeover , massive tax increase we have to stand up and not just talk about it mr blitzer thank you mr romney i'm the guy who actually tackled this issue we get all of our citizens insured we get people that were uninsured with private health insurance we have to stand up and say the market works personal responsibility works mr blitzer thank you , governor mr romney we 're going to have insurance for all of our citizens they can afford , that s theirs , that s portable mr blitzer thank you mr romney they never have to worry about losing it mr blitzer thank you mr romney that s the answer mr blitzer thank you , governor \( applause \) mr i'm told that s not true mr blitzer jennifer , go ahead mr actually , wolf , that s not true ms vaughn thank you , wolf next question comes from you , sir your name is max latona q yes , it is ms vaughn you live in manchester , new hampshire what do you do for a living , sir \? q i teach philosophy here at st anselm college ms vaughn what s your question tonight \? q my question is a simple one in your opinion , what is the most pressing moral issue facing this country today \? and if you 're elected president , how would you address that issue \? ms vaughn governor huckabee , you are an ordained minister what is the most pressing moral issue in this country \? mr huckabee well , it looks like i'm getting all the moral questions tonight , and i guess that s a good thing \( laughter \) that s better than getting the immoral questions \( laughter \) so i'm happy to get those i really believe that if you define in a moral issue , it is our respect , our sanctity and our understanding of the value of every single human life , because that is what makes america a unique place on this planet we value every life of an individual as if it represents the life of us all many of us who are prolife , quite frankly , i think , have made the mistake of giving people the impression that prolife means we care intensely about people as long as that child is in the womb , but beyond the gestation period , we 've not demonstrated as demonstrably as we should that we respect life at all levels , not just during pregnancy we should n't allow a child to live under a bridge or in the back seat of a car we should n't be satisfied that elderly people are being abused and neglected in nursing homes it should never be acceptable to us that people are treated as expendable any people but the unique part of our country is that we elevate and we celebrate human life and if you look at us with the contrast of the islamic jihadists , who would strap a bomb to the belly of their own child , march him into a crowded room , set the detonator and kill innocent people , they celebrate death , we celebrate life it s the fundamental thing that makes us unique and it keeps us free i pray we never , ever abandon that basic principle \( applause \) mr blitzer thank you , governor mayor giuliani mayor giuliani \( applause continuing \) mayor giuliani , what is the most pressing moral issue in america today \? mr giuliani i think the governor is correct i 'd put it maybe in a slightly different way we have great gifts in this country that come to us from god we have a country in which we have freedom of religion , freedom of press , freedom for the individual , the right to elect our own officials and the reality is that in some of the world , much of the world , that does n't exist i think the challenge for our generation is going to be , are we able to share those gifts in an appropriate way with the rest of the world \? if we can bring along the middle east , if we can bring along those countries that are presently our enemies and get them to see the values of these ideals , if we have the moral strength to be able to explain it to them in the way ronald reagan was able to do with communism , then we can we can end up having the peace that we want and we should not we should never become pessimistic about this remember this is the country that was at war with vietnam just a short while ago we 're friends now mr blitzer all right mr giuliani this was a country that was at war with japan , italy and germany a generation ago they 're some of our best friends today mr blitzer thank you mr giuliani we have great resources in this country and watching the strength of america when we believe in the essential ideals that we have , they 're not just american ideals , they come from god and i think it s our moral obligation to find the right way to share that with the rest of the world mr blitzer thank you , mayor \( applause \) congressman paul , what s the most pressing moral issue in the united states right now \? rep paul i think it is the acceptance just recently that we now promote preemptive war i do not believe that s part of the american tradition we in the past have always declared war in the defense of our liberties or go to aid somebody , but now we have accepted the principle of preemptive war we have rejected the just war theory of christianity and now , tonight , we hear that we 're not even willing to remove from the table a preemptive nuclear strike against a country that has done no harm to us directly and is no threat to our national security ! i mean , we have to come to our senses about this issue of war and preemption and go back to traditions and our constitution and defend our liberties and defend our rights , but not to think that we can change the world by force of arms and to start wars \( applause \) mr that s not right that s not right mr blitzer thank you , congressman mr wolf , that s not right mr blitzer senator brownback really wants to weigh in as well sen brownback thank you , and thank you for the question from a philosopher i think it s a life issue clearly , and i am prolife and i'm whole life and one of the things i'm the most , the proudest about our party about is that we 've stood for life we 've been a party that has stood for a culture of life , and it was in our platform in 1980 and it continues today and with that respect and i have respect for my other colleagues that s why i do n't think we can nominate somebody that s not prolife in this party because it is at our core we believe that every life is beautiful , is sacred , is a child of a loving god , from natural from conception to natural death , and that applies not only here and in the womb , it applies to somebody that s in poverty , it applies to the child in darfur and that philosophy , being prolife and whole life , is something i think can really help move us forward as a country and as a party mr blitzer senator , if rudy giuliani got the republican presidential nomination , would you be able to support him \? sen brownback i that question came up at the first debate , and i stated that this is something that we as a party have struggled with i have great respect for the mayor i do n't think we 're going to nominate somebody that s not prolife mr blitzer would you be able to support him \? sen brownback i can support and will support the nominee of our party , but our party has stood on principles it s a party of principles , it s not a party of personalities mr blitzer thank you sen brownback we lose when we walk away from our principles that s when we have trouble and that s what the country wants us to do mr blitzer thank you , senator sen brownback is to stand for principles \( applause \) mr blitzer jennifer , go ahead ms vaughn next question tonight from neil capano neil , you are an airline agent q yes , i am ms vaughn you live in manchester , new hampshire do you have a question tonight for governor romney \? q yes , i do first of all , i would like to thank all of you for joining us tonight in beautiful manchester , new hampshire however , my question is for governor romney exclusively you 've been accused of you 've been accused of flipflopping on immigration just earlier tonight , you indicated that you said that you 'd want the national language of the united states to be english however , why are you airing ads in spanish \? ms vaughn governor , let me also add something on this your campaign also provides a spanishspeaking version of your website with your son also speaking in spanish mr romney let me make it real clear i'm not antiimmigrant i love immigrants i love legal immigrants coming to our country i'm happy to communicate to them , and i hope they vote for me and i'm happy to have people all over the country , and i'm going to reach out to them in any language i can to have them have them vote for me and understand why i'm going to support making this a great land i 'll tell you as well , i very firmly believe that we have to make sure that we enforce our borders , that we have an employment verification system , and that those people who have come here illegally do not get an advantage to become permanent residents , they do not get a special pathway that s a mistake that s the problem i have with the bill that the kennedymccain bill that s a mistake , in my view now , let me tell you what i think about a broader issue we 've talked tonight about all of the issues as they relate to the problems that we have , and i understand that but we have extraordinary opportunities what the republican party has to stand for is more than solving problems in the 19th century , the new frontier for us was the american west in the 20th century , it was europe selling products to europe and north america now asia has come out of poverty a billion people mr blitzer thank you mr romney who were steeped in poverty are coming out of poverty they 're consumers we can sell products to them , medicines , technology mr blitzer thank you , governor mr romney energy we are a party of the future , and we have to stop worrying about the problems and thinking we ca n't deal with those we have to focus on the future and our opportunity to make america a great place for our kids and grandkids thank you mr blitzer thank you , governor congressman tancredo , would you advertise for your campaign in spanish \? specifically , i'm referring to the highly publicized comment you recently made that miami was like a third world country rep tancredo right yeah , exactly no , i would not advertise in spanish believe me when i tell you this , english the preservation of the english language is important for us for a lot of reasons , not the least of which is because it is what holds us together it is the glue that keeps a country together , any country bilingual countries do n't work , and we should not encourage it and even in the bill that senator mccain is pushing , he says that he supports englishonly or official english does n't go on to tell you , that of course he says that we 're going to codify president clinton s original plan , original executive order signed that said all papers produced by the government have to be in various languages no , it is absolutely wrong english is the language of this country , and you know what , we should not be ashamed of that it s a good thing and it holds us all together regardless of where we come from mr blitzer thank you rep tancredo regardless of our backgrounds , our histories , it does n't matter we need that thing to hold us together mr blitzer all right , thank you , congressman \( applause \) senator mccain , i 'd like you to respond sen mccain well , first of all , governor , muchas gracias \( laughter , applause \) we need to enforce our borders there is indeed a special path , it s especially hard , it s eight to 13 years my friends , we know what we 're talking about is the latest wave of migrants into this country we have to stop the illegal immigration , but we 've had waves throughout our history hispanics is what we 're talking about , a different culture , a different language , which has enriched my state where spanish was spoken before english was my friends , i want you the next time you 're down in washington , dc to go to the vietnam war memorial and look at the names engraved in black granite you 'll find a whole lot of hispanic names when you go to iraq or afghanistan today , you 're going to see a whole lot of people who are of hispanic background you 're even going to meet some of the few thousand that are still green card holders who are not even citizens of this country , who love this country so much that they 're willing to risk their lives in its service in order to accelerate their path to citizenship and enjoy the bountiful , blessed nation so let s from time to time remember that these are god s children they must come into country legally , but they have enriched our culture and our nation as every generation of immigrants before them thank you \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer thank you jennifer , go ahead ms vaughn john lewicke , good evening to you , sir q good evening ms vaughn you live in mason , new hampshire what do you do \? q i work selfemployed as an electrical engineer ms vaughn what s your question tonight \? q in 2006 , we saw the first the worst republican defeat in living memory if we do more of the same , why do we expect anything different \? and i 'd like to ask each of the candidates why their position is or how their position differs from the present administration s , so that we wo n't see a repeat of 2006 in 2008 ms vaughn senator mccain , do you want to begin with this one \? sen mccain spending , spending , spending , spending , which led to corruption we have members former members of congress in jail as we speak because of this earmarking we let spending get out of control , we presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the great society , and our constituents and our republicans became dispirited and disenchanted we 've got to stop the earmarking the bridge to nowhere , the 233 miles a 233 million bridge to an island in alaska with 50 people on it was the tipping point i want to promise you , as president of the united states , i 'll veto every bill that has a porkbarrel project on it , and i 'll make the authors of it famous , and we 'll get spending under control , and we 'll stop the corruption in washington \( applause \) mr blitzer if all of you will if all of you will limit your answer to about 10 or 15 seconds we 'll go down the line , starting with mayor giuliani what has been president bush s biggest mistake since taking office \? mr giuliani i would like to add to what john was saying the thing that i would do different is i would establish accountability in washington washington is a mess , and that s one of the reasons republicans lost republicans became democrats i would establish programs like i did in new york city , where i had to deal with a heavily democratic city fedstat programs to measure accountability mr blitzer all right mr giuliani you get what you measure if you do n't measure success , you have failure and i turned around new york city i can turn around washington mr blitzer governor \? mr romney it s going \( interrupted by applause \) mr blitzer go ahead , governor mr romney it s going from small bore to large bore yes , of course it s spending , and yes we 're going to have to deal with all the issues and the problems we have but the republican party is a is a party of the future and with a vision ronald reagan had a vision for where he was going to take america we have to once again take people forward , and that vision is the new frontier of the 21st century mr blitzer all right mr romney our products and services can lead the world mr blitzer senator \? sen brownback spending but it s bigger than that it s hope and ideas and i want one i put i want i have one i want to put on the line here taking on cancer and deaths by cancer , and ending deaths by cancer in 10 years the leading cause of fear in america today is that you 'll get cancer , and this is one that s actually within our reach mr blitzer all right the sen brownback and it s something i think we can go at and we should go at , and it touches a lot of americans mr blitzer the question is what what s president bush s biggest mistake over these past several years \? mr thompson because we went to washington to change washington and washington changed us we did n't come up with new ideas we got to transform health care we got to wind we got to wind down the war in iraq we got to make sure that we really are conservatives if we 're going to spend money like as foolishly and as stupidly as the democrats , the voters are going to vote for the professional spending , the democrat mr blitzer all right mr thompson not the amateur spender , the republican \( laughter , applause \) mr blitzer congressman \? rep tancredo the biggest problem , i think , in this administration has been the fact that he ran the president ran as a conservative and governed as a liberal that is what has really been the basis , i think , of the distrust that has developed among the republican base it s wellfounded we have to do something about that mr blitzer thank you congressman paul mr paul the president ran on a program of a humble foreign policy , no nationbuilding , and no policing of the world and he changed his tune , and now we are fighting a war , and our foreign operations around the world to maintain our empire is now approaching 1 trillion a year mr blitzer thank you mr paul that s where the money s going , and that s where it has to be cut so we can take care of education and medical cares that are needed here in this country \( applause \) mr blitzer governor gilmore mr gilmore wolf , let me answer the question principle is the difference the republicans have always been a party of principle , and when we deviate from that , the people of the united states remember let me say this number one , on the issue of immigration , it violates the principle of the rule of law , and if we pass this bill and support it as republicans , we will lose again spending if we continue to earmark and spend and spend mr blitzer thank you mr gilmore we will be violating our principles and finally on taxes , the president has a pretty good tax program , as a matter of fact , that s not only helped the economy but helped regular people and hillary clinton is wrong mr blitzer thank you mr gilmore when she says that we should eliminate those tax cuts \( applause \) mr blitzer thank you congressman \? rep hunter you know , wolf , when my son returned from fallujah , he wrote these words , he said , families lift our nation up they provide us with fidelity , morality , faith in god , and raising the next generation of americans the republican party has to reunite with the american family and pass policies that are constant with the american family , then we 'll be a great party again mr blitzer governor mr huckabee i think the people of america are pretty smart , and the fact is they know that if they have excessive taxation and a tax system that literally steps on their head , and they have a regulation system that makes it very difficult for our businesses to compete , and then we 've got a system of immigration that we do n't have confidence in , and in addition to that , we have litigation that makes it very difficult for our businesses to be able to operate in a free enterprise system , the result is a job migration and if you ask what the president s problem was , it s a lack of communication to be able to really help us understand what those problems were and how we needed to solve them mr blitzer thank you mr huckabee that s what we need to do mr blitzer thank you let s go back to jennifer ms vaughn erin gardner s here with us tonight erin , you live in the gate city , nashua , new hampshire q yes , i do ms vaughn what is your question tonight \? q with regards to illegal and legal immigration , in your opinion , what does it mean to be an american \? what are the tangible and intangible attributes of an american \? ms vaughn congressman tancredo rep tancredo it means , number one , cut from the past if you come here as an immigrant , great welcome if you come here legally , welcome it means you cut your ties with the past , familial especially political ties with the country from which you came but let s be serious about this , you guys we talk about all the immigration reform we want , and what it s got to get down to is this are we ready for a timeout \? are we actually ready to say , enough is enough \? we have to stop all legal immigration except for the for people coming into this country as family members , immediate family members , and or refugees are we willing to actually say that and say enough is it we have got to actually begin the process of assimilating people who have come in this great wave of immigration the process of assimilation is not going on and how long \? how long will it take us for that for us to catch up with the millions of people who have come here , both legally and illegally , and assimilate them \? i 'll tell you this it 'll take this long until we no longer have to press 1 for english and 2 for any other language \( applause \) mr blitzer i promised , governor huckabee , you 'd have a chance to weigh in on this immigration issue do you agree with congressman tancredo that the us should effectively end most legal immigration into the country \? mr huckabee no , i disagree with that i think that there are a number of people that we should welcome into this country and it s certainly engineers and doctors and scientists that we may need legally coming here what we need to do is to have a border that is sealed and the same kind of process that we have to go through if we go into a stadium we go in one at a time and we have a ticket that s the only thing i think americans really are asking us for is a sane , sensible system that s based on the idea that if you come here , that you come here through the same process that we would be expected to go through if we went to another country , which is not happening today mr blitzer mayor giuliani , are you comfortable with what congressman tancredo says about immigration to this country \? mr giuliani no , i'm very uncomfortable with it i mean , the reality is , it s one thing to be debating illegal immigration it s a very complex subject i think we 've had a very good debate about it and i think the bill needs to be fixed in the way that i 've indicated but we should n't be having a debate about legal immigration abraham lincoln defined what an american is better than i'm going to be able to do it or congressman tancredo or anyone on the stage abraham lincoln , who fought the knownothing movement , said being an american is not whether you came over on the mayflower or you came here yesterday how much do you believe in freedom \? how much do you believe in freedom of religion \? how much do you believe in freedom for women \? how much do you believe in the right to vote \? how much do you believe in the rule of law \? the person who believes in that the most is the best american , and the person who does n't is n't an american mr blitzer thank you mr giuliani that s abraham lincoln s words we should always be open to legal immigration it reforms us it makes us better it brings us people who want to make a better life for themselves mr blitzer thank you mr giuliani and their families if we lose that , we lose the genius that has made america what it is mr blitzer i'm going to go back to jennifer in a second \( applause \) but i want senator mccain to respond as well when you hear what congressman tancredo says , what goes through your mind \? sen mccain it s beyond my realm of thinking look , america is the land of opportunity the question was just asked , what is it to be an american \? it s to share a common goal that all of us a principle are created equal and endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights that means we go as far as our ambition will take us that means we have a better life for ourselves and our children and the lady that holds her lamp beside the golden door is still the ideal and the dream of course it has to be legal of course it has to be regulated and 18 months , by the way , will go by while we fix the border before we do anything else on this issue mr blitzer thank you sen mccain but america is still the land of opportunity and it is a beacon of hope and liberty , and as ronald reagan said , a shining city on a hill and we 're not going to erect barriers and fences mr blitzer thank you , senator let me go back to jennifer go ahead , jennifer ms vaughn carolyn gargasz , you 're here with us tonight you 're a state legislator what is your hometown \? carolyn gargasz hollis ms vaughn and what s your question \? ms gargasz what would you do to include moderate republicans and to bring back to the party those independents who were formerly registered republicans \? ms vaughn governor gilmore speaking of you mr gilmore glad to when i was a candidate for governor , i was told that a conservative could n't appeal to moderate areas in the state of virginia and i rejected that because i believe that conservatism still stands for all people , it stands for everyone and it goes to this question that my colleagues were talking about , what s an american an american is someone who s noble , someone who s greater than just themselves and their own personal interests , and someone the rest of the world can look up to , and someone who believes in liberty and freedom and when i ran for governor , i went to the moderate communities and said listen , we 're going to talk about empowering people we 're going to talk about giving back more tax money we 're going to talk about the value that is yours around the kitchen table to decide where your child s going to go to school or whether or not you can pay the tuitions , or whether you can pay the mortgages and you earned this money and you we understand very well that you have to pay taxes , but we also understand the value of every single person and as a taxpayer mr blitzer thank you thank you , governor mr wolf , can i mr blitzer hold on one second congressman hunter , i want you to weigh in because arnold schwarzenegger , your governor in california , has become very popular out there by bringing in independents and moderates and trying to forge a consensus among republicans and democrats in your state should n't the gop nationally be following that arnold schwarzenegger example in california \? rep hunter no \( laughter \) and let me just say , you know , i look at governor romney , mayor giuliani , my good friend john mccain governor romney joined with bill clinton for the 1994 gun ban when i was fighting that mayor giuliani stood with him at the white house on that governor romney has passed what i consider to be a major step toward socialism with respect to his mandated health care bill john mccain is standing strong with ted kennedy on this kennedy mccainbush border enforcement bill i think the guy who s got the most influence right here with these three gentlemen is ted kennedy and i think we need to move away from the kennedy wing of the republican party \( applause \) mr blitzer all right i got to let all three of them respond governor romney , go ahead go ahead first but do it very briefly mr romney the model for how the republican party wins , and wins moderates , democrats , independents , conservatives , is who \? ronald reagan he did it ronald reagan won in massachusetts both times he ran how did he do that \? he had a stool he sat on that had three legs one was a strong military and today a strong military needs more troops , more funding to make sure that our troops are cared for in the battlefield with the equipment they need , and our veterans receive the care they need when they get home mr blitzer thanks mr romney strong military , strong economy , keeping our taxes down , and strong families and strong family values mr blitzer thank you mr romney that s the stool with all three legs mr blitzer mayor mr romney and one more thing , optimism and a vision for the future mr blitzer thank you \( applause \) mayor giuliani , i want you to respond specifically to what we 've heard from congressman hunter mr giuliani i think , ma'am , the way to accomplish what you want is to nominate me \( laughter \) that would be the way to do it and i think the republican party can unite around two major principles that are bigger than all of us being on offense against terrorism , unlike the democrats , who are on defense against terrorism , and you saw that two nights ago here they could n't even utter the word \( s \) islamic terrorism it s our biggest enemy they could n't utter it we need somebody who can stand up to that and second , someone who will be on offense for a growth economy fight this impulse to raise taxes , do socialized medicine mr blitzer thank you mr giuliani put everything in government those are the two big principles that unite us and make us a majority party mr blitzer thank you mr giuliani and we have to respect some of our differences \( applause \) mr blitzer senator mccain \? sen mccain protect the family , that s one of the questions earlier protect our american family , it s under assault in many respects , as we all know and second , take the lead in fighting this transcendent issue of our time the battle and struggle against radical islamic extremism it is a force of evil that is within our shores look at the events of the last few days at jfk , attempts at fort dix , the london suicide bombers my friends , this is a transcendent struggle between good and evil everything we stand for and believe in is at stake here we can win we will never surrender , they will i am prepared to lead my life and my experience and my background and my heroes inspire me and qualify me to lead in this titanic struggle which will not be over soon , but we will prevail mr blitzer thank you , senator \( applause \) thanks to all of you for joining us this unfortunately , it s time for us to say goodbye for the second part of this debate it brings the end of our debate here please to be sure to join us for our next debate that will occur

washington , june 6 president bush has pardoned 113 people during his presidency , including a tennessee bootlegger and a mississippi odometer cheat but none has drawn the public scrutiny , nor posed the same political challenge , as the candidate that many conservatives hope will be bush presidential pardon no 114 , the former chief of staff to vice president dick cheney , who was convicted of lying to investigators in the cia leak case and sentenced tuesday to 30 months in prison a pardon for mr libby would attract more painful attention to a case from which mr bush had managed to keep his distance for more than three years , a case inextricably linked to the flawed intelligence used to justify the iraq war and an administration effort to discredit a critic that ultimately exposed a cia officer the democrats who control congress would be none too pleased , either a decision not to pardon mr libby would further alienate members of mr bush s traditional base of support in the conservative movement , a group already angry about his proposed policy , his administration s spending and his approach to iran so far , mr bush seems to be willing to take that chance , saying he will not intervene until mr libby s legal team has exhausted its avenues of appeal already , major conservative and neoconservative organizations , magazines and web sites are expressing vexation that mr bush has not granted clemency to mr libby , who they say was unfairly railroaded for an initial leak that has now been traced to richard l armitage , the former deputy secretary of state i do n't understand it , said david frum , a former speech writer for mr bush who is now a fellow at the american enterprise institute , a conservative research group with close ties to the white house a lot of people in the conservative world are weighted down by the sheer , glaring unfairness here a conservative with close ties to the administration , who requested anonymity to speak frankly , put it another way letting scooter go to jail would be a politically irrational symbol to the last chunk of the 29 percent upon which he stands , a reference to the low percentage of americans who tell pollsters they support mr bush but mr bush has never been very eager to grant pardons , and in fact is among the stingiest presidents in history , said p s ruckman jr , a political science professor who studies pardons at rock valley college in rockford , ill mr bush took office as his predecessor , bill clinton , was facing harsh scrutiny for granting a pardon to marc rich , whose former wife , denise , had donated heavily to mr clinton s presidential library a former senior administration official with his own ties to the case said mr libby had failed to meet the general standard for a pardon by not showing contrition or serving any time this official also noted that mr libby had also been found guilty of lying to investigators , the same offense that led to the impeachment of mr clinton the former official , who requested anonymity to speak frankly about the president , said it would show a deep disregard for the rule of law if he was to do it right now , when there has been no remorse shown by a convicted felon and no time has been served how s this going to fit in his longterm legacy \? though they can be ignored by presidents , the guidelines for pardons and clemency recommended by the department of justice say that a convict should generally have to wait five years after conviction or release from confinement before being pardoned those who received pardons are also generally expected to accept responsibility for their criminal conduct , and should be seeking forgiveness rather than vindication presidents can also commute sentences without granting an underlying pardon , although that action is rare and is generally taken after a sentence has begun kenneth l adelman , the former director of the arms control and disarmament agency and one of mr libby s prominent supporters , said he did not believe a pardon of mr libby would have any bearing on mr bush s legacy clinton is very popular in the world , and he pardoned marc rich , of all things , mr adelman said \( mr rich was a fugitive from charges of conspiracy , tax evasion , racketeering and violating united states sanctions by trading oil with iran when mr clinton pardoned him \) mr adelman said he was chagrined by what he described as the president s inconsistent application of loyalty , which he said seems to be cutting against mr libby after having played out in favor of former defense secretary donald h rumsfeld and attorney general alberto r gonzales , who were palpably doing a terrible job but mr bush s support for mr gonzales in the face of charges that the attorney general s office politicized the hiring and firing of federal prosecutors has not helped clear a path for a pardon for mr libby other presidents withstood calls for pardons from their supporters and survived with their legacies intact president ronald reagan faced very similar albeit , preinternet pressure from conservatives to grant pardons to oliver north , john m poindexter and others indicted for roles in the irancontra affair he never did so , leaving the matter to his successor and vice president , george bush \( mr bush did not grant clemency to colonel north or admiral poindexter , neither of whose convictions stood he did pardon six others \) mr bush , who is hoping for a republican successor , could do the same and judging by the reactions against the sentence for mr libby at the republican presidential debate on cnn on tuesday , mr libby could ultimately get a pardon but that would mean withstanding the pressure that will intensify if and when mr libby goes to jail , which could happen in a matter of weeks , even as his appeals are pending speaking with reporters with him for the group of eight economic summit in germany on wednesday , mr bush was not showing his hand it would n't be appropriate for me to discuss the case until after the legal remedies have run its course , he said he cut off a reporter s followup question on a possible pardon by moving on to another reporter who changed the subject to the new tensions with russia
chip brown makes the story of charlie hess and his quest for longburied answers come alive \( april 29 \) the story crackles , the characters breathe and i could almost feel the snap of the cold rockies air on my face brown quotes hess saying that if you want to see into the abyss , you 've got to walk near the edge charlie hess is not doing easy work he is exploring the darkest recesses of the human condition sal weir flushing , ny your article , fascinating as it was , lost me when it made robert charles browne s investigator , charlie hess , the hero of the piece hess , a former deputy coordinator of the cia s infamous phoenix program , seems unrepentant , while browne , repellent as he is , is at least slightly more forthcoming hess s selfserving claim that he had n't participated in the more brutal interrogation practices is nothing new the article could have presented a classic contrast between two evils , rather than framing it as a goodguybadguy cop story kenneth e scudder san francisco among the many astonishing statements in chip brown s deeply moving article , none was more poignant than the words uttered in court by amie sperry , daughter of the slain rocio sperry , when she said of her mother s killer , and as for robert browne , i would like to say may god be with his soul i know nothing more about this young woman , but she is clearly a beautiful soul herself paul mundschenk carbondale , ill charlie hess is indeed in a category all by himself after reading the article , i thought i would like to be a friend of his there are n't many like him around bill superdock jacksonville , fla photos \( photographs by sarah stolfa \)
when you read deborah solomon s questions for in the new york times magazine , it s like crashing an exclusive book party at tina brown s east side garden apartment there you stand , sipping white wine , as solomon and a famous author or politician or media personality trade zippy repartee her sharp , challenging questions elicit pithy , surprising answers a disloyal comment about an employer , a confession to a diet coke habit , what s in jack black s ipod that is the illusion of solomon s column the reality is something else the 700 or so words each week are boiled down from interviews that sometimes last more than an hour and run 10 , 000 words though presented in a way that suggests a verbatim transcript , the order of the interview is sometimes altered , and the wording of questions is changed for clarity or context , editors say at least three interviews have been conducted by email because the subjects could n't speak english or had other speech difficulties and , solomon told me , very early on , i might have inserted a question retroactively , so the interview would flow better , a practice she said she no longer uses questions for came under fire recently when a reporter for new york press , a free alternative weekly , interviewed two highprofile journalists amy dickinson , the advice columnist who followed ann landers at the chicago tribune , and ira glass , creator of the public radio program this american life who said their published interviews with solomon contained questions she never asked while the vast majority of solomon s interview subjects have never complained , these are not the first who have last year , the times magazine published an angry letter from nbc s tim russert , who said that the portrayal of his interview with her was misleading , callous and hurtful russert , the author of two books about his father , told me that the interview had been presented as an opportunity to talk about his mom on mother s day instead , the interview , headlined , all about my father , featured a seemingly insensitive russert dodging solomon s questions about his mother i talked at great length about my mother , he said , but none of it appeared in the published interview russert said that solomon combined questions and took an answer and transposed it to another question gerald marzorati , the editor of the magazine , said , we examined his complaint and found it more or less justified russert had talked about his mother , marzorati said , and solomon made it appear that he had not solomon said , i made a mistake not putting in what he said about his mother afterward , marzorati said , a new policy was put in place , requiring that solomon give the tapes of her interviews to her editor or a magazine researcher , in case a subject raised an objection it was then , solomon said , that she also stopped inserting retroactive questions dickinson s interview came in july 2003 , before the new policy , and was not recorded it starts with dickinson saying that her column would be funnier and snappier and might be more fun to read than ann landers solomon then says , how immodest of you ! is n't it bad manners to brag \? some of us found ann landers hilarious dickinson said solomon never said those words to her if she had , dickinson said , she would have bristled , instead of replying , as the interview had it , i always found the entertainment value came more from the questions than the answers i was correctly quoted , dickinson said , but what totally jumped out , the questions were not the same solomon said she felt that dickinson was being boastful , and , i'm sure i said as much the glass interview was published last march , after the new safeguards were in place glass , who was just starting a television version of this american life on showtime , was stung by this printed exchange with solomon q what do you think of the network \? a i do n't meet many people who are talking about shows on showtime he did not deny saying it , but he said he was sure it came during a long conversation about how the network marketed itself i do n't believe she asked me that question , he said if she did , it certainly did n't precede that answer glass said , if i'm remembering this wrong , the tape would establish what was said but solomon and the magazine editors ca n't find it aaron retica , the magazine s research chief , said he listened to parts of the tape at the time and is sure that solomon asked glass what he thought of showtime solomon said , of course i asked him about showtime , and she was adamant that they had not gotten into a marketing discussion retica said he read the interview back to glass before it was published , and that glass reacted strongly to his showtime comment , saying there was a different context in an earlier exchange of email , solomon had already posed a new question to glass to allow him to get off the hook a bit is n't that a cocky thing to say \? she wrote why do n't you feel more appreciative of people who appreciate you \? glass wrote a 60word reply , calling the showtime people total sweethearts and saying how insanely lucky he was to work with them it was boiled to his opening words but i do feel appreciative ! i'm not communicating my feelings very well if you 're not getting that retica said he regarded it as a classic sort of rowback situation he was n't thrilled with what he 'd said , and the magazine had given glass a chance to amplify without removing a provocative quote i felt we 'd solved this in an interview with columbia journalism review in 2005 , solomon said feel free to mix the pieces of this interview around , which is what i do is there a general protocol on that \? her questioner asked there s no q and a protocol , solomon replied you can write the manual solomon told me she was joking in fact , there is a protocol , and questions for is n't living up to it the times s manual of style and usage says that readers have a right to assume that every word in quotation marks is what was actually said questions for does not use quotations marks but is presented as a transcript the manual also says ellipses should be used to signal omissions in transcripts , and that the times does not clean up' quotations marzorati told me , this is an entertainment , not a newsmaker interview on meet the press' but that does not relieve it of the obligation to live up to the times s standards or offer an explanation when it deviates from them i think editors made a mistake by not publishing an editor s note with russert s letter , acknowledging error and explaining the reforms now , i believe , if they want to preserve the illusion of a conversation , they should publish with each column a brief description of the editing standards the order of questions may be changed , information may be added for clarity , and the transcript has been boiled down without indicating where material has been removed if such a disclaimer destroys the illusion , maybe questions for needs to be rethought
david tyree has been a receiver for five years he caught his first pass of 2007 against the chicago bears on sunday , during the final drive of the season s 12th game he caught his second pass four plays later , helping the giants toward a gamewinning touchdown it felt great , tyree said and it was just good to be part of a big win it was about as good as it gets for the giants' committee of backup receivers who , to the team s chagrin , operate largely in anonymity for years , the giants have searched for a trustworthy no 3 wide receiver , a backup who enters the game on passing downs and makes big catches or , at a minimum , pulls defensive attention away from the two starters they have mostly come up emptyhanded the task of finding someone to relieve pressure on the starting receivers has taken on greater urgency this season , with the declining health of plaxico burress , who has played on a sprained ankle all season and now has a sore knee , and the increasing age of amani toomer , who is 33 and in his 12th season in 2005 , the giants got only 15 catches and 238 yards out of the thirdreceiver position without a viable threat , opponents shifted coverage toward burress and toomer , who combined that season for 136 catches , 1 , 898 yards and 14 touchdowns so the giants spent a secondround draft choice in 2006 on sinorice moss they spent a secondround choice in 2007 on steve smith this season , those two have combined for 18 catches , 170 yards and no touchdowns smith has four of those catches , but has been out of the lineup since the second game with injuries he said he hoped to play sunday it is not the numbers , coach tom coughlin said it is what happens when the ball goes there sinorice has made some plays and we were obviously very excited about steve through camp he caught the ball very well david tyree made a couple of really good plays for us the other day so we just need to keep moving along here the giants do not necessarily need another receiver to catch 40 passes they have a pro bowl tight end in jeremy shockey \( 54 receptions this season \) and have filled the receiving void left after tiki barber s retirement with 50 completions to running backs our no 3 guy is not a guy who generally gets a lot of balls to begin with , tyree said our offense is n't really designed to be focused on three receivers it s not a wideopen offense we 're a playaction team , great at running the football , and we want to take our shots down the field those shots usually go toward burress and toomer but without a perceived threat from another receiver , those two find less room to maneuver it just keeps them honest , toomer said of the role a third receiver can play against a defense they 'll cheat on the routes , so they 'll run from the third receiver under plax s route , under my route , under shockey s route , and just take for granted that we 're not going to throw them the ball i think that s one of the things that hurt us in the past the giants have given several young players a chance to become the trusted no 3 they drafted ron dixon in the third round of the 2000 draft , and he caught an average of 12 passes over three seasons they drafted the speedy tim carter in round 2 of the 2002 draft , and he struggled with injuries and caught three touchdown passes in five seasons before being traded to cleveland last spring for running back reuben droughns tyree , a sixthrounder in 2003 , has remained , mostly as a specialteams ace the giants hoped that moss , small and elusive , would end the search last season but he missed most of his rookie season with a strained quadriceps and caught five passes in six games the giants , unimpressed , drafted smith in april he seemed to snare the role during the summer and had three catches in the season opener against dallas but he fractured his scapula after making one catch in week 2 , and strained his hamstring just as that injury healed it seems like it s been forever , smith said he was talking about the time since he last played he could have meant the time the giants have spent looking for someone to fill the role he wants extra points the giants may face the philadelphia eagles on sunday without middle linebacker antonio pierce \( ankle \) and their starting safeties , gibril wilson \( knee \) and james butler \( hamstring \) none practiced yesterday the veteran chase blackburn would take pierce s spot the backup safeties are the rookies michael johnson and craig dahl , although the giants would probably shift r w mcquarters from cornerback running back brandon jacobs \( hamstring \) did practice , but it is uncertain whether he will play
in researching a story i wrote for play , the new york times quarterly sports magazine , i talked to a gaggle of statisticians whose primary goal other than putting together expensive algorithms designed specifically to make us all feel stupid was to figure out the proper way to fill out an ncaa tournament pool sheet most of these men are not only not experts in the field of college basketball , they mostly don t know anything about the game at all their expertise is numbers , not hoops they said this only worked to their advantage in fact , they said the ideal basketball prognosticator watched little to no basketball at all similar to some of the antiscouting principles espoused in michael lewis s moneyball , your eyes provide only immediacy , not perspective if you ve watched the illinois fighting illini all year , you have a distorted view of not only bruce weber s team , but also all their opponents you might think you know what a team is capable of because you ve watched them , but you probably don t so , while i was milling around on the internets yesterday , i found a deceivingly basic question on espncom s home page which team will win the men s national championship game \? florida ohio state this question is simple enough it would be easier if they had included a team not playing in the national championship game no way am i getting tricked into picking iowa but all told , not a tough call worst case scenario , a 5050 shot i made my pick , and , because espn is always eager to remind of their global omnipotence , a map popped up , featuring the demographic breakdown of states that had picked florida and those that had picked ohio state on the whole , the republic favors florida , at a 56 percent to 44 percent clip in fact , only five states came out in favor of the buckeyes , and not surprisingly , they were all midwestern states illinois , indiana , iowa , minnesota and , of course , ohio , which likes greg oden s boys 8020 \( the state of florida can only come out 7822 for the gators \) i m not sure what it means that montana likes joakim noah and company at a 5743 clip , but it must be important , because espn has told me so those five proosu states are the ones who have watched thad matta s team more than any other this year , and they re clearly believing their lying eyes \( as a witness to the buckeyes 6244 thumping of my illini at assembly hall in january , i m convinced they could beat dallas \) as much as i might think this means ohio state is as invincible as they looked that afternoon , it means nothing , or at least as much as some random figures from the worldwide leader none of us knows anything remember , the games saturday were supposed to be fun and that unpredictability is the reason we watch well , that and reaction shots of yannick noah so , who s gonna win tonight \? it seems amazing that florida is going for its third national championship in the span of 12 months and look out for that women s gymnastics team ! so much so that it seems odd that billy donovan would consider leaving for a supposedly more prestigious franchise like kentucky it gets more prestigious than national titles in both football and basketball \? do they need to win the world series too \? in a tournament that has been mostly listless and predictable , the general consensus is that tonight needs to be an epic classic in the north carolinageorgetown or connecticutduke mold it certainly won t be lacking for star power , with oden and noah \( and al horford , who might be a bigger star if his name weren t al horford \) two of the brightest stars in the game this year \( kind of seems like cbs should spring for kevin durant s courtside seats \) but we ve been waiting for that signature game for two weeks now , and instead we ve been treated to the clean mismatches we saw in the final four one could ask for a prediction , but until i ve had a chance to see what the fine citizens of the state of alaska have to say about it , i really wouldn t feel comfortable venturing one
even playing the last 18 minutes with 10 men did n't stop the united states from opening up its gold cup defense with a comfortable 10 victory over guatemala , in theory the toughest opponent in its group the us utterly dominated the first 25 minutes guatemala s star striker , carlos ruiz of fc dallas , was invisible , partly because of good marking by oguchi onyewu and the us defense , partly because ruiz s teammates did n't seem able or inclined to press forward and attack on defense , guatemala tackled hard and succeeded in holding off the americans for 25 minutes , but doing so for 90 never seemed likely , and a few nice passes gave clint dempsey a gift goal guatemala then had to try to score , but the us dealt with the few incursions professionally and continued to have all the best chances when ruiz finally was awarded a free kick from a semidangerous position he booted it far over the bar although guatemala cobbled together a few attacks in the second half , the us remained much the best team on the pitch and really should have scored at least once more two yellow cards to oguchi onyewu led to a few nervous moments but in the end , the talent gap was too great , and the us grabbed the three points and looks unlikely to face a stern challenge in this tournament until the semifinals at least had very little to do in the first half , but stayed alert and was ready to tip a surprise lob by leonel noriega over the bar early in the second half quietly efficient at left back , stymieing a few decent moves by the guatemalans lined up at right back , but also went forward often , providing a few good crosses was never reluctant to sacrifice his body on defense , earning a yellow card and committing a couple of fouls that gave guatemala rare attacking free kicks the key man in bringing the ball out of defense , he never faltered in the role , although he was seldom pressured looked especially good after his partner onyewu was ejected controlled the center defensively both with his usual physical presence but also with some lighttouch clearances kept ruiz out of the game but his two rather marginal yellow cards gave guatemala its only realistic hope of a result played a defensive midfield role well , but had some errant passes when he went further forward perhaps the least assured of the midfielders early on he needed to be the conduit to the forwards , but bobbled a few passes and was stripped of the ball several times improved as the game went along solid defensively , including a goalline clearance , although he picked up a yellow late frequent doubleteaming on the left wing reduced his usual effectiveness probably should have scored in the 23rd minute with the goal gaping in front of him made up for it with a crafty pass that started the move that led to the goal added some more nice runs and passes in the second half thrived playing in an attacking midfield role a great pass to beasley almost led to a 23rd minute goal was in just the right place to get the us s goal in the 38th minute nearly had another late in the first half as the ball flashed past him in the goalmouth substituted with half an hour to play took a physical beating from the hardnosed guatemalan defenders will be disappointed to have missed a few good chances to score , both with head and boot had a better day passing , including a flawless pass to set up the goal subbed in the second half a classy performance in attack and also pitched in with a few defensive clearances took most of the corners and free kicks , and although none led to goals , they frequently looked dangerous made several nice crosses a few good shots , but no goals never really got a chance to show his mls scoring form had one shot sail over the bar adapted well to unexpectedly being part of a 10man team

baghdad , june 3 three months after the start of the baghdad security plan that has added thousands of american and iraqi troops to the capital , they control fewer than onethird of the city s neighborhoods , far short of the initial goal for the operation , according to some commanders and an internal military assessment the american assessment , completed in late may , found that american and iraqi forces were able to protect the population and maintain physical influence over only 146 of the 457 baghdad neighborhoods in the remaining 311 neighborhoods , troops have either not begun operations aimed at rooting out insurgents or still face resistance , according to the onepage assessment , which was provided to the new york times and summarized reports from brigade and battalion commanders in baghdad the assessment offers the first comprehensive look at the progress of the effort to stabilize baghdad with the heavy influx of additional troops the last remaining american units in the troop increase are just now arriving violence has diminished in many areas , but it is especially chronic in mixed shiitesunni neighborhoods in western baghdad , several senior officers said over all , improvements have not yet been as widespread or lasting across baghdad , they acknowledged the operation is at a difficult point right now , to be sure , said brig gen vincent k brooks , the deputy commander of the first cavalry division , which has responsibility for baghdad in an interview , he said that while military planners had expected to make greater gains by now , that has not been possible in large part because iraqi police and army units , which were expected to handle basic security tasks , like manning checkpoints and conducting patrols , have not provided all the forces promised , and in some cases have performed poorly that is forcing american commanders to conduct operations to remove insurgents from some areas multiple times the heavily shiite security forces have also repeatedly failed to intervene in some areas when fighters , who fled or laid low when the american troops arrived , resumed sectarian killings until you have the ability to have a presence on the street by people who are seen as honest and who are not letting things come back in , said general brooks , referring to the iraqi police units , you ca n't shift into another area and expect that place to stay the way it was when planners devised the baghdad security plan late last year , they had assumed most baghdad neighborhoods would be under control around july , according to a senior american military officer , so the emphasis could shift into restoring services and rebuilding the neighborhoods as the summer progressed we were way too optimistic , said the officer , adding that september is now the goal for establishing basic security in most neighborhoods , the same month that bush administration officials have said they plan to review the progress of the plan lt gen raymond t odierno , the senior american ground commander in , said in a brief interview that he never believed that a midsummer timetable for establishing security in baghdad was realistic this was always going to be conditionsdriven , he said , noting that he always had expected it would take until fall to establish security across much of the city but in order to meet that timetable , he added , the iraqi security forces would have to make strides in coming months at maintaining security ultimately the isf , and specifically the police , are the key to holding an area , he said we have to within the next four months move them more toward holding the areas we have cleared the last of the five combat brigades ordered to iraq as reinforcements as part of the security plan will increase the number of american troops in the city to around 30 , 000 , up from 21 , 000 before the operation , an american officer said in addition , around 30 , 000 iraqi army and national police forces and another 21 , 000 policemen have been deployed in baghdad many of the iraqi units have turned up at less than full strength and other units have been redeployed from the capital , general brooks said , leaving fewer than expected american commanders have also had to send troops outside the capital , to deal with a sharp rise in violence in diyala province and to search for american soldiers kidnapped south of the capital in some parts of the city , commanders have yet to attempt largescale clearing operations for example , american forces have moved into only a small portion of sadr city , the vast slum on the city s east side that is a shiite stronghold sending large number of troops in there could incite heavy violence and opposition from prime minister nuri kamal almaliki s largely shiite government , several officers said the problems facing american troops are illustrated in troubled western baghdad in the rashid district there , the first battalion , fourth brigade of the first infantry division has been working since march to carry out the security push when the battalion , commanded by lt col patrick frank , moved in , it was replacing a lone american army company of 125 soldiers yet even with three times as many soldiers patrolling the area , violence has worsened last month , 249 bodies were found in the sector , up from 98 the month colonel frank arrived , according to statistics compiled by the battalion lately , his troops have been hit by a wave of roadside bomb attacks that have killed five of them and wounded 13 others we have a tough fight ahead of us , he said the district includes ameel , baya , jihad and furat , mostly mixed sunnishiite neighborhoods abutting the road to the baghdad airport where his troops have established three patrol bases before the new strategy , there were none the area , a mixture of poorer urban slums and middleclass dwellings , once home to many retired professionals , has been troubled for years violence dipped there and across the city in the first months of the year , but has since worsened militants , many associated with the mahdi army of the shiite cleric moktada alsadr , have resumed a push to drive sunnis from their few enclaves , american commanders said one of the area s last sunni mosques was bombed wednesday this area used to be primarily sunni , but in the last six months jaish almahdi has conducted essentially a cleansing campaign , said colonel frank , using the arabic name for the mahdi army in addition to carrying out sectarian killings , the mahdi army controls two of the area s three gas stations , which refuse to sell to most sunnis gunmen regularly attacked trash trucks when they entered sunni areas until the american military began providing security sunni homes are also the targets of arson attacks if their occupants fail to heed warnings to leave , he said sunni insurgents have fought back as well , with two large car bomb attacks in largely shiite sections of baya and ameel that killed more than 60 people , officers said the sectarian violence was especially disheartening to some american officers because it occurred in may , the same month that they were undertaking the centerpiece of the baghdad security plan a neighborhood clearing operation the battalion s troops , augmented by more than 2 , 000 soldiers in armored stryker vehicles , went block by block through the neighborhood , arresting suspected insurgents and destroying arms caches but since the stryker unit has moved on to a different area of baghdad , there s been a reinfiltration by shiite fighters and intimidation squads , who had left the area when the operation began , said capt tim wright , the company commander responsible for the neighborhood in addition to the dumped bodies being found every day , more sunni families are departing soon , he said , they may all be gone colonel frank , of cuba , ny , who served a previous iraq tour in mosul in 2003 with the 101st airborne division , said his forces were having some success in neighboring ameel at keeping sectarian violence under control thirty sunni families have returned to the neighborhood recently , he said but american officers worry that many members of the largely shiite police force sympathize or collaborate with the mahdi army the local commander of the iraqi national police , a force run by the shiiterun interior ministry , has been replaced three times since march one of those commanders , col nadir aljabouri , a shiite described by colonel frank as the most aggressive and evenhanded iraqi officer he had seen but he was detained in late march by the interior ministry and accused of having ties to insurgents he was not a protector of the people he was a terrorist , said col vhafir kader jowda , his shiite replacement american patrols have been attacked in a wave of deadly bombings recently , sometimes within sight of police checkpoints , officers said ten soldiers under colonel frank s command have been killed since march at least eight of the recent attacks in the area have used explosively formed penetrators , or efp s , powerful bombs able to pierce armored humvees when colonel frank went to the ameel police station recently accompanied by a reporter and asked for help in capturing a local shiite sheik believed to be behind the bombings , the police official he was meeting with spoke in a whisper they listen to us , he said , pointing to a ventilation grill on his wall i am in danger just by meeting with you a few weeks earlier , angered by the attacks on his soldiers , colonel frank ordered a video camera hidden near an abandoned swimming pool along a main road in ameel , near a police checkpoint , where patrols had been hit repeatedly when the video was examined after another attack , it showed two iraqi policemen talking with companions , who were heard offcamera , apparently laying an explosive device minutes after the policemen were seen driving away , the camera showed a powerful bomb detonating as an american humvee came into view the video of the attack , which just missed the vehicle and caused no casualties , was shown to a reporter from the new york times after police commanders were confronted with the video in midmay , six iraqi officers were arrested , colonel frank said but the episode has not been forgotten at a weekly meeting where military commanders and police chiefs sit around a horseshoeshaped conference table at one of the american bases , capt adel fakry , the ameel police commander , complained that american soldiers on patrol were showing distrust toward his officers the reason there is distrust , colonel frank responded , his voice rising , is because i have a video of six iraqi officers placing a bomb against my soldiers , and they came from your station there had been some mistakes , captain fakry responded , looking taken aback by the confrontation not all of the six officers were from his station , he added before ending the conversation by flipping open his cellphone and making a call while the meeting continued the same distrust has hampered relations throughout baghdad since the strategy began in shula , a neighborhood just east of kadhimiya , north of rashid , american troops in march discovered a group of iraqis in police uniforms setting up an efp near a bridge they were using police vehicles to provide cover the american soldiers killed two of the bomb planters they later discovered that one had a badge granting him wide access to the green zone , the fortified area in central baghdad where the american embassy and most iraqi government buildings are situated that s the level of penetration that these guys have , said lt col steven

jack johnson , addicted to attention and craving a colorful legacy , loved to chronicle his rise from a restless texas teenager to the world s first black heavyweight boxing champion now , nearly a century after his most famous fight the 1910 defeat of jim jeffries and decades after his death , johnson has more tales to tell his largely unknown 1911 musings to a french sports magazine , including candid observations on racism most likely never intended for american readers , have been translated into english in their entirety for the first time the result is the 127page book my life battles by and about the man considered by many to be one of history s most important athletes to get new material and new stories from jack johnson is significant not just in sports , but sociologically as a look into that whole era , said bert sugar , a boxing historian and author of dozens of books on the sport johnson s 1908 championship and his 1910 defeat of jeffries touched off race riots among black americans who considered him a hero and white americans who deemed him a threat he really was a figure of great hatred and paranoia among many white americans , and when he won the 1910 fight , it was considered on all sides to be a really monumental event , said christopher rivers , a mount holyoke college professor who translated and published the 1911 memoirs rivers , a boxing enthusiast who teaches french , first noted references to the french articles in geoffrey ward s 2004 biography , unforgivable blackness the rise and fall of jack johnson at rivers s request , ward sent him copies of all the frenchlanguage magazine articles rivers translated them and blended them with excerpts already used in johnson s 1914 mes combats \( my fights \) , of which harvard university s widener library owns the only known complete copy rivers was able to provide a rare glimpse into the life of a man whose extravagant stories are his only descendants johnson s 1927 memoir , jack johnson in the ring and out , touches lightly on racism , but only in brief and restrained language the 1911 magazine articles , however , assess what he called the color line with more frankness , probably because his audience was not the tensely divided american populace while rarely sounding bitter , johnson made it clear he did not appreciate being painted as a dumb , brutal animal a slur he tried to toss back in the faces of his critics by indulging in the finest tailored clothes and a taste for the best possessions his large winnings could buy johnson also questioned the hypocrisy of white fighters who avoided betterskilled black fighters , suggesting they were avoiding the embarrassment of a loss by rejecting the fights under the thin cloak of scruples a true fighter should be able to , and want to , fight with anyone with enough talent to aspire to the title , he said in the memoir and that means not building a wall around himself , the gate of which is strictly forbidden to anyone likely to beat him johnson , renowned for the gusto of his storytelling , also could be counted on to boost a tale s entertainment value or to burnish his legacy , according to sports historians and his biographers there s always that caution that jack johnson is constantly reinventing himself on the fly , changing stories in midstream , and he knew he could tell different stories to different audiences , sugar said he was really one to put his finger in the pot and stir yet for all of johnson s amusing tales inside and outside the ring , the reality of his life after the 1911 magazine memoirs was darker in 1913 , he was convicted under the federal mann act , which was intended to fight prostitution it made it illegal to take a white woman across state lines for immoral purposes ironically , johnson was arrested after convincing a prostitute , lucille cameron , who would later become his wife , to leave a brothel he fled while his case was on appeal and spent seven years in exile in canada , france , great britain and elsewhere in europe he returned to the united states in 1920 , five years after losing a questionable title bout in havana against jess willard johnson at various times asserted , then denied , that he had thrown the fight johnson eventually served eight months in prison many supporters and boxing historians said the prison term was trumpedup punishment for his flouting of racial norms , notably his relationships with white women including cameron and his previous wife , etta duryea , who committed suicide various presidents have been petitioned over the decades to pardon johnson posthumously , but none has johnson returned to the ring sporadically after his release from prison , but with limited success he also owned a nightclub , tried acting and later got a job spinning tales and demonstrating jabs in an amusement arcade johnson died june 10 , 1946 , at age 68 in a crash in raleigh , nc sugar , who was a boy when he saw johnson in his storytelling gig at hubert s museum and flea circus in times square , said the newly published memoirs could introduce johnson to a new generation and cement the legacy the boxer wanted so much to build we owe a debt to understand jack johnson and what he stood for , what he came up against in that time and that place , sugar said he s a seminal figure in many ways , and his life really does transcend just boxing
frustrated at the lack of a good screening test for ovarian cancer , advocacy groups have persuaded professional cancer organizations to endorse a list of persistent symptoms that might indicate the presence of the disease the list could have a very beneficial effect in alerting patients and doctors who have been dismissive of complaints of generalized discomfort that ovarian cancer is present at an early stage when it is most treatable among the flood of patients who have the alltoocommon symptoms , there will be some who undergo needless surgeries to remove ovaries that turn out not to be cancerous that is the price that may be paid for this modest step toward detecting a cancer that typically kills most women who have it the need for early detection is clear ovarian cancer can be successfully treated when it remains in the ovary the fiveyear survival rate for localized treatment is 93 percent but the vast majority are not detected until the cancer has spread to distant sites , at which point the fiveyear survival rate drops to 30 percent unfortunately , all efforts to develop a screening test for early detection , analogous to mammography for breast cancer or a pap smear for cervical cancer , have thus far failed the two most common a blood test for a potential tumor marker and a transvaginal ultrasound to detect abnormal growths are notoriously inaccurate what the new statement does instead is list symptoms that are much more likely to occur in women with ovarian cancer bloating , pelvic or abdominal pain , difficulty eating or feeling full quickly and urgent or frequent urination women who have these symptoms almost daily for more than a few weeks are advised to see their doctor still there is a real quandary as to what should be done for women whose symptoms ca n't be attributed to other causes the hope is that a combination of a pelvic and rectal exam , a blood marker test and transvaginal ultrasound none of which is determinative in itself might yield useful information in the end , many women may opt for surgery to remove the ovary , just to be sure the real value of the statement may be to raise awareness there are simply too many horror stories of doctors dismissing the complaints of patients as being all in their heads or as a sign of aging only to find out belatedly that an ovary was cancerous the new statement puts them and their patients on alert that closer attention must be paid
i spent almost a year in the sunni triangle i somehow avoided the hundreds of mortar attacks on my base , the ieds on some of the most dangerous roads in iraq , the rpg fired at my convoy it s the path of the ages i feel i ve traveled , where able bodied americans go to war for their country , either by choice or not , and the best way to illustrate my journey is with a simple then and now it is a desert full of memories i can conjure up , and every grain of sand is in ultrasharp focus like a 7megapixel photo then i had been happily married for seven years the most sacred things in my life were my family , my marriage , my children , and my dreams this was the war of my generation and i wanted to do my part i was in charge of tactical communications for a battalion of 600 soldiers , but sometimes i was called upon for other missions one day i found myself conducting a search for an al qaeda weapons cache on a farm near ramadi the helicopters landed and we jumped out i ran through a swirling dust cloud with my weapon pointed at the chest of the man who walked out of his doorway when he heard us land i didn t know if he was hostile yet i couldn t take the chance i was yelling at the interpreter , and the interpreter was yelling at the man two hours later , the farm had been searched and we were kicking a soccer ball with the man s son there was no weapons cache and no one was hurt it was still a good mission because we narrowed our search that same night i boarded another helicopter to go on emergency leave i was flying to new orleans just weeks after hurricane katrina to visit my mother , who had been struggling with breast cancer i had received a red cross message that same morning my soldiers tried to talk me out of going on the mission , but i refused to back out i compartmentalized those personal emotions until the mission was complete once there i helped my dad get the house and property cleaned up water damage had left everything in a horrible mess i ll never forget the wisdom and wetness in my mom s eyes the last time i saw her i had been there for weeks and she was still holding on my leave could not be extended anymore i had to go back to ramadi we both knew it was the last time our eyes would meet and it was she passed five weeks later my wife and kids were still back in utah , where the marriage i left behind was struggling to survive as well these are the pictures hardest to look at in my highdef recollections and these are the pictures that need no wellintended caption scribbled on the back because they are burned into my memory i returned to iraq , an anonymous face in the window of a plane , flying across the atlantic in the middle of the night , and threw myself into the work things got worse back in utah and at that point i gave up on trying to save my marriage my own home was no longer a healthy environment my only concern then was for the kids i honestly thought i might lose my mind to frustration , helplessness , and anger when my tour was over and i finally got back to utah , i had been gone for 17 months i had lived and worked in close proximity to violence and death for a year over 80 soldiers in my brigade were killed in combat hundreds more were injured two soldiers in my battalion were killed i prayed for them i thanked god that none of the 18 soldiers in my communications section were killed , and that i was unharmed it felt positively blessed to be home in one piece now my kids needed their daddy overnight , i changed my focus completely and put every ounce of energy into facing new challenges the transition was immediate i had no choice now when i first returned to utah i felt that my very soul had been scrubbed raw by sustained emotional overload i was equidistant between two extremes and the balance could go either way darkness or light depression or joy i could see no grey , only black and white i was on the cusp of major life changes on many levels and they scared me i was drinking too much and nothing felt the same my marriage had failed and faded like a polaroid left out in the sun my mom was gone and i hadn t yet begun to understand how much the war had affected me the kids kept me busy , yes , but they kept me grounded too i have to be strong and stable for them i have gladly cared for the kids since the day i got off that plane i was granted full custody in the divorce and have been a single dad for 10 months , working 40 hours a week while raising my two kids \( 7yearold girl and 4yearold boy \) with very little help i m not complaining , but the adjustments have been intense i am becoming an expert in the art of parenting and personal sacrifice , and my kids are worth it so far , i volunteered in my daughter s classroom , taught both kids to swim , and threw them very cool birthday parties we ve spent holidays together we ve gone to movies , plays , amusement parks , disney on ice , and the circus also , after nine years with the same woman i m single again , so i ve started dating a little it s much more complicated now i have been writing quite a lot , working on multiple projects , and i have a literary agent i don t remember the last time i had a bad day i am settling into a renewed optimism , a fresh interest in all facets of life and ambition before i went to iraq i was not in the habit of sharing my personal life with complete strangers , and i m still not but through my blog , and forums such as this one , i ve come to realize that it s good to talk about these things to those who want to listen because i know i am not the only soldier facing adversity in fact , i feel very lucky indeed for months i was bitter and confused , but after deep consideration , and with the unconditional support of a very small circle of family and friends , the image of a still pond behind the hurricane won over my intention , rather than the fury of the storm itself forgiveness seemed possible grief less painful i sat alone the other night at a lookout point above the salt lake valley it is a spot i visit whenever i can it was dusk and the mountains looked like the painted shadows of mountains , silhouetted by the light behind them i thought about the last couple of years , as i do often and i was once again amazed by the momentum of the sun when it struck the horizon , and the way time heals these invisible scars , slowly braiding solace back around a broken heart war and life have penned this harsh new narrative , but i am home now and i am learning
travel books can generally be divided into two categories first there are the ones in which all the traveling is done in the journey to an intended destination , at which point the writer stays put and then there are the books in which the writer never stops jetting , cycling , cruising or otherwise gamboling about often at breakneck , tgv speed miss manners , a k a judith martin , is one of those who know where they like to go and do n't deviate in their devotion her latest book , no vulgar hotel the desire and pursuit of venice \( norton , 2495 \) , takes its title from henry james s novel the wings of the dove , whose heroine , milly theale , declares that in venice she will stay in no vulgar hotel , but in some fine old rooms , wholly independent , for a series of months as martin puts it , renting not necessarily a palace , but no vulgar hotel is also a requirement for savoring the living venice and truly understanding the city it s the only way , she explains , to reciprocate invitations and entertain the locals , essential aspects of pursuing friendships \( even on vacation , she remains miss manners \) in some ways , no vulgar hotel is less an ode to venice than it is to venetophiles , those who , with swaggering unpretentiousness , consider themselves something other than tourists , buying their fish from street vendors and avoiding the daytrippers' piazzas having spent many years renting or borrowing apartments for long vacations , and lately visiting the city up to four times a year , martin has even gone so far as to study the venetian dialect she seems to have read all the other books on venice and seen every play or film that contains a passing reference to her beloved town reading her book , with its captivating minihistories of venetian literary salons , families of note and artists in residence , is like attending a gossipy continental dinner party , in which martin not only plays the hostess but moonlights as various guests \( the garrulous raconteur , the imperious knowitall , the greataunt who does n't realize her listener has n't a clue whom she s talking about \) though her artfully coiffed prose can run a bit precious and long , for the most part she enlightens and entertains the best books on venice , as martin says , deftly mix the past with the personal present in a spirit of light scholarship not only does martin know what she likes , she knows how to serve it rebecca s ramsey s french by heart an american family s adventures in la belle france \( broadway , paper , 1295 \) offers no such pretensions unlike the flotilla of expatriates who publish memoirs of their sojourns in france , ramsey is neither a professional writer nor an epicurean , neither an aspiring artist nor a trustfund loafer she s a teacher who shops at j c penney and lives with her husband , a tire designer , in kensington farm , a good subdivision , full of perfectly fine vinylsided twostory houses , with a swim team , close to the soccer fields and good schools in greer , sc but when michelin offers her husband a job in clermontferrand , an unremarkable industrial hub , she s game to relocate her three children for a fouryear stint i wanted to understand it all , the frenchness of this place , she writes could we be french too , just for a little while \?

though few would deny that s macbeth , based on shakespeare s tragedy , is a work of genius , experts may disagree about the true nature of verdi s achievement adrian noble , a former director of the royal shakespeare company in london who has staged the play twice , points to verdi s scene of scottish refugees lamenting the state of their country under the tyrant s yoke , a far cry from shakespeare s political game of catandmouse among fugitive scottish nobles in shakespeare that scene is often a black hole , mr noble , 57 , said recently backstage at the , where he is directing only the third production of verdi s opera in the company s history verdi gives us the reverse camera angle , as it were , encapsulating all the pain of a bleeding country and it builds a bridge from the opera to the 20th century when verdi was writing macbeth' in 1847 , europe was crackling with unrest the story he chose to dramatize about civil war , about a great general who has become a bloody tyrant and has to be replaced with foreign aid is in a sense the history of the world since 1945 look at cuba look at zimbabwe look at southeast asia or south america in the met production , which opens monday evening , mr noble exercises the modern director s prerogative , introducing firearms into an arsenal that also includes the obligatory swords and daggers potentially more radical is his take on the witches , following the lead , he has said , of diane arbus , whose eerie camera sought out the freaks and grotesques on the fringes of american society all signs point to a serious , maximally shakespearean approach to verdi s adaptation that puts it at the far end of the spectrum from the met s last macbeth , introduced in 1982 and retired in 1988 it was the work of peter hall , also a former director of the royal shakespeare company to the shock of the openingnight audience , mr hall cared more about reviving the operatic conventions of 19thcentury italy than about demonstrating how faithful verdi was to shakespeare apart from the fact that shakespeare s play inspired the opera , the two do n't have much to do with each other , mr hall , 76 , said recently from london the opera takes an early romantic approach to the subject in macbeth and lady macbeth , we 're dealing with human emotions of a high order but the witches' music has wit in it you sense rossini looking over verdi s shoulder it s the world of trick or treat , a gothic comedy of black magic , very unlike shakespeare s world of dread and it was mr hall s treatment of the supernatural , above all , that stirred up the trouble a huge harvest moon of bright orange put people in mind of , yes , halloween the witches were more camp than scary , and when a bevy of fairies in toe shoes came tripping on in the dark forest , much of the audience exploded in laughter \( nearly 20 years after the premiere of macbeth in florence , the opera received its paris premiere it was for that production that verdi added the ballet mr noble s production omits it , but not the other revisions made at the same time \) the human psyche feels a deep desire for chills that will make you laugh , mr hall said thus shakespeare s porter scene , which fills the interval between macbeth s murder of the sleeping king duncan and the discovery of the body but in the opera the porter does n't appear in verdi , mr hall said , it s the witches who provide comic relief can you imagine an early19thcentury audience not reacting with humor \? i ca n't i'm unrepentant if i were doing the opera again , i 'd do it the same way but better i 'd put a great deal more time into stagecraft i did n't really have enough time to fly the witches properly , to put it crudely renata scotto , the italian soprano , who had a triumph as lady macbeth in mr hall s production , remembers that opening night well the new york public did not like it , she said by email , because to them the stage effects were very strange and eccentric mr hall begged to differ half of the audience got what we were trying to do and loved it , he said unlike mr hall , mr noble means to sustain the high , tragic tone throughout verdi s insights and sensitivity with respect to shakespeare are astonishing , he said the two artists are close kin given mr noble s perspective , the new cast , led by zeljko lucic , the serbian baritone , as macbeth and maria guleghina , the russian soprano , as his fiercely ambitious wife , may expect to find an audience less divided mr noble has directed only a handful of operas , but those have included some of the best mozart s nozze di figaro and cos fan tutte , monteverdi s ritorno d'ulisse in patria , verdi s falstaff his approach to opera is predicated on what he sees as its straightforward similarities to classical theater the verse in shakespeare captures at the micro level what the play as a whole expresses at the macro level , he said you ca n't be a good director of shakespeare without a strong sense of rhythm you need to feel the rhythm of the line of verse and the rhythm that shapes the play the same relationships exist in opera speaking verse and singing are much alike too a line of verse can be a mode of strangulation or it can be a mode of liberation , a weapon and so can song in developing characters , he said , his job is very much the same it s to marry to crucial traditions , he explained on the one hand there s the method , derived from stanislavsky , where as an actor i live through the character and the character lives through me on the other there s shakespeare s fundamentally different technique , which separates the person of the actor from the character in much the way the mask did in greek tragedy as an actor i learn the interior life of a character from the verse the day the met cast moved from the rehearsal studio to the stage , mr noble was applying these principles to the scene of banquo s murder in shakespeare two wary assassins are unexpectedly joined by a third , sound him out and do the deed with his help verdi expands the circle to the entire male chorus , entering in two edgy posses we 're not quite inhabiting the world of physical danger , mr noble said after the choristers shuffled on for a first go something happened in the studio that i'm not seeing here we need a moment of standoff the subtext for the second group is i'm peaceful i'm peaceful but if i have to , i can defend myself' he lifted his hands in a gesture of conciliation , though not as something for the men to copy do n't just do extra things , he said imagine keep the tension up and bring it into your singing they ran it from the top , ending with a handshake to seal the criminal pact can you feel the difference \? mr noble asked now that was terrific theater after the handshake , however , the chorus froze for a brief moment of operatic reflection , and that was less terrific you can still be moving when you start to sing , mr noble said so take a bit more time to move into position they did it again as he wished , and a tableau came to life just then the male principals were hanging around the auditorium like movie stars in their trailers , and ms guleghina s services were not required at all mr noble is hoping for the same quality of performance from his lead characters as he would want in shakespeare s play , but he acknowledges that opera singers are different animals from straight actors for one thing there s a huge difference between the way an actor approaches a part and the way a singer must approach a part , mr noble said many actors say they have to learn their lines in rehearsal as they develop an interpretation singers know their roles cold on day 1 for another thing most actors cast in a classical lead will learn it for one specific production and never play it again they expect rehearsals to be a time of continual discovery opera stars , however , specialize they tour signature roles all over the world , in productions old and new , sometimes with the benefit of extended rehearsals , sometimes with none at all maria and zeljko have sung their roles loads of times before , mr noble said maria probably has a performance , ' but she is n't just doing what she knows put her in a situation , and her dramatic instincts are formidable as a director , i watch and adapt i 'd be daft not to ms guleghina was shy about sharing details \( i'm superstitious , she said \) but she agreed that a metamorphosis was in progress adrian goes over each episode a hundred times , almost like for the camera , she said he s not a dictator , saying you go here you go there' he gives me an idea i try it many ways we change things , and then choose what is most interesting when i wake up in the morning , i ca n't wait to run to rehearsals do n't laugh a new era is starting at the met this is a modern production but done with respect , intelligence , study , preparation , heart , love , soul not like in germany it s like being reborn

bangkok , nov 9 the prodemocracy leader in , , met on friday with members of her party , the national league for democracy , for the first time in three years as well as with aung kyi , the general appointed as a liaison by myanmar s military government , news agencies reported from yangon nyan win , a spokesman for the national league for democracy , said mrs aung san suu kyi believed that the military government was serious and really willing to work for national reconciliation , reuters reported six weeks after its violent crackdown on protests led by buddhist monks , myanmar s military government has telegraphed alternating signs of combativeness and flexibility analysts say they are watching to determine whether the ruling generals' outreach to mrs aung san suu kyi is genuine or whether it falls into a wellestablished pattern of shortlived concessions toward dissidents followed by a return to a hardline stance myanmar has been under military rule for 45 years the staterun newspaper new light of myanmar said friday that the government would continue to carry out democratic change , as promised in a convention in july to set up guidelines for a constitution that the junta said was the first of a sevenstage process to establish what it called a disciplined form of democratic rule but the junta has given no time frame for the overall process the government will continue striving earnestly for national reconsolidation in true cooperation with the un secretariat , said the newspaper , which is closely read by diplomats and analysts seeking hints to the secretive government s intentions ibrahim gambari , the united nations envoy who ended a sixday mission to the country on thursday , said the government and its political opponents had agreed on a process that would lead to substantive dialogue but it is a reflection of the glacial pace of change in myanmar that allowing mrs aung san suu kyi to meet with her colleagues passes for progress mrs aung san suu kyi , 62 , who has been held under house arrest on and off since 1990 , said in a statement released by the united nations late thursday that she was willing to cooperate with the government in the interest of the nation she said she would represent as broad a range of political organizations and forces as possible , not just her party this may be out of necessity , analysts say the national league for democracy , which won the 1990 elections that were ignored by the military , has been reduced to a skeletal party after many of its leaders were harassed , jailed or fled the country she s got a pretty weak hand , said sean turnell , a specialist on myanmar at macquarie university in sydney , australia so many people have been arrested , she s isolated , she s been imprisoned for 19 years , her husband has died , her children have grown up without her that s got to wear you down mrs aung san suu kyi has been called to negotiate with the generals several times over the past 17 years none of the talks have persuaded the government to begin relinquishing control so far there is little to suggest that these negotiations are different , said win min , a lecturer in contemporary burmese politics at payap university in the northern thai city of chiang mai they are just making procedural concessions , mr win min said but he noted that the junta had stopped dismissing her as irrelevant in state media , the word used to describe her for years anger over the crackdown may have also led to cracks within the government , especially among younger officers in the military mr win min said he had heard reports of lenient treatment from recently released leaders of the september demonstrations they thought they would be very hurt , he said of the released dissidents instead , he said , the officers told them we are just doing our jobs we are not going to torture you
miami , jan 31 when his soninlaw , patrick mannelly , complains of sore elbows , all tommy john can do is laugh before mannelly married john s daughter , tamara , nine years ago , john had no idea that long snappers and baseball pitchers could have anything in common john won 288 games during his 26year career , but he is perhaps better known for the experimental elbow surgery he had in 1974 two days before tamara s birth that resurrected his career and has been named after him mannelly , who became the chicago bears' long snapper and john s soninlaw in the span of three months in 1998 , is the longesttenured bear on the super bowl roster , along with center olin kreutz though he is not as renowned as bears linebacker brian urlacher or as recognized as bears placekicker robbie gould , mannelly is held in high esteem by his teammates we have the best long snapper in the league , brad maynard , the punter and the holder on field goals and extra points , said wednesday we realize it our team realizes it the organization realizes it that s why he s been here nine years if the average nfl fan does not know mannelly from bears safety danieal manning , it is because long snappers are the most anonymous people on the field this side of the game officials the only time they seem to be noticed is when they mess up there is a common misconception that bending over and hiking a ball 10 yards is , well , a snap people think it s a lot easier than it is , said mannelly , who started a web site , , in an effort to educate the masses i get emails all the time saying i want to be a long snapper in the nfl who do i contact \? ' as mannelly s career at duke was winding down , john called his friend bill parcells , who was coaching the jets , to gauge his future soninlaw s pro prospects john said parcells told him that if mannelly could deliver the ball to the punter within 075 of a second , there would probably be a spot for him in the nfl so i called patrick and asked him how much time it took him to snap the ball to the punter , and he said seventenths of a second , john said wednesday in a telephone interview i told him , good that s very good' john did not appreciate how similar the mechanics of snapping and pitching were until he started to watch mannelly , who was drafted by chicago in the sixth round in 1998 now the two talk regularly about release points and spin and target spots the thing i liken long snapping to is a lefthanded relief pitcher , john said , because it s a specialized position you 're brought in to perform a specific task , and if you 're good at it and patrick is very good you can stay around for a long , long time john , 63 , knows what it is like to play on the grand stage , having been a member of three teams that played in the world series he has shared his experiences with mannelly , but he hopes they do not end up having a shared experience the los angeles dodgers teams that john played on in 1977 and 1978 lost to the yankees , and the 1981 yankees team he was on lost to the dodgers mannelly , 31 , has not had a snap this season that resulted in a punt , field goal or extra point being aborted i had one this year in practice , he said , sounding none too happy about it he flirted with disaster in the bears' secondround playoff game against the seattle seahawks , though he was the only one brooding about it afterward on a fieldgoal attempt in the fifth minute of overtime , mannelly s snap to maynard was a little high , but maynard was able to pull it down and spin the ball into place without affecting the timing of gould , who nailed the 49yarder to win the game when mannelly talked to his fatherinlaw afterward about knowing as soon as the ball left his hands that the release point had not been quite right , john knew exactly what he meant john s specialty pitch was a sinker , which meant he fielded quite a few ground balls sometimes , he said , on the throw to a fielder , you 'd get the ball down in the palm of your hand instead of getting out on your fingers , and when that happened you did n't know where the throw was going on occasion , john will gently remind mannelly that long snappers , like fastball pitchers , can improve their aim by taking a little speed off their throws that advice has proved particularly helpful for mannelly , whose target is small on punts , he aims for maynard s belt buckle on field goals and extra points , his target is the inside crease of maynard s left elbow john grew up in terre haute , ind , the son of two devoted bears fans so the bears were part of his family long before he had a bear in his family he was surprised when tamara told him that she was dating a football player since she had vowed she would never , ever marry a professional athlete i'm always reminding her of that , john said it s just another twist in a family bond that grows ever tighter
tripoli , , sept 9 col swatted flies with a longhandled whisk as he and secretary general of the talked this weekend about their joint interest in bringing peace to the region of sudan distraction was clearly setting in as the meeting reached the onehour mark saturday in a tent outside the libyan leader s desert retreat in sirte , and it was time for mr ban s favorite move the t te t te aides were excused , mr ban drew his armchair closer to the colonel s , and they continued on alone for another half hour eight months into his job as secretary general , this resort to personal action has become the stamp of mr ban s diplomacy and the early measure of how effective he will prove to be he put it to the test this past week on a frantically paced sevenday , sevenstop african trip devoted to gaining the support of countries in the region for curbing the violence in the darfur region of western sudan , which has cost more than 200 , 000 lives and made 25 million villagers homeless he came away with a pledge from president omar hassan albashir of sudan , who has a record of showing disdain for the united nations , to enter peace talks with sudanese rebels here in tripoli next month under the auspices of the united nations and the  and he gained promises from colonel qaddafi and idriss d by , the president of chad , to try to persuade sudanese rebel groups over whom they have influence to participate in the talks rebel groups have held talks with the government before with only limited success but as mr ban saw it , the promises he got on this trip were a triumph of his bent for personal engagement it has been my firm belief , sort of my lifestyle and personal philosophy , that sincerity and honesty is the key to everything in diplomacy , he said sunday in an interview in his seafront tripoli hotel he acknowledged that this left him open to criticism that he appeared indecisive and na ve i know it makes me look too modest , but in the end , even with people who are involved in conflicts , i have been able to make some personal relationships on the basis of trust , he said it may take time , but i'm not a person who excels with a very brief time mr bashir s agreement to new talks followed a oneonone meeting monday night , with no aides present , in khartoum it was the third time this year that mr ban had subjected mr bashir to his brand of friendly arm twisting while mr ban was greeted during the trip at palaces and airports with red carpets , sharpcadenced military displays and african dancers of the kind that welcome heads of state , he has none of the authority that they do unlike national governments , the united nations does not enjoy much power in terms of resources , he said we only work on the basis of a higher moral ground and a very sincere , genuine commitment to engage in dialogue his aides say mr ban is as deliberate and earnest in exercising his influence in private as he is in public it is n't as if he plays buddybuddy with bashir , grabs his arm and chats his up about the latest rugby match , said one of his darfur specialists , speaking anonymously because he was giving a personal assessment he is all talking points the united nations often suffers from a reputation for ineffectiveness and delay from the collision of high expectations and institutional limitations , and no situation has better illustrated this crippling reality than the continuing crisis in darfur many people have looked to the united nations to stop the bloodletting in darfur , and say the organization has been slow to act mr ban declared on taking office that he would make darfur his top international priority , a bold move given the outside hopes and sudan s resistance to international involvement at the time of his election last fall , mr ban was expected to devote himself to a businesslike overhaul of the creaking united nations management whether he will accomplish that goal remains to be seen , but he has made more than 20 overseas trips in an effort to practice personal diplomacy in his appearances , he is still hampered by a wooden style of delivering speeches and an overdependence on bureaucratic references to united nations programs and numbing bromides about the international community but while his personal efforts at persuasion seem to have been the hallmark of his first months in office , he remains characteristically modest and measured in assessing it we have made credible progress , he said of his african trip , but i would not claim a solid achievement because it is progress on commitments , and these commitments must be realized in action
my dad had been serving his tour of duty in vietnam when he d decided to adopt he and my mother had already had two boys and wanted a girl in 1970 , toward the last six months of his tour , he d come across me in an orphanage and taken me home at least , that s what i d been told as a child in the early days of my childhood , i believed myself to be a true orphan with no living genetic parents the thought that i d had another mother and father before my adoption didn t even occur to me until second or third grade with the exception of my dad , no one spoke of my adoption at length perhaps it was my family s way of telling me that it didn t matter they loved me regardless of my unfortunate circumstances further still , my past was too closely linked to a war that had cost thousands of american and vietnamese lives for my dad , this was yet another reason not to talk too much about our shared past in vietnam war created the circumstances of my adoption , chaos an excuse for hiding the truth and time covered the trail it boiled down to , life happens here s a shovel now dig it still baffles me that some adoptees must exert so much effort just for the hope of gaining access to a history that rightfully belongs to them the obvious question is , why \? perhaps the fact that i wore the face of the other side doubled the importance of locking away certain memories forever maybe he feared conflicting feelings that might arise in my own growing consciousness as i learned about the conflict between my birth country and my adopted one many of us from that era still have memories we choose not to speak of or think about , he once wrote in a letter to me , it is just a selfprotective mechanism of our human nature to preserve our dignity and perhaps our very own sanity unfortunately , in his attempts to bury parts of his past , he also secreted away vital keys to mine and with it my personal history and identity not content to leave the story open ended , he invented a scenario that might offer us both some closure my parents had divorced shortly after my adoption my mother had been my primary caregiver for most of my childhood during the early part of my adolescence , i went to live with my dad shortly after my arrival , he decided it was time to tell me the truth of my adoption i was 14 when he called me into the room honey , come here i have something to tell you he then began to tell the story of how he d fallen in love with my vietnamese mother while he was serving in vietnam how i d been the result of that love and how he d brought me back under the guise of adoption my dad was married to my adoptive mother at the time , so the need for the ruse was obvious , wasn t it \? as for my mother , he told me , she d been killed by a group of viet cong after which he d taken me to hoi duc anh orphanage in order to begin the adoption process my feelings at that sudden disclosure almost 14 years ago escape me but i do know it wasn t like what you see in the movies there were no tearful , joyous declarations of , daddy ! no feelings of resolution no closure i can t remember how i felt only my reaction endures in my memory i smiled , tried to comfort him with a hug and left the room we didn t really speak of it again aside from his occasional remarks of how i walked or looked like my mother how could i convey my feelings of betrayal at having been lied to \? i didn t have the tools to process how learning i was amerasian threw my identity into chaos deeper still , how could i explain that with his sudden confession , he d just killed all hopes of ever finding my mother \? as an orphan , there had remained a small glint of hope now that was gone in silence , i spent the next several years trying to come to terms with what he d told me my mechanism of choice was denial i went on with my life trying to not to think of it too much it worked better on some days than others but his words and their affects on me were always there they manifested themselves in every aspect of my life , directed my choices in ways i m still trying to understand i finished high school , got married and had children of my own just like everyone else , but i could never rid myself of the sense that my insides had been ripped from beneath my skin and then there were the unanswered questions what was my mother s name \? why did he have no photos of her \? what about other family members still in vietnam \? by the time i reached my midthirties , i couldn t stand it i had to know after over a decade of silence , i began to ask those questions out loud and once again , my dad s response threw me into chaos the words of bryan thao worra , a laotian adoptee and poet , reverberate through my mind as i make yet another necessary edit to my story for transcultural adoptees , our lives are written in pencil everything you think you know about yourself can change in an instant and for me it did it seems that i am not my dad s genetic daughter after all he didn t say it directly , but it was obvious you were already in the orphanage when i got there even this small detail took months of prodding and questioning once it was out , he offered up a tangible clue to my past it was a 37yearold address in saigon that he said belonged to my foster mother , ta kim cuc so here is my dad s most recent version of my beginnings i have no way of knowing if it is true cuc somehow learned of my dad s wishes and took him straight to my crib in the orphanage after that , i was taken to her house where i stayed for the next six months she accompanied us to the airport before we left vietnam and gave my father her address give this to le thi , she instructed , so that i can find out what became of her does or did this woman really exist \? if so , how long did she wait hoping for the letter that never came \? is it possible that she s waiting , still holding perhaps the only clue to the identity of my mother \? why did my dad never write to her \? why did he wait until i d nearly driven myself crazy with the longing to know my history before he d given me her address \? i was waiting until you understood more about life i had my reasons , was the only explanation he offered all i heard was , i am not accountable i couldn t disagree more adoption isn t just about destiny , circumstance and selfcongratulation for saving a child it s also about the consequences of conscious decisions made for adoptees supposedly in our best interest regardless of whether it s for better or worse , adoption is the power to change a life and as the saying goes , with great power , comes great responsibility my history had been hidden and altered , affecting my life in ways i m only beginning to understand furthermore , my father s actions may have possibly prevented me from ever finding out the truth what i think my dad failed to realize is that regardless of his own feelings , the truth of my adoption was rightfully mine to know he was simply holding it in trust and was responsible for giving me unfiltered access to it unlike in decades past , the act of hiding an adoptee s heritage is not beyond question or criticism we should be past the days when adoptees are forced to shoulder the burden of maintaining the illusion that none of it matters in my own situation , though , the instinct to comfort and reassure is too ingrained despite my feeling of outrage and betrayal , i cannot break my conditioning it s alright , dad , i said i was glad we were talking over the phone , that he couldn t see the look on my face i understand i didn t understand but what good would it have done to say so \? i m 37 years old with four kids of my own how much more was i suppose to understand about life before he deemed me ready to hear the truth \? the fact is he withheld and even altered vital pieces of my puzzle years after my initial inquiries knowing that forces me to question the nature of his other reasons without further explanation , i am again left to speculate but to what end \? my dad and i both know it wouldn t do anything good for me to push the matter even if i tried to hold him accountable for withholding information that was rightfully mine , we both know he would throw up the old reliable defense everything i did was in your best interest how do you argue with that \? it s not that i doubt my dad s sincerity i have little doubt that he believed his decisions were based in large part on what he thought was best for me unfortunately , we disagree sympathy or even empathy does not equal acceptance or approval in fact , over the years , i have become highly critical of his actions by way of omission , deception and halftruth , he altered my personal history and my identity his actions not only affected me , but all those around me , including my children and even the life of an obscure , almost forgotten woman by the name of ta kim cuc that is , if she exists if i bring thoughts of my vietnamese mother into the picture , the pain and anger become unbearable my dad would probably argue that he simply told my story as a continuation of his true , my story is part of his own , but in telling it through his own perceptions and not including mine , he took away my ownership and for that i need to hold him accountable  i have tried to write a letter cuc to whom it may concern but how do you write a letter to a person who may no longer be alive and send it to an address that may no longer exist \? to whom it may concern \? my father s choices concerned us all my whole family has had to live with the consequences , yet i am the one left with the job of rectifying his wrongs it is the thought foremost in my mind as i scramble to find the one woman who could unravel decades of secrecy i can t even begin to think of how i might react if it s discovered she s already passed from this life , taking it all with her of course , i will always love my dad as any dutiful daughter does , but i will always feel betrayed any feelings of ingratitude , disloyalty and guilt about my anger takes a back seat to a sense of urgency as i run full steam backwards into the past
to the editor i can truly relate to verlyn klinkenborg s thoughts on familiar places that are no longer there \( remembered spaces , the city life , july 17 \) it happened to 80 percent of my city overnight thousands of establishments that helped define our little world were suddenly gone , and none will ever be exactly the same if they ever return our dedicated patronage at those places turned out to be a useless investment it is a strange feeling now we are well along demolishing thousands of homes and businesses ruined by the floods from the levee failures every day , i see newly empty lots and often sit and stare at them and am usually disappointed by my inability to recall what was there it is a very strange feeling ray broussard new orleans , july 17 , 2007
our band of undergraduate students at harvard , under the umbrella of the kennedy school s institute of politics , is spending a lot of time in new hampshire in the leadup to the state s jan 8 primary the students braved the chilly prelude to that granite winter wonderland this past weekend , and filed these posts \( the snow is starting to fall in the northeast and elsewhere , mind you \) you can read a lot more takes at campusvoicesorg and watch their videos , \( which are pretty cool in that youtubey way that is , pardon the 08 phrase , authentic \) and we ll link later to some new videos from their recent forays here are three ontheground takes from the weekend that offer all of us a glimpse of what s up in new hampshire , from the everyday voter to residents just trundling through the cold as they try to figure out which candidate offers them what they want these students are not journalists they ve pretty much become witnesses to the scenes at hand as part of their academic work we are inviting students , who are engaged in reporting out the primary scene from other schools , to offer up their insights , too for now , remember that new hampshire voters are notorious for being undecided until the very last minute by lisa rotenstein nashua , nh at 21 fahrenheit , it was definitely one of new hampshire s colder days , and most of the state stayed inside however , campus voices braved the weather and explored the turf here in a city that boasts a beautiful main street now laden with christmas decorations and lights that dotted the storefronts one common thread among voters was the continued ringing of the telephone that may make some cringe , and may do more harm than good it s annoying sometimes how you will get calls from candidates four or five times a day , kathy flis , cashier and server at joanne s kitchen and coffee shop , told us i eventually switched to only a cell phone because i got so many campaign calls leni hodgins who worked in a small purse shop reiterated ms flis s comment , saying , i don t like the phone calls they are overwhelming i would almost vote for the person who calls the last we also found other residents who didn t think they were well enough informed to talk about the primary or the candidates i m not as up to date on my politics as i should be , one woman said i am not very politically savvy , said another i m not as schooled in politics as i need to be , ed morrie jr of aubuchon s hardware store told us , but his approach in choosing a candidate would be to focus on trustworthiness rather than the issues dishonesty seems to go hand in hand with politicians nowadays , he said he wants a candidate who is honest , someone he can trust to make the right decisions and still others are focused on issues that mattered to them i m a bornagain christian said john webber so i need a candidate who supports my values the candidate needs to have my stands on abortion chris forman wants the veterans out of iraq his experiences with a stepfather who lost a leg in war taught him how much war can and does affect children he thinks that barack obama will bring america s troops home from the war , and has given him his support wendell palmer , an employee at alec s shoes , told us that while he had not decided his candidate yet , he really wanted someone who would look out for the middle class the poor get help and the rich don t need help , and while my family donates to charities and tries to help people out each year , we need somebody to take care of the middle class he told us that he needed a politician who could look out for him , and cared most about health care for his age group and people like him in particular brian regan wanted somebody who was not from within the system and has taken a liking to bill richardson i m tired of hillary and obama , he bemoaned while he liked mr obama at first , he found him playing too much softball throughout the campaign in trying to appeal to such a wide range of voters he just didn t take hard stances while most voters we talked to were still undecided and not fully engaged or enamored of the new hampshire primary , most nevertheless appeared to be slightly in awe when they stopped to think of what they were so instrumental in determining \( selecting a president \) , and how cool , how awesome it was that they were in the midst , the bustling midst , of it all by jon noronha manchester , nh we covered college convention 2008 while there , we saw and got to speak to ron paul and mike huckabee  congressman paul rolled in about 9 am and , as always , there was a mob of rabid supporters around him he spoke to the crowd of assembled college students \( which had dwindled by then because it was the last day of the convention \) and gave what i assume was his standard stump speech about the money supply and foreign policy the students were excited to see him , and on the way out one of our interviews was drowned out by supporters all over the hall chanting ron paul ron paul but the main attraction was definitely mr huckabee i had never seen him speak in that kind of setting before , and i was blown away he arrived on the scene around noon and was greeted by a mob even bigger than congressman paul s before his speech , he was set to broadcast his infamous chuck norris ad , but then there were technical difficulties and even under that situation , he shone , bantering with the crowd and making them feel like old friends having a beer and complaining about windows he was getting wild applause before they finally got the ad to play , and once it did the crowd was roaring mr huckabee had them in his pocket before the event started , and as his speech progressed he got better and better , with lots of great jokes and stories he was channeling reagan the whole time , in a way i d seen every candidate try for but only one succeed he knew exactly which buttons to press for the young audience , and in contrast to mr paul , he talked about our issues global warming \( from a republican \? \) , health care \( in a way that didn t make it sound like an aarp issue \) , education \( without being prompted \) , and the more touchyfeeling bridging divides sort of language that mr obama has , up to this point , pretty much owned i can see exactly why mr huckabee is surging in iowa he connects with people in a way that none of the other candidates even come close to by kristine beckerle porstmouth , nh we headed here , a very picturesque , quaint town with christmas wreaths and lights adorning the streets , a perfect place for interaction with new hampshire voters and campaign volunteers jeff and dan , two 20something guys canvassing for senator obama , were passionate about their candidate , but much more so about their issue they talked at length about campaign finance reform , and had actually chosen their candidate to them , changing the rules of financing for campaigns is the key to fixing every other problem in our democracy their focus on changing the power structure in washington was echoed by other voices here emily arsenault , a staff member for john edwards , talked about his appeal as one of the first candidates to outwardly say he would not accept money from corporate lobbyists she echoed some of his typical talking points , as a candidate who would work for the people , who was not a part of the traditional washington institution that was unresponsive to the citizens , and as a guy who would fight to break the exclusionary system john , a young man we found in a record store , supported mr obama , or ron paul while the two candidates may seem completely at odds with one another , he came to them because of their mutual distance from the perceived washington corruption he wanted someone who didn t listen to interest groups , and would be willing to change things overall , the theme was of anger at the separation between what washington says and what washington does , and an overwhelming desire to see something different come through this next election
the women s yearend championships are in full swing in madrid , with still in fine form and maria sharapova showing signs of resurgence in shanghai , the men s yearend championships are set to start tomorrow with the top eight men in the world , led by roger federer but it has been difficult to focus on mere tennis matches this fall there have been continued concerns about match fixing and about the integrity of nikolay davydenko , the men s no 4 player there have been continued concerns about doping , with retiring suddenly last week and revealing that she had tested positive for cocaine at wimbledon hingis denied using the drug there have even been concerns about foul play , with germany s top player , , planning to have medical examinations in the united states to help determine whether it was possible that he was poisoned in moscow in september during a davis cup semifinal that russia won yesterday , the italian tennis federation confirming that the journeyman alessio di mauro , ranked no 124 in the world , was under investigation for betting on other tennis player s matches through an online account amidst all this , who has had time to follow upbeat stories like david nalbandian s revival and lindsay davenport s remarkable comeback after pregnancy \? i think it s the nature of sport in this day and age that there are real issues that every sport has to deal with in terms of ensuring integrity and keeping it clean , said larry scott , the chairman and chief executive of the wta tour noting that tennis has enjoyed a reputation as a clean sport , he added , it does n't mean we are immune to the types of things all sports deal with scott spoke before the story surfaced about haas poisoning is certainly not something with which many sports have to cope , and it was unclear whether the concerns were founded they were generated by a german news report in which haas s doubles partner , alexander waske , said that he had been informed by a contact in russia of the reason haas fell ill during the davis cup semifinal someone came to me and said , it was a tight match , it s a shame that tommy was poisoned , ' waske told german news agency sid without identifying his interlocutor haas was unable to play singles on the final day , and russia eventually won the semifinal , 32 , and will face the united states in the davis cup final in portland , ore , beginning nov 30 i have never felt so miserable in my whole life as i did on the saturday and sunday nights in moscow , haas , the world s no 13 player , told sid my stomach is still doing some strange things the international tennis federation , which runs davis cup , has announced that it intends to open an investigation into what happened , although officials with the german tennis federation have distanced themselves from the poisoning theory the german federation spokesman , oliver quante , told reuters that the erich rembeck , the german team doctor , had seen no medical evidence to support a claim of poisoning russian tennis officials , including the davis cup captain , shamil tarpishchev , have also dismissed the allegations haas declined further comment through his agent , tony godsick meanwhile , russia s top male player , davydenko , continues in the focus of an unwanted spotlight in his last two tournaments , he was fined by the atp for a visible lack of effort in st petersburg , russia , and was then lectured on his serving technique by another skeptical umpire during a loss at the masters series event in paris but none of those developments were as curious as the online betting patterns during davydenko s secondround loss to martin vassallo arguello in sopot , poland , in august all payments were eventually suspended by betfair , an internet betting exchange , after large wagers were laid on a davydenko defeat , even after he won the first set he eventually retired from the match , citing a foot injury that match is now under investigation by the atp davydenko has denied any attempt to fix the match , but he could be banned for life from the sport if he is found to have been involved his wife , irina , and brother and coach , eduard , were among those interviewed by atp investigators this week since davydenko s match in poland became a source of concern , several players have come forward to say they have declined offers to throw matches among them were dmitry tursunov of russia , paul goldstein of the united states , arnaud cl ment of france and gilles elseneer , a belgian who said he was approached to lose at wimbledon in 2005 none of those players approached the atp or the itf with that information before going public no player has publicly identified his wouldbe bribers representatives from tennis s governing bodies met in london last month to begin creating and sharing the cost for an internal watchdog structure they have dubbed the tennis integrity unit it s not something that should happen it s something that must happen , said etienne de villiers , head of the atp , who said that he believed match tampering was more of a threat to tennis than doping
east rutherford , nj , oct 18 two weeks from opening night , isiah thomas is still pondering lineup options and which 10 players should comprise his rotation a group that almost certainly will not include  the opened thursday s preseason game against with a new starting lineup , and with houston sitting behind the bench , wearing a suit thomas , the knicks' coach , asked houston not to dress for the game , a 11094 nets victory , and cast his bid to make the roster in grim terms asked if houston s chances were slim , thomas said , i 'd say that s accurate the decision to sit houston certainly looked like a blow to his comeback attempt houston is eager to prove he can play after knee injuries forced his retirement in 2005 but he played only six minutes wednesday , his first game in nearly three years their call , houston said of the decision not to suit up asked if he wanted to play , he said , i'm not angry houston then tried to play down the situation , saying it was a good day to rest and that it was definitely a mutual agreement the knicks have until oct 29 to reduce the roster to 15 players , but houston s fate may be decided sooner the knicks already have 15 guaranteed contracts and little room to maneuver i just do n't feel there s a need to play him in a backtoback situation , thomas said we know what he can do , we know what he s capable of doing he does n't need to prove it , per se thomas said that houston definitely needs as much court time as possible , but you also want to be respectful of the player and the person thomas acknowledged that houston s comeback attempt has put him in a tough position , a point houston made last week this is the toughest part of the business , is when you have to call somebody in your office and tell them that it s not going to work out , thomas said none of us like doing it , so when that day comes , if it comes , we 'll do what s best for the knicks stephon marbury also sat out the game , conserving his knees and giving jamal crawford a rare start at point guard thomas said he wanted to see crawford and nate robinson run the point jared jeffries started at small forward , and quentin richardson shifted to shooting guard eddy curry and zach randolph started their second consecutive game together , with moderately better results curry finished with 23 points and went 9 for 13 from the field randolph had 8 points and 9 rebounds and shot 3 for 9 crawford , who missed all eight of his attempts a night earlier , scored 22 points and was 7 for 15 the night featured a promising return by nets center nenad krstic , who played his first game since tearing a knee ligament dec 22 krstic scored 11 points in 15 minutes , making all 5 of his fieldgoal attempts , including a 3pointer rebounds jason kidd missed the game because of a strained lower back but could return to practice sometime next week , the nets announced kidd was given an epidural to reduce inflammation in the back , which he injured sunday he has not played in a preseason game , but could return for the nets' final two exhibition games knicks center jerome james needs surgery on his ailing left knee but is hoping to delay it until after the season james said four screws in the knee inserted during reconstructive surgery in 1999 have come loose and are causing extreme irritation the problem was discovered last season , but it did not become a debilitating problem until the summer , when james twisted the knee during a workout if there is no improvement soon , james said he would probably schedule surgery to remove the screws
rutshuru , word spread quickly of the surrender of four interahamwe , members of the hutu fearsome youth militia that carried out the rwandan genocide in 1994 and has been hiding in the eastern congo jungles since a crowd of people in their sunday best soon gathered to gawk at the young men as they marched through town but in a sign of how complex the hutu militia has become , the four wiry young men were barely out of diapers when an estimated 800 , 000 rwandans , mostly tutsis , were killed by hutu extremists in the biggest mass murder since world war ii what is more , the teenagers were not even from they were congolese we got tired of life in the bush , said roger seburo , a 19yearold fighter , hungry and holloweyed from days of walking through the jungle we want to join the regular army and leave the bush we do n't want to fight with the rwandans anymore congo s civil war , a complex and seemingly endless conflict that drew in neighboring countries and killed as many as four million people , is inextricably tied to the rwandan genocide the hutu militia and soldiers who led the genocide fled into congo , then called zaire , in 1994 when a tutsiled rebel force toppled the rwandan government how to deal with these foreign fighters has been at the root of the humanitarian emergency in congo battles among the rwandan hutu militia , the congolese army and a congolese tutsi general who insists that the hutu militia be disarmed have forced 425 , 000 civilians to flee in the past year , and plunged congo into its deepest crisis since the war ended in 2003 many have tried in the past 13 years to remove the rwandan militia frustrated that those responsible for the slaughter in rwanda were hiding as refugees across the border , rwanda sponsored a rebel movement in congo in 1996 to attack them rwanda s prot g , laurent d kabila , took power after he pushed congo s longtime ruler , mobutu sese seko , into exile but mr kabila soon turned on his rwandan allies , and eventually united with the rwandanled hutu militia they fought the rwandan government and its allies in the second , perhaps most deadly , chapter of congo s civil war the war devolved into plundering by local militias and foreign armies , who all fought to control congo s mineral wealth a peace deal ended the war in 2003 , and last year congo had its first democratic elections in four decades , but the east remains a battleground rwanda says those responsible for the genocide remain in congo and should be turned over to rwandan authorities to face justice rwanda also says that the congolese army uses the militia as an auxiliary force to fight the renegade tutsi general , laurent nkunda congolese military officials deny that , but current and former rwandan hutu soldiers say they have often fought with congolese forces most of the rwandan militia in rutshuru district wore congolese army uniforms the fdlr has become part of this fight , said richard sezibera , a senior rwandan diplomat , referring to the name now used by the hutu militia this is a foreign armed group , a terrorist organization , and they work together with the congolese military rwandan officials assert that the congolese army has given the militia weapons col delphin k kahimbi , deputy commander of the congolese army in the region , said that such cooperation could never happen the fdlr recruits who surrendered to the united nations on sunday said that they had worked with the congolese army in operations against general nkunda s men , and that their rwandan commander regularly spoke with his congolese counterparts they talk on phones to share tactics , said mr seburo , one of the fighters the four were still boys when they were recruited , and they received military instruction as well as a potent dose of antitutsi ideology they told us tutsi are the worst people in the world , said mr seburo they said tutsi want to destroy congo and make it part of rwanda the rwandan army withdrew from congo under the peace accord , and the rwandan militias have not mounted a serious attack on rwanda since 2001 some analysts say the threat they pose is less to rwanda s government , which is protected by one of africa s most formidable armies , than to the congolese people the fdlr is routinely accused of committing terrible atrocities in congo it is particularly well known for raping women , often leaving them incontinent or unable to bear children it controls large territories in north and south kivu provinces , preying on villages for cash , crops and animals here in rutshuru , a rural district of north kivu province , a complex picture of these rwandan occupiers emerged many militia members , like the four young deserters , are actually congolese many are hutus , but members of other ethnic groups have joined the rwandans because they felt threatened by general nkunda s fight to control parts of rutshuru today the fdlr is a formidable but ultimately fractured force some factions are made up of diehard fighters further toughened by nearly 14 years in the bush they seek to overthrow the rwandan government and establish a hutudominated rule some even speak of finishing what was started in 1994 , in the words of one fdlr commander , a dark hint at plans for more mass killings of tutsis other factions are led by rwandans but made up largely of congolese foot soldiers and seem focused on selfenrichment the fdlr was not achieving its objective of bringing rwandans in congo home to live in dignity , said col rashid ngoboka , 38 , a former rwandan soldier who runs a splinter group of the fdlr they are busy getting rich on congo s minerals and have lost their way he said none of his men had been involved in the genocide our goal is to change the political system in rwanda and to live side by side with tutsi , he said a few miles up the road , katwiguru is occupied by another group of fdlr fighters whose hatred of tutsis is more typical of the militia katwiguru villagers said they were not happy to play host to heavily armed foreign extremists , but had little choice we are tired of living with the problems of rwanda at our doorstep , but what can we do \? said yoweri bwiruka kanyenyezi , the chief of katwiguru what the villagers here fear most happened this year a brigade of the congolese army battled to push the fdlr out of this area to try to appease general nkunda and persuade him to integrate his troops into the congolese army thousands were forced to flee their homes they missed the planting season and now have no crops the brigade executed any hutu it found , accusing them of being fdlr members , several witnesses said hutus were killed because they were hutus , said simon habimana , a congolese red cross worker in katwiguru they were not militia he pointed to mounds that he and other villagers said were mass graves from the assault in one , human bones were visibleunder a thin layer of earth the violence has forced tens of thousands into squalid camps cholera is rampant the united nations is trying to persuade rwandan militiamen to turn in their arms and go home and congo plans a peace conference this month that is expected to include general nkunda , a prospect aid workers welcome when militants clash , it is always the people who suffer , mr habimana said we do n't want to be chased away again
ottawa , april 30 \( ap \) ray emery held off the on monday night until his teammates could find a way to score on  emery stopped 25 shots and tom preissing scored 4 minutes 46 seconds into the third period for the senators in a 20 victory in game 3 of their eastern conference semifinal series ottawa leads in the bestofseven series , 21 game 4 will be wednesday the shutout for emery was his second of the playoffs his first came in the victory that clinched ottawa s firstround series against pittsburgh brodeur , who has 22 career postseason shutouts and 94 playoff victories , finished with 32 saves it s definitely great to play against a legend of the game like that , and it s a great feeling to win , emery said preissing beat brodeur with a high shot from a tight angle in front of the right boards for a 10 lead at some point , something s going to have to go in , preissing said it just happened to be on my shot if i had five more shots like that , probably none of them would go in jason spezza scored into an empty net with 56 seconds to play brodeur said that he was disappointed that the referees had not seen senators center mike fisher make contact with him on preissing s goal i got touched , brodeur said it s unfortunate he did n't make the call on it he probably did n't think it was enough for him to call , but it definitely took my concentration away fisher acknowledged that he made contact with brodeur i got a piece of brodeur and i tripped him up a little bit , and preissing got the shot away , he said it was a great shot i did n't intentionally try to trip him devils coach lou lamoriello said he did not care about fisher s intent that was interference on the goaltender , lamoriello said , adding , i do n't think it matters whether it was intentional or not he made contact with the goalie the senators ended fivegame points streaks by brian gionta , who had scored in five consecutive games , and scott gomez , who is the playoffs scoring leader the game was scoreless through the first two periods ottawa mounted the more sustained attack the devils sought to be opportunistic each team had plenty of chances , but brodeur and emery came up with big saves the senators actually put the puck in the net twice in the first period , but each time a whistle had just blown to stop play the first time , brodeur made a save , then spezza drove to the crease and jammed the puck into the net the referee kelly sutherland quickly interrupted the celebration , waving off the goal from his position directly behind the net the second time , the senators were on the power play with 31 seconds remaining in the first antoine vermette got the puck off a scramble and put a shot past brodeur , but time had expired
the savage detectives by roberto bolano translated by natasha wimmer 577 pp farrar , straus giroux 27 over the last few years , roberto bolano s reputation , in english at least , has been spreading in a quiet contagion the loud arrival of a long novel , the savage detectives , will ensure that few are now untouched until recently there was even something a little masonic about the way bolano s name was passed along between readers in this country i owe my awareness of him to a friend who excitedly lent me a now nevertobereturned copy of bolano s extraordinary novella by night in chile this wonderfully strange chilean imaginer , at once a grounded realist and a lyricist of the speculative , who died in 2003 at the age of 50 , has been acknowledged for a few years now in the spanishspeaking world as one of the greatest and most influential modern writers those without spanish have had to rely on the loyal intermittence of translation , beginning with by night in chile \( 2003 \) , two more short novels distant star \( 2004 \) and amulet \( 2007 \) and a book of stories , last evenings on earth \( 2006 \) , all translated by chris andrews and published by new directions the best way to offer a sense of this writer might be to take a scene , and a sentence , from by night in chile , still his greatest work the book is narrated by father urrutia , a dying priest and conservative literary critic , a member of opus dei , who comes to emblematize , by the novella s end , the silent complicity of the chilean literary establishment with the murderous pinochet regime in one episode , father urrutia is sent to europe , by opus dei agents , to report on the preservation of the churches there this is where bolano s imagination suddenly expands into a magical diorama father urrutia discovers that the chief threat to the churches comes from pigeon excrement , and that all over europe churches have been using falcons to kill the pests in turin , father angelo has a fearsome falcon called othello in strasbourg , father joseph has one named xenophon in avignon , the murderous falcon is named ta gueule , and the narrator watches it in action ta gueule appeared again like a lightning bolt , or the abstract idea of a lightning bolt , and stooped on the huge flocks of starlings coming out of the west like swarms of flies , darkening the sky with their erratic fluttering , and after a few minutes the fluttering of the starlings was bloodied , scattered and bloodied , and afternoon on the outskirts of avignon took on a deep red hue , like the color of sunsets seen from an airplane , or the color of dawns , when the passenger is woken gently by the engines whistling in his ears and lifts up the little blind and sees the horizon marked with a red line , like the planet s femoral artery , or the planet s aorta , gradually swelling , and i saw that swelling blood vessel in the sky over avignon , the bloodstained flight of the starlings , ta guele splashing color like an abstract expressionist painter much of the most successfully daring postwar fiction has been by writers committed to the long dramatic sentence \( bohumil hrabal , thomas bernhard , w g sebald , jos \? aramago \) bolano is in their company the quotation here is broken off of a phrase that takes about a page in the book the musical control is impeccable , and one is struck by bolano s ability to nudge on his long , light , ethereal sentence impossibly , like someone punting a leaf image by image the falcon , the red hue , the sunset , the dawn , the dawn seen from a plane , the femoral artery , the blood vessel , the abstract painter it could so easily be too much , and somehow is n't , the flight of fancy anchored by precision and a justsuppressed comedy \( in spain , amusingly , the falcons are too old or docile for killing , and the priests have none of the dangerous elegance of their french or italian counterparts \) likewise , this fantasia about falcons in every european city might have been thuddingly allegorical or irritatingly whimsical , and is n't it is comically plausible , and concretely evoked the surrealism lies in the systematic elaboration of the image the catholic church is likened to a bird of prey , murderous and bloodred in its second capital , avignon , and we are free to link this , without coercion , to the chilean situation and the ethical somnolence of father urrutia that long sentence is a poem , really , proceeding by foliation in fact the entire novella is a poem of a kind it will not surprise you to learn that roberto bolano wrote poetry before he wrote fiction even in a long novel like the savage detectives , his favorite unit is the discrete , browninglike monologue , not the extended scene he was born in chile in 1953 , but came of age in mexico city , where his family had moved in 1968 returning to chile in 1973 to help with the socialist revolution as he saw it , he was caught in the pinochet coup and briefly arrested he went back to mexico , where he published two books of verse , and then began a long period of displacement and travel and drugtaking and odd jobs in france and spain he died of liver failure , in barcelona , a far violin among near balalaikas \( to adapt nabokov s words on a fellow exiled writer \) he knew time was short the fiction that is currently being translated there are more novellas to come , and a huge novel , 2666 , will appear in english next year was written in a spasm of activity in his last years
praising a docudrama about , may seem ridiculous , like giving a sculpture award to a wax museum but even those who despise the postmortem dissection of celebrities will have to admit that the knife has rarely sliced more cleanly than it does in diana last days of a princess the program , which will be shown on tlc tomorrow night , is as convincing as it is cheesy diana does n't deify the princess it portrays her as needy but manipulative , loving but flawed in other words , as a human being blending documentary techniques and scripted drama , it gives a surprisingly credible picture of the princess s last summer diana begins and ends with diana and her beau at the time , , known as dodi , in a limo in paris on the fateful night of aug 31 , 1997 we see diana \( portrayed by the australian actress genevieve o 'reilly \) nestled against mr fayed \( patrick baladi \) , apparently ruminating over her life as it flashes by in a series of film clips of the real diana in her wedding dress , with her babies , alone in front of the taj mahal it s over the top , and it sucks you in right away the drama flashes back to early summer , when diana and her boys spent time on the yacht of mr fayed s father , the mogul mohammed alfayed the relationship masterminded by the elder mr fayed , who calls it the biggest romance since edward viii is no storybook affair the princess was carrying a torch for the heart surgeon hasnar khan and was probably using mr fayed to make him jealous the british royal family is mentioned only in passing this is the fayeds' show , and diana s really , it was the first summer that she did n't have to be a princess , the docudrama s director , richard dale , said on the today show last week if her last summer is any indication of how diana would have lived the rest of her life , her death deprived the world of decades of vicarious , if vacuous , glamour the scenes between diana and dodi are silly at one point he shows her his childhood teddy bears but by most accounts , these were people who could be silly indeed the role of adult goes to two fayed bodyguards , kez wingfield and trevor reesjones and the real drama is the tension between them and the fayeds , whose decisions and indecisions , and whose obsession with fleeing the press , at least according to this account , led to the crash between the dramatic reenactments , there are real interviews with mohammed alfayed , with mr wingfield , with two london tabloid editors who discuss diana s relationship with the press \( she thought she could pick it up and put it down whenever she wanted to , one says of the princess s attitude toward media coverage \) the editors are insightful , but the most amusing interview is with myriah daniels , identified as dodi s personal therapist the entire day was going just like an energy ball , she says of aug 31 none of us could stop it and later , she proclaims , if you buy tabloids , you have bloodstained hands if you watch diana , you may feel a little guilty as well do n't given the nature of its subject and the temptations of its seedy genre , this show is practically a miracle of restraint richard dale , director and executive producer rebecca hedderly and bill howard , executive producers produced by dangerous films for tlc with genevieve o 'reilly \( \) , patrick baladi \( \) , nadim sawalha \( mohammed alfayed \) , james barriscale \( kez wingfield \) , shaun dooley \( trevor reesjones \) , charlie manton \( prince harry \) , jake taylor shantos \( prince william \)
the telephone calls keep coming , so general manager omar minaya keeps listening but trading away premium talent for a modest starter is not going to happen so minaya has resisted all comers , and will take a chance that the enigmatic jorge sosa and seven other candidates will ultimately produce three capable starters for the last three spots in the rotation none of the three figures to be the elite pitcher the mets anticipated they would land when the offseason began , so at some point minaya may look to aim higher acquiring a top starter someone , for instance , like florida s dontrelle willis would probably cost the mets two , or perhaps three , of their top prospects , a notion they have rebuffed in the past but as minaya said recently , after being outbid for barry zito , if you have those kinds of premium prospects , those kinds of impact pitchers become available in trades when teams ask about the mets' top prospects , five players stand out the righthanded starters mike pelfrey and philip humber , and the outfielders lastings milledge , carlos g mez and fernando mart nez having recently turned 24 , humber is the oldest and is six years older than mart nez , who , at 18 , is the farthest from the major leagues , but might turn out to be the best of the five , only pelfrey figures to make the mets' opening day roster , although as a no 4 or no 5 starter , not as the ace they project him to become someday pelfrey , 23 , the mets' top draft pick in 2005 , did well in his three months in the minor leagues , but struggled at times in his four starts with the mets unlike in college , where he could dominate by simply throwing his fastball , which can reach 98 miles an hour with nasty sinking movement , pelfrey labored in the majors without consistent command of his secondary pitches before the mets shut down his season in the arizona fall league because of minor arm soreness , pelfrey improved his changeup and scratched his curveball for a latebreaking slider his manager in arizona , pat listach , said that pelfrey left arizona feeling comfortable with all his pitches i know that we were all very pleased with the improvements mike made , listach said in a recent telephone interview now that he s found a consistent arm slot for his breaking pitches , his stuff is even more unbelievable like pelfrey , humber is tall and polished , and he could also develop into a future anchor of the rotation in 2005 , he was soaring through the organization until an elbow injury that required reconstructive surgery sidelined him for a year he recovered quickly , however , and pitched well in two appearances with the mets last september his fall season in arizona ended prematurely after he experienced shoulder tendinitis he is likely to begin the season at class aaa new orleans as team officials acknowledge , they promoted milledge a little too soon last may his offfield problems during two stints with the mets generated as much discussion as his superior bat speed but his name still comes up in trade talks at the moment , there is no space in the outfield for him he appears headed for new orleans and , at some point , he may be joined there by g mez signed out of the dominican republic in 2002 at age 16 , g mez , a righthanded hitter , is viewed as having few weaknesses that experience cannot eliminate he has stolen 105 bases over the past two seasons , and once he fills out his lanky 6foot2 , 175pound frame , he is expected to hit about 25 home runs a season g mez has a strong arm , which makes him a candidate to shift to right field from center once he is ready for the majors the mets challenged g mez , then 20 , last season by placing him at class aa binghamton after hitting 406 there in july , he finished the season batting 281 with 7 home runs and 48 runs batted in he will begin the season back in binghamton mart nez is the most precocious player in the system he batted 279 with 10 homers and held his own defensively at three minor league stops at an age when most players are still in high school the mets are enthralled with his compact swing , 30homer potential and projection to hit for a high average , and how he handled being the youngest player in the arizona fall league listach called him the league s most exciting player and compared him to carlos beltr n at 18 years old , i thought he 'd be overmatched , listach said but after the first week , he was passing by people with more experience his bat speed was tremendous he hits to the opposite field as well as anyone and he had the best arm of anyone i saw in the fall league it is natural to fantasize about a future outfield of g mez , mart nez and milledge , one that could take the field when the mets move into their new stadium in 2009 but beltr n has five years left on his contract and does not figure to be going anywhere soon besides , minaya may just as easily trade one , two or all three before then it is up to him
charlotte , nc \( ap \) was back on the court tuesday , making jump shots and talking tough no , he is not making another comeback in an effort to get more involved with his slumping team , jordan , a part owner of the bobcats , jumped into a drill during charlotte s practice he then gave tips to some young players and showed he still had his famous shooting touch this was more or less for the morale of the players , jordan said the last couple of days it has been all about trying to get them to focus on the little things and to play as a team the workout came a day after jordan sat in on team meetings and film sessions as the bobcats try to end a stretch of 10 losses in 12 games under the firstyear coach sam vincent i also told them yesterday that on this team we have no allstars none , jordan said that means everybody has to rely upon each other to be successful until we develop an allstar that can take over a game , i think it s very important for them to understand that they have to play as a unit i think that s the message that a lot of the guys got it was a rare oncourt appearance for the 44yearold jordan , who bought into the bobcats in june 2006 and was given the final say on the team s basketball decisions jordan has rarely been seen in public since he has given few interviews , and when he attends home games , he sits in a suite above the court he has instructed arena staff members not to show him on the video board but jordan chatted with reporters tuesday after working out with the team , which has struggled after a 64 start he said building a 13point , thirdquarter lead last friday against orlando before losing showed him the bobcats were not far from being a winning team i thought the game against orlando , they could have stepped out and made a name for themselves , jordan said they did , but so quickly they reverted back to old habits in the second half that proves to me that they have it you just have to somehow get it out of them , so they focus on all 15 guys , as opposed to one guy here or one guy there being the focus i think the last couple of days we had great conversations jordan , who won six nba titles with the chicago bulls , is still trying to translate that success to the front office he was fired as the president of the washington wizards in 2003 in a stint that was interrupted by jordan s second comeback as a player jordan has gotten bob johnson , the bobcats' owner , to spend money in his new role jordan was behind a draftnight trade that brought in jason richardson from golden state last week , the bobcats traded primoz brezec and walter herrmann to detroit for center nazr mohammed but the added payroll has not led to more wins jordan stressed that he believed the key to success would be point guard raymond felton getting the ball inside more and avoiding critical errors by now we should start to see more consistency in his play , jordan said less turnovers , more leadership so that you do n't have periods where you come down and lose the ball with no shot on three straight plays on that fourth play you have to focus jordan echoed many of the complaints vincent has had about the bobcats sam is totally saying the same thing , jordan said but coming from me , it resonates a little more and a little bit fast
washington there has not been a postseason baseball game in the district of columbia in 74 years and counting the disenfranchised fans have had to put up with mostly rotten baseball or none at all , but in their final week in robert f kennedy stadium , the hardcore fans have at least enjoyed the piquant delights of sadism the nationals , who are moving to a new stadium a few miles away next season , tormented the on monday and tuesday but relaxed their grip last night as the mets ended a fivegame losing streak with an 84 victory and they made only three errors at the moment , the mets do not seem like the whiteknuckle phillies of 1964 , who blew a sixandahalfgame lead with 12 to go , but there is still time the nats have done their part there is one interesting similarity between these mets and those 1964 phillies , who fell out of first in the chilly final week in st louis , with their star right fielder , johnny callison , playing while shivering from a fever \( at one point , callison was allowed to run the bases wearing a warmup jacket , something normally permitted only for a pitcher bill conlin of the philadelphia daily news recalls bill white respectfully buttoning callison s jacket for him \) last night , moises alou of the mets asked to play despite a tight left quadriceps as professional as callison was , alou admitted he might not be playing but for the circumstances of the fivegame losing streak to me , if it s a pulled muscle , you could make it worse , mets manager willie randolph said if it s pain , you can play with that , randolph added , noting that proud veterans like alou might minimize their injuries in order to play would n't you know it , alou had to stress that quad by rapping three hits and chugging around to score twice \? randolph took him out after he had set an example to his teammates , exactly what they had needed knocking off a frontrunner was a more exquisite torture before the bailout device of the wild card came around in 1995 nowadays , the mets or the red sox might still wobble into the postseason , with pride damaged but licensed to sell tickets the mets have looked awful , particularly because jos reyes has been clumsy and indecisive in every phase of the game then again , even with their lead this year , this has not been the same mets team as in 2006 every time the broadcasters mention bullpen names like guillermo mota , jorge sosa , aaron sele and scott schoeneweis , an audible gargle goes up in the farflung diaspora of mets fans , some of whom were present last night  the mets mingled with their friends on the nationals before last night s game , laughing with the rival manager , manny acta , who coached third base for the mets last season other mets chatted with lenny harris , the nats' hitting coach , who has played everywhere and knows everybody there were no overt signs of tension , at least before the game the guys are playing hard , said omar minaya , the mets' general manager , who admitted he looked for signs of nervousness and said he saw none we 're up with two weeks to go that s why you playrandolph said he was not surprised the nationals would give fits to the mets these are capable bigleague players , he said before the game these guys want to win these teams can be dangerous i 'd rather be playing the phillies and atlanta , to be honest with you his theory is thrown off a bit by the fact that the mets have lost eight straight to the phillies for washington players , tormenting the mets is nothing personal for the fans , it would be a transient thrill the city has not held a postseason game since the old nationals won the american league pennant in 1933 and lost to the new york giants in the world series renamed the senators , that team moved to minnesota in 1961 , and the new senators were born they were doomed to 10 losing seasons in 11 years , distinguished mostly by two iconic managers , gil hodges and ted williams , and by soaring homers from frank howard , still noted by three seats painted white in the far reaches of the upper deck  if the new senators ever tormented the yanks or any other frontrunner late in those 11 mostly futile years , it is not high up in civic memory now rfk becomes the sole province of the dc united soccer team , while nats fans make do with memories of annoying the mets randolph said he expected the same challenge from the lastplace marlins during a fourgame trip to florida this weekend but ronnie belliard of the nationals , who helped the cardinals win the world series last year , promised ed coleman of wfan that the nationals would try just as hard to kick around the phillies this weekend the mets would be advised not to count on it
the influence of the periodpractice movement is so strong that romanticized interpretations of baroque and classical repertory now seem indulgent vibratofree romantic repertory as advocated by roger norrington , who conducted the on thursday night at , is a tougher sell the program opened with the rhapsodic violin concerto of karl goldmark , the hungarianborn composer and violinist , performed here by hilary hahn , a superb young violinist the diatonic score , written in 1877 and stylistically indebted to ludwig spohr and felix mendelssohn , barely hints at mr goldmark s enthusiasm for wagner s music the orchestra played with straight tone , in incongruous contrast to ms hahn s generous use of vibrato , which enhanced her rich , sweet sound in light of ms hahn s passionate rendition , the orchestra sounded rather austere , like severe parents desperately trying to rein in a freespirited daughter but ms hahn was having none of it , leading a highspeed , rhapsodic chase as she fearlessly conquered her fiendishly difficult part audiences often leap to their feet with undiscerning abandon after a performance , but ms hahn deserved her standing ovation as an encore , she played the second movement from ysaye s sonata no 2 with burnished luster the orchestra of st luke s is a firstrate ensemble and clearly has an excellent rapport with mr norrington , who was their music director from 1990 to 1994 they expertly followed his vision of brahms s symphony no 4 , which followed after intermission , offering a lean , mean and mostly pristine \( vibratofree \) rendition mr norrington would argue that this was how brahms first heard it brahms certainly did hear the work with an ensemble similar in size to that of st luke s \( a 49member orchestra performed during the premiere of the work in 1885 at meiningen , germany \) , although the piece is now usually associated with mammoth orchestras brahms was fascinated and greatly influenced by classical and baroque composers , and the finale of his symphony includes a complex passacaglia mr norrington s approach emphasized textural clarity and instrumental balance , with the sound between woodwinds and strings more equal than usual but it was still hard not to pine for a touch of that oldschool \( or newschool , mr norrington might say \) grandeur
participants senator joe biden \( dde \) senator hillary clinton \( dny \) senator christopher dodd \( dct \) former senator john edwards \( dnc \) representative dennis kucinich \( doh \) senator barack obama \( dil \) governor bill richardson \( dnm \) moderators wolf blitzer , cnn campbell brown , cnn suzanne malveaux , cnn john roberts , cnn mr blitzer so let s begin our questioning tonight , campbell brown campbell \? ms brown senator clinton , recently in an interview on cnn , you said of the last debate that you were n't at your best that day you stumbled on an important question involving illegal immigration but your opponents are saying that that s really part of a larger pattern with you , that you often avoid taking firm positions on controversial issues and one of your opponents on this stage calls this the politics of parsing how do you respond to that \? sen clinton well , campbell , i am happy to be here tonight and this pantsuit is asbestos tonight \( laughter \) so , i i am aware that some people say that , but i think that the american people know where i 've stood for 35 years i 've been fighting for issues affecting women and children , workers and families i 've been fighting for universal health care and i know that people are looking at this campaign and evaluating us , and i 've put forth very specific policies about what i will do as president , because this has to be a big election this is going to be one of the most important elections we 've ever had in our country s history , and it is important that we have a candidate who is tested and a president who is ready to lead from day one and i'm perfectly comfortable leaving these assessments up to the american people to make their judgments among us mr blitzer let me bring in senator obama , because you 've been among those critical of senator clinton you 've suggested she s triangulating , whatever that means , on some of the key issues she s running a textbook washington campaign , you 've suggested that i want you to explain , if you do n't mind , senator , what do you mean by that \? sen obama well , first of all , i'm really happy to be here in nevada and i appreciate this opportunity senator clinton , i think , is a capable politician , and i think that she has run a terrific campaign but what the american people are looking for right now is straight answers to tough questions and that is not what we 've seen out of senator clinton on a host of issues , on the issue of driver s licenses for illegal immigrants we saw in the last debate that it took not just that debate but two more weeks before we could get a clear answer in terms of where her position was the same is true on social security we have serious disagreements about how we 're going to make sure that social security is there for the people who need it and what i'm absolutely convinced of is that right now , we need a different kind of politics everywhere i go , all throughout nevada , people are struggling with health care people are working harder for less they are having a tougher time saving , tougher time retiring and part of the reason is because they do n't feel that washington is listening to them and what i want to do in this campaign is make certain that we are breaking out of the gridlock and partisanship and the standard practices of washington and actually start listening to the american people to get things done mr blitzer all right senator clinton , do you want to respond \? sen clinton well , i hear what senator obama is saying , and he talks a lot about stepping up and taking responsibility and taking strong positions but when it came time to step up and decide whether or not he would support universal health care coverage , he chose not to do that his plan would leave 15 million americans out that s about the population of nevada , iowa , south carolina and new hampshire i have a universal health care plan that covers everyone i 've been fighting this battle against the special interest for more than 15 years , and i am proud to fight this battle you know , we can have a different politic , but let s not forget here that the people who we 're against are not going to be giving up without a fight the republicans are not going to vacate the white house voluntarily we have some big issues ahead of us , and we need someone who is tested and ready to lead i think that s what my candidacy offers \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer all right senator obama sen obama well , let s talk about health care right now because the fact of the matter is that i do provide universal health care the only difference between senator clinton s health care plan and mine is that she thinks the problem for people without health care is that nobody has mandated forced them to get health care that s not what i'm seeing around nevada what i see are people who would love to have health care they they desperately want it but the problem is they ca n't afford it , which is why we have put forward legislation \( cheers , applause \) we 've put forward a plan that makes sure that it is affordable to get health care that is as good as the health care that i have as a member of congress \( applause \) mr blitzer all right sen obama that s what the american people are looking for that s what they deserve and that s why i intend to provide as president of the united states sen clinton wolf , i wolf , i cannot let that go unanswered you know , the most important thing here is to level with the american people senator obama s health care plan does not cover everyone he starts with children , which is admirable i helped to create the children s health insurance program back in 1997 i'm totally committed \( applause \) sen obama that s not true , wolf sen clinton to making sure every single child is covered he does not mandate the kind of coverage that i do and i provide a health care tax credit under my american health choices plan so that every american will be able to afford the health care i open up the congressional plan but there is a big difference between senator obama and me he starts from the premise of not reaching universal health care sen obama wolf \( cross talk \) mr blitzer hold on one at a one at a time mr \( inaudible \) in control \( applause \) sen obama no , i understand , but look , i'm not going to mr blitzer senator obama , we 're going to have a lot more on health care mr there s no \( inaudible \) sen obama i will be very brief on this issue hillary states audience member \( off mike \) sen obama states that she wants she states that she wants to mandate health care coverage , but she s not garnishing people s wages to make sure that they have it mr blitzer all right sen obama she s not audience member \( off mike \) mr blitzer okay , please sen obama she is she is audience member \( off mike \) mr blitzer go ahead , senator sen obama she is not she is not enforcing this mandate and i do n't think that the problem with the american people is that they are not being forced to get health care mr blitzer all right sen obama the problem is , they ca n't afford it and that is why my plan provides the mechanism to make sure that they can \( applause \) mr blitzer all right , we 're going to get back on health care shortly because we have a lot more to talk about \( cross talk \) i want senator edwards to weigh in , because you 've spoken about the politics of parsing in your criticism of senator clinton i want you to explain what that means mr edwards well , can i say first , nobody on this stage is perfect , and that certainly includes me \( cross talk \) and i do n't claim perfection , far from it what i would say is that the issue is whether we can have a president that can restore trust for the american people in the president of the united states \( applause \) because i think this president has destroyed that trust , and i think there are fair questions to be asked of all of us , including senator clinton senator clinton says she will end the war she also says she will continue to keep combat troops in iraq and continue combat missions in iraq she says she will turn up the heat on george bush and the republicans but when the crucial vote came on stopping bush , cheney and the neocons on iran , she voted with bush and cheney \( applause \) on the issue of social security , she said , standing beside me on the stage , that she would not do anything about the cap on social security taxes and she has said privately to people , because it s been reported in the press , that , in fact , she would consider raising that cap and the most important issue is , she says she will bring change to washington while she continues to defend a system that does not work , that is broken , that is rigged and is corrupt , corrupted against the interest of most americans and corrupted \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer all right mr edwards let me and corrupted for a very small , very powerful , very wellfinanced mr blitzer we 're going to mr edwards so we have fundamental differences mr blitzer we 're going to get all of these issues , including energy and iran and everything else sen clinton well , wolf , i 've just been personally attacked again mr blitzer senator clinton , i 'll let you respond because there was a direct charge made against you sen clinton and i thank you yes mr blitzer then we 're going to bring in everybody everyone s going to get time tonight do n't worry we got a lot of time go ahead sen clinton well , you know , i respect all of my colleagues on this stage \( laughter \) and , you know , we 're democrats and we 're trying to nominate the very best person we can to win and i do n't mind taking hits on my record , on issues , but when somebody starts throwing mud , at least we can hope that it s both accurate and not right out of the republican playbook because what i \( cheers , applause \) what i believe is important is that we put forth what we stand for i have been active for 35 years the american people know where i stand you know , senator edwards raised health care again when senator edwards ran in 2004 , he was n't for universal health care i'm glad he is now but for him to be throwing this mud and making these charges , i think , really detracts from what we 're trying to do here tonight we need to put forth a positive agenda for america \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer all right sen clinton telling people what we 're going to do when we get the chance to go back to the white house mr blitzer senator edwards , we 're going to give you a chance in a second \( continued cheers , applause \) we 're going to give senator edwards a chance to respond i want senator senator biden to weigh in senator biden \? sen biden oh , no , no , no , no , no \( laughter \) mr blitzer i want you to weigh in sen biden do n't do it no do n't make me speak mr blitzer i want you to go ahead what do you think senator biden , here s the question what do you think about this exchange among democrats \? is that good for the democrats or is it bad \? sen biden hey , look , let s get to it , folks the american people do n't give a darn about any of this stuff that s going on up here look , they 're sitting now , seriously , think about it they 're sitting down at their table tonight , they 've put their kids to bed , and they 're worrying about whether or not their child s going to run into a drug dealer on the way to school they 're worrying about whether or not they 're going to be able to pay for their mortgage , because even if they did n't have one of those subprime mortgages , things are looking bad for them they 're worrying about whether they 're going to keep their job and they 're worrying about their son in the national guard s going to get killed in iraq \( applause \) ladies and gentlemen , look , every every political campaign gets to this place and i'm not criticizing any of the three people who are the ones who always get to talk all the time at these events \( laughter \) i'm not i'm not i'm not criticizing but look , folks , let s get straight to it here this is not about experience , it s not about change , it s about action who among us is going to be able to on day one step in , \( end \? \) the war who among us understands what to do about pakistan \? who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble \? who among us knows what they 're doing \? i have 35 years of experience while everyone s talking about their experience and hillary has a great experience , and john and the rest of them i was passing the violence against women act i was passing the crime bill mr blitzer \( \? \) all right mr biden i was passing you 're right \( extended cheers and applause \) mr blitzer let me just point out , everyone s going to have plenty of time tonight i want john roberts to go ahead and ask the next question , and then we 'll bring everybody in , i promise mr roberts senator clinton , you were saying just a moment ago \( laughter \) \( boos \) that you the question s not going to her , by the way reiterating what she said you said you 're not you think it s legitimate for you to take hits on your record well , some of those hits on your record have come from the far righthand side of the stage , from senator edwards , who has frequently attacked you for flipflopping but senator , you have changed your position on several issues you were for the yucca mountain nuclear repository before you were against it you were for the iraq war before you were against it people change their positions if it s fair for you to change your position , is it not fair for her to change hers \? \( applause \) sen edwards it s absolutely fair but \( applause \) it s absolutely fair for people to learn from their experience and grow and mature and change anybody who s not willing to change based on what they learn is ignorant , and everybody ought to be willing to do that that s not what i'm saying i'm saying there s a difference between that and saying exact saying two contrary things at exactly the same time i mean , for example , just over the course of the last week , senator clinton said in washington that she would vote for the peru trade deal \( boos \) and she said in iowa , talking to union members , that she wanted a moratorium on trade deals the important thing about this , though , is none of us none of us because the reality is and i want to add onto something that joe biden said you know , before i came over here tonight , i was thinking , we 're going to have this debate when we finish , all of you are going to be on television saying , oh , who scored points , who won the debate all of us are going to be fine the question is , will america be fine \? because what i saw \( cheers , applause \) before we came over here on your troll underneath the screen , 35 million americans last year went hungry thirtyseven million people in this country live in poverty every day fortyseven million americans have no health care coverage and there is a fundamental choice that everyone in this room and democratic voters have to make , and that is , who do you believe will take on this system and change it so that it is no longer rigged , corrupt and mr blitzer all right mr edwards rigged against the interests mr blitzer all right mr edwards of the american people that is the fundamental choice and i think people are entitled to know that they have choices there s nothing personal about this this is about what america needs to be this is about those 35 million people mr blitzer all right mr edwards who are hungry every single year when is our party mr blitzer all right mr edwards going to show a little backbone and strength mr blitzer all right mr edwards and courage and speak up mr blitzer all right mr edwards for those people who have been left behind \? \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer all right hold on one second i want senator dodd to weigh in , senator dodd , because you said made a statement earlier in the week and i'm quoting you now you 're surprised at just how angry senator edwards has become and you 've suggested he s not the same person i once knew \( laughter \) go ahead and elaborate tell us what you mean sen dodd well , let me pick up on this point here i think , first of all , we democrats have a job to do , and that is to unite this party , attract independents , republicans who are seeking change to join us 12 months from now and elect a democrat to the white house and to hold on to the house and senate that s number one \( cheers , applause \) and it s going to take more than just getting people in our own party to support us we 're going to have to reach out there s a shrillness to the debate the american people want results they want the job done , exactly what joe biden talked about here when people get up in the morning and go to work , they sit around and they worry about their jobs , their retirement , their health care , their kids' education , and they wonder if anybody in washington is paying any attention to them and whether or not the job is being done on their behalf and frankly , when a campaign is about turning up the heat or who s angrier or who s yelling louder , the american people turn off , in terms of listening they want us to come together they want a president that can lead the country we want a democratic candidate who can unite our party , and i think if we waste time on the shrillness of this debate , then we lose the american people so it s important to focus on those thank you \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer all right governor richardson , go ahead gov richardson by the way , i'm bill richardson i'm the governor of new mexico \( laughter , cheers , applause \) nice to meet you all you know , it seems that john wants to start a class war it seems that barack wants to start a generational war it seems that senator clinton with all due respect on her plan on iraq does n't end the war \( audio break from source \) \( laughter , cheers \) and i say that i say that because these are the fundamental issues do our plans end the war \? do our plans make america energy independent \? do our plans give health care to every american \? are we creating jobs and economic growth \? are we resolving the real problems affecting this country \? you know , let s stop this mud slinging let s stop this going after each other on character , on trust let us debate the issues that affect the american people \( cheers , applause \) and let us be positive let s be positive mr blitzer i just want to go down the line and ask everyone , and then we 're going to move on to the next question just to be precise because there was a little confusion , thanks to senator edwards earlier in the week , i just want to make sure i fully understand all of you democrats are you ready to commit absolutely , positively that you will support the democratic nominee , no matter who that nominee is , no ifs , ands or buts \? senator edwards mr edwards is that a planted question \? mr blitzer yes , i planted it \( laughter \) mr edwards yes , i absolutely will support the democratic nominee for president sen dodd absolutely yes \( applause \) sen clinton absolutely yes rep kucinich only if they oppose war as an instrument of policy \( applause \) gov richardson yes , i will support the nominee sen biden hell , no , i would n't support any of these guys \( laughter \) no , i'm joking , joking of course , for them all mr blitzer campbell , go ahead ms brown all right , let s talk about the issues senator obama , i want to ask you about immigration it s an important issue in this state in particular there are between 100 , 000 to 200 , 000 illegal immigrants here in nevada and you 've supported various benefits for illegal immigrants , including driver s licenses and instate college tuition what do you say to those americans who say they are losing out because you would give benefits to people who broke the laws of this country , who came here illegally \? and then more generally as president , where do you draw the line when it comes to benefits for illegal immigrants \? sen obama i would say that they 're justified in feeling frustrated because this administration the bush administration has done nothing to control the problem that we have we 've had 5 million undocumented workers come over the borders since george bush took office it has become an extraordinary problem , and the reason the american people are concerned is because they are seeing their own economic position slip away and oftentimes employers are exploiting these undocumented workers they 're not paying them minimum wage they 're not observing worker safety laws \( applause \) and so what we have to do is create a comprehensive solution to the problem now , i have already stated that , as president , i will make sure that we finally have the kind of border security that we need that s step number one \( applause \) step number two is to take on employers right now , they an employer has more of a chance of getting hit by lightning than be prosecuted for hiring an undocumented worker that has to change they have to be held accountable \( applause \) and when we do those things when we do those things , i believe that we can take the undocumented workers , the illegal aliens who are here , get them out of the shadows , make sure that they are subject to a stiff penalty , make sure that they 're learning english , make sure that they go to the back of the line so they 're not getting an advantage over people who came here legally and when we do that , i think that we can , instead of shedding all this heat , start shedding some light on the problem , and we can once again be a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants that s what i intend to do as president of the united states \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer all right i want to just press you on this point because it s a logical followup , and then i want to go and ask everyone on the issue that apparently tripped up senator clinton earlier , the issue of driver s licenses for illegal immigrants , i take it , senator obama , you support giving driver s licenses to illegal immigrants is that right \? sen obama when i was a state senator in illinois , i voted to require that illegal aliens get trained , get a license , get insurance to protect public safety \( scattered applause \) that was my intention and but i have to make sure that people understand the problem we have here is not drivers licenses undocumented workers do n't come here to drive \( laughter \) they do n't go they 're not coming here to go to the innout burger that s not the reason they 're here they 're here to work and so instead of being distracted by what has now become a wedge issue , let s focus on actually solving the problem that mr blitzer all right sen obama this administration , the bush administration , has done nothing about mr blitzer well , let s go through everybody because i want to be precise i want to make sure the viewers and those of us who are here fully understand all of your positions on this barring , avoiding , assuming there is n't going to be comprehensive immigration reform , do you support or oppose drivers licenses for illegal immigrants \? sen obama i am not proposing that that s what we do what i'm saying is that we ca n't \( interrupted by laughter \) no , no , no , no , look , i have already said i support the notion that we have to deal with public safety and that drivers licenses at the state level can make that happen but what i also mr blitzer all right sen obama but what i also know , wolf , is that if we keep on getting distracted by this problem , then we are not solving it mr blitzer but because this is the kind of question that is sort of available for a yes or no answer \( laughter , cheers , applause \) either you support it or you oppose it let s go down and get a yes or no from everyone starting with senator edwards sen edwards tell me again what your question is \( laughter \) mr blitzer do you support drivers licenses for illegal immigrants \? sen edwards if we do n't have mr blitzer assuming we do n't in the absence of comprehensive immigration reform does n't look like it s going to happen any time soon do you support drivers licenses for illegal immigrants \? sen edwards no , but i do n't accept the proposition that we 're not going to have comprehensive immigration reform what i do support \( scattered applause \) and what i will do as president of the united states is move this country toward comprehensive immigration reform mr blitzer all right sen edwards and anyone who s on the path to earning american citizenship should be able to have a drivers license \( scattered cheers , applause \) mr blitzer senator dodd sen dodd well , it s important to put it in context obviously , look , clarity is important here the american people in a debate like this want clarity here , and certainly the whole idea of getting immigration reform , something i strongly support but i believe part of our job is to discourage those who want to come here i understand why they want to come , but coming illegally creates serious problems , 4 \( 00 , 000 \) to 500 , 000 mr blitzer so is that a yes or a no \? sen dodd no , my belief is that giving a driver s as i 've said from the very beginning here , i think driver s licenses are the wrong thing to be doing in terms of attracting people to come here as undocumented mr blitzer all right thank you senator obama , yes or no \? sen obama yes \( cross talk \) mr blitzer okay \( applause \) sen obama i am going to be fighting for comprehensive immigration reform , and we should n't pose the question that somehow we ca n't achieve that i believe that the american people desperately want it that s what i'm going to be fighting for as president mr blitzer senator clinton \? sen clinton no mr blitzer congressman kucinich \? rep kucinich i take issue with your description of people being illegal immigrants there are n't any illegal human beings that s number one number two , they 're undocumented and i believe that the best way to do it \( applause \) thank you i believe the best way to deal with this is cancel nafta and renegotiate the trade agreement with mexico \( cheers , applause \) also mr blitzer well , let me rephrase the question , congressman rep kucinich so the driver s mr blitzer if undocumented people in this country rep kucinich give people wolf mr blitzer should be able to get driver s licenses rep kucinich you give people a path to legalization , and then they can be legal and have their driver s license that s the way to work it that s the way to work it mr blitzer \( inaudible \) comprehensive immigration reform rep kucinich you know what \? you give people a path to legalization , and you work to make sure that you do n't criminalize their status any further and again , i take exception to the way you frame that question \( applause \) mr blitzer governor \? gov richardson well , my answer is yes , and i did it you know why \? because the congress i notice barack mentioned the president , but the congress also failed miserably to pass comprehensive immigration and we need to have it in this country i did it four years ago my legislature sent me a bill i signed it my law enforcement people said it s a matter of public safety what we need is public safety , a reduction in traffic fatalities we wanted more people to be insured when we started with this program , 33 percent of all new mexicans had were uninsured today it s 11 percent traffic fatalities have gone down it s a matter of public safety mr blitzer all right gov richardson the states have to act when the federal government and the congress does n't act the answer is comprehensive immigration \( cheers , applause \) the answer is mr blitzer your answer is yes gov richardson secure the borders , a stronger relationship with mexico those that knowingly hire illegal workers should be punished , and a path to legalization that is the solution mr blitzer senator biden sen biden no \( laughter , applause \) mr blitzer john roberts mr roberts senator dodd , a lot of people in this room no doubt are very concerned about the quality of education that their children will have , and how it will prepare them for postsecondary education and the working world after that in workplaces across america , it s pretty common practice to reward highperforming employees with pay raises , and to terminate bad employees however in our education system across the country , by and large in our nation s public schools , teachers unions make it difficult to do that the question is , what is wrong with rewarding a teacher who excels at the job that they 're doing by paying them more than an average teacher would make \? \( applause \) sen dodd well , i think if you define excelling by teachers who will go into poor rural or poor urban areas and make a difference , mentor children after school , put in extra time to make a difference , then i think that sort of merit pay has value if you 're judging excelling by determining whether or not that teacher has students who do better because they 're in better neighborhoods or better schools , i'm totally opposed to that that s not the way to be judging these matters \( cheers , applause \) this is a this is critical i always say this is the single most important issue i 've been asked the question , over 26 years in the senate , 1 , 000 times it s a very difficult question to answer what s the most important issue \? this is the most important issue every other issue we grapple with depends upon our ability to have the best educated generation we 've ever produced \( applause \) and we need to have , in my view , far more cooperation at the national level we spend less than 5 percent of the national budget on elementary and secondary education that is deplorable in my view it s basically \( applause \) we need to fundamentally reform no child left behind no child left behind is a disaster for most schools and most people \( cheers , applause \) i 've spent i 've spent 26 years in the senate i started the children s caucus 26 years ago with arlen specter i wrote the legislation dealing with afterschool programs , infant screening , autism issues as well spent a good deal of my time i head start senator of the decade by the head start association i 've dedicated a good part of my public career to children and to education , onequarter of the population but truly 100 percent of our future this is an issue that deserves far more attention we ought to have one single debate on education \( cheers , applause \) it comes up about once every two hours of the discussion \( applause \) mr blitzer we 're talking about education right now , and i want to bring congressman kucinich in because i know you 're a strong supporter of the unions the teachers' union , very powerful teachers' unions , very powerful are there any issues with unions teachers' unions , or other unions for that matter with which you disagree \? rep kucinich my father was a truck driver he was a member of the teamsters i happen to be a member of the iatse i think that the trade that the union movement is essential to upholding human rights and i think that if we had trade agreements that had workers' rights in them , that would lift up conditions for workers in this country and in all countries so i'm the candidate of workers in this this campaign because i 've stood for jobs for all , fullemployment economy health care for all education for all and the fact of the matter is that a kucinich administration will mean a worker s white house right now wealth is being accelerated upwards , and i'm the one candidate in the race who comes right from the working class and can address those needs directly because i remember where i came from \( applause \) mr blitzer all right i take it the answer is there s nothing there s no issue no major issues you disagree with america s unions rep kucinich well , you know , the teamsters wanted to drill in alaska i voted against drilling in alaska so it s not like i'm a slam dunk on every issue \( scattered applause \) mr blitzer all right okay governor \? rep kucinich but i'm for working people that s why i'm up here gov richardson i think the key i want to be the education president the key to a good education is a strong teacher one of the problems we have in this country is we disrespect teachers we underpay them \( cheers , applause \) i would have a minimum wage for all teachers starting out at 40 , 000 per year and chris , i think we need to be bolder with no child left behind i would junk it this is a disaster \( cheers , applause \) it s got to go i would have preschool for every child i 'd have full day kindergarten america is 29th in science to the european union , to japan we need to have science and math academies , hire a hundred thousand science and math teachers , have art in the schools we need also \( interrupted by applause \) we need also to have a college education policy that deals with these huge loans that are killing our college students \( cheers , applause \) and what i would do look , what i would do and you know , we 're at a great college here what i would do is , in exchange for two years of tuition , government pays tuition , one year of national service for this country \( applause \) those are the kind of creative solutions we want in this country mr blitzer let me thank you , governor thank you very much i want senator clinton to weigh in on the issue of merit pay , if there s a teacher out there who s doing a great job , should that teacher get merit get a bonus for doing a great job , that individual teacher who works really hard , does a great job educating young people \? sen clinton well , i support schoolbased merit pay for a lot of the reasons chris was talking about we need to get more teachers to go into hardtoserve areas we 've got to get them into underserved urban areas , underserved rural areas but the school is a team , and i think it s important that we reward that collaboration you know , a child who moves from kindergarten to sixth grade , say , in the same school , every one of those teachers is going to affect that child mr blitzer well , what if there s an excellent teacher in that team and a crummy teacher in that team , a teacher who s simply riding along and not really working very hard , not really educating those young kids \? do you give just everybody the merit pay , or do you give the individual teacher \? sen clinton wolf , you need to weed out the teachers who are not doing a good job i mean , that s the bottom line \( applause \) they should not be teaching our children i mean , what i believe so strongly is that our education system has served this country very well but we 're in the 21st century we do need to reimagine it we 've got to get everybody to talk about it but what i object to with the bush administration is it s always talking down we need to have a collegial collaboration and the teachers need to be at the table mr blitzer all right sen clinton helping us figure out what the best way is to achieve our goals mr blitzer i want to move on to the next question , but i want senator biden to weigh in because i know your wife is a teacher so go ahead should an excellent teacher be given merit pay \? sen biden an excellent teacher should be judged by whether or not that teacher , outside of the classroom , improves themselves and their teaching skills my wife got two master s degrees and a doctorate degree that s merit pay she went out there and she earned the ability to be able to demonstrate to everyone that she was an exceptional teacher , because she went out and she gathered this additional knowledge instead of being not just being a good teacher here s the problem with simple merit pay , based on the principle who makes the decision , based on merit pay \? \( applause \) who s the person who \( inaudible \) \? i believe there should be teaching excellence i think we should demand more of our teachers in continuing education i think there should and unions do n't like that i think we should demand more of the teachers in terms of their participation after school and in school but i think you 've got to pay them and the last point i 'll make is bill is correct you have to look , the idea you start teachers at 28 , 000 in most states when , in the countries we 're competing with , they start off and they graduate their the graduating seniors are getting the same pay that engineers are getting in those same schools my father has an expression , god love him , before he passed away he 'd say , do n't tell me what you value show me your budget , and i will tell you what you value i 've laid out a 30 billion plan \( applause \) over five years mr blitzer thank you sen biden \( to pay \? \) 16 years of education is what our kids need they need to start two years earlier and be guaranteed two years after school mr blitzer thank you , senator campbell brown ms brown senator biden , a question on pakistan as you know , in the past few weeks pakistani leader pervez musharraf has declared a state of emergency there he s dismissed several supreme court justices he has recently placed opposition leader benazir bhutto under house arrest twice now and imprisoned numerous other dissenters and i know you spoke with musharraf last week and you , along with several others on this stage , assert that the us should maintain its current level of financial support for pakistan and my question is , is it your view that there are times when the security of the united states is more important than the way a key ally like musharraf disregards freedom and disregards democracy \? sen biden first of all , i do not think we should maintain the same aid we 're giving i have made it clear to musharraf personally , when he called me , and i 've spoken personally to bhutto before , i might add , the president spoke to either one of them i spoke to them and i indicated very clearly two things one , if he did not take off his uniform , if he did not hold fair and free elections by the middle of january , i would , on the floor of the senate , move to take away the aid we 're giving with regard to f 16s and p3s , because that s the biggest leverage you have on him within his military he is not a sole player he has to keep his military happy as well i would use that leverage secondly , i 've indicated that what we should do is move from a musharraf policy to a pakistan policy unlike anyone else , within five days of this happening i laid out a detailed plan the president has n't no one on this stage has no one else has a detailed plan as president how i would proceed with iraq and you have to move from military aid to giving to the middle class there the middle class is overwhelmingly the majority they get no connection with the united states we have to significantly increase our economic aid relative to education , relative to ngos , relative to all those things that make a difference in the lives of ordinary people over there , and not be doing it through the military side mr blitzer all right , thank you sen biden i know there s more to say , campbell i appreciate you asking me the question and i'm sorry i answered it i know you 're not supposed to answer questions , based on what i 've heard \( laughter \) mr blitzer well , let me bring in governor richardson governor richardson , you 've suggested cutting off military aid to pakistan , so long as the pakistani leader does n't take these steps to restore the constitution , take off his military uniform , end the national state of emergency and have free and fair elections but some are worried , including the opposition leader , benazir bhutto i spoke with her earlier this week that cutting off military aid to the pakistan military could undermine us national security this is a country that has nuclear weapons it has a strong taliban presence , an al qaeda presence are you worried at all that as bad as president musharraf might be , it could get a whole lot worse over there \? gov richardson well , of course , i'm worried but what happened with our pakistan policy , we got our principles wrong we forgot our principles , our principles that we said to musharraf , you know , musharraf , security is more important than human rights if i'm president , it s the other way around \( applause \) democracy and human rights what i would do is , yes , i would condition the assistance to musharraf we give him 10 billion 60 percent of that is to his military i would say , president musharraf , unless you restore the constitution , unless you have elections in january , unless you end the state of emergency , unless you allow benazir bhutto to run as a candidate , unless you put the supreme court back and something else we 've forgotten he is supposed to go after terrorists on his border , and he has done a very weak job of doing that \( scattered applause \) and you know , i would condition the assistance mr blitzer all right gov richardson but here is another point no , but here s another point pakistani in pakistan in the politics of pakistan , islamic parties get maybe 15 percent of the vote i mean , so this threat that , oh , revolutionary elements are going to overtake him if he has a fair election , and you take his party and benazir bhutto s party and you get the military mr blitzer but gov richardson i believe that moderate forces can win so if we 're on the side of democracy and human rights and we 're on the side of musharraf having elections , then us interests are preserved and the pakistani people have a democracy \( applause \) mr blitzer let me just be precise because i want to make sure we all i heard you correctly what you 're saying , governor , is that human rights , at times , are more important than american national security \? gov richardson yes , because i believe we \( applause \) we need to find ways to say to the world that , you know , it s not just about what halliburton wants in iraq , it s also about our \( cheers , applause \) values of freedom , equality our strength is not just military and economic our strength as a nation is our values equality , freedom , democracy mr blitzer all right all right gov richardson human rights \( applause \) mr blitzer senator edwards , i want you to weigh in gov richardson that s why we are strong mr blitzer go ahead , senator mr edwards well , i think first of all , we have some basic goals that we need to be focused on with respect to pakistan one is to make sure that the extremists in northwest pakistan are under control second , that we provide support for the democratic reformers third is that senator biden just spoke about , to make sure these elections take place in january and fourth , we need to make certain that the nuclear weapons are under control now , this leads to a bigger question i think pakistan is the living , breathing example that america s ad hoc policy of dealing with the spread of nuclear weapons , while it s absolutely required in today s world given what s happening with iran , given what we see today in pakistan and the incredible fragility of the administration in pakistan and the presence of extraordinary extremist elements within pakistan , that this is the living , breathing example mr blitzer all right mr edwards of a policy that will not work over the long term i'm about to finish what we have to do , what america needs to do and what i will do as president of the united states is to lead a longterm international effort to rid the world of nuclear weapons it is the only way we 're going to keep the world secure and keep america secure \( applause \) mr blitzer all right everybody s going to have a chance senator obama , is human rights more important than american national security \? sen obama the concepts are not contradictory , wolf mr blitzer because occasionally they could clash sen obama they they they they they are complementary , and i think pakistan is a great example look , we paid 10 billion over the last seven years , and we two goals , deal with terrorism and restore democracy , and we 've gotten neither and joe and bill are exactly right on this pakistan s democracy would strengthen our battle against extremists the more we see repression , the more there are no outlets for how people can express themselves and their aspirations , the worse off we 're going to be and the more antiamerican sentiment there s going to be in the middle east we keep on making this mistake as president , i will do everything that is required to make sure that nuclear weapons do n't fall into the hands of extremists , especially going after al qaeda in the hills between afghanistan and pakistan but we 've got to understand that if we simply prop up anti democratic practices , that that feeds the sense that america is only concerned about us and that our fates are not tied to these other folks and that s that s going to make us less safe that s something i intend to change as president \( applause \) mr wolf mr blitzer hold on hold on one second hold on senator dodd mr i do not agree with \( it \? \) mr blitzer senator dodd , i want you to weigh in what s more important when they clash , human rights versus national security \? sen dodd well , first of all , i hope maybe other people find it as ironic as i do to have president bush urging the turks not to invade the kurdish areas of iraq and lecturing musharraf about restoring the constitution this is an administration that has stepped all over our own constitution in the process \( applause \) and this is n't elections are there s an expression in spanish that says elections mr blitzer so what s more important , human rights or national security \? sen dodd well , obviously national security , keeping the country safe when you take the oath of office on january 20th sen biden \( \? \) that s right sen dodd you promise to do two things , and that is to protect and defend the constitution of the united states and protect our country against enemies both foreign and domestic the security of the country is number one , obviously , yes , all right \? mr blitzer all right okay , thank you sen dodd now secondly , this does n't mean elections are only one note , as they say , in the tune of democracy here be careful what you wish for if they were totally free elections in many of these countries we 're talking about today , the islamic jihad or the islamic brotherhood would win 85 percent of the vote that s not a great outcome for us at this point here mr blitzer all right sen dodd so we need to have a sense of balance about this here i disagree with those who suggest here that we ought to condition musharraf s actions regarding some of these issues on aid and assistance here there s only one way in afghanistan it s through pakistan the generals in the military control the nuclear weaponry here we need to move and remind musharraf that there are obligations he needs to fulfill be careful here about mr blitzer \( inaudible \) you answered you answered the question , senator sen dodd let me finish musharraf , because literally , then you have to do what you say you 're going to do and if he does n't do what he s suggesting , then you have to terminate that relationship , and that puts this country in a very , very dangerous position mr blitzer you say national security is more important than human rights senator clinton , what do you say \? sen clinton i agree with that completely i mean the first obligation of the president of the united states is to protect and defend the united states of america that does n't mean that it is to the exclusion of other interests and there s absolutely a connection between a democratic regime and heightened security for the united states that s what s so tragic about this situation after 9 11 , president bush had a chance to chart a different course , both in pakistan and in afghanistan , and could have been very clear about what our expectations were we are now in a bind , and it is partly not completely , but partly a result of the failed policies of the bush administration so , where we are today means that we have to say to president musharraf look , this is not in your interest either this is not in the interest of the united states it is not in your interest to either stay in power or stay alive we have to figure out how we 're going to navigate this when i was meet ing with him earlier this year , i asked him if he would accept a highlevel presidential envoy to begin to negotiate some of these issues he said , yes , i got back i called the white house i asked them to send such a highlevel envoy they did not do it they 're going to send one now so i mean , you 've got to stay on top of this and you have to manage it all the time that requires presidential attention we have n't had that , and part of the reason is obvious now \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer thank you , senator john roberts rep kucinich hello \? hello \? mr blitzer stand by stand by john roberts , go ahead you 're going to have a chance mr roberts all right , to governor richardson , a military police unit from the nevada national guard , stationed about 12 miles from here , just left for its third tour of duty in iraq i want to talk to you for just a moment here about the effect of the troop increase over there it s true that 2007 is the deadliest year so far , since 2003 , for american forces but it s also true that us troop deaths have been declining steadily since the spring and in fact , in the month of october , they were at their lowest level in nearly two years at the same time , there has been a marked decline in the number of deaths of iraqi people is general david petraeus correct when he says that the troop increase is bringing security to iraq \? gov richardson john , we should n't be talking about body counts one american death is too much and \( interrupted by cheers , applause \) what i am saying here is the surge is not working there is less right now less possibility of a political solution three out of the 18 benchmarks the general accounting office have been fulfilled even among republican math is a failing grade \( laughter \) what i'm saying , also , is that look at this statistic 65 percent of the iraqi people now say it s okay to shoot an american soldier our troops are dying over 3 , 800 , two today , 60 , 000 wounded , casualties , mainly mental trauma now , my position is that we get the troops out in a year leave no residual forces behind unlike some of my colleagues here that want to leave some until 2013 , but not just wave goodbye because we have a responsibility , and that is , one , to get a political compromise , a usled political compromise among the three groups that they share power the sunni , the shi'a , the kurds that they share oil revenues that we have an allmuslim , allarab peacekeeping force with some european forces headed by the un a donor conference that involves other countries european union , rich arab states contributing to the reconstruction of iraq , where we have spent mr blitzer all right gov richardson 500 billion mr blitzer thank you , senator \( sic governor \) gov richardson in this war when this money should be used in america for health care , education and for kids \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer congressman kucinich , is the troop increase right now rep kucinich excuse me \? mr blitzer is the troop increase , as general petraeus has put forward over these past few months , is it working \? rep kucinich no , the occupation is fueling the insurgency in 2003 , i put forth a plan to get out of iraq i'm actually the only one on this stage who voted against the war , voted against funding the war a hundred percent of the time \( cheers , applause \) and also who has a plan to bring the troops home , and they should be brought home now \( applause \) and let me tell you something the democrats in congress have not done the right thing for the american people they should tell president bush we 're not going to give you another time we 're not putting a bill on the floor bring them home now \( cheers , applause \) also , when you talked about pakistan you did n't get a chance to me on that question , but i want to point something out to you , wolf you cannot look at pakistan and the destabilization that s occurring in many muslim nations without understanding the role that our aggression against iraq has played in contributing to that destabilization \( applause \) so i'm speaking about a new policy of strength through peace , no more unilateralism , no more preemption , no more first strike to open dialogue , diplomacy , adherence to international law \( applause \) mr blitzer thank you , congressman senator obama , i 'll put the same question to you is general petraeus' strategy working \? sen obama there is no doubt that because we put american troops in iraq more american troops in iraq , that they are doing a magnificent job , and they are making a difference in certain neighborhoods but the overall strategy is failed , because we have not seen any change in behavior among iraq s political leaders and that is the essence of what we should be trying to do in iraq that s why i'm going to bring this war to a close that s why we can get our combat troops out within 16 months that s why we have to initiate the kind of regional diplomacy not just talking to our friends but talking to our enemies , like iran and syria , to try to stabilize the situation there \( applause \) but i just want to make this important point because all of us , as we 're campaigning , we 're seeing this in human terms people are on two , three , four tours of duty families are carrying an enormous burden this year , we saw the highest casualty rates for american troops in iraq since this war started the same , by the way , is true in afghanistan if we have seen a lowering violence rate , that s only compared to earlier this year we 're back to where we started back in 2006 mr blitzer all right sen obama and so the notion that somehow because we 've gone from horrific violence to just intolerable levels of violence , and that somehow that justifies george bush s strategy , is absolutely wrong and i'm going to bring it to a halt when i'm president of the united states \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer thank you thank you , senator campbell brown ms brown congressman kucinich , we 're approaching the holiday season right now and parents across the country are in a panic they are riffling through their toy boxes , they are throwing things away , because they are so worried that toys , the products coming from china right now are too dangerous for their children do you believe that the people on the stage who voted to fully open trade relations with china bear some of the responsibility for what s going on right now \? rep kucinich well , of course they do i mean , in the same way that people who voted for the war bear responsibility for what s going on , people who voted for the patriot act bear responsibility for what s going on \( cheers , applause \) people who voted for yucca mountain bear responsibility people have to take responsibility for their positions now , let s talk about china trade the fact of the matter is , wolf , it was well known when china trade came up that china does n't have environmental quality standards , does n't have health standards , does n't have workers' rights , does n't permit people to form unions everyone knew that and for someone to come up afterwards and i think in the last debate i think hillary clinton was criticized by john edwards for some traderelated issue but the fact of the matter is , john , you voted for china trade understanding that workers were going to be hurt now , you 're a trial lawyer you knew better i'm saying that it s important \( boos \) mr blitzer all right rep kucinich really mr blitzer senator edwards , he made a he made a specific reference to you rep kucinich this is a fact , though i mean , i'm not backing down from this this is a fact mr blitzer well , let s let rep kucinich people have to take responsibility for their positions \( applause \) mr blitzer let s ask senator edwards to respond was that vote a mistake \? mr edwards well \( chuckles \) i'm not sure what being a trial lawyer has to do with it , but what my response is rep kucinich product liability mr edwards america america s trade \( laughs \) cute cute , dennis \( applause \) i think america s america s trade policy has been a complete disaster i do believe that nafta , cafta , colombia , korea , peru which we 're now considering has been a complete and total disaster and i think it s really important to pull what s been happening with trade into the bigger picture of what s happening with america because what i believe is that powerful interests particularly big corporate interests have literally taken over this government , and they 've taken over it against the interests of ordinary americans \( applause \) and a living , breathing example of that is , in 1993 , when we were in control of the white house , of the united states senate and the united states house , we made an effort to pass universal health care the big drug companies , insurance companies and their lobbyists killed it at the same time , nafta was put on the table mr blitzer all right sen edwards the big corporations in america were for nafta so what did we get with a democratic congress , with a democratic president \? we did n't no , let me finish this we did n't get something that america desperately needed , which is universal health care , but we got something america did not need , which is nafta , which has cost us millions of jobs \( applause \) we will not change this country if we replace a crowd of corporate republicans with corporate democrats \( cheers , applause \) we have to give the power in this democracy back to the american people that s what s at stake in this election mr blitzer all right i'm going to let senator clinton respond , but let me just rephrase the question was your vote to normalize trade relations with china a mistake \? mr edwards i think what s the mistake is allowing china to operate unfettered , to send dangerous products into this country , to not have the president of the united states hold them responsible for their trading obligations or the wto , which has not been done mr blitzer so it was a mistake \? mr edwards i think it was right to bring them into wto it s wrong to not hold them responsible for their obligations mr blitzer all right senator clinton , all of us remember the big nafta debate when your husband was president of the united states , and a lot of us remember the debate between al gore , who was then vice president , and ross perot ross perot was fiercely against nafta knowing what we know now , was ross perot right \? \( laughter \) sen clinton all i can remember from that is a bunch of charts \( laughter \) that sort of is a vague memory look , nafta did not do what many had hoped , and so we do need to take a look at it and we do need to figure out how we 're going to have trade relations that are smart , that give the american worker and the american consumer rights around the world and i want to go back to campbell s question for a minute because it s really related to this it is something that every parent should be worried about it s not only the toys it s the pet food , it s the medical components and prescription drugs if we do n't impose a thirdparty , independent investigative arm on our corporations that do business in china as well as the chinese government , we should not permit any items to be imported into our country until we 're sure they 're safe \( applause \) i mean , that to me is rule number one \( applause \) mr blitzer all right so let me rephrase the question i 'll rephrase the question was nafta a mistake \? rep kucinich it was passed in the clinton administration mr blitzer was nafta a mistake \? sen clinton nafta was a mistake to the extent that it did not deliver on what we had hoped it would , and that s why i call for a trade timeout when i am president i'm going to evaluate every trade agreement we do need to get back to enforcing the ones we have , which the bush administration has not done they have totally abdicated that but i think we have to get broader than that we 've got to have enforceable labor and environmental standards we 've got the wto that enforces financial and corporate rights we need the international labor organization and other mechanisms that will be there to enforce labor rights and environmental rights , and that s what i intend to do as president \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer i want to go to john roberts in a second , but i know senator dodd and senator obama want to weigh in on this senator dodd , you first sen dodd well , first of all , look i respect the fact that we 're calling for timeouts , but as was pointed out earlier by john edwards , we 've had senator obama and senator clinton both came out in support of the peruvian free trade agreement now switching our positions on these issues here for the convenience of a debate and discussion on where polling data may be we are in a global economy it is critically important that we do everything we can to expand those markets so that our products and our services can be sold in foreign nations here it was outrageous in a sense here had a us corporation produced contaminated toys or food , they would have been shut down in 20 minutes mr absolutely sen dodd i called upon the president to put a moratorium on trade coming out of china when those products were announced to be contaminated it should have stopped right then and there for eternity \( applause \) mr blitzer all right senator obama , was nafta a mistake \? sen obama well , first of all , i hope chris is clear i have n't changed positions on peru i am intending to sen dodd oh , you are for it sen obama i am for it , and i plan to vote for it because it is a small country sen dodd okay sen obama this is a trade agreement that has the labor agreements and the environmental agreements that we 've been fighting for in it , and i think it s the right thing to do i am opposed to cafta i 've been opposed to south korea but going back to the issue of china you know what japan does with the chinese when it comes to , for example , food importation \? they send their own inspectors over to china and they set up their own safety system and they say , if you do n't abide by our rules , you ca n't send food into japan now , the question is , why does n't the united states impose these same rules and regulations as japan has \? \( cheers , applause \) this is the biggest market this is the biggest market in the world china has to sell here but this goes back to how we did most favored nation trading status with china the problem was we had one \( level \? \) when we allowed them in we should have said , we will review this every single year , so if you are not behaving properly , if you are not safeguarding our consumers and we find that you are not looking out for american workers or the administration is not , we wo n't have that subject to review that was the failure on that china bill sen biden wolf 30 seconds , wolf thirty seconds mr blitzer all right 30 seconds i 've got to let senator biden sen biden look , it s not the agreement it s the man under the wto , we can shut this down what are they all talking about here \? it s about a president who wo n't enforce the law \( applause \) when they contaminated chicken , what happened \? they cut off all chickens going in from delaware a 3 billion industry into china they cut it off we have power under the this agreement i do n't know what anybody s talking about here enforce the agreement mr blitzer thank you sen biden shut it down \( applause \) mr blitzer thank you , senator rep kucinich \( inaudible \) put it there from the beginning mr blitzer all right hold on rep kucinich they were n't it was n't in there from the beginning mr blitzer john roberts everybody s going to have a chance rep kucinich it was n't in there from the beginning that it was n't in there from the beginning \( inaudible \) mr roberts want to explore the energy issue for a moment here because it s been of particular importance to the state senator obama , the price of oil is flirting with the 100abarrel mark right now , making all the more urgent the need for alternate fuel forces you support nuclear energy as a part of the plan for the future , but there is an issue of what to do with the waste you are opposed to the yucca mountain nuclear repository about 90 miles from here your state uses about gets about 48 percent of its power from nuclear compared to 20 percent for most other states yet you are opposed to bringing nuclear waste from other states and keeping it in illinois the question is , if not in your backyard , whose \? sen obama well , as i 've said , i do n't think it s fair to send it to nevada , because we 're producing it \( applause \) so what we have to do is , we 've got to develop the storage capacity based on sound science now , laboratories like argonne in my own home state are trying to develop ways to safely store nuclear waste without having to ship it across the country and put it in somebody else s backyard but keep in mind that i do n't think nuclear power is necessarily our best option it has to be part of our energy mix we have a genuine crisis that has to be addressed and as president , i intend to address it , and here s what we have to do we have to , first of all , cap greenhouse gases , because climate change is real and it s going to impact nevada and it s impacting the entire planet \( cheers , applause \) that means that we 're going to have to tell polluters , we are going to charge you money when you send pollution into the air , that s creating climate change that money we can then reinvest in solar , in wind , in biodiesel , in clean coal technology and in superior nuclear technology mr blitzer all right senator , until there s some new technological breakthrough , as you would hope and all of us would hope , where do you send the waste \? sen obama well , right now it is on site in many situations , and that is not the optimal situation , wolf but do n't keep on assuming that we ca n't do something i mean , this is about the third time where you said , assuming we ca n't do it , what s our option \? mr blitzer well , until we until we do it sen obama well , but i'm running for president because i think we can do it \( cheers , applause \) gov richardson \( \? \) wolf \? wolf \? sen obama i reject i reject the notion that we ca n't meet our energy challenges mr blitzer all right sen obama we can if we 've got bold leadership in the white house that is saying we are going to do something about climate change , we are going to develop renewable energy sources that s what i intend to do as president and we should n't , you know , be pessimistic about the future of america \( scattered applause \) mr blitzer okay i'm optimistic \( laughter \) governor richardson s a former energy secretary what do you do with the nuclear waste in the interim \? gov richardson well , you mentioned all the labs , argonne , yucca mountain i was in charge of them here s what you do first , the future is renewable it s not oil , it s not coal , it s not nuclear \( applause \) what you do with the waste is you do n't put it in yucca mountain all my life as secretary of energy , as a congressman i opposed the site for environmental reasons , water saturation i do n't think the answer , also , is in regional sites there s a technological solution , a scientific solution what i would do , i would turn yucca mountain into a national laboratory we have the greatest brains , our national lab scientists we need to find a way to safely dispose of nuclear waste there is a technological solution but while we do that , we should n't be giving the nuclear power industry all of these advantages in the senate bills that are coming forth , or subsidies oil , coal and nuclear are getting most of the subsidies we need an energy revolution in this country \( applause \) to shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources by 50 percent by the year 2020 eighty percent reduction of greenhouse emissions , a mandate mr blitzer all right gov richardson we need to have 30 percent of our electricity renewable and it s got to be also the american people i'm g going to say this honestly sacrificing a little bit when it comes to appliances \( applause \) and when it comes to being part of an energy efficiency revolution mr blitzer thank you thank you , governor campbell ms brown senator clinton , you went to your alma mater recently , wellesley college , and you said there that your tenure had prepared you to compete in the all boys club of presidential politics at the same time , your campaign has accused this all boys club surrounding you on stage of piling on with their attacks against you and then your husband recently came to your defense by saying that these , quote , boys , had been getting rough with you \( light laughter \) and some have suggested that you , that your campaign , that your husband are exploiting gender as a political issue during this campaign what s really going on here \? sen clinton well , i'm not exploiting anything at all i'm not playing , as some people say , the gender card here in los vegas i'm just trying to play the winning card , and i understand well that \( cheers , applause \) people are not attacking me because i'm a woman they 're attacking me because i'm ahead , and i understand \( interrupted by laughter , cheers \) that you know , as harry truman famously said , if you ca n't stand the heat , get out of the kitchen \( cheers \) and i feel very comfortable in the kitchen , and i'm going to \( laughter \) you know , withstand the heat but you know , this is really one of the kind of issues that we can laugh about because it s exciting when you look at this field of candidates you know , several of us would never have had a chance to stand here and run for president a latino , an african american , a woman if it had n't been for the progress of america over my lifetime \( cheers , applause \) and i am thrilled to be running to be the first woman president ms brown but senator , if i can just ask you , what did you mean at wellesley when you referred to the boys club \? sen clinton campbell \( laughter \) ms brown just curious sen clinton well , it is clear , i think , from women s experiences that from time to time , there may be some impediments \( laughter \) and it has been my goal over the course of my lifetime to be part of this great movement of progress , that includes all of us but has particularly been significant to me as a woman and to be able to aim toward the highest , hardest glass ceiling is history making now , i'm not running because i'm a woman i'm running because i think i'm the best qualified and experienced person to hit the ground running \( cheers , applause \) but it s humbling it s inspiring and i have to tell you , as i travel around the country , you know , fathers drive hours to bring their daughters to my events and so many women in their 90s wait to shake my hand and they say something like , i'm 95 years old i was born before women could vote , and i want to live long enough to see a woman in the white house mr blitzer thank you , senator we 're going to take a quick break , but i want to give all the boys up here \( laughter \) a chance to quickly respond , if any of them want to respond do any of you believe that senator clinton is playing the so called gender card \? mr edwards i think are you looking at me \? \( laughs \) mr blitzer yeah \( laughter \) mr edwards i think that every single candidate on this stage should be held to exactly the same standard i do believe , however , that the voters need to know that we have choices there s nothing personal about this i think there are very good people running in the democratic party for president , and we need to have a strong candidate in this presidential race but i think there are differences between us , and voters are entitled to know what those differences are without it being personal , without it being attackoriented i spoke earlier about the difference between corporate democrats and corporate republicans and how critical it is for us to give the power in the democracy back to the american people so we can give a better life to our children , as 20 generations before us have done and my point is , some of us have taken a different approach to that senator clinton defends the system , takes money from lobbyists , does all those things and my point is simply that people have \( chorus of boos \) no , wait a minute voters have those choices voters have those choices they deserve to know that they have those choices and that there are , in fact , differences between us but i think every one of us should be held to the same standard mr blitzer thank you , senator \( applause \) and thank you , all of you we 're going to take a quick break we have a lot more to do we 're going to readjust the stage up here , get some chairs and when we come back , you 're going to be hearing directly from voters here in nevada they 're going to have a chance to ask these democratic presidential candidates questions \( applause \) much more of our democratic presidential debate right here on the campus of the university of nevadalas vegas we 'll be right back \( cheers , applause \) \( announcements \) mr blitzer welcome back we 're on the campus of the university of nevadalas vegas in the cox pavilion all the candidates are now seated we 're going to begin the second half of this presidential debate our white house correspondent , suzanne malveaux , is here with us \( applause \) and suzanne , you have some undecided voters who are ready to ask these presidential candidates some specific questions let s begin right now ms malveaux sure , wolf they are all very excited , about a hundred folks here i 've had a chance to actually meet at least some of you here , and obviously i noticed when you were responding to some of the candidates you were shaking your head , wrinkling your nose i'm not sure if they 've answered your questions , and this is your opportunity to ask the candidates what you really care about catherine jackson , i want to start off with you if you 'd stand with your son , please now , catherine , i understand that you 're quite concerned about your son , christopher you have served three tours of duty in iraq , and you 're \( cheers , applause \) recognize your service \( extended cheers , applause \) that s for you , christopher your mother , i spoke with her your mom is so worried that you 're going to be called to duty again , but not to be deployed in iraq , but rather iran do you share her concern \? christopher jackson yes , i do and i feel that if we continue on the path we 're at , that s where we 're going to end up , in iran and that s not what our troops need our troops need to come home now \( cheers , applause \) ms malveaux catherine catherine , your question catherine jackson i finally got my son home after three tours of policing iraq s civil war now members of the bush administration and neoconservative members of congress are beating the drums of war again my son is still part of the marine individual ready reserve , and if president bush starts another unnecessary war , there will be a chance that he 'll likely be recalled for war all of you on the stage have either i'm sorry have formal political power or significant informal power , and have the ability to stop the rush to war please tell me , how are you going to show us your leadership so on this issue now so i can decide who i think would be the best leader for tomorrow \? ms malveaux to senator biden , please sen biden the way to do that , ma'am , is to not ratchet up the winds of war here we had a vote in the united states senate on declaring the qods force their special forces and the revolutionary guard to be a terrorist organization a lot of people voted for that 70 some voted for it it s a serious , serious mistake because what it does , it was completely counterproductive \( applause \) what it did was , ma'am , what it did was it convinced the rest of the muslim world this is really a war against islam and not a war in iraq and number two , it rose the it caused the price of oil to head to 100 a barrel we 're paying 30 a barrel for what they call a risk premium and it helped destabilize the situation both in iran i mean afghanistan and pakistan so the way to do this is to keep quiet , hush up , and do what i told the president personally and what i 've said as chairman of the foreign relations committee if he takes the country to war in iraq \( sic \) without a vote of congress , which will not exist , then he should be impeached \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer senator clinton , you voted for that resolution you 're the only one on the stage who did vote for that resolution do you want to respond sen clinton i do mr blitzer to senator biden \? sen biden i was n't attacking senator clinton sen clinton no , no , no no mr blitzer i know , but she did vote for the resolution but if you could address this young man and his mother sen clinton yes mr blitzer about their fear that because of your vote , he might have to go fight in iran sen clinton well , there is no basis for that fear there is , however , a deep concern that is well justified about this president that s why what i tried to do is oppose a rush to war i started speaking out against it back in february because i was worried about president bush , working with members of congress to do exactly what joe is saying , which is to make it absolutely clear there is no legal authority whatsoever but what i think is most important is that we have aggressive diplomacy with iran i believe that the bush administration has allowed this situation to worsen and fester because they wo n't have any diplomatic relations of any sort with iran so i would do is to immediately begin that kind of negotiation , and i would n't ask the iranians to give up their quest for nuclear power or anything else get them to the table let s figure out if there s some way we can , number one , ratchet down the tension number two , prevent them from becoming a nuclear weapons power because that would be dangerous for all of us and get the rest of the world to help us we need china and russia , the neighbors in the region that s what i would be doing the only thing i would add , in addition to thanking you for your service , is that having been in iraq you know that the iranian revolutionary guard has assisted the militias and others in killing our americans and in maiming them they have imported technology and technical assistance i believe they are a terrorist group i think mr blitzer all right sen clinton sanctioning them and putting some pressure on them is an important part of getting to the diplomatic table with both carrots and sticks mr blitzer all right sen clinton so oppose the rush to war , but get tough and have a diplomatic approach to iran mr blitzer all right , i want to hear from senator edwards first go ahead senator , do you accept her explanation , this was no vote for a rush to war with iran \? mr edwards well , let me say , can i just say first , christopher , thank you god bless you for what you did for us and for america men and women like you have served this country so courageously and i'm proud of both you and your mom being here to speak up , because i think this is such a crucial issue for the future of the country my own view is that it s important for us to stop bush , cheney and the neocons at every single stage and i think there was an important opportunity to do that on the vote on the iranian revolutionary guard bush , cheney and the neocons wanted the iranian revolutionary guard declared a terrorist group , as senator biden just spoke about , because it s part of their path to moving militarily on iran and actually the fear a lot of us had about that was realized about a week ago , when bush , cheney and the administration declared the iranian revolutionary guard a terrorist organization , and this is the part everyone s going to love , a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction \( jeers \) we 've seen this movie we know how it turns out and i think it is absolutely crucial for democrats on this issue to show real strength , real backbone , and stop this president from moving forward on iran \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer thank you , senator very quickly , senator obama sen obama well , chris , we appreciate your service , and your mom , i can only imagine what she went through when you were away , so we 're glad you 're back home but understand the problem with this vote on the iranian revolutionary guard it was n't simply that it was identified as a terrorist organization it was also that in the language of the resolution it said we should maintain our forces in iraq with an eye towards blunting iranian influence so it s not just going to have an impact in terms of potentially having a war against iran it also gives this administration an excuse to perpetuate their failed strategy in iraq , and that could mean that you could be redeployed in iraq that s why this was a mistake , and that s why not only do we have to bring the war in iraq to a close , but we have to change the mindset that got us into war , which means we initiate yes , i agree with hillary that we 've got to initiate bold diplomacy i think the next president has to lead that diplomacy it ca n't just be envoys and one of the reasons i'm running for president and hillary and i had a disagreement on this i said i would meet with not just our friends , but also with our enemies because that s what strong countries and \( cheers , applause \) what strong presidents do is meet with our adversaries , tell them where we stand \( continued applause \) mr blitzer senator , i want to go back to suzanne malveaux , but this was an important vote , and you missed that vote you were n't present in the senate when that vote occurred sen obama no , this is true and it was a mistake this is one of the hazards of running for president but the but what i 've but what i have consistently said , and i said at the time of the vote , was that we should not take steps that would increase troop presences inside iraq with an eye towards blunting the impact of iran i always think that s a mistake mr blitzer thank you , senator go ahead , suzanne ms malveaux jeannie \( sp \) jackson , if you would stand for us , please you have something in common with the other mother you have a son that s also in iraq but your question , your concern is very different what is your question \? jeannie \( sp \) jackson well , i think you 're all about getting us out of iraq , and i appreciate , so it may be a moot point but my son s making 30 , 000 while corporate people are making , minimum , 100 , 000 for going over there is there any way to end this disparity in wages \? and also , i 'd like to say to bill richardson happy birthday \( laughter , applause \) thank you ms blitzer let s throw the question to the birthday boy \( laughter \) ms malveaux okay , i guess he gets the gift here and obviously , we 're talking about private contractors governor richardson , you know that senator obama has said he would pull out all of the private contractors if in fact that he was president but in light of how stretched our military is , do you think that s a practical solution \? gov richardson yes i would pull out all the contractors \( cheers , applause \) i would get them all out , just like i would get all our troops out , all residual forces and i would do it within a year jeannie \( sp \) jackson great answer gov richardson here s my answer what i believe we need to do is we need to reform our military this is what i would do this war in iraq has bled us enormously , has bled our military enormously i would find ways to keep the allvolunteer force now , i would say to you that i would have two more divisions in the army , two more in the marines i would increase military pay and educational benefits , a new gi bill for our military \( applause \) but what i would also do is with our veterans , you know , and military families i would have a heroes health card for every military person in this country \( applause \) which would mean that they could get health care , not just at the va system but anywhere they want i would fully guarantee funding at the va and most importantly the big , big challenge is mental health we do n't treat mental health with the parity that this country deserves and our kids coming back from iraq , afghanistan , vietnam there s a huge burden , mental trauma , traumatic brain injury , ptsd and we have a va system and we have a mental health system in this country that is not given the parity , the coverage that it deserves mr blitzer thank you , governor thank you suzanne ms malveaux our next question khalil khan , if you would just please stand for a moment you and i spoke very briefly , and you said you have some concerns about racial profiling khalil khan yes , i do i'm american citizen and have been profiled all the time at the airport since 9 11 , hundreds of thousands americans have been profiled and you know that it is like harassment and my question is that , that our civil liberties have been taken away from us what you are going to do to protect americans from this kind of harassment \? ms malveaux senator edwards , we 'd like you to take that you obviously voted for the patriot act , which gives the government extended powers of surveillance what do you say to people like mr khan , who say he s been abused by that power \? mr edwards i say he s right , he s right , and this administration has done more than abuse the patriot act and the patriot act needs to be dramatically changed , by the way \( cheers , applause \) but in addition to that , the racial profiling that you 're describing has to be stopped , and it will be stopped when i'm president of the united states and we 're going to take the steps that need to be taken to restore america s moral leadership in the world , and that means a whole group of things stopping the profiling , stopping the illegal and i use that term intentionally the illegal spying on the american people that this president has been engaged in \( cheers , applause \) closing guantanamo , which i think is a national embarrassment \( cheers , applause \) no more secret prisons , no more rendition and it s just absolutely amazing to me that there s actually an open discussion in the united states of america about what kind of torture will be tolerated i 'll tell you what kind of torture will be tolerated when i'm president of the united states , no torture will be tolerated when i'm president of the united states \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer thank you , senator mr edwards we 're going to restore our respect in the world mr blitzer congressman kucinich , i believe you 're the only person on this stage who had a chance to vote on the patriot act right after 9 11 , who voted against it right away rep kucinich that s because i read it \( laughter , cheers \) mr blitzer now , here s the question , here s the question \( continued cheers \) here s the question congressman , do you feel , as you 've felt on other issues , that those who voted for the patriot act and there are several here on this stage bear a responsibility for the way this individual , this american citizen , is being treated when he goes through an airport \? rep kucinich i you 're owed an apology you really are and every american should be able to present themselves without having to be further scrutinized based on ethnic identity but let s go back to the point that you made here the time you know , the president of the united states is called upon to make the right decision at the right time and you 've seen here tonight people who voted for the war , voted to fund the war , and now they have a different position people who voted for the patriot act , now they have a different position people who voted for china trade , now they have a different position people who voted for yucca mountain , now they had a different position just imagine what it will be like to have a president of the united states who s right the first time just imagine \( cheers , applause \) and and i do n't think i do n't think that the first questioner s question was really answered , about what are you going to do about this president , and for that matter the vice president , because they 're out of control and the congress is n't doing anything \( applause \) i mr blitzer thank you thank you , congressman rep kucinich it s called impeachment , and you do n't wait you do it now \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer all right rep kucinich you do n't wait \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer suzanne got suzanne has another question rep kucinich now \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer but i want rep kucinich impeach them now mr blitzer senator biden to go ahead and respond because you voted for the patriot act sen biden you know , let s facts are a funny thing they get in the way \( laughter \) you know what i mean \? there is nothing in the patriot act that allows profiling let s get that straight nothing in the patriot act allows profiling , number one you 're profiled illegally i have voted against and worked with legislation with many people on this stage to stop profiling that s number one it did not it s not because of the patriot act it s a convenient thing to talk about , number one number two , you know , when we had a chance to close down guantanamo , i voted against funding guantanamo other folks up here voted for funding it , including the two leading candidates i voted to not build the new 36 million part i called for closing it three years ago and so folks , this but this is not about who was right when , it s what s your plan now \? what are you going to do now \? \( applause \) mr blitzer thank you thank you , senator go ahead , suzanne ms malveaux george ambriz he s you 're a graduate student here , and you 're also a mentor for children i understand that you have a concern about immigration q yes , i do \( speaks in spanish \) it seems that many political commentators such as lou dobbs are guiding the debate and strongly shaping us policy on immigration by insinuating a linkage to terrorism as many people know , no terrorist has come from our southern border do you consider fighting terrorism and slowing the flow of illegal immigration coming from our southern border as intrinsically related issues \? ms malveaux governor richardson , since you 're the only on this stage who does not support even building a fence , why do n't you take this one \? rep kucinich that s not true gov richardson by the way , dennis , you keep stop including me in all these votes i 've been a governor i'm in new mexico \( laughter \) i'm not in washington \( applause \) here s my answer you know , two years ago and i'm the only one that s dealt with the immigration issue directly you know , and by the way , with the congress , let me just say , the congress s approval rating is 11 percent now , you know who s higher \? dick cheney and hmos \( laughter \) my point is that , you know , let s talk about the need to bring this together dysfunctional relationships exist between the president and the congress that needs to be corrected here s my answer two years ago , i'm the first governor that declared a border emergency because the federal government was n't doing its job in stopping the flow of drugs and people but you know what \? we should stop demonizing immigrants we should stop doing that \( applause \) and i'm against the fence and i am against the fence because it will not work the congress only funded half of the fence , and it s not america what i would do is i would do four quick things one , we have to secure the border double the number of border patrol agents keep the national guard there a little longer detection equipment , as you mentioned secondly , those that knowingly hire illegal workers should be punished \( applause \) third , we should have a relationship it s called foreign policy with mexico they 're our friend but we should speak frankly to our friends , and it should be something like this mexico , give jobs to your people \( cheers , applause \) you know , at the very least , stop handing out maps on the easiest place to cross \( laughter \) and then , lastly , a legalization plan a legalization plan mr blitzer thank you gov richardson not amnesty , not citizenship , but a path to legalization that involves conditions learning english mr blitzer thank you gov richardson paying back taxes mr blitzer governor , thank you gov richardson this is a very important issue mr blitzer very important i want senator dodd , though , to respond , because you voted for that security fence along the border between the us and mexico sen dodd well , first of all \( speaks in spanish \) \( cheers , applause \) i was in the peace corps in the dominican republic i argued at some points that fence , at certain places , you could make a case that a wall might help not across the entire border i'm opposed to that , but the idea of having some sort of better security , including additional guards , additional technology here that would allow us to deal with the issues but there ought not to be any correlation here when you take the oath of office , you do n't swear to uphold the constitution or protect the country i believe by upholding our rights , we do protect the country and the administration has taken the opposite view they 're posing to us the false choice , the dichotomy that to be safer , we have to give up rights i think that s so fundamentally flawed and fundamentally dangerous for the united states of america to \( embrace \? \) that idea \( applause \) mr blitzer all right , thank you , senator let s go back to suzanne ms malveaux we have judy bagley here with us if you would stand for a moment you have been working in the casino business for some 27 years now , a cashier judy bagley that s right ms malveaux you 've seen a lot of people come and go , obviously ms bagley absolutely ms malveaux what is your concern \? ms bagley i'm a booth cashier and we moved here over 30 years ago and i have three children , and as of yesterday , eight grandchildren \( applause \) ms malveaux and what is your question congratulations that s amazing and what is your question to the candidates \? ms bagley my question is , over the next several years the baby boomers , like my husband and i , will be retiring en masse at the same time , the country is at a record deficit we face a major challenge when i retire , i will have my pension , but many others will not throughout the campaign we 've heard the candidates supporting committing to support oh , my goodness committing to support social security and medicare my question is but the ideas on reform are often vague my question is , what do you plan to do to ensure that social security and medicare are truly available to us , our children and grandchildren in light of the current budget conditions \? ms malveaux thank you very much a very important issue senator obama sen obama well , first of all , judy , thank you for the question , and thanks for the great work you do on behalf of the culinary workers a great union here \( applause \) look , this is something that we 've talked about in our campaign we 've got 78 million baby boomers who are going to be retiring and the first thing we have to do is to put an end to george bush raiding the social security trust fund to pay for a misguided war in iraq \( applause \) if we take some of that money back and we start getting control of our budget and have fiscal discipline , that will make some of the difference , but not all of it , because we 're going to have more senior citizens , more retirees and fewer workers so i 've been very specific about saying that we should not privatize we should protect benefits i do n't think the best way to approach this is to raise the retirement age but what we can do is adjust the cap on the payroll tax right now anybody who s making 97 , 000 or less , you pay payroll tax on 100 percent of your income warren buffet , who made 46 million last year , pays on a fraction of 1 percent of his income and if we make that small adjustment , we can potentially close that gap and we can make sure social security is there \( applause \) mr blitzer thank you sen obama last point because just because i have to answer the full question medicare is a tougher problem because we 've got health care inflation going up , and i am meeting people all across the country who just ca n't manage , even if they 've got health insurance their premiums have gone up 78 percent since george bush took office it s a scam , and people are getting desperate the only way we 're going to fix medicare is if we get that rising cost under control , and that means having a universal health care plan where every single person has prevention and they are able to get the treatments they need we 're instituting health technologies and managing the chronically ill so that we save money we provide coverage for everybody that over the long term will save medicare enormous amounts of money , and it will be there for you mr blitzer thank you , senator senator clinton , you 've been criticized by senator obama , i think senator edwards , among others , for refusing to take a hard and fast position on whether you would raise the tax above those making 97 , 500 dollars a year to try to secure social security in the long term are you ready to make a hard and fast statement now on your position on what senator obama just said \? sen clinton well , i 'll tell you what i'm for , and i think judy raises two really important issues i am for getting back to fiscal responsibility i think i counted you said deficit three times six and a half years ago when george bush came into office , he inherited a balanced budget and a surplus \( applause \) and the social security system was on a path to be solvent into 2055 we have longterm challenges with social security we have a crisis with medicare , just like we have a crisis with health care costs we have a crisis with energy costs we have a lot of very intense challenges we have to meet right now so what i want to do is move back toward fiscal responsibility i think if we do n't do that , we 're not going to deal with any of these problems adequately then i think we will demonstrate that we 're serious about getting our house in order again mr blitzer so sen clinton and then i think we have to have a bipartisan commission i do not want to fix the problems of social security on the backs of middle class families and seniors \( applause \) if you lift the cap completely , that is a 1 trillion tax increase i do n't think we need to do that but i want to say one final word about medicare number one , medicare should be able to negotiate for lower drug prices \( applause \) mr blitzer all right thank you , senator sen clinton it was a travesty when the bush administration did not allow that to happen , and i have a lot of other ideas about how we 'll preserve and strengthen medicare mr blitzer all right so senator so you 're not ready to accept that raising of the cap on that , but i know that senator obama wants to respond to you sen obama i will be very brief on this because , hillary , i 've heard you say this is a trillion dollar tax cut on the middle class by adjusting the cap understand that only 6 percent of americans make more than 97 , 000 \( cheers , applause \) so 6 percent is not the middle class it s the upper class and you know , this is the kind of thing that i would expect from mitt romney or rudy giuliani \( laughter , boos , cheers , applause \) where we start playing with numbers we start playing with numbers in order to try to make a point \( cheers , applause \) and we ca n't do that no , no , no , no , no this is this is this is too important this is too important for us to pretend that we 're using numbers like a trillion dollar tax cut instead of responsibly dealing with a problem that judy asked for , and she said she wants a specific answer and that s what i provided but understand , this is the top 6 percent , and that is not the middle class \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer senator \? sen clinton first of all first of all , i think that you meant a tax increase , because that s what it would be but secondly , it is absolutely the case that there are people who would find that burdensome i represent firefighters i represent school supervisors i'm not talking i mean , you know , it s different parts of the country so you have to look at this across the board , and the numbers are staggering now , when people say be specific , i listened very carefully to what senator obama said when he appeared on one of the sunday morning shows , and he basically said that he was for looking at a lot of different things and using a bipartisan commission to do it i think that s the right answer that is where i have been from the very beginning that s what worked back in 1983 , when we had a real crisis in social security the government got together president reagan and speaker tip o'neill put together a bipartisan commission then everybody looked at everything at once it was n't one person s idea or somebody else s idea everybody had to get in a room and say , here s what we 're going to do to fix the problem that s what i want to do because i think that s what will work for america \( applause \) sen obama that s mr blitzer i want everybody to stand by because we have a lot more to talk about , a lot more of these questions from undecided voters here in nevada but we 're going to take a quick commercial break much more from the campus of the university of nevadalas vegas right after this \( cheers , applause \) \( announcements \) mr blitzer welcome back to the campus of the university of nevada , las vegas we 're at the democratic presidential debate suzanne malveaux s got another undecided voter with a question ms malveaux lashannon spencer , please stand up for a moment what is your question \? lashannon spencer we constantly hear health care questions and questions pertaining to the war but we do n't hear questions pertaining to the supreme court justice or education \( applause \) my question is , if you are elected president , what qualities must the appointee possess \? ms malveaux i 'd like to get to senator dodd , if you would and in answering that question , also tell us whether or not you would require your nominees to support abortion rights \( laughter , cross talk \) sen dodd well , first of all , you want first of all , thanks for your question well , obviously you want people here that are going to have a balanced sense of justice , to bring a life experience to that bench , where they 're not just there as academics , that have a clear record in the judicial branch , where they either served as a judge or as a lawyer , where they 've demonstrated that ability to be fair and just when it comes to the administration of laws of our country here i do n't necessarily believe in applying litmus tests here i think that s a dangerous precedent to begin that process here you start down that path , others may follow you end up with a court then that may lack that kind of balance now , obviously as someone who s prochoice and have been , entire public life and career , i feel very strongly about roe versus wade i would not want a justice to be appointed who would even think about overturning that \( applause \) but i want to be very careful here i want to be careful about making sure that i 'd know the person , i'm not just looking at people i do n't know or do n't understand their background , so i have a very good feel of where they 're going to be on these matters \( inaudible \) when they make the statement that they will uphold precedent , and they raise their right hand before the judiciary committee and make that commitment and then violate that commitment , that i find highly offensive that will not happen in a dodd administration , i promise you \( applause \) mr blitzer all right , let s go through the whole panel i want everybody to weigh in this is an important question that was raised i 'll start with senator biden would you insist that any nominee for the us supreme court supported abortion rights for women \? sen biden suzanne s decided i'm not answering her question i'm answering the question of the woman who is there okay \? \( cheers , applause \) and number one and then i 'll answer suzanne s question mr blitzer well , let s ask the woman do you want him to answer that question \? sen biden do you want me to answer your question \? ms spencer i would like for you to answer both questions sen biden i will answer both i 'll answer your question first your question first , is i 've presided over more supreme court justices than anyone in american history , number one number two , i have taken on those justices who in fact show no balance they are ideologues we have enough ideologues we have enough professors on the bench we have enough i want a someone who ran for dog catcher i want someone \( laughter \) literally not a joke when hillary s husband asked me for his advice when he was appointing people , i wanted to go to people , and so did he we could n't four people turned it down we wanted to get someone who in fact had knew what it was like to live life , knew what it was as not some intellectual feat \( applause \) and by the way , the next person that s appointed on a biden administration is going to be a woman we do n't have enough women on the bench , number one mr blitzer so sen biden number two , suzanne malveaux s question i would not appoint anyone who did not understand that section 5 of the 14th amendment and the liberty clause of the 14th amendment provided a right to privacy that s the question i 'd ask them \( applause \) if that is answered correctly , that that is the case , then it answers the question , which means they would support roe v wade \( applause \) mr blitzer let s go down the whole panel , and if you could give me a short yes or no would you insist on a supreme court nominee supporting abortion \? gov richardson i would have diversity as a prime criterion , but i would also ask my nominee this is what i would ask number one , do you believe roe versus wade is settled law \? number two , do you support the right to privacy \? number three , do you support civil rights \? number four , do you support \( what you asked \? \) education , school equalization \? if the answer is no to those questions that basically say is it settled law or not you want to call it a litmus test , fine those would be the judges that i would appoint for the supreme court \( applause \) mr blitzer all right thank you , governor congressman rep kucinich a kucinich appointment to the supreme court would have a litmus test on abortion it s a it s a question of a woman s right to choose and a right to privacy but a president has to do more than that a president has to be a healer , and this has been one of the great divides in our country and so i want to also let the american people know that i 'll stand for prenatal care , postnatal care , child care , a living wage , universal health care , sex education mr blitzer all right rep kucinich birth control we can make abortions less necessary if we have a healer in the white house , and we can also protect a woman s right to choose we can do both \( applause \) mr blitzer thank you , congressman senator clinton \( cheers , applause \) senator clinton , would this be a sine qua non for you , that any nominee you name to the supreme court would have to share your view on abortion \? sen clinton well , they 'd have to share my view about privacy , and i think that goes hand in hand privacy , in my opinion , is embedded in our constitution what does it mean to have a right to free speech or the right to worship as you choose if you also do n't have the right to be left alone , to have that privacy that goes with being an american \? \( applause \) so it would be absolutely critical and i , like senator biden mr blitzer so the answer is yes \? sen clinton yes , the answer is yes and mr blitzer okay all right sen clinton but i i just want to say , senator biden really deserves a lot of plaudits because he knows this issue forwards and backwards and i think it s important to have a president who understands the intricate connections of our branches of government and the constitution i think that s one of the great tragedies of george bush s presidency is he did n't really understand the way our government was supposed to work \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer thank you senator obama , you used to be a professor of law sen obama i would not appoint somebody who does n't believe in the right to privacy but you 're right , wolf , i taught constitutional law for 10 years , and i when you look at what makes a great supreme court justice , it s not just the particular issue and how they rule , but it s their conception of the court and part of the role of the court is that it is going to protect people who may be vulnerable in the political process , the outsider , the minority , those who are vulnerable , those who do n't have a lot of clout \( applause \) and part of what i want to find in a supreme court justice and joe s exactly right , sometimes we 're only looking at academics or people who 've been in the court if we can find people who have life experience and they understand what it means to be on the outside , what it means to have the system not work for them , that s the kind of person i want on the supreme court \( applause \) mr blitzer thank you thank you , senator we heard from senator dodd , so senator edwards , go ahead would you insist that nominees support abortion \? mr edwards i would insist that they recognize the right to privacy and recognize roe v wade as settled law but i want to go beyond what some others have said here because it is so crucial if you grew up like i did in the segregated style and you saw how important it was to have federal judges who had some backbone and were willing to stand up against popular opinion but we had a judge who desegregated the public schools in north carolina , in charlotte , north carolina he literally had to have armed guards take him from home to work and home each day that s the kind of courage and strength we need in a united states supreme court justice mr blitzer thank you , senator all right , suzanne ms malveaux frank perconte is a student here frank , what is your question \? frank perconte whether it s the continuing violence in iraq , or if it s a potential confrontation with iran , or even the emerging instability in pakistan , nothing seems to be getting any better in the middle east it only seems to be getting worse and if the upcoming election is anything like the last two elections , if any of you is elected , in all likelihood , you 'll be presiding over an extremely divided electorate almost half the country is not going to agree with you on the direction you want to take this country to meet those challenges in the middle east so my question to you is , assuming you are elected , the day after you take the oath of office , what message will you offer the whole country , to unite all of us behind you , so that you can see us through this period of transition that we 're in \? \( applause \) ms malveaux i 'd like to refer that to senator obama senator obama , you said on a tv interview just this past weekend , you did n't believe that senator clinton was able to unite this country why do you believe she ca n't \? sen obama no , that s not what i said what i said was i thought i could do it better that s why i'm running for president \( applause \) if i did n't think i could do it better then i would n't be running for president , because the stakes are too high , just as we heard here s what i would do immediately i would convene a continuous advisory meeting , with not just democrats but republicans , specifically on national security issues , because there is a long tradition that our differences in foreign policy should end at the water s edge and we have lost that tradition and there are some wonderful republicans dick lugar , chuck hagel there are a group of them who have continued that tradition , but we have lost it because of the polarization of the bush administration so i want republicans and democrats and independents to understand that , as president , i am going to want to go before the entire world and say , america s back , we are ready to lead but we 're not just going to lead militarily we 're going to lead by building schools in the middle east that teach math and science instead of hatred of americans we 're going to lead by shutting down guantanamo and restoring habeas corpus in this country so that we offer them an example \( applause \) mr blitzer thank you sen obama we 're going to lead by talking to our enemies and not just our friends and i believe that there are a lot of republicans who hunger for that kind of bipartisan approach that s what i will offer as president of the united states \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer senator clinton thank you , senator some have suggested , including some on this stage , that you are simply too polarizing to unite the country if you were elected president what do you say to those critics \? sen clinton well , i say that i am running to be the president of the entire country you know , when i started running for the senate in new york , i heard the same things and what i did was to reach out to republicans , democrats , independents , rural , urban because we 've got to begin to work together that s what i 've tried to do in the senate working across party lines , trying to find common ground to go back to chris , you know , working to get health care for guard and reservists with a colleague , a republican colleague from south carolina you know , you have to look to find common ground , and it is the responsibility of a leader to try to make that possible now , that does n't mean there wo n't be differences because there are we 're not going to wake up the day after the election and not believe what we believe and not see the world as we see it , but we can certainly begin under presidential leadership to listen to one another , to look for those chances to find that common ground and work together that s the kind of president i will be , and i will spend a lot of my time working with not just republicans , but people who are n't in public life we 've got smart people all over this country who want to make a contribution , who want to give something back let s enlist the best that we have in america and start acting like americans again to solve our problems and make a difference , wolf \( applause \) mr blitzer thank you , senator senator biden sen biden let me give you a direct answer to your question i 'd start by ending the war , and i 've already gained the respect of my republican colleagues the only person that s gotten 75 votes in the united states senate on a plan to end the war it s sitting in a drawer it 'll begin the day that i get elected secondly , one of the ways you work in the house and the senate is over time you gain respect find me a republican on the other side that does n't respect my judgment and does n't think i tell them straight up the truth i 've worked with them i 've already done it i would also include republicans in my administration look , the basic premise you operate on , i reject the vast majority of republicans think this war stinks as well the vast majority of republicans out there think that our foreign policy is shambles the vast majority of the independents think that folks , this is not going to be that hard this is like not this is n't pushing the rope they 're sticking with george bush out of loyalty , but i promise you i 've already brought them along i brought them along on bosnia under the administration of senator clinton of president clinton i brought them along on the issue of dealing with arms control i brought them along on the issue of the war in iraq so folks , do n't mr blitzer thank you sen biden buy into this premise that republicans average republicans and republican senators do n't agree to this , they do they 're afraid to take on bush i will end that i 've already done it , and i would start with ending the war in iraq with 75 senators \( off mike \) \( cheers , applause \) mr blitzer all right thank you , senator we 're going to go back to suzanne , but go ahead , governor richardson , very briefly gov richardson well , you know , tonight we 've talked about iran , we 've talked about iraq , we 've talked about regimes that have not been friendly i 'd thrown in north korea the cornerstone of my foreign policy would be diplomacy and negotiation we would be not the world s policemen but the world s conscience all my life as an ambassador to the united nations , as a special envoy , i 've brought people together as a governor , bipartisan solutions , as a congressmen , as a secretary of energy i'm going to answer your question specifically on the middle east number one , i would have a middle east peace envoy this president s the only president that has n't had one i would base a middle east settlement on a twostate solution protection for the security of israel and a palestinian state i would also look at adjustments in the '67 borders i would also look at dealing effectively and efficiently and fairly with the settlements issue , with jerusalem i would do something else i would talk to syria i would talk to iran it s all tied in a solution it s called leadership and diplomacy and to take these steps , you have to be bold we 're talking about electing a president that is going to need to repair the enormous damage of this administration in the last eight years mr blitzer thank you , governor suzanne , go ahead ms malveaux maria , would you stand , please \? give us your full name q maria \( inaudible \) and i'm a unlv student and my question is for senator clinton this is a fun question for you do you prefer diamonds or pearls \? \( laughter \) sen clinton now , i know i'm sometimes accused of not being able to make a choice i want both \( laughter \) ms malveaux do we get to ask any of the other candidates or , i suppose , just senator clinton \? \( cross talk \) q it s the only thing shiny up there ms malveaux okay , thank you so much mr blitzer all right , so on that note , diamonds and pearls , i want to thank all of the democratic presidential candidates for joining us here this evening let s give them a big round of applause \( cheers , applause \) that wraps up our debate tonight this is the first presidential debate ever held here in the state of nevada we 'd like to thank our hosts here at the university of nevada , las vegas , and the nevada democratic party , for all their help and all their volunteers in putting this together the next debate , by the way , in the race for the white house , will be in less than two weeks here on cnn , the longawaited republican youtube presidential debate in st petersburg , florida anderson cooper , he 'll be moderating that debate , and we 're going to hand over the program right now to anderson cooper to pick up our coverage anderson
mayor michael r bloomberg of new york announced this evening that he was quitting the republican party and changing his political affiliation to independent the announcement came after mr bloomberg gave a speech denouncing partisan gridlock in washington , stirring renewed speculation that he is preparing to run for president in 2008 as an independent or thirdparty candidate i have filed papers with the new york city board of elections to change my status as a voter and register as unaffiliated with any political party , he said in a statement issued while he was in california delivering political speeches although my plans for the future have n't changed , i believe this brings my affiliation into alignment with how i have led and will continue to lead our city , the mayor said mr bloomberg , a billionaire businessman , is a former democrat who won the new york city mayoralty in 2001 by running as a republican against mark green , the democratic candidate he easily won reelection in 2005 the mayor , who cannot by law seek a third consecutive term , has said he had no plans to run for president , but he has declined to shut the door completely on a white house bid we have achieved real progress by overcoming the partisanship that too often puts narrow interests above the common good , mr bloomberg said in his statement as a political independent , i will continue to work with those in all political parties to find common ground , to put partisanship aside and to achieve real solutions to the challenges we face he added any successful elected executive knows that real results are more important than partisan battles and that good ideas should take precedence over rigid adherence to any particular political ideology working together , there s no limit to what we can do can be found on the new  mr bloomberg announced his decision after a campaignstyle swing through california in which he gave a series of speeches that clearly previewed what aides have long said would be the thematic underpinnings of a bloomberg presidential campaign , should he decide to run he presented himself as an antidote to partisan gridlock in washington , suggesting that not withstanding his affiliation with the republican party , he brought nonpartisan government to new york when you go to washington these days , you can feel a sense of fear in the air , the fear to do anything or say anything that might affect the polls or give the other side the advantage or offend a special interest group , mr bloomberg said the federal government is n't out front it s cowering in the back of the room should mr bloomberg ultimately decide not to run for president or any other office , his announcement could become an interesting footnote to one of the more unusual mayoralties in a city that has produced a series of memorable mayors but mr bloomberg s decision to leave the republican party and become an independent was immediately viewed by many of his prospective rivals as a major jolt to the presidential campaign mr bloomberg has never shown any reluctance to use his huge personal fortune to advance his career he spent more than 150 million on his two bids for mayor , and he would have no problem financing his own presidential campaign what is more , mr bloomberg has arguably at least as strong a claim on new york city s prosperity as his predecessor , rudolph w giuliani , who is seeking the republican nomination if mr bloomberg decides to run as an independent or thirdparty candidate , he might find that he enjoys the benefits of new york city s successes without the ideological burdens that mr giuliani has faced in trying to win the republican nomination while being identified with such positions as supporting , gay rights and gun control that said , several political analysts have argued that a thirdparty candidacy by mr bloomberg could pose a problem for the democratic party until he ran for mayor , mr bloomberg was a lifetime democrat , and his success in new york reflected his ability to draw democratic votes should he enter the race , mr bloomberg would join mr giuliani and senator hillary rodham clinton as one of the three major new york figures seeking the presidency this year mr bloomberg s trip to california came in a week when he was on the cover of time magazine and stood by gov arnold schwarzenegger , who told a crowd of reporters that he should run for president like mr bloomberg , mr schwarzenegger has proven successful in appealing for democratic support after being elected as a republican mr bloomberg , while in california , told an audience of google employees that the united states is really in trouble and used caustic language in describing what he said was timidity in washington , contrasting that with his own approach to running new york city in his speech , he laid out what he said were the cornerstones of nonpartisan leadership independence , honesty , common sense , innovation , teamwork and accountability mr bloomberg promoted his approach as mayor to issues like education , crime prevention and health care in putting those principles into practice none of the

gphone so open it could be closed eric e schmidt s conference call last week about google s new cellphone operating system , android , was the opposite of a showy steve jobs keynote mr schmidt , the chief executive , above , talked about everything except the cool new features of the product that is because android is not really a product it is opensource phone software google emphasized android s ability to run programs from any developer , and it will publish a software development kit this week this is , of course , in contrast to apple , which has been slow to open the iphone manufacturers and carriers do not need to be as open as google the company chose an opensource license used by the apache web server that is especially friendly to big companies unlike some other opensource licenses , it does not force anyone who uses it to contribute their improvements to the public domain with android , a cellphone maker could , say , add features that it could keep to itself when pressed , andy rubin , the head of the android project , said a wireless carrier would be free to make an androidbased phone that locked out any application it did not approve when you free something into the open , it is up to the industry to do something with it , mr rubin said there are n't any restrictions mr schmidt jumped in , however , to suggest that he could not imagine anyone making the sort of choice that apple \( on whose board he sits \) and att have made with the iphone the more constraints the manufacturers put on the platform , he said , the fewer the applications that will work with their devices saul hansell email hoax asks friends for money nigeria continues to develop and export the world s most innovative internet scams in one bizarre variation , the swindlers are taking a page from facebook and leveraging the power of social connections here is how it works the swindler somehow breaks into a victim s webbased email account he then impersonates the victim and writes to everyone in the account s address book , asking them to wire money to nigeria the email includes some variation on a story about being mugged or losing a wallet while on a trip to nigeria this happened recently to drew biondo of port jefferson , ny , a public relations executive mr biondo used a yahoo account for work email and had about 600 people in his contact list , many of them journalists he said he experienced an influx of phone calls from every reporter i 've ever spoken to , all alerting him to the hijacking it took mr biondo two and a half days to get his account back he has no idea how it was stolen the brilliance of the scheme is that while the story in the email might strain credulity , people are obviously far more willing to trust a friend than someone claiming to be the widow of a former nigerian dictator while none of mr biondo s contacts fell for the ruse , some people somewhere must be sending money , because a web search indicates that the hoax is spreading david f gallagher facebook s ads are they illegal \? mark zuckerberg , the founder of facebook , promised no less than a revolution with his idea that ads you see on the site will be attached to the names and photos of your friends who like the products being advertised there is at least one problem with this idea it may be illegal under a new york privacy law the statute says that any person whose name , portrait , picture , or voice is used within this state for advertising purposes or for the purposes of trade without the written consent first obtained can sue for damages such a use is also a criminal misdemeanor william mcgeveran , a professor at the university of minnesota law school who wrote about these issues in a blog post last week \( blogslawharvardedu infolaw \) , said the law would apply to facebook users anywhere if the ad were displayed in new york more broadly , professor mcgeveran said , people can sue advertisers who use their names and images without permission under a common law principle chris kelly , the chief privacy officer of facebook , said the professor s interpretation of the law was too broad he said the advertisements were simply a representation of the action users have taken choosing to link themselves to a product and he argued that it would be difficult for users to object if they had already chosen to publicly identify themselves with the brand doing the advertising we are fairly confident that our operation is well presented to users and that they can make their own choices about whether they want to affiliate with brands that put up facebook pages , mr kelly said saul hansell bosses blocking social web sites it turns out that your bosses do n't want you updating your social networking page at the office the web security firm barracuda networks polled 2 , 400 of its corporate customers and found that 502 percent block access to myspace or facebook but companies treat the two sites differently 439 percent block myspace , but only 256 percent block facebook do employers distrust the entertainment and datingfocused myspace more than the cleaner , more predictable facebook \?

the patriots do so many things well that searching for a weakness can be as futile as guaranteeing a victory against them , which steelers safety anthony smith did on wednesday but search the steelers \( 93 \) must , especially if they think their topranked defense can play the patriots topranked offense to a draw today there is only one category in which the patriots \( 120 \) rank last in the league punting but their poor average there can be attributed to excellent field position or inactivity and because games do not usually turn on a team s ability to down a 60yard punt inside the 10yard line in the final minutes , maybe a better place to look for their achilles heel is at the bottom of their other kicker s leg placekicker stephen gostkowski , the leading scorer in the american football conference , is only 4 for 7 in his career on fieldgoal attempts of 40 yards or longer , and has made only one gamewinning kick it was an important one , lifting the patriots over the chargers in the playoffs last season , but it was also a 31yard chip shot on a warm night in san diego hitting from 45 yards off the frozen turf in foxborough , mass , will be tougher of course , the question of whether gostkowski can make such a kick , or whether a player who has scored 103 points can be considered a weakness , is largely theoretical unless the steelers or some other team put him in a position where he has to try raiders at packers the packers \( 102 \) will try to wrap up the nfc north with help from ryan grant , who is averaging 49 yards a carry brett favre is expected to start against the raiders \( 48 \) , but injuries have muddled the choice between josh mccown and daunte culpepper for oakland aaron kampman \( 11 sacks \) and kabeer gbajabiamila \( 9 \) will try to get their hands on whoever gets the call chargers at titans the chargers \( 75 \) have won six of eight to take control of the afc west san diego leads the league in interceptions , which could foreshadow problems for titans quarterback vince young he has thrown 14 interceptions this season , including 8 in the past 5 games a conference loss would be a big blow to the titans \( 75 \) , who are tied with the browns for the final wildcard spot cardinals at seahawks the seahawks \( 84 \) have not been impressive but can clinch their fourth straight nfc west title , another reason the cardinals \( 66 \) are kicking themselves over two division losses to the 49ers if larry fitzgerald and anquan boldin do not play , protecting the turnoverprone kurt warner could be the difference 33 of the seahawks 36 sacks have come in their eight wins buccaneers at texans like their 2002 super bowl team , the buccaneers \( 84 \) are using a smothering defense to help their offense only pittsburgh has allowed fewer points than tampa bay , and that has kept jeff garcia \( three interceptions \) from taking risks after missing two games with a sore back , he should return against the texans \( 57 \) , but if the buccaneers take a lead , expect him to take a seat panthers at jaguars a wildcard spot will be an improvement for the jaguars \( 84 \) after last season , when jacksonville lost three in a row to finish 88 and miss the playoffs the return of marcus stroud from a suspension will mean even more pressure on vinny testaverde the panthers \( 57 \) have had their problems , but winning on the road has not been among them they are 42 away from home colts at ravens willis mcgahee went over 1 , 000 yards rushing for the season on monday night and scored a touchdown for the seventh consecutive game but the ravens \( 48 \) have lost six in a row and have the worst turnover ratio in the league \( minus12 \) marvin harrison may finally be ready to return for the colts \( 102 \) , but with the division title well in hand , another week of rest would not hurt vikings at 49ers the vikings \( 66 \) average 56 yards a carry , which will be a league record if they can sustain it that should not be a problem against the 49ers \( 39 \) , who have the league s top tackler in linebacker patrick willis but still rank 27th against the run rams at bengals thousands of fantasy owners missed the playoffs because of forgettable years by players like marc bulger , steven jackson and rudi johnson it is probably little consolation , but at least the rams \( 39 \) and the bengals \( 48 \) will miss them , too dolphins at bills if the bills \( 66 \) had received a couple of breaks , they might have been focusing on playoff positioning this week instead of hoping for the return of marshawn lynch if the dolphins \( 012 \) had received a couple of breaks , they might be , well , 111 chiefs at broncos chiefs defensive end jared allen , the league s sack leader , has as many touchdown receptions in the past five games \( one \) as tight end tony gonzalez that could explain why kansas city \( 48 \) has lost five in a row heading into its game at denver \( 57 \) browns at jets the browns \( 75 \) probably lost their chance at the afc north title by losing to the cardinals last sunday , but none of the wildcard contenders have an easier closing schedule cleveland s final four opponents , starting with the jets \( 39 \) , are 1632 saints at falcons when the saints \( 57 \) played host to the falcons \( 39 \) in their return to the superdome last season , millions of fans were watching when the teams play again tomorrow , some of those fans may wish espn had stuck with showing poker on monday nights cowboys at lions the cowboys \( 111 \) will clinch the nfc east with a win terrell owens has 14 touchdown receptions , including at least one in seven consecutive games the lions \( 66 \) have been as bad as they have been predictable lately , passing on 39 of their first 42 plays in last week s loss , their fourth in a row detroit has given up the most sacks in the nfl giants at eagles the giants \( 84 \) sacked donovan mcnabb 12 times when they played the eagles \( 57 \) in week 4 but philadelphia has allowed only 16 sacks in the eight games since this time , mcnabb will have a reliable safety valve available in running back brian westbrook he missed the first game , but he still has accounted for 37 percent of the eagles total yards this season
should andy reid have called for a punt late in the fourth quarter with the eagles trailing by 3 points \? the eagles never got the ball back and perhaps they should have foreseen that because deuce mcallister had been having his way with them the eagles were on their 39 and had two timeouts remaining it was a curious move by reid because the eagles had gone for it on fourthand10 a play earlier , and only a false start had prevented a first down jeff garcia , on a charmed run as donovan mcnabb s replacement at quarterback , had been continuing to create plays when none seemed apparent but with 1 56 left , reid suddenly took the ball out of his hands it s easy to say , in retrospect , but reid effectively took the eagles out of the game philadelphia has been in great hands with reid in the regular season , with five division titles and six playoff appearances in eight seasons , but the playoff disappointments are piling up what do eagles fans and readers think of reid s lategame tactics \? scheduling note join us for live playbyplay commentary of chicagoseattle \( 1 pm eastern \) and new englandsan diego \( 4 30 pm \) later today
council bluffs , iowa , july 3 dell collins teaches an adult sunday school class at his evangelical church in central iowa , and he recently took his students through a series of lessons on the book of james and its repeated exhortations to put faith into action but mr collins is grappling with just how to apply his beliefs when it comes to picking a favorite from field in which the leading contenders each face serious obstacles to winning over christian conservatives do you go with your heart or with your head \? he said my first choice is with my heart , but you also have to be realistic unlike in the 2000 presidential campaign , when george w bush was able to overcome early doubts among religious conservatives by speaking the language of personal faith , the three most prominent republican candidates , , senator and , are continuing to have difficulty winning over this crucial constituency in the republican base the calculus at this point for social conservative voters , who represent more than 60 percent of republican caucus goers here in iowa , is replete with tradeoffs over who best adheres to their values and who is ultimately electable next year interviews with more than 40 evangelicals recently across iowa at campaign events , churches and over the telephone found that many feared mr giuliani might win the nomination even though he supported rights but they are wrestling with whether mr romney s recent conversion to opposing abortion is genuine , and they wonder how much to trust mr mccain , who has harshly criticized the religious right in the past you want to support a candidate that has your values , but you also need to support somebody who has the ability to win , said nancy hedegaard , who volunteers as a bookkeeper at her lutheran church and attended a house party here for mr romney on monday the question is , are they going to be the same person \? ' partly because of their qualms about the candidates already in the race , some evangelicals are hoping that they might find a better match in a republican who has yet to formally announce his candidacy , former senator fred d thompson of tennessee but for now many christian conservatives interviewed , at least here in iowa , appear to have settled tentatively on mr romney , the former massachusetts governor , who has been advertising and campaigning aggressively in the state and has been leading in recent polls robin nichols , 49 , a mother of two who attends a baptist church in ames , disagrees theologically with mr romney s mormon faith but she said it would not stop her from voting for him because she believed he was the most conservative of the top three candidates his religion actually bolsters his credibility in her mind , ms nichols said , as someone with strong family values his wholesome family image he and his wife are high school sweethearts , with 5 children and 10 grandchildren also helps reinforce that impression i felt like morally and ethically , because of his mormon values , that he would be trustworthy , she said but she began to question her allegiance saturday , after listening to mr romney speak at a republican candidate forum in des moines sponsored by the iowa christian alliance and iowans for tax relief there , mr romney said he opposed federal financing for embryonic stem cell research but would not outlaw it the response confused mrs nichols that really bothered me , she said at that point , i questioned , had he really changed his viewpoint , or was he just trying to appeal to the conservative vote \? mr romney s mormonism clearly continues to trouble some evangelicals i like his stand on families , i really do , said mary van steenis , a teacher at a christian school from pella , iowa but if he s going to put the leader of the mormons before his god there s a problem norm pawlewski , 73 , a retired iowa state official and parttime christian lobbyist , said he quickly crossed mr romney off his list too many flipflops mr giuliani s candidacy was similarly a nonstarter with him , he said , because of the former new york city mayor s support for abortion rights abortion is still number one with me and every social conservative i know , mr pawlewski said but michael canady , a board member for the iowa christian alliance , said he was at least open to voting for mr giuliani , arguing his strong stance on terrorism could trump other concerns he s definitely more liberal on the social issues than most evangelicals like , he said , but he added that he considered mr giuliani a leader and somebody who could be strong on defense with many christian conservatives intent on preventing a democrat from being elected , perhaps the biggest quandary for many is whether electability should be paramount , or whether to stick to a candidate who most shares their faith and worldview in an informal survey taken by this reporter at an adult sunday school class of about 30 students at first assembly of god in des moines , former gov mike huckabee of arkansas , a former baptist minister , finished ahead of mr romney , eight to five , with none of the other candidates getting more than one or two votes but the largest segment of the class , nine students in all , said they remained undecided the bible says to be as innocent as doves and as sly as serpents , said john phillips , 48 , a member of the class you have to weigh things with your intellect but put it through the filter of your faith that s what i'm trying to do right now most of the 40 evangelicals interviewed for this article , however , said they were not interested in throwing away their vote , saying mr giuliani would be preferable to any democrat mr pawlewski professed to being tempted to back one of the secondtier candidates , but , in 2000 , he supported alan keyes , a firebrand from the right who secured a surprising 14 percent of the vote in the iowa caucus , only to see his campaign sputter afterward mr pawlewski said he vowed to never again pour himself into a longshot campaign , and is now volunteering for mr mccain if you look at his record as a senator , he s pretty conservative , he said he s always been on the conservative side fiscally and on a number of issues he s been conservative socially but many remain deeply skeptical of mr mccain because they view him as too much of a maverick his support of the recent bill is also unpopular among republicans here , who saw the legislation as amnesty for illegal immigrants the search for that elusive combination of conservative bona fides and electability has fueled a yearning among some for mr thompson to enter the race fred thompson has a 100 percent voting record with the national right to life committee said tim morgan , 51 , a jewelry store owner who is active in his methodist church in newton , iowa , and ran unsuccessfully for state senate last year for me , that s a badge of honor mr morgan said he also liked mr thompson s consistency in voting in favor of traditional marriage and that he appears to be a candidate that can raise the money , get the votes and win the nomination most interviewed here in iowa , however , said they knew little about mr thompson , aside from his acting in law and order others predicted his record , including his role in the passage of the mccainfeingold campaign finance bill , which he has since disavowed , would pose its own dilemmas for conservatives i think there may be a certain fascination with him simply because of his name recognition , said tamara scott , iowa state director of concerned women for america , a conservative christian group but it seems to fade quickly when people begin to analyze his political viewpoint and find it s not so enchanting after all for many christian conservatives , following their true convictions means bucking the conventional wisdom and turning to one of the lesserknowns in the field , such as mr huckabee or senator sam brownback , a leading social conservative from kansas , or even representative tom tancredo of colorado , who has made illegal immigration his signature issue many of those interviewed said mr huckabee s past life in christian ministry lent him immediate credibility recent polls have shown mr huckabee running fourth in iowa he drew an enthusiastic ovation at the recent candidate forum in des moines , attended by nearly a thousand conservatives , which mr giuliani and mr mccain did not attend ms nichols , who had been leaning toward mr romney , came away from the forum impressed by mr huckabee but remained unsure of his chances the iowa straw poll , an early test for the republican field , is fast approaching in august i'm sitting on the fence , she said i have to make a decision
to the editor re how the good war' in afghanistan went bad \( front page , aug 12 \) i'm sure there are many reasons the afghan war went sour but much of the blame must lie with a bush administration that from the start treated afghanistan as merely the warmup exercise for the war it really wanted , in iraq the rubble of the world trade center was still settling when donald h rumsfeld issued the administration s intelligence analysts their marching orders find a way to tie saddam hussein to the attacks , no matter what things related and not they had to lash together to do so that set the tone then the administration charged into afghanistan , ostensibly in hot pursuit of osama bin laden , and allowed the terror mastermind to get away , despite having supposedly had him cornered at tora bora and finally , when war with iraq came in response to the war resolution congress let itself be slickered into passing , the administration sucked resources away from the afghan conflict to smash saddam hussein and then to hold down the lid on the bubbling cauldron of violence mr bush s invasion had created there four years later , we 're still holding down the lid in iraq , and the taliban are staging a comeback in afghanistan my question is why should anyone be surprised \? eric b lipps staten island , aug 12 , 2007  to the editor that so many countries joined the united states in the war against afghanistan shows that it was viewed as the only way to liberate the afghan people from the oppressive yoke of the taliban government as usual , the united states was the lead player , but it is responsible for the major blunder committed when , after the initial victory , european allies sought desperately to shore up security beyond kabul by sending troops to outlying provinces the ever omniscient and triumphalist united states administration refused , saying securing kabul was enough as the taliban had been routed afghanistan is a country of many ethnic peoples , with frequent prevalence of pashtoons in central government it is also a country where ethnic groups and communities jealously guard their local autonomy common lore was that when the tax collector came from kabul to the provinces , he was often shot at ! the united states decision not to secure provinces beyond kabul , particularly in kandahar to the south and helmand to the west , where pashtoons dominate , is puzzling the united states had poured millions there in the 1960s and 1970s for development projects , including the famous helmand valley agricultural project this seems to be another case of the ideologues trumping the lessons of history or was it the distraction of iraq \? either way , the price in terms of economic and physical security is borne by poor afghans oh for the days when this beautiful country used to be a haven for tourists ! sri ram aiyer chevy chase , md , aug 13 , 2007  to the editor a reasonable question for all citizens to ask congress and the bush administration is how could the expenditure of billions over four years result in such poor results \? so far , the electorate should have no confidence that those who seek the presidency have learned from the mistakes made by congress in agreeing to fight terrorism through war although the candidates of both major parties correctly fault the bush administration for its obvious ineptitude , none of the leading candidates have made it clear that continuing to fight terrorism in this way has the great probability of increasing our vulnerability , as well as continuing to erode our constitutional rights thomas m stephens columbus , ohio , aug 13 , 2007
wrapping up his campaign for changes to the constitution before tens of thousands of supporters in caracas , president delivered a speech threatening the moneyed elite , investors from spain , foreign correspondents , the united states and pitiyanquis , a term loosely translated as yankee lovers he also ordered soldiers to occupy oil installations ahead of the referendum tomorrow , threatening to cut off oil exports to the united states in the event of american interference who votes yes is for ch vez , he said who votes no is voting for george w bush mr ch vez devoted almost none of his speech to the 69 amendments in the vote , which would centralize power in the president s hands and abolish his term limits he said he could see himself ruling until 2050 , when he would turn 96 the tensions led the united states to break its silence we are concerned that people would not be able to have the free and fair elections that they deserve , said , the white house spokeswoman
there were times in s ownership of the when he would not allow his general manager to attend the annual meetings of major league general managers other teams , steinbrenner was convinced , wanted to steal the ideas that made the yankees so successful , and he was n't going to let that happen if the general manager was n't there , the thieves would have nothing to steal about 16 months ago , the yankees' brain trust met in tampa , fla steinbrenner and the team executives steve swindal , randy levine , lonn trost and discussed the organization and its structure it was an appropriate time for that discussion because cashman s contract as general manager was expiring cashman , whose eightyear tenure was already longer than that of any of his predecessors in the steinbrenner regime , was n't happy with the organizational structure , and neither were some of the others at the meeting steinbrenner had allowed a twoheaded monster to grow and infect the operation , with the tampa faction often exerting greater influence on organizational decisions than the yankee stadium crew the general manager s opinion was often undermined by the tampa troops the view that prevailed at the meeting , though , was that the yankees had to be more like other teams , with one person , the general manager , making decisions imagine that the general manager would be responsible for the operation of the team what a novel concept that is exactly what cashman wanted give me the authority , he told the others , and i 'll accept the responsibility cashman would make the final decisions , subject only to steinbrenner s approval on major expenditures with steinbrenner , accountability has always fallen on the general manager , but it has n't always been deserved now it will fall squarely on cashman more than ever , as he goes forward , in the second year of his threeyear contract , cashman will be responsible for whatever may go wrong i 'll take the results good or bad , cashman said , rather than look back and regret not doing it the way i wanted if the yankees' run of division titles ends at nine this year , cashman will most likely answer for it steinbrenner probably wo n't fire him , but a second season without a division title could be fatal he knows that , and he is prepared to accept the consequences , as long as he has the authority to do the job the way he thinks it should be done  cashman has already made two decisions on which the yankees' season could turn they open spring training this week manager joe torre will meet with reporters today the first workout is thursday without randy johnson , one of their best pitchers , and gary sheffield , one of their best hitters cashman had specific reasons for trading each player , but he had a common reason as well if you go back to last year , i said i'm interested in reducing payroll , cashman said last week i wanted to get more flexible and younger , yet maintain a championship team on a regular basis last year we reduced payroll for the first time in i do n't know how many years from 1995 , when the payroll was 40 million , through 2005 , when it was 200 million , the yankees' payroll rose every year for 10 years last year it dropped to 195 million this year it will be lower still it s lower , cashman said , and we 're younger youth is something that never impressed steinbrenner the only value young players had for him was as trade fodder but when he was suspended in the early 1990s , his designated general manager , gene michael , began changing the culture bernie williams , mariano rivera , andy pettitte , derek jeter and jorge posada remained in the organization , developed and formed the nucleus of the championship teams of the last decade now cashman will try to develop the next championship nucleus we want to contend but also put ourselves in better position to contend for years to come , he said you have to do it very carefully it s a balancing act hopefully , it s no more than taking a small step back and taking two giant steps forward i 've lost significant players in these transactions but i go in with my eyes wide open understanding that but i believe in what i'm doing cashman was alluding to the moves he made this offseason , trading sheffield , johnson and jaret wright for young players and holding on to his own young players walt jocketty , the st louis general manager , said in talking with brian cashman over the winter , i found that he s in that situation where he does n't want to give up quality young players that s what everybody looks for younger players in his three trades , cashman acquired eight players , only one of whom has extensive major league experience none of us are interested in giving away any of our good young players , cashman said to lump the yankees with everyone else is unusual for a yankees executive but another development at the meeting in october 2005 may be even more startling the yankees' brain trust decided that having all highly paid superstars and no young players was not the way to win we do n't need a 200 million payroll to win , they told themselves they came to that conclusion even though the team s revenue had taken off money is not an issue with the yankees , but they do n't have to spend it just because they have it and when they do spend it , spend it wisely if you get the idea that someone besides steinbrenner was exerting influence , you 're right
rendezvous , a mildmannered musical revue with a gallic theme , suggests an equestrian parade in which famous old racehorses mounted by riders in fancy dress make their stately way down the champs lys es although the noble animals have marquee names like jacques brel , and , none of them are permitted to break into a gallop the middleaged riders sitting tall in the saddle are agreeable enough , but lack the frantic competitive drive of actual jockeys once the procession winds to a halt , formal portraits will be taken for a museum exhibition on the glory that was once french popular music , which in the show s misguided view of cultural history , died a slow death in the 1970s the revue , which slipped into feinstein s at the regency on tuesday for a fivenight run , is a bland fabrication that purports to explore the frenchamerican connection in popular music accompanied by bass and drums , its four singers philip anderson , brenda bush , katie geissinger and gregory purnhagen act as polite tour guides to the past although all have polished theatrical voices , you will detect only distant traces of piaf s savagery , brel s passion and mr aznavour s worldly sadness in these sedate performances as the musicians go through their mechanical motions , no hard information is conveyed about french pop music or about its american admirers , like cole porter and stephen sondheim the show relies on familiarity brel s carousel and if we only have love , piaf signatures la vie en rose and non , je ne regrette rien , and mr aznavour s yesterday when i was young they 're all here by the end of the revue , you might think these old nags have so little life left in them that they are ready for the glue factory do n't believe it
rickey henderson blew into camp this morning for his annual spring tour this year s focus , as it was last year , is teaching the mets to run like him over 25 seasons , henderson stole 1 , 406 bases , including a mindboggling 130 in 1982 to me , that record is as untouchable as dimaggio s 56game hitting streak or ripken s 2 , 632 consecutive games , although henderson said that jose reyes would be the only player he could envision challenging his marks the chances of that happening are between slim and none , and slim just left town reyes s careerhigh is 64 henderson matched or exceeded that figure 10 times reyes , 23 , has 129 career steals , and if he were to play until he s 40 , he would have to average more than 75 stolen bases a season to overtake henderson in other , less shocking news , henderson said that , after a fourseason hiatus , he intends to officially announce his retirement this year he last played in 2003 , making him eligible for the hall of fame in 2009 that is one speech i don t want to miss
joyce didonato is the kind of singer doomed to be described with adjectives like perky or feisty she is blond , attractive , american and cute this is perhaps unfortunate , since none of these things have much to do with her best qualities as an artist qualities that were displayed , intermittently but abundantly , at her carnegie hall recital debut at weill hall on thursday night take , instead , her voice firm and radiant , digging into sultry lower notes , caressing the middle , shining forth with a clear top , and yet presented matteroffactly , in the service of the music modulating , inflecting rather than as an end in itself it seemed particularly to shine in rossini thursday s program included the cantata giovanna d'arco , written for piano performance in the composer s drawing room by his wife , and it brought out the best in ms didonato , showcasing a lower register she had been shyer about emphasizing in the opening \( and elegant \) set of bizet songs and rising up to golden heights her fast passage work was rapidfire but slightly swallowed , creating the effect of a dotted line rather than a straight , unbroken one , but getting no less effectively from point a to point b \( although her accompanist , julius drake , seemed to run into the pianistic equivalent of tonguetwisters , notes that seem simple but trip up elocution when sped up \) the main thrust of the program , however , was not rossini but spain the focus of her cd pasi n ! , released last month after the intermission the piano lid came up , and ms didonato s top the wrap around her shoulders came down , and she plunged into songs by granados , de falla \( the seven spanish popular songs , a recital staple \) and montsalvatge interestingly , this was not the strongest part of the program the plunging was a little too violent , the voice slightly less focused the de falla , which might seem tailormade for a mezzo with spark , was a touch wild montsalvatge s lovely cuba dentro de un piano calmed things down , but there were traces of tiredness in the voice by the end of canto negro it took rossini to bring her back in her first two encores first she gave a fine rendering of the canzonetta spagnuola , starting so slowly that the song was unrecognizable , and heating up to darting fire then she marshaled her forces for non pi mesta , the closing aria of rossini s cenerentola \( which she had just performed in houston \) , and delivered the goods once again ms didonato is about to sing rosina in the metropolitan opera s barber of seville , and you would do well to buy tickets soon but the term rossini singer , however well it fits her , usually evokes a small , light , little voice again , the description does n't do her justice

for one night at least , the cool kids took over the joyce soho some of the most interesting artists in contemporary dance could be spotted in attendance at the normally sleepy theater , which kickstarted its effort to revitalize itself by presenting the american premiere of jeremy wade s and pulled out their hair mr wade decamped to berlin last year , generating a spike in the constant , anxious chatter over new york s impoverished independent dance scene but the geographic shift makes sense artistically for mr wade , who , like many german artists before him , has cultivated an extreme physical grotesquerie , building on clenched muscles , stuttering steps that seem to unfold via time lapse , and moaning , guttural utterances his mouth stretched wide , his dark eyes stretched wider , mr wade \( none of his dancers have yet fully grasped his style \) is always the man about to turn werewolf he is both abject and sinister he frightens the expressionist artist otto dix , the poet hans magnus enzensberger these men might have gone down a similar corporeal path , had they been choreographers they might , indeed , have passed mr wade fairly quickly it s still early days glory fiction , his first eveninglength work , opened in february 2006 but , having settled on a distinctive movement language , he has not yet been able to make it say very much of distinction so it went with and pulled out their hair , a quintet that seemed longer than its actual 60 minutes dressed variously in white buttonup shirts and black pants , trouser shorts and skirts , and flooded in fabian bleisch s shifting lighting patterns , three men and two women devolved from twitches to paroxysms , then kept unraveling some more you could easily bat this away as flailing , but the skill needed to sustain such muscular spasms is no small thing \( virtuosity does not reside simply in making beautiful feats look easy \) still , there s only so much id you can take before it seems more a shtick than , as the flier put it , a grotesque organism and an emotional sculpture the more the dancers screamed and gesticulated and desperately but impotently pawed at one another , the more raucous and assaultive adam linson s sound design grew , the less urgent and important the whole event seemed so what if they pulled out their hair \? hair grows back it s what s under the scalp that mr wade has yet to really probe
washington , jan 19 of all the new rules passed in congress s recent ethics overhauls , the most sweeping is a barely debated provision in a senate bill passed thursday night that could alter one of the most timehonored campaign fundraising practices in washington rushing to complete its promised reform bill , the senate adopted a measure that , for the first time , would require registered lobbyists to disclose not only the limited money they can donate to candidates personally but also the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars they raise from clients and friends and deliver as sheaves of checks a tradition known as bundling if signed into law , the measure could expose a potent tool that lobbyists use to gain access on capitol hill and even at the white house although currently invisible in campaign finance disclosures , bundling is a pillar of the modern campaign the ability to deliver an envelope of checks each one in compliance with the federal limit is one of the most valuable favors a lobbyist can provide a lawmaker bundling is also a major reason incumbents so easily outraise their challengers and so rarely lose their seats there are a host of uncertainties about the measure , including whether the house will agree to it in addition , it is not clear whether lawmakers will shy from using lobbyists to collect money for their campaigns just because the extent of their reliance on lobbyists and the special interests they represent will be made more visible still , the measure is causing ripples as interested parties learn details of what the senate did it is the most significant provision in the bill , said marc elias , a campaign finance lawyer who represents numerous senators they have essentially created a new campaign finance regulatory structure since campaign finance laws cap individual contributions at 2 , 100 per election , or 4 , 200 for both a primary and a general election , lobbyists who can gather and bundle checks from scores of friends and clients stand out on a campaign team , sometimes earning hero status in a tight race by the nature of what we do , you have to have people helping you to gather contributions , said senator , a louisiana democrat who voted along with 95 others in favor of the ethics bill otherwise you are raising 10 million or 20 million , 100 at a time and lobbyists , who earn their own income selling influence with the white house or congress , have the most incentive to spend time holding fundraisers or making calls to gather checks it is the capacity for fundraising that gives lobbyists their power , said meredith mcgeehee , policy director of the campaign legal center it is the currency of power in washington as the money spent on presidential campaigns has swollen , candidates have formalized their networks of bundlers like a network marketing business president bush s 2004 reelection campaign , for example , rewarded its fundraisers with names like pioneers , each of whom bundled at least 100 , 000 , or rangers , who bundled at least 200 , 000 apiece of the campaign s more than 500 bundlers , public citizen , the ethics advocacy group , identified more than 60 prominent lobbyists members of congress , however , usually prefer not to call attention to their connections on k street , where many lobbyists have offices some lawmakers have especially close ties to just a few lobbyists who play a big role in their fundraising , and calling attention to those relationships could focus new scrutiny on their votes given the reliance of many lawmakers on lobbyists as fundraisers , the idea of requiring them to disclose their roles usually meets stiff resistance on capitol hill all of it behind the scenes and almost none of it in public house passage is far from assured , and its adoption by the senate by a rollcall vote of 96 to 2 followed some backroom resistance among senators in both parties to allowing the idea to come up for a vote at all the republicans who controlled the senate last year refused to let it come up and on jan 12 , before the details of the proposal had been disclosed , senator , the new york democrat in charge of his party s fundraising as head of the senatorial campaign committee , used a runin on the senate floor to deliver an angry rebuke to the disclosure idea s lead sponsor , , democrat of illinois , several people present or briefed on the confrontation said in a subsequent conversation , mr schumer said he worried that the proposal could cramp fundraising by placing an undue burden on potential bundlers , said aides who were briefed and a lawmaker familiar with their talk , speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the nature of the talks senator obama has not been the most popular person in our caucus in the last couple of weeks , said a democratic aide involved in deliberations over the bill mr obama also this week started a bid for his party s presidential nomination eric schultz , a spokesman for mr schumer , said the senator quickly supported the bill when he understood it would apply only to lobbyists registered lobbyists , of course , are not the only ones who seek to influence legislation , and the senate measure would not affect other interested parties as often happens when bills are on the floor , rumors swirl about what amendments contain or do n't contain and that s what happened here , mr schultz said but as soon as senator schumer saw the language and what was included , he supported it and in fact urged the senate democratic leadership to accept it a spokesman for mr obama said the senator was pleased that the democratic leaders made the legislation a priority but he would not comment on private discussions within the party in the house , republicans quietly deleted a similar proposal , after it had passed in committee , before it could come to a floor vote but on friday , the proposal s previous sponsor , representative chris van hollen of maryland , now chairman of the house democrats' reelection committee , and representative martin t meehan , democrat of massachusetts , sent a letter to colleagues announcing plans to reintroduce it hopefully , requiring disclosure will begin to break the nexus between lawmaking and the efforts by lobbyists to enhance their influence by channeling money from special interests , mr van hollen said in an interview he said he saw no conflict with his new role as the house democrats' chief fundraiser it may make some kinds of fundraising more difficult , but it will play at least as much on the republican side as the democratic side , he said from a political perspective , it is probably a wash the rules for bundling would require the approval of the house and the signature of the president many other elements of the senate ethics overhaul do not require house approval because they change only senate rules but none of the senate rules will take effect until a house and senate conference harmonizes their respective rule changes some lawmakers , however , acknowledged that anything addressing bundling was likely to face skepticism in both chambers i am sick and tired of fundraising , said senator bob casey , a newly elected pennsylvania democrat who voted for the ethics bill when you sit in a room for four hours making calls , it kind of has a deadening effect on you he added , wryly , anything that reduces the amount of time that you are spending fundraising is good for the country , and it is definitely good for me
cliff floyd could rattle off a list of 100 reasons why he signed with his hometown in january , starting with more day games and more time with his family but an unanticipated benefit , floyd quickly learned , was that playing in the national league central afforded him more chances to face the st louis cardinals and specifically adam wainwright , who struck him out with a wicked curveball with two on and none out in the ninth inning of game 7 of last year s national league championship series it was floyd s final atbat as a met i must have replayed that pitch 1 , 000 times , floyd said but you know what \? he has n't thrown that pitch to me all season i 've been looking for it , but he has n't thrown it floyd returned to shea stadium last night , his first visit back after spending four injuryplagued seasons with the , and only his clubhouse had changed he still had the affable personality and quick wit that made him a favorite among fans and teammates here as he walked to the cubs' clubhouse before last night s game , he greeted a handful of security personnel by name and with a hearty hug or handshake he stopped to catch up with a few other familiar faces walking through the city today , you 'd be amazed at what people remember about when you played , floyd said i was n't like a superstar when i was here i just grinded it out and played hard , and these fans loved that it was a tremendous welcome back home while i was walking through the city but he knew his tenure with the mets ended in november , when they signed moises alou floyd said he was impressed that general manager omar minaya called him after signing alou and offered some advice on where he thought floyd could find a job once the cubs pursued him , floyd said , he did not have to think twice the cubs have a glut of outfielders , including alfonso soriano , whose shift to left field from center has cut into floyd s playing time floyd plays only against selected righthanded pitching before last night s game , he had 73 atbats and was hitting 274 with 2 home runs and 13 runs batted in floyd created a minor stir in spring training when he suggested that mets manager willie randolph seemed confused about whether to have floyd pinchhit or use someone else to bunt against wainwright with the tying run on first in game 7 he said yesterday that he should have phrased what he said differently never have i ever questioned a manager s decision out loud to anybody , said floyd , who added that he did not intend to speak about the subject with randolph i hope he knows that nothing i said disrespected him or called him out or implied that he made a bad managerial decision or anything like that randolph , who had little to say about the issue in spring training , said yesterday cliff means well , he means well we 'll leave it like that moises alou said that he expected to know tomorrow whether his strained left quadriceps would require a stay on the disabled list , but the decision will not be his alone alou did not test the muscle in drills yesterday unless he makes a speedy recovery , the mets are inclined to deactivate him and recall the lefthander jason vargas from class aaa new orleans to start thursday against the cubs you always want to be more conservative than aggressive with it , general manager omar minaya said of alou the mets have a capable backup in endy ch vez and are eager to see more of the rookie carlos g mez , who took pitcher mike pelfrey s place on the roster and had two hits in his major league debut sunday vargas was scratched from his start on sunday , suggesting that a promotion is imminent in seven starts for new orleans , vargas is 23 with a 530 earned run average reliever guillermo mota , serving a 50game suspension for violating baseball s performanceenhancing drugs policy , joined new orleans for tonight s game in las vegas as part of his 16day rehabilitation assignment barring rainouts , mota is eligible to return may 30 against san francisco
iowa city , july 6 the glass door slid open , and senator hustled onto the wood deck of bob and maggie elliott s house on dover street here throwing his hand in the air , mr biden offered a few paradelike waves and ran down the short staircase i'm one of the 800 people running for president this year , mr biden , democrat of delaware , said with a grin , introducing himself to a crowd on monday i 'll be very brief it s too beautiful of a night for me to talk too long nearly two hours later , mr biden continued to walk and talk his way across the elliotts' backyard he fielded so many questions methodically moving back and forth that he started to wear a path in the lush lawn more than 70 people remained they moved in closer and closer , forming a semicircle around mr biden as he articulated a list of challenges facing the nation unlike any other time in modern american history , mr biden said , the next president of the united states is going to be left with no margin for error none the next president of the united states of america literally has an opportunity to change the world this is not hyperbole most candidates are searching for ways to distance themselves from washington not mr biden he is among the few who openly embrace time in the senate he seldom forgets to remind his audiences that he was elected in 1972 , at age 29 , and has worked with seven presidents when mr biden arrives in town , it feels as if he has brought the senate along with him the one outfit that i know is the place that i work , he beamed the congress he does not dwell on his previous run for the presidency , in 1988 , telling voters just that he had not planned on running again this year , he survived the controversy over remarks he made in january , when he referred to senator barack obama of illinois as the first mainstream africanamerican who is articulate and bright and clean and a nicelooking guy but mr biden continues to lag in fundraising and in the polls he is seeking the presidency , he said , because he realizes that in the senate the likelihood of me being able to change things are small essentially , being a senator for 34 years is the definition of a misspent adulthood , mr biden said i want to live in the white house because i want to be involved in forming important decisions if such a statement sounded selfcentered , mr biden offered no apologies ambition is absolutely necessary , he said later when a voter asked repeatedly about his path to winning his party s nomination , mr biden sounded unsure , at least for a moment i must admit to you that i 've thought more about what i would do as president than how to get elected as president , he said in trying to ignite his candidacy , mr biden is trying to change some habits that accompany spending more than half a life as a senator when asked in an interview about his propensity to speak at great length , he responded with a brief foray into third person , saying yes , that s the thing biden has to get over i'm conscious of it i do n't always meet it , but i'm working on it he infuses his pitch with sharp criticisms of president bush , saying this week , this guy is brain dead but mr biden spends more time talking about his candidacy and his biography in an election in which foreign policy is a chief concern , he tries to make a case that he is particularly qualified to mend diplomatic relations i know most of the world leaders , he said not because i'm an important guy , but because i 've just come up with them at a second event here , mr biden stood outside a restaurant near the university of iowa when the crowd grew to more than 100 people after much of the audience broke up , mr biden kept talking , and a smaller semicircle formed he ended with an adage from delaware politics , saying , if you keep people standing for more than 15 minutes , you 've lost their vote the crowd laughed mr biden pressed on , saying i 'll answer any question i 'll be standing right over there the last plane left so i'm here
the nba made its first foray to las vegas last weekend , bringing in an estimated 85 , 000 fans and 906 million in nongaming revenue , and stirring hope that an nba team would settle there the nba revelers for allstar weekend were part of a crowd of 302 , 000 that was in town to celebrate the chinese new year , the merchandising magic show and presidents' day weekend there were 403 arrests made during the fourday weekend including two for shootings which was more than an average convention weekend , according to the las vegas metropolitan police department none of the arrests mostly for vicerelated activities and small crimes like trespassing and disorderly conduct involved nba players , the metro police public information officer , jose montoya , said nba commissioner said yesterday that the enormous volume of people , traffic jams and the isolated violence at the finale of the event would not affect a decision on whether an nba franchise could come to las vegas still , the nba would consider returning for another allstar game only if two major changes were made we would be wise to schedule our events perhaps out of harm s way out of other events where there is such a surge of people , stern said yesterday in a telephone interview the second change is one that las vegas officials have been planning and one they already knew the nba wanted they 'd have to have a new arena , stern said the 23yearold thomas mack center did not have the infrastructure to put on a largescale show or the seating capacity of a more modern arena the mayor of las vegas , oscar goodman , was arranging meetings with casino owners yesterday to prepare a compromise proposal on gambling for stern by march 20 they 're going to go for it i feel very confident , goodman said of the casino owners as for the arrests and misconduct , goodman said you can only be vigilant and prudent i do n't attribute that to las vegas joe maloof , an owner of the sacramento kings who also owns the palms casino resort , which housed the players last weekend , said that the hotel tripled security for the players we never had one incident at the palms , maloof said as for incidents elsewhere , he said , it s a little disappointing some of the things that happened , but that can happen anywhere the police yesterday were investigating the role that tennessee titans defensive back pacman jones had in one of the shootings at 5 am monday at the strip club minxx , where three people were injured the gunman was still at large the other shooting occurred at 4 am monday in a parking garage at the mgm grand hotel and casino , which served as the headquarters for the news media covering the allstar game one man was shot in the hip , but he was not critically injured and did not press charges , according to the police of the 403 people arrested , 172 were of local origin , according to the public information officer , martin wright of the total arrests , 239 were for vicerelated activities , compared with about 175 on a normal threeday weekend , rather than the fourday weekend with the amount of people we had in the city that brings in more criminal element , that s just the reality of it , wright said the police presence is beefed up , and obviously there is a propensity for more arrests mark cuban , the dallas mavericks' owner , said he was displeased that the nba was receiving negative attention i have idiots emailing saying the nba is at blame for some incidents in vegas because we ca n't keep our players like pacman jones under control , he wrote in an email message have you ever been to vegas during a big fight weekend \? cuban wrote given the number of people who came , it was quiet he added that in a large city \( the metropolitan area is 19 million people \) incidents would happen what happened in ny this weekend \? cuban wrote should we move the knicks \? if something happens in la this weekend , should they move the oscars \? asked if he considered the weekend a success , cuban responded absolutely the customers and sponsors we brought had a blast stern said everything with respect to our guests was spectacular obviously , with the large number of people , some invited and uninvited , there will be activities that we cannot control

has been asked before on the campaign trail if his sons have served in the military , and he usually has dispatched the question easily enough but an awkward response last week in , in which mr romney said in part that one of the ways my sons are showing support for our nation is helping to get me elected , forced him several days later to say he misspoke and injected a discordant note into his otherwise triumphant few days after he won the state s republican straw poll it has also threatened to put a chink in what has been widely viewed as a major asset in his bid for the republican presidential nomination his crowded family portrait , which includes five successful adult sons who have been a prominent part of his campaign the fact that none have served in the armed forces is a potentially sensitive point , given how badly stretched the nation s military has become with the conflict in iraq and the nearly unanimous support for the war on the part of the republican candidates an opponent of the war raised the issue again with mr romney last week at a forum in eastern iowa although his campaign said mr romney s remarks were taken out of context , his response to the pointed question drew potshots because of his mention of what his sons were doing in his campaign , including that his son josh had driven a winnebago to all of the state s 99 counties mr romney said later in an interview on fox news sunday that he had not meant to equate military service with his sons' campaign work to be fair , that part of his response came only after an extended series of comments in which he explained that the military was a volunteer army and that his sons had made different career choices some have questioned the fairness of impugning mr romney for his sons' choices it is also unclear why mr romney s children have drawn scrutiny and not those of others , like rudolph w giuliani , who has a son at duke university is it a fair question \? said stewart peay , the husband of mr romney s niece , who went to iraq with the utah national guard in the world of the allvolunteer army , i do n't know if it is or not but mr peay said that while in iraq he had wrestled with what difference it might have made if president bush and vice president dick cheney had family members in harm s way i think it s unfortunate sometimes that we do n't have a broader group of people in the military , he said , but that s a result of an allvolunteer military there was a time when military service was much more common for family members of those in public life president franklin d roosevelt s four sons all fought in world war ii all four sons of joseph p kennedy served in the military , including his eldest , joseph jr , who was killed in world war ii , and his second son , john f kennedy , who was wounded and later went on to become president politicians should try to envision whether they believe in a war enough that they would send their own children , said nancy lessin , cofounder of military families speak out , an antiwar group made up of more than 3 , 600 military families if this war is so important , why is it ok for you to support our loved ones fighting it but not send your own sons \? said ms lessin , whose stepson joined the marines after college and went to iraq the fact that mr romney s sons have not served is not necessarily surprising , she said , because the military tends to be dominated by those from less welltodo backgrounds there is the economic , or the opportunity , draft , ms lessin said of others seeking the presidency , representative duncan hunter , republican of california , talks often on the stump about his son , duncan jr , who served two tours in iraq with the marines and is on his third in afghanistan i think it s valuable to have a commander in chief who can look the american people in the eye and say , we 're all in this together , ' said mr hunter , who is a vietnam veteran senator john mccain , a former prisoner of war in vietnam , by contrast , goes out of his way to avoid talking publicly about his son jimmy , a marine who was recently deployed to iraq mr mccain has another son , jack , who is at the united states naval academy shortly before leaving for iraq , jimmy mccain spent a few days last month on the campaign trail in new hampshire with his father he stayed in the background at events , even when mr mccain gave a big speech laying out his reasons for continuing to support the current strategy in iraq the one time jimmy mccain s name came up was at the last stop of the trip there , at american legion post 29 in claremont , nh , one of the veterans who gathered for a public forum drew a big round of applause for praising jimmy mccain s service apparently unbeknown to the questioner , mr mccain s son was sitting just a few seats away but mr mccain did not introduce him to the crowd fair or not , it is likely that the issue will continue to dog mr romney he got the question again later in the week at the iowa state fair , this time from a man holding a photograph of his son in a soldier s uniform none of your sons are in the military \? the man asked mr romney said they were not are they going to go over to iraq \? the man asked no , they are not , mr romney said who is going to do his job \? the man said we have a volunteer army , mr romney said that s the reason
if there s one issue on which republican presidential hopefuls should feel vulnerable , it s taxes the bush tax cuts , more than any other policy , are crippling the government financially from 2002 to 2011 , forgone revenue from the cuts will account for 37 percent of the federal budget s descent into the red , according to the congressional budget office war and defense spending come next , producing 30 percent of the deterioration , followed by domestic spending at 11 percent with revenue falling short year after year , federal borrowing from the public has mushroomed since 2001 , by 53 percent , to 51 trillion , compared with a 2 percent increase during the clinton years american taxpayers must repay the borrowed money with interest , which means fewer federal dollars to spend on everything else for decades to come , including health care , infrastructure repair , emergency response , chemical plant security and alternative energy and yet , each of the republican primary candidates act as though president bush s record on taxes has been a smashing success and prominently and proudly tout their tax policies which boil down to a call for ever lower taxes , primarily through extending all of those same bush tax cuts beyond their scheduled expiration at the end of 2010 for democratic candidates , in contrast , taxation is the issue that dare not speak its name with the exception of john edwards , none of the democratic candidates list taxes under issues on their official web sites hillary clinton buries various tax proposals in a category labeled strengthening the middle class , while most of barack obama s tax ideas are under fighting poverty even the alsorunning candidates subsume tax issues under broad , bland headings a charitable explanation for the democrats' reticence is that not much of substance separates them on the issue of taxes the frontrunners , mrs clinton , mr edwards and mr obama , all pledge to end the bush tax cuts for the richest americans generally defined as people making upwards of 200 , 000 or so all three would keep the estate tax , but with multimilliondollar exemptions to ensure that only the wealthiest americans pay it they 're also in general agreement on using the tax code to funnel more money to lowerincome americans by expanding the childcare credit , for example , or boosting the earned income credit for lowincome workers or introducing new tax breaks to defray the cost of college or make it easier to save for retirement all of that is laudable , especially when the candidates say they would target tax breaks based on fairness and need , both of which have been largely ignored in bush tax policy but with the nation in dire financial straits , serious tax talk circa 2007 has to do more than serve as a way to show a candidate cares about those who are struggling to make a living which brings us to the less charitable , and more likely , explanation for the democrats' aversion to talking candidly about taxes they do n't want to level with the american people , for fear of being felled by a barrage of antitax rhetoric from republican opponents \( we ca n't imagine that any democrat has forgotten how walter mondale tried being honest about taxes in 1984 and ended up winning only his home state and washington , dc \) the democrats are not as pie in the sky as the republicans ending the bush tax cuts for the rich would raise about 1 trillion in revenue over 10 years extending all the tax cuts and piling even more on top of them , as some republicans propose , would only dig the budget hole deeper still , going forward , competent governance , let alone achieving great things , will require more revenue , period the expiration of the bush tax cuts at the end of 2010 could be a moment of opportunity  to recast the tax system so that it raises needed revenue with the burden distributed progressively throughout the income scale  to create a system that does not disproportionately favor investment income over income from work  to consider new taxes that both raise revenue and distribute the overall burden even wider , including valueadded taxes that have worked well in europe tax reform cannot be achieved piecemeal , and it will not be achieved as long as the debate is polarized , as it is now , between those who say that governing is possible without adequate tax revenue , and those who seem too cowed by fear of the tax and spend label to call for dramatic change worse , the lack of serious tax debate opens the door to offthewall ideas , like the republican candidate mike huckabee s proposal to replace the income tax with a hefty national sales tax it will be like waving a magic wand releasing us from pain and unfairness , he said in new hampshire recently it would also be easily evaded and incapable of raising adequate sums unless set prohibitively high fred thompson proposes to let taxpayers choose to pay a flat income tax , without writeoffs that might make things easier on tax filing day but it would make every other day more difficult , as the exorbitant cost of the flat tax would likely be paid by cutting medicare , social security and other bedrock government services more difficult than tax reform itself may be the search for a candidate with the political courage to speak frankly to the american people about the nation s budget problems and the leadership skills to solve them
the new york police department has generally had the public on its side when it comes to securing the city since the sept 11 attacks for their part , new yorkers seem perfectly willing to put up with inconveniences , including traffic stops and bag searches but the police have more and more overstepped by routinely and indiscriminately videotaping demonstrations of every kind , even peaceful ones a federal judge was right this week to order the police to curb this conduct the practical effect of the order is to compel lawenforcement officers to obey guidelines that require them to state a reason to suspect unlawful activity before they videotape demonstrators they must also get department authorization that s a modest requirement the city contends the current practice is not strictly unconstitutional , but the prospect of being photographed by police while merely protesting can have a chilling effect on free speech the city agreed in 1985 to abide by guidelines for police tactics as part of a settlement of a lawsuit by vietnamera political activists four years ago , after the 9 11 attacks , a judge agreed to give the police greater powers to investigate political groups unfortunately , the cops ignored the part about having a rationale for video surveillance this week , the same federal judge , charles haight jr , rebuked the city for that failure he said it was fine for the police to videotape the hundreds of bike riders who take to the streets on the last friday of every month as an environmental protest , because the riders have a history of traffic violations but taping a peaceful demonstration by activists for the homeless in front of mayor michael bloomberg s home , as was done in 2005 , was pointless because the group posed no security threat judge haight s lyrical opinion alluded to longfellow , greek mythology and even the new yorker we hope none of it goes over the heads of the city government , which should now move quickly to ensure the court , and the public , that it will protect new yorkers' civil liberties
remembers sitting on his couch , watching his children play he had no energy in his tired body to join them , and his mind would stray to hockey he was home , resting with his family between games and practices , but not really there at all now , leetch makes lunch for his 6yearold son , jack , and takes him to school he gets down on the floor to play with all three of his children he plans activities for his family , and some days , the only skating he does is with jack on an outdoor rink in boston common it s been great , leetch said in a recent telephone interview from his home in boston i used to always be thinking about the game it s a big weight off my shoulders i get to enjoy being a dad this is semiretirement for leetch , a defenseman who spent the first 16plus seasons of his career with the he has decided not to play this season , so far , although at 38 he has not yet called it a career he and his wife , mary beth , have stayed in boston , where leetch played last season he said he still received calls from teams with offers to play , but none had felt quite right , including a possible return to the rangers as it is for many athletes , the decision to retire is difficult , fraught with issues of identity and with planning a future that is almost impossible to envision fortunately for leetch , he has three friends to lean on , adam graves and cherished teammates from the rangers who have already navigated this rough stretch of life richter was a goaltender who was forced to retire in 2003 after a series of concussions graves , a left wing , realized in 2003 that his battered body could not withstand another season and messier , a center , wrestled with the decision until 2005 , when at 44 he finally admitted he was done i do n't think there s ever a good way to say goodbye , to call it the end , messier said i 'd been playing hockey since i was 3 years old every memory i have is with the game when the time comes to say it s over , it s never easy messier , leetch , richter and graves shared so much in their days as rangers , including the unforgettable run to the 1994 stanley cup championship , and they continue to lean on one another they speak on the phone frequently , help with one another s charity efforts and even spend some vacations together with their families richter , graves and messier have already begun to build their second lives , which revolve around young families and new dreams as much as time flies by , it seems like yesterday when we get together , graves said it was special , the time we were together as strong as our bond was on the ice , it s probably stronger off the ice graves , 38 , has maintained the strongest tie to the rangers by working for them , as a special assistant for prospect development and community relations he lives in toronto with his wife , violet , and their three children as a member of the team s playerdevelopment staff , he helps at the team s postdraft camp and visits the players who are in the rangers' organization , helping them with what lies ahead it keeps him close to a game he still loves i'm a glassishalffull guy , graves said i still have the same passion i had back then it was just the right time for me i played a lot longer than i ever dreamed i would have and i had a lot of fun doing it graves also ran the in november , finishing in 4 hours 27 minutes 32 seconds , or about 30 minutes behind his wife , who is an avid runner richter has navigated his transition by enrolling at yale and working toward a degree in ethics , politics and economics he will finish either this year or next he works with yale s goalies as a volunteer assistant and also helps coach his 6yearold son s hockey team he and his wife , veronica , have two other sons , ages 4 and 2 being forced to retire left richter feeling as if he had been robbed of the end of his career but he said yale had given him structure , a goal and time to spend with his family he has not decided on his next career , he said , but he has invested time with the environmental group riverkeeper and is interested in nonprofit organizations and public policy you miss the things you could do physically when you were younger , but you have a perspective you did n't have , he said it s funny to be 40 years old and talking to career counselors i want to find something that i truly enjoy as much as hockey messier has remained the most visible of the four , befitting his role as the rangers' longtime captain and charismatic leader he uses his stature to help promote the nhl this season , he brokered a deal with coldfx , a company he endorses , to sponsor the mark messier leadership award , given monthly to an nhl player who exhibits leadership qualities on and off the ice he selects the winners he runs an annual leadership camp for adults , owns a hotel in the bahamas and plays fulltime dad to douglas , 3 , and jacqueline , 18 months he also spends time with his 19yearold son , lyon , who is from a previous relationship lyon is a defenseman for the texas tornado of the north american hockey league , an alevel league for junior players i am really lucky that i had a young family when i retired and that kind of filled my life up pretty quickly , messier said i always felt like there s an obligation to give back i help promote the game where i can messier envisions taking on a bigger role in the nhl soon he has thought about coaching but said he was probably more interested in becoming a general manager for mark , the game is such a passion for him , leetch said i knew he would n't stray far from the nhl he has n't missed a step at all for leetch , the transition from his years as a ranger has been difficult he was stunned when the team traded him to toronto on march 3 , 2004 , his 36th birthday , and acknowledged that he still harbored hard feelings he struggled with his return to madison square garden as an opposing player last season as a member of the bruins he said that he had discussions about returning to the rangers this season , but that he could not overcome his lingering bitterness about the way he left he said he still saw himself as a fulltime player and was concerned that teams would use him in a lesser role i do n't want to diminish what i did in my 16 years there , leetch said when leetch returned to the garden last season , his three closest hockey friends watched from a luxury box upstairs messier said it was painful , knowing how uncomfortable leetch was to be in that situation messier and graves had each returned to the garden as an opponent messier in the three seasons he played for vancouver between stints with the rangers , and graves in two seasons with the san jose sharks to finish his career richter remembered how hard it was even to step on the ice when the rangers retired his number in 2004 the three of them silently hoped that leetch would be back on a better occasion , that the rangers would sign him again and that he would end his career where it began i wanted him to be where his heart really is , messier said i hoped he could come back and play another two years , and finish his career with a sense of fulfillment the three retired friends know how difficult it is to end a career , no matter how it happens the years they spent as teammates are a hard act to follow life is less intense , less focused on one goal you 'd like a storybook ending , richter said but sometimes it does n't happen then you have to find a new career , and you hope it feeds your soul like the last one did and sometimes , when stuck in between , you spend a little time skating with your kids
two prominent muslim american organizations took steps yesterday to reverse what they called a justice department effort to smear the entire muslim community by naming some of its largest organizations as unindicted coconspirators in a terrorism trial the national association of muslim lawyers , which is not named , sent a letter to attorney general objecting to the list , which it said breached the department s own guidelines against releasing the names of unindicted coconspirators and did not serve any clear law enforcement purpose the letter , also signed by the national association of criminal defense lawyers , said the overreaching list of more than 300 organizations and individuals would further cripple charitable donations to muslim organizations and could ratchet up the discrimination faced by american muslims since the sept 11 attacks in addition , the council on americanislamic relations , or cair , which is on the list , announced that it would file a brief today asking judge a joe fish of the united states district court for the northern district of texas to remove its name and all others from the list the brief , a copy of which was released yesterday , says the list furthers a pattern of the demonization of all things muslim that has unrolled in the united states since 2001 most people do n't understand what an unindicted coconspirator is , said parvez ahmed , cair s board chairman , adding that the release of the list prompted death threats and hate mail against the council they think that being related to a terrorism case means we are terrorists the unindicted coconspirators were named in the case against the holy land foundation for relief and development , which opened july 16 the charity and five of its officers are accused of providing material support for terrorism by funneling millions of charitable dollars to the organization hamas the federal government ordered the foundation shuttered in december 2001 technically , the prosecution can introduce statements made by any individual or organization named as an unindicted coconspirator without such statements being dismissed as hearsay those on the list have not been charged with anything , but they are concerned that the label of unindicted coconspirator will forever taint them , particularly if the holy land group is convicted , and that they will have no legal recourse on july 13 , judge fish barred lawyers from discussing the case with reporters a justice department spokesman , bryan sierra , said the order prevented him from commenting about the list , as did the spokeswoman for the united states attorney in dallas , kathy colvin before the judge s order , however , the prosecution , while acknowledging that the list was unusually long , maintained that the names of the organizations would have come up in the trial anyway defense lawyers accused the justice department of using the list to create the aura of a vast conspiracy where none existed both the national association of muslim lawyers and cair said they were working in uncharted legal territory , as they had been unable to find firm legal precedents about how an unindicted coconspirator could be removed from such a list many organizations named are foreign , but among the most notable in the united states are the islamic society of north america , the largest muslim umbrella organization , and the north american islamic trust the islamic society said in a statement that it , too , was seeking a legal recourse , while the north american islamic trust did not respond to telephone calls seeking comment
the senior judge in durham , nc , said last night that he would file orders this morning to immediately suspend from office , the district attorney at the center of the lacrosse case also yesterday , duke university announced an agreement to head off any possible legal claims against the university by three former lacrosse players who were falsely accused of sexual assault by a woman hired to strip at a team party mr nifong was disbarred saturday and had promised to resign , but he told the governor he planned to stay in office four more weeks i will suspend him in the morning , judge orlando f hudson jr of superior court said in a telephone interview last night judge hudson said he would also authorize sheriff worth hill to enforce the order to the best of his ability that is , the judge said , if that means removal of mr nifong from the building , i think the sheriff can do that , or take away his parking pass or his key mr nifong did not answer his home phone last night , and his lawyer did not return calls judge hudson said a state law gave the senior judge in a county the power to remove a prosecutor if the judge believed there was probable cause in a petition for removal such a petition was filed earlier this year against mr nifong , but judge hudson delayed hearing it while the bar association ethics proceedings against the prosecutor were pending i watched the proceedings just like everybody else did , judge hudson said last night i felt that he should resign immediately the disbarment by a state panel takes effect 30 days after papers are filed mr nifong said friday that he would resign , and he sent a letter to gov michael f easley giving july 13 as his resignation date in a letter to judge hudson , he said , it is my fervent hope that this action will spare this community the further anguish that a removal hearing would entail and allow the healing process to move forward judge hudson said mr nifong would be suspended with pay meanwhile , the terms of the agreement reached by duke and the three lacrosse players were undisclosed under a confidentiality agreement duke had faced the possibility of lawsuits by the players , but none had been filed the university had been criticized for actions by the lacrosse coach and the dean of students , who told the 46 lacrosse team members to go to a police station to have their pictures taken and to provide dna samples without first advising them to talk to their parents and lawyers it has also come under criticism for statements by some faculty members who thanked protesters in the wake of the incident in march 2006 and statements by richard h brodhead , the duke president , initially viewed as insufficiently supportive of the three former players in more recent months , mr brodhead has been harshly critical of mr nifong , who pursued the case despite a lack of evidence the north carolina attorney general took the case from mr nifong in january and announced in april that the woman was not credible and that the former students david f evans , 24 , reade w seligmann , 21 , and collin finnerty , 20 were innocent in a statement monday , mr brodhead and the duke board of trustees said we welcomed their exoneration and deeply regret the difficult year they and their families have had to endure they conducted themselves with great dignity during their long ordeal john f burness , senior vice president for public affairs at duke , said the parties wanted to avoid the possibility of months and years of litigation we all agreed it s best to put it behind us , mr burness said in an interview a statement from the three men said the events of the last year tore the duke community apart , and forcibly separated us from the university we love it concluded , we hope that today s resolution will begin to bring the duke family back together again , and we look forward to working with the university to develop and implement initiatives that will prevent similar injustices and ensure that the lessons of the last year are never forgotten

on their way from the locker rooms at arthur ashe stadium to court 11 , players pass a ben jerry s stand , which makes perfect sense considering the court sits there like a scoop of ice cream packed into a small cup while off the beaten path of the united states open s show courts , court 11 yesterday served up one of the best treats , offering fans holding tickets for the day session matches featuring three grand slam runnersup there was marion bartoli of france , the runnerup to at wimbledon , who outlasted lucie safarova by 46 , 62 , 63 in a thirdround marathon that took 2 hours 5 minutes to complete i'm not scared even if i lose the first set , bartoli said afterward i know i could play three hours , four hours at the same level i could see she was really tired , she was slowing down and really starting to struggle out there and that gave me some confidence the beauty of court 11 is that what bartoli could see was also obvious to the fans , who sit close enough to feel as if they are viewing the action through a photographer s zoom lens from the third row of the bleachers rising behind the changeover chairs , it was possible to see the strain in safarova s face , especially in the waning games of the third set bartoli s eyes opened wide as a camera aperture before every hit , the intensity on her face standing in sharp contrast to her casual mien in the first row , fans were nearly close enough to reach out during a changeover and tuck in the label that was sticking out of the back of bartoli s black wraparound skirt the actor pierce brosnan , whose acquaintance bartoli said she had hoped to make during wimbledon , did not show up in flushing , either but she did not lack admirers the lines to get into the stands were snaking through the food court by the beginning of the third set , which was over in 41 minutes bartoli did not mind having to wait at least another round for her turn on center stage you can put me on practice court 16 and i will have the same energy , she said i just want to win after bartoli took her bows , she was followed on the court by elena dementieva of russia , who was a finalist at the united states open and the french open in 2004 her streak of deep runs at flushing was snapped by sybille bammer , 61 , 62 it was dementieva s earliest exit from the national tennis center grounds since 2002 , when she lost in the second round her futility on this day was seemingly telegraphed by her grunts , which from close range sounded like so many nuhuhs after losing the first set in 40 minutes and the first game of the second in quick order , somebody in the stands yelled loud enough for everybody to hear , go , elena take control serving it was too much to ask dementieva s serve failed her she won just 33 percent of the points off her second serve , compared with 65 percent for the 19thseeded bammer dementieva , the no 14 seed , gathered up her rackets and weaved her way through the food court , past the ice cream stand and the sushi bar on her way to the locker room david nalbandian , the runnerup at wimbledon in 2002 , closed out the day s schedule by sweeping xavier malisse off the court , 64 , 64 , 62 , in 1 50 once upon a time , nalbandian owned a 50 career record against the world no 1 , roger federer did he feel at all insulted to be playing on a court where the music and noise of arthur ashe stadium sounded as far off as a distant siren \? sometimes you have to play there , nalbandian said with an insouciant shrug he added it s small , it s tough more wind than in the show courts a little bit tougher , but that s fine none of the three grand slam runnerups sounded as if they would petition for court 11 to be renamed after rodney dangerfield any time soon my ranking s dropped , dementieva said , so i think that s normal she added , if you play well , you 're going to be in the center court one day that day is surely coming for no 10seed bartoli , whose next opponent is serena williams , the reigning australian open champion and a twotime united states open champion when i saw the draw , that was the one i wanted to play , bartoli said , referring to the fourthround match against williams i was really going to commit myself to be there i'm going to show everybody how hard i can be to beat
the rich and income taxes to the editor claims like mine that middleincome workers now pay a larger share of their incomes than people at or near the top do n't hold up under close examination , says n gregory mankiw in fair taxes \? depends on what you mean by fair \( economic view , july 15 \) his column relies on a study by the congressional budget office that finds the top 1 percent paying 311 percent of their income in federal taxes while the middle fifth pay 139 percent but three important things are not noted first , though the column acknowledges the existence of people like warren buffett , who by his own affirmation pays only 177 percent of his income in taxes , it attributes this to the fact that his earnings are largely from dividends and capital gains , taxed at 15 percent but is n't this also true for a large portion of the very wealthy \? second , the cbo analysis assumes that corporate taxes are borne by shareholders but shareholders do n't carry all the burden some is passed along to consumers in higher prices and some to employees in lower wages finally , the column does not figure in state and local taxes , notably sales taxes and taxes on cigarettes and alcohol , both of which eat up a far higher share of the incomes of middleclass and poor families robert b reich berkeley , calif , july 15 the writer , who was secretary of labor in the clinton administration , is a professor of public policy at the university of california , berkeley to the editor when looking at the percentage of income that the rich pay in taxes , remember that the numbers are averages , that plenty of rich people pay much less , and that the data are based on stated income and available deductions hedge fund managers , for example , can often defer declaring earnings as income , allowing them to earn compound interest on what an ordinary person would have to pay in taxes , until they 're ready to repatriate such funds similarly , those who are compensated with stock options can put off taking the money in addition , i doubt whether many people in the bottom 20 percent of income benefit from tax breaks like the deduction of mortgage interest or business travel that s combined with a vacation they also ca n't take a deeply discounted ride on the corporate jet or enjoy other perks available to the rich and superrich shaun breidbart pelham , ny , july 17 to the editor in his look at current tax rates , mr mankiw says none of these calculations , however , say whether the rich are paying their fair share fairness is not an economic concept if you want to talk fairness you have to leave the department of economics and head over to philosophy there s no question that philosophy is superior to the dismal science in solving human problems , but taxes are a political , not a philosophical , problem that s why democrats tax the rich and republicans repeal those taxes so what s new \? warner b huck hilton head island , sc , july 15 to the editor tax rates are n't a goal they are a means to an end taxes pay for what we , through our democratic processes , decide are our national priorities mr mankiw approvingly quotes president bush s principle that no one in america should have to pay more than a third of their income to the federal government but this formula has left the nation hopelessly in debt the only sensible discussion to have about tax rates is to decide what we want to achieve as a nation then we should adjust tax rates accordingly steven conn yellow springs , ohio , july 15 the writer is a professor of history at ohio state university drawing \( drawing by david g klein \)

these are strange days in the capital when the republicanled state senate called last week for spending more in next year s budget than did the democratic governor , eliot spitzer , or the democraticled state assembly , newspapers around the state marveled at what one called a political freaky friday and another termed bizarro world , a nod to the alternate , topsyturvy universe of superman and seinfeld fame that throughthelooking glass quality was only heightened when michael r long , the chairman of the state s conservative party , wrote a letter to governor spitzer in support of his budget , saying , as difficult as your budget is , what the republicancontrolled senate is proposing forces me to reevaluate your proposals senate republicans even held two long floor debates to get senate democrats to come out on record against more spending for health care and education all this has allowed governor spitzer who proposed a 1206 billion budget that would raise spending well above the rate of inflation , but who is calling for some politically difficult health care cuts to portray himself as the fiscal conservative so what does john faso , the former republican assemblyman who ran against mr spitzer last year as the fiscally conservative candidate , make of it all \? i think that i laid out last year the place where the republican party needs to be , he said we need reform , first of all we need fiscal responsibility and lower taxes i do n't think any of the budget proposals out there meet those criteria but i got just under 30 percent of the vote , said mr faso , who has returned to the practice of law i'm not sure new yorkers at this point really are focused on the fiscal condition of the state in the long term no one has yet repealed the business cycle , he said none of the decision makers seem to be considering what happens if the money spigot slows down that s my concern with the level of projected spending with all the parties' budgets
republican presidential candidates debate participants former new york mayor rudolph giuliani representative duncan hunter former arkansas governor mike huckabee senator john mccain representative ron paul former massachusetts governor mitt romney representative tom tancredo former tennessee senator fred thompson former ambassador alan keyes moderator carolyn washburn ms washburn we 're going to start with a discussion about the financial situation facing our country , which was the single biggest issue iowans of both parties wanted you to talk about i 'd like to ask everyone briefly to answer this question , and then we 're going to talk more specifically the comptroller general has said the us faces a tsunami of debt that is a great threat to our national security do you agree our country s financial situation creates a security risk \? and why or why not \? we 're going to just go down the line , starting with mayor giuliani and please limit your answers on this to 30 seconds mr giuliani i believe that it s a major problem , and it s one that has n't been addressed the way it should be over the course of the last seven , eight , maybe really 20 years and there are three major things that we have to do first , we have to reduce government spending , and we have to be very disciplined about that and we have to do it by imposing spending caps on the civilian agencies in governments 5 percent , 10 percent , maybe 15 percent we have to say that we 're not going to rehire half of the civilian employees that come up for retirement fortytwo percent are coming up over the course of the next eight to 10 years they should not be rehired that would give us a 20 billion , 22 billion reduction the other would even be higher and then we have to reduce taxes right now we should reduce the corporate tax we should reduce it from 35 percent to 25 percent it would be a major boost in revenues for the government most importantly , it would be a way of dealing with our fiscal policy in the same way that the fed is dealing with our monetary policy to create more liquidity and then there are other taxes we should get rid of we should get rid of death tax and a whole group of others , but the first one should be the corporate tax ms washburn okay yes or no i just want to be sure that i'm clear is the debt a threat to our national security \? mr giuliani i would say i would look at it ms washburn \( inaudible \) mr giuliani i would n't call it national security i would call it economic security it s very , very important i think ms washburn congressman \? mr giuliani islamic terrorism as being national security economic security is also very important rep hunter there are two debts that are a threat to the national security one is the budget deficit , which is going to be about 161 billion this year , but the real deficit , the real loss that we have right now that is a threat to national security is a trade loss the trade loss this year is going to be 800 billion it s going to be 200 billion to communist china , which is rapidly becoming our banker , and there s an old saying , you do n't want to have a banker who does n't have your best interests at heart we should level the playing field we should stop china from cheating on trade , bring back a lot of those highpaying manufacturing jobs to this country that we pushed offshore that means bigger paychecks that means more money going into the federal treasury and to social security and to medicare , eliminate those twin deficits , and we 'll be on the right track ms washburn thank you we do need to stay at 30 seconds this is not the time to get behind congressman \? rep paul it s absolutely a threat to our national security because we 've spent too much , we tax too much , we borrow too much , and we print too much when a country spends way beyond its means , eventually it will destroy the currency , and we 're in the midst of a currency crisis our dollar is going down rapidly as we speak it s because we have lived beyond our means we ca n't afford the foreign policy that we have we have to cut back we have to live within our means if we 're going to spend money , we ought to spend it at home , and that is why we have to change this foreign policy we ca n't afford it to do what we 're doing today because it will destroy our dollar ms washburn thank you rep tancredo the reason why it becomes a national security problem is because the bulk of our imbalance of trade is a result of our importation of oil from countries that are not our friends that s really where it rests most of the stuff that the rest of the stuff we bring in does n't constitute that kind of threat to the united states but when we are supplying funds , supplying the funds for the people in other countries that have an intent a malicious intent in regard to the united states , it s a national security issue so of course , energy independence is one huge step in the direction of trying to alleviate that problem ms washburn senator \? mr thompson our country has a 9 trilliondollar debt a good chunk of that is owned by china we 're bankrupting the next generation without any question every economist in washington who s looked at it will tell you that it affects our national security for one reason is because we 're squeezing military spending we 're spending at below historic norms under these circumstances for our defense , and we 're spending twice as much for entitlements that s why i put out a specific social security plan that 'll save social security while saving the government 4 trillion it s all in entitlements we 've got to spend more for the military , as a matter of fact but we 've got to look at social security and medicare and do some things now that wo n't hurt anybody badly but will save it for the next generation ms washburn governor \? mr romney this is , indeed , a time of extraordinary challenges in this country , and the overspending in washington and the overpromises that we 've made are certainly among those challenges but this is not a time for us to wring our hands and think that the future is bleak in fact , the future is bright we need leadership in washington that 'll rein in excessive spending , and we also need leadership that will help america grow the best answer for our economic woes is to make sure we have good jobs for our citizens , good schools for our kids , good health care for everyone , and that we have policies that promote the growth of the nation we can have a little playing field around the world , get ourselves off of foreign oil , reduce the excessive spending in washington , and have a bright future for our kids this , again , is based upon the strength of the american people if you want to see a strong america , you do n't look to washington you look to ways to strengthen the american people mr huckabee it s most certainly a national security threat because a country can only be free if it can do three things first , it has to be able to feed itself it has to be able to put food on the table for its own citizens secondly , it s got to be able to fuel itself if it looks to somebody else for its energy needs , it s only as free as those are willing for it to be and it also has to be able to fight for itself it s got to be able to manufacture its own weapons of defense tanks , airplanes , bullets and bombs when we start outsourcing everything and we are in that kind of a trade deficit , then just remember , who feeds us , who fuels us and who helps us to fight , that s to whom we are enslaved so if we ca n't do those three things , our national security is very much at risk sen mccain of course , any nation that no longer has economic strength sooner or later will lose its military strength , so it s a national security issue we have many trillions of dollars of unfunded liability obviously , we 've been on a spending spree we cannot increase taxes if oil reaches 100 a barrel , which many people think it may , 400 billion from america treasure will go to oilproducing countries some of those those monies will go to terrorist organizations we have got to achieve energy independence , oil independence in this nation i will make it a manhattan project , and we will in five years become oil independent ms washburn ambassador \? mr keyes i think it s obviously a national security problem , but you have to understand what national security is the constitution defines it as securing the blessings of liberty it has to do with the freedom of our people if you want to secure the blessings of liberty for the american people , you cut off the spigot that funds the political ambition of our leaders by abolishing the income tax and restoring control of 100 percent of their income to the american worker that means you replace it with a fair tax system that puts the american people in control of their money by doing that , you will encourage the politicians to stop spending to fund their little political cliques and only limit their spending to what actually produces results for the american people ms washburn thank you i want to dig into the budget issue a little bit more you 'll have 30 seconds to answer this next question , and again , i want to start with mayor giuliani what sacrifices would you ask americans to make to lower the country s debt \? and i 'd like you to be specific mr giuliani well , i think the most important thing is the federal government has to restrain its spending that s the area in which we 're hurting ourselves and in which we 're creating this problem national security , economic security , however you define it the problem is not the american people what we should be doing is restraining the amount of money that washington spends in a concerted way , with major reductions in civilian spending , using attrition , and returning actually leaving more money in the pockets of the american people the strength of america is not its central government the strength of america are its people restrain the central government , give people more choice , more money to spend , we 're going to see our economy booming that s the kind of future where we can have unlimited dreams ms washburn so , mayor , you 've said you would cut nonmilitary spending 10 percent across the board what sort of sacrifices would that require from people who use those government services \? mr giuliani well , that would that would require their trying to figure out other ways to do it i mean , rather than moving in the direction of more people on government medicine , i 'd rather see us reduce the income tax burden , create an exemption for health care so people can buy their own health care so that s going to require they take a little bit more time , take a little more ownership of their health care rather than relying on government as the nanny government , let s rely on people to make choices about their health care let s rely on , instead of 17 million people buying their own health insurance , 50 , 60 , 70 million you 'll see the price come all the way down and you 'll see the quality come up that s an american solution it s a bold one , but it s the kind of thing america has done in the past we rely on our people , not on our government ms washburn thank you congressman paul , what sacrifices would you ask americans to make for debt reduction \? rep paul i think it s absolutely unnecessary to sacrifice we want to give people more freedom , more chance to spend their own money it s unnecessary we can cut by looking at our foreign policy we maintain an empire which we ca n't afford we have 700 bases overseas we are in 130 countries we cut there , and then we have a better defense of this country , and the people get that money and they get to spend it here at home there s no need to sacrifice we need more liberty , more rights for the people to spend their own money and in this in that situation , there is no sacrifice and no need for it ms washburn so , governor huckabee , your colleagues seem to think there is no sacrifice needed to reduce the debt do you agree \? what would you do \? mr huckabee sometimes it s not so much doing things so that people sacrifice it s doing them differently let me give you an example a lot of the federal budget goes to health care we need to do what most american companies are finding works in reducing health care cost that s moving from the interventionbased health care model to a preventionbased our current model is upsidedown we wait until people are catastrophically ill and then we spend the most expensive ways of trying to cure incurable diseases if we would put the focus on prevention , we would find , like american business is finding , that there really is savings if you kill the snake rather than just treat the snakebites , which is the way our current system is built ms washburn governor romney , i 'd like you to address this first you 'll have one minute are there programs or situations that are so important that you 'd be willing to run a deficit to pay for them \? mr romney well , we do n't have to run a deficit to pay for the things that are most important because we can eliminate the things that are n't critical you know , in the private sector , where i spent the first 25 years of my life and most of my career , you learn how to focus on the things that are most important , and you get rid of the things that are n't we have , in the federal government , 342 different economic development programs , often administered by different departments we do n't need 342 we probably do n't need a hundred of those we probably need a lot fewer than that we have 40 different programs for workforce training there are probably five or six that are really working and a lot that are not working terribly well we can get rid of some of those we have 13 different programs to prevent teenage pregnancy well , they 're obviously not working real well , and we can probably cut it down to one or that are making a difference and so what anyone in the private sector s learned how to do is to focus their resources on those things that have the biggest impact , that are most important surely , protecting our country and our defense of our military is critical getting our free market finally able to allow all of our citizens to have insurance , health insurance , that s something we did in massachusetts improving our schools with school choice , better pay for better teachers these are a lot of things that we can do , but they do n't require us to eliminate the things that are most critical in our society instead they require us to get rid of those things that are unnecessary and the sacrifice we need from the american people , it s this it s saying let the programs that do n't work go ms washburn thank you mr romney do n't lobby for them forever ms washburn thank you congressman tancredo , how would you answer that \? rep tancredo i would say that there is a way and a very clear way to actually establish what the government needs to do in order to reduce its the cost that it incurs and to do what is right , and that is called follow the constitution of this country the constitution is a limiting document it tells the federal government what it can and cannot do today we do far too many things that exceed our constitutional the constitutional bounds that are placed there we have a responsibility it is to protect and defend this country concentrate on that concentrate on doing what s right and what the constitution itself gives us the responsibility for , and the rest of that stuff becomes extraneous and honestly , if you think about it , if you ask america , what would you do , what would you sacrifice , the one thing i would say is this do n't ask the government for wombtotomb protection for your life , to build a bubble around you because all of that will cause a humongous amount of money and money that we do n't have but we will respond to you , politicians will do it , because they want the vote do n't ask , and i guarantee you my administration will remain inside the bounds of the constitution ms washburn senator thompson , could you answer that \? are there programs or situations so important you 'd be willing to run a deficit for them \? mr thompson yes , the military , the security of our people , first and foremost , always our infrastructure , which is coming apart and research and development , which is going to help us solve some of the problems in the future as far as energy and a lot of other issues but i want to take a chance on telling the truth to the american people our entitlement programs , by 2040 or so we 're going to eat up our entire budget now we 'll go all day here and nobody else will talk about that obvious problem that we 've got we 've got to address the thing about it is that we can do it now without hurting those programs with actually strengthening those programs so that our kids and grandkids have i do n't think we as american people are so selfish that we 're going to put this off the table , kick the can down the road and let everybody else solve that problem , you know , when our grandkids get to be working age that s not america that s not what makes us strong and specifically , as far as medicare is concerned , we need to tell people that are in warren buffet s category we 're not going to take care of all your medicare in the future we ca n't afford it ms washburn well , which leads me nicely to the next question i want to go down the line in reverse order and hear from everyone very briefly , please , 15 seconds or so who in this country is paying more than a fair share of taxes relative to everyone else the wealthy , the middle class , the poor or corporations \? starting with mr keyes mr keyes it s one of those let you and him fight questions the people in the media always want to get us involved in because they would like to pretend that the tax question is about fighting amongst ourselves when the real sacrifice that s required from the american people we need to start sacrificing some of these incumbents who have funded their political ambition using our money ms washburn remember , we have 15 seconds mr keyes who have spent overboard into deficits after promising us on the republican side that they would limit the government , and then produced the highest budget deficits in the history of our country ms washburn senator mccain \? mr keyes i think we need to stop listening to these phonies and start looking for people who will actually fulfill the words that they speak that s what i think ms washburn senator mccain \? sen mccain i know that i'm happy to say lowincome americans , except for payroll taxes , do n't pay taxes , but we 've got to reform the tax code nobody understands it nobody trusts it nobody believes in it and we have to fix it and we ca n't raise taxes as our democrat friends want so i do n't know exactly who s paying the most of the burden , but i would say that the american people need a tax code they can understand and that they know is fair ms washburn governor huckabee \? mr huckabee over 80 percent of the american people know that the tax code is irreparably broken i would lead one to a fair tax , and that means that the rich people are n't going to be made poor , but maybe the poor people could be made rich that ought to be the goal of any tax system not to punish somebody , but to enable somebody so that they can have a part of the american dream the fair tax does just that ms washburn governor romney \? mr romney i do n't stay awake at night worrying about the taxes that rich people are paying , to tell you the truth i'm concerned about the taxes that middle class families are paying they 're under a lot of pressure gasoline s expensive home heating oil , particularly in the northeast , is very difficult for folks health care costs are going through the roof education costs and higher education are overwhelming and as a result , we need to reduce the burden on middleincome families in this country ms washburn okay , a little snappier , gentlemen \( laughter \) senator thompson mr thompson my goal is to get into mitt romney s situation , where i do n't have to worry about taxes anymore \( laughter \) mr romney \( off mike \) your situation \( laughter \) mr thompson \( off mike \) you know , you 're getting to be a pretty good actor actually \( laughter , cross talk \) five percent of americans pay over half the income taxes in this country 40 percent of americans pay no income taxes at all i think we need to concentrate on preserving the tax cuts of '01 and '03 that s going to be a monumental battle that s going to be coming at the end of 2010 ms washburn congressman rep tancredo everyone that is presently paying tax , you could be you can make a case that they 're paying too much the reality is , of course , you need a different system entirely we do need to move away from this archaic a system that taxes productivity , which is what we do , to a system that allows for a fair tax i believe in that ms washburn thank you congressman rep paul the most sinister of all taxes is the inflation tax and it is the most regressive it hits the poor and the middle class when you destroy a currency by creating money out of thin air to pay the bills , the value of the dollar goes down , and people get hit with a higher cost of living it s the middle class that s being wiped out it is most evil of all taxes rep hunter the tax that we 're all paying that does n't help anything it does n't go to defense , it does n't go to the roads , it does n't go to medical care is the 250 billionplus that we pay each year not to the federal government , to the treasury , but to prepare our taxes , defend our taxes , and for the massive cost of the irs that s all overhead 250 billionplus dollars what we ought to do is have a system the fair tax system is a good one , or a flatter tax or a simpler tax , because that young couple that pays 1 , 450 bucks in taxes may pay 450 to their tax preparer that s a second tax ms washburn mayor \? mr giuliani a flatter tax , a simpler tax that you could file on a one page , as an option , would be a good idea reducing the corporate tax , as i suggested reducing income tax rates across the board , which would mostly benefit the middle class that s where the focus should be but we 've got to reduce taxes across the board , and we should give the death penalty to the death tax it really is a very unfair tax ms washburn thank you periodically throughout the debate , we 'll give each of the candidates 30 seconds to make a free statement the candidates drew for the order , and we 'll hear from the first two candidates now senator mccain , followed by congressman hunter sen mccain thank you i 've devoted my life in uniform and in public office to keeping this nation safe i 've been involved in every major national security issue of our time that kind of experience is what s given me judgment , the judgment to oppose a failed strategy in iraq , a judgment to call for the strategy that s succeeding now and i was n't very popular because of it i have the judgment and the experience , and i believe that i can ask every american to serve i have one guiding principle , one ambition , and that is to keep america safe and to achieve and maintain our greatness ms washburn congressman hunter \? rep hunter you know , i stand for a strong national defense , enforceable borders and bringing back highpaying manufacturing jobs to this country that we 've pushed offshore with bad trade deals i 've been a member of the armed services committee for 26 years now , and i 've chaired that committee for four years and i'm one of the few guys up here whose worn the uniform of the united states , and my own son has done now three tours in the middle east , coming back on thanksgiving i know what it takes to secure this country , and i also built that border fence in san diego that worked so well and i wrote the law that takes it across arizona , new mexico and texas , and as president , i will finish that border fence in six months ms washburn thank you i want to come back to some issues that affect the economy you 'll have 30 seconds again the longer you go on , the shorter we 'll have to go thirty seconds to answer these questions , and we 're going to start with congressman paul one in five jobs in iowa depends on exports to foreign countries , but we 're also exporting a lot of highwage manufacturing jobs what s your plan for keeping foreign markets open while protecting goodpaying american jobs \? rep paul well , we need to adopt free trade agreements with other countries today we inhibit the export of , say , farm products to countries like cuba it s time we changed our attitude about cuba we should be looking to open these markets , but our markets get closed for monetary reasons because our chief export is our dollar because we have the reserve currency of the world , people take these dollars and our jobs go overseas you ca n't solve any of these problems if you do n't look at the monetary system and how it contributes to these job losses in order to provide the prosperity for our people here at home ms washburn governor romney , would you answer that \? mr romney you know , i 've spent the last as i told you , 25 years in the private sector i understand why jobs come and why jobs go i 've done business in over 20 countries around the world , and i understand how we can build more strength in our own economy and that s by investing in education , investing in technology and innovation , getting ourselves off of foreign oil , and making sure that the playing field we play on around the world is level it s not right now we 're going to have to renegotiate deals with people like those in china that manipulate their currency to put their products in advantage over ours we want to make sure that we do not have a circumstance where people close down their markets to our goods because we can compete anywhere in the world one out of three agricultural acres is planted to go offshore , so do n't put up barriers to keep us from being able to trade america can compete anywhere in the world , and to remain a superpower , we must compete around the world ms washburn governor huckabee \? mr huckabee well , job migration is a result of three things when you have excessive taxation that penalizes the productivity of a company you add to that excessive regulation , which means that you 've got more red tape than is possible to get through and i would say that as president one of my goals would be i ca n't part the red sea , but i believe i can part the red tape and the third thing is we 've got too much litigation when a company goes into business , particularly small business , from which 80 percent of all american jobs come , most small business people ca n't fight off the potential liabilities that they come from all of the lawsuits and litigation take care of those three things , we wo n't see the incredible level of job migration that we see today ms washburn thank you some of our big trading partners commit human rights violations considering that poverty and abuse are often blamed for fostering terrorism , should we alter trade policies with those countries \? senator mccain sen mccain well , obviously we should make sure that every nation respects human rights , and we should advocate that and try to enforce it but i will open every market in the world to iowa s agricultural products i'm the biggest free marketer and free trader that you will ever see and i will also eliminate subsidies on ethanol and other agricultural products they are an impediment to competition they are an impediment to free markets and i believe that subsidies are a mistake , and i do n't believe that anybody can stand here and say that they 're a fiscal conservative and yet support subsidies which distort markets and destroy our ability to compete in the world , and destroy our ability to get cheaper products into the united states of america ms washburn i'm going to move to the next question what specific changes should be made in nafta \? mayor giuliani mr giuliani i think the main thing is it should be enforced and the reality is , nafta has been a good thing i was concerned about nafta and i became convince , watching it , that it s actually helped us our percentage of exports , percentage of our gdp , has gone up dramatically from something like 9 percent to 11 percent it s brought more jobs to america america should think about free trade , global economy , as something we want to embrace this is what we 've always wanted and america s a country of entrepreneurs and dreamers and creators , and what we should be thinking about is , how much can we sell to these people \? as they 're coming out of poverty 20 million , 30 million people in india , china these are new customers for the united states of america and then we have to make sure that we have a level playing field that s very important but we should n't lose the goal of free trade we 're big dreamers here in this country we 've got plenty we can sell all over the world that will make up for what we 're buying ms washburn senator thompson , what specific changes would you make to nafta \? mr thompson well , i think free trade and fair trade is the backbone of our economy i think it s been just as good for us as it has mexico in fact , i think mexico needs to think about that when they criticize us for trying to enforce our border they export or send more people out of the country every year than we do , in terms of illegal aliens so it s been a good thing for both countries it s a long , complex document i have nothing in particular to point out i just think we need need to make a commitment to free and fair trade and make and enforce the agreements that we 've got the problem is , too many people close their markets to us they want to trade with us , but they want to place undue restrictions to our manufacturers and to our farmers we ca n't stand for that ms washburn congressman tancredo \? rep tancredo nafta has been a disaster for a lot of places and especially mexico southern mexico it was a disaster it destroyed the entire agricultural economy guess what happened \? they all came north if nafta had worked so well as everybody on the stage appears to think it did , why would we still have so much pressure on our southern border from people trying to escape from a country that does not provide them with the economic opportunities that it that nafta promised \? what , of course , is also ingrained in this whole discussion is the lack of sovereignty , the fact that our borders are now meaningless , the fact that mexican trucks can come across essentially without being checked these are the problems with nafta , and they have to be unwound ms washburn congressman hunter , you wanted in on that \? rep hunter absolutely you know , when we had a 3 billion trade surplus with mexico when we passed nafta , and the advocates said we 're going to build on that surplus today we have a massive trade loss we went immediately to a 15 billion trade loss we 've had that now for the last many years and let me tell you , if you take your product made in iowa down to the mexican border right now and tried to get it across , you will pay a 15 percent tariff , which they moved into place after we passed nafta you know , trade deals are business deals between nations , and we have n't made good business deals between nations and nafta is a bad business deal ms washburn i want to move on and hear the three statements from our next two candidates , congressman paul first , and then senator thompson rep paul the goal of all political action should be to preserve liberty we need more freedom in this country we need to look to ourselves in what we are doing we have drifted so far from our constitution that the government that the constitution was written to restrain our government yet we turned around , and the constitution now is used to restrain the people but we have no chance if we do n't restrain the government , all that they do in undermining our personal liberties , controlling our economic wellbeing and using our using it as an excuse to police the world if we do n't change the role for government , this country is going to suffer a very , very serious economic crisis ms washburn senator thompson mr thompson on all these issues , i 've been a strong , consistent , commonsense conservative but the most important issue facing our country , and will be for a long time , is national security and the safety of our people i 've spent a lot of time , both in and out of government , traveling , talking to foreign leaders , dealing with these issues i know the world we live in i think i know what we need to do i think that it s going to require strong leadership and i would ask people to think one thing before they cast a vote when our worst enemy is sitting down at the negotiating table thinking about what he can do to the united states of america , who do you want sitting on our side of the table representing you \? that s probably the guy you ought to elect president ms washburn thank you i want to take on a new issue i would like to see a show of hands how many of you believe global climate change is a serious threat and caused by human activity \? mr thompson well , do you want to give me a minute to answer that \? ms washburn no , i do n't i mr thompson well , then i'm not going to answer it \( laughter , applause \) ms washburn okay mr huckabee \( \? \) how about 30 seconds \? ms washburn no , i you know , i want mr thompson you want a show of hands , and i'm giving it to you ms washburn we 're going to follow up on that , but what i need to know is who believes global climate change is serious and caused by human activity mr giuliani i do ms washburn and then we 'll talk in more detail about it mr serious \? it is mr giuliani i believe that global climate change is a serious \( cross talk \) sen mccain and i think climate change is real , and i mr huckabee \( \? \) let s have a chance about it \( cross talk , laughter \) ms washburn go i'm going to start with senator mccain , come back to mayor giuliani sen mccain i 've been involved in this issue since the year 2000 i have had hearings i 've traveled the world i know that climate change is real but let me put put it to you this way suppose that climate change is not real , and all we do adopt green technologies , which our economy and our technology is perfectly capable of then all we 've done is given our kids a cleaner world but suppose they are wrong suppose they are wrong , and climate change is real , and we 've done nothing what kind of a planet are we going to pass on to the next generation of americans \? it s real we 've got to address it we can do it with technology , with capand trade , with capitalist and free enterprise motivation and i'm confident that we can pass on to our children and grandchildren a cleaner , better world ms washburn mayor giuliani \? mr giuliani i agree with i agree with john climate change is real it s happening i believe human beings are contributing to it i think the best way to deal with it is through energy independence ms washburn who does n't agree \? mr giuliani and i think energy independence is a mr that i agree with ms washburn who does n't agree \? rep hunter \( \? \) but he said contributing but not totally mr no yes mr no mr yeah mr oh , okay mr yeah mr yeah mr well , and i \( laughter \) \( cross talk \) rep hunter \( \? \) on our party , you 're getting closer sen mccain more than contributing , my friend mr romney \( \? \) give us give us each a chance ms washburn i did mr giuliani and i think that our party should embrace this as an issue for us , in our positions ms washburn well , let me come at this way let me come at it this way what impact on the economy would be acceptable in order to reverse global warming and greenhouse gas emissions \? governor romney \? mr romney well , it s going to help our economy because we 're going to invest in new technologies to get ourselves off of foreign oil , and as we get ourselves off of foreign oil , we also dramatically reduce our co2 emissions that s good for the environment it s also good for our economy because 300 to 400 billion worth of oil a year from other people who use it against us , that s bad for our economy , it s also bad for the environment ms washburn so then our mr romney we can do these things in a way that help both the environment and the economy and national security that s the beauty of what we 're talking about here , which is , yeah , is global warming an issue for the world \? absolutely is it something we can deal with by becoming energy independent and energy secure \? we sure can but at the same time , we call it global warming , not america warming so let s not put a burden on us alone and have the rest of the world skate by without having to participate in this effort it s a global effort , but our independence is something we can do unilaterally ms washburn mr keyes , what do you think about this \? mr keyes well , what i think is that a lot of folks out there ought to understand that what you 're watching represents the situation in our country ask yourself who represents the people they do n't let you hear from , and you 'll know who you should vote for in the iowa caucuses who represents the voice that they 're absolutely determined to overlook in the discussion of our sovereignty and the betrayal of this people s sovereignty on the border , on our moral principles , on the major export overseas , which is our jobs these folks represent the very elite , who year after year after year have destroyed our constitution , betrayed our rights and undermined our strength , created by our people in the world and yet the one person willing to talk about that is overlooked time and time again that person represents you mr thompson i agree with alan keyes s position on global warming \( laughter , cross talk \) mr keyes i'm in favor of reducing global warming because i think the most important emission we need to control is the hot air \( off mike \) politicians , who pretend one thing and do n't deliver \( laughter , cross talk \) ms washburn let me come to a question that iowans may not let you out of answering governor huckabee , you 've said you support increasing government mandates requiring motorists to use 36 million of biofuel by 2022 , which is six times what we 're producing this year are you willing to increase that mandate , even if it will drive up feed for livestock producers or force consumers to by flexfuel vehicles \? mr huckabee i do n't think that s what s necessary and the reason that this issue ought to be important is because we do n't own this earth we are simply stewards of it , caretakers and i know on a day like today , it s hard to believe there is global warming , if anybody s been in iowa on a day like today but climate change and who s causing it is of less importance than what senator mccain said , and he s exactly right we have done no harm if we take better care of this planet and give it to our children with cleaner air , cleaner soil and cleaner water we have done ms washburn so are you willing to increase the mandate \? mr huckabee i am willing for us to make the decisions which will not necessarily create the mandates and let me tell you how we do it you know who one of the biggest energy users is in the whole country \? the united states government if the government commits to being the primary user of alternative forms of energy , we have a market built in and therefore , the big argument against having alternative energy is there s no market for it well , let the government be a marketplace and we 'll create the kind of demand that lowers the price rather than raises the price ms washburn congressman hunter rep hunter you know , i 'd say instead of mandates , incentives the problem with mandating only biofuels and you know , ethanol s not the is not the greatest thing in show business you use a lot of energy to create ethanol , and there s other biofuels out there biodiesel , et cetera but by giving incentives in rd and by bringing our government laboratories together with business , with our educational institutions , the united states can become the center with a grand new industry of energy innovation we can be the leaders in the world in this but you do n't want to you do n't want to push away things like hydrogen , fuel cells and other things incentives is the way to go and we should take the entire array of alternative energy sources and give incentives to private enterprise to get involved and get into the business of delivering us a great product and we can produce a great new industry for this next generation ms washburn congressman tancredo , what would you do about mandates \? rep tancredo no , i do n't believe in mandates i do n't believe that they should be increased i believe that the market is the best determinant of exactly how these problems should be addressed i do n't mind and i would not be opposed to any investment in research and development , but the idea that the government knows the right amount somehow , some way some brilliant analyst usually some politician who has n't the slightest idea of the issue will make a decision about what is the right amount of mandate to impose on the rest of the country and you know what \? it never works out right let the market i trust the market more than i do the government ms washburn let s hear free statements from two more candidates first , congressman tancredo , and then governor huckabee rep tancredo we have had 40 years of unlimited 40 or 45 years , really of unlimited immigration , both legal and illegal , into this country it has become a that is a problem unlimited , massive immigration is a problem but when it happens commensurately without the same amount of assimilation , it becomes a catastrophe it will become what teddy roosevelt warned of when he said you have you can have immigration , but if it happens without assimilation , all you end up with is not a nation , but a polyglot boarding house some of my friends on the stage , both governors and senators , said they we should trust their judgment well , their judgment is what got us into this problem , so we need to trust somebody else to get us out ms washburn governor huckabee mr huckabee i think people in this country are looking for leadership they 're looking for change they 're not looking that people would be elected to be so much a ruling class , but a servant class we 've forgotten that our founding fathers had a brilliant , really revolutionary idea , that the people elected would not represent the elite , but would represent the ordinary our founding fathers had the idea that when we are elected , we 're not elected as a part to be elevated up , but to truly remember who it is we work for i think sometimes that s what s happened in america we forget that our job is to keep this country safe first and foremost , and it s to try to encourage americans to be their best at everything they do and i can tell you , it s a long way from the little rent house i grew up in to this stage i'm still in awe that this country would afford kids like me the opportunity to be a president i 'll try not to forget where i came from and where this country needs to go ms washburn thank you a new topic that some iowans say has n't had enough debate during this campaign , and that s education american 15yearolds ranked behind 16 other countries in a recent assessment of science literacy what educational standards does the us need to adopt or improve to compete in the global economy , and what will you do to move us toward those standards , and what s your timetable \? senator mccain sen mccain the answer to the problem in education in america is simple we need more choice and more competition entrance by a good student into a college today , they have a number of choices and people are seeking them to be part of those educational institutions we do n't have a choice in competition we need it in k through 12 we need more charter schools we need vouchers where it s approved by the local state and school boards we need to have clearly home schooling if people want that we need to reward good teachers and find bad teachers another line of work we need to have all of these compete in my home state of arizona , we have charter schools , some have failed , but they 're competing with the public schools , and the level of education is increasing in new york city today , there s some remarkable things happening under mayor bloomberg and joel klein , who have done marvelous work with an educational system that was clearly broken those can be examples of a way to improve education in america , provide choice and competition and give every american family the same choice i and my family had , and that is to send our child to the school of our choice ms washburn thank you thank you mayor giuliani \? mr giuliani i'm here because of the educational choices my parents made or i would n't be here or have achieved anything that i 've achieved , and that s the place where the decision should be made instead of having these education standards done in washington by the education department or some bureaucrats in a state capital or or in a board , the choice should be made by parents parents should choose the school that their child goes to , the same way people choose higher education has it ever occurred to to us that higher education is still the very , very best in the world \? and it s you 're asking me about k through 12 well , higher education is based on choice it s based on a large consumer market it s based on competition it s the area of k through 12 where we have this government command sort of approach and if we if we give the choice to parents , where they can choose a private school , a parochial school , a public school , a charter school , home schooling ms washburn time mr giuliani let them be the be the decider , i think we 'll see a big revolution in education ms washburn congressman hunter \? rep hunter three words jaime escalante and inspiration jaime escalante was a great math teacher who in the barrio of lose angeles taught young kids calculus , and he taught them so well that the school district called up and said , we got a problem we think your kids are cheating on the tests and he said , test them again and he established this incredible system of calculus in the school district by inspiring young people how many of us have have our careers can can point back to a teacher and say , that teacher inspired me \? what we have to do is take away the bureaucratic credentialing of teachers and allow people who are aerospace engineers and and pilots and scientists and retired folks to come in and inspire young people in third , fourth , fifth , sixth , seventh and eighth grades let let s inspire them to reach for the stars and give them the incentive to work hard enough to get there inspiration , changing the credentialing system , and school choice ms washburn has n't that teacher since left the public school system \? rep hunter and you know why \? i read the the the post mortem on jaime escalante is that the unions ran him out of the school district , and i think that goes right to one of the one of the big problems that we have ms washburn if we need to improve our educational system quickly to be more competitive in the world , does the federal government need to exercise different influence than it has historically over educational standards \? if so , in what ways \? and if not , how do you encourage state to meet national goals to move us forward \? governor romney mr romney carolyn , these are 60second answers , right \? ms washburn yes mr romney okay , let s make sure , because time s going pretty quick here education s an important topic and the president was right to fight for no child left behind , because we allow states now to test our kids and see how well they 're doing , particularly in math and english we 've made the same effort in our state , actually before no child left behind was passed we test our kids we have high standards we teach them in english , english immersion we say , to be successful in america , you 've got to speak the language of america we also put in place incentives for kids to do well for those that take the graduation exam , which you have to take to get out of high school , we say that you 're going to get , if you score in the top 25 percent on the test , a fouryear tuitionfree scholarship to a massachusetts institution of higher learning ms washburn but what about the role of the federal government \? mr romney and the federal government insists on those tests and those standards , and it s key , and let me continue i think we also have to have higher pay for better teachers and people who are not good teachers ought to find a different career and finally we need more parental involvement and we 've tested our kids in massachusetts , along with all the other kids in the nation 50 states get tested every two years in english and math , in 4th and 8th grade my 8th graders came out number one in english they came out number one in math my 4th graders number one in english , number one in math first time in history one state , number one in all four measures school choice , better pay for better teachers , high standards , scholarships for the best kids , english immersion these principles work ms washburn governor huckabee mr huckabee first of all , the whole role of education is a state issue it s not really a federal issue and the worst thing that we can do is to shift more burden , more responsibility , more authority to the federal government when more of it needs to go to the states but i think the federal government can play a pivotal role in primarily in helping to make sure that the best practices that are working in the states are shared with states who are struggling let me give you a couple of examples of what has to happen in all the states , and the federal government can at least share the data and the information one , personalize the learning for the student we have 6 , 000 kids every day drop out in this country they do n't drop out because they 're dumb they drop out because they 're bored to death they 're in a 19thcentury education system in a 21stcentury world if we really are serious , then first of all we make sure that we build a curriculum around their interests rather than just push them into something they do n't care second thing , unleash weapons of mass instruction i'm a passionate , ardent supporter of having music and art in every school for every student at every grade level \( applause \) ms washburn time mr huckabee because let me just make sure you understand why it s not frivolous it s because if we do n't develop the right side of the brain with the same level of attention as we do the left , which is the logical side , we end up with an unbalanced , bored student , which is exactly what we 've done , and we 're dropping students out of our system because of it ms washburn congressman paul , what s the biggest obstacle standing in the way of improving education \? mr keyes \( off mike \) do i have to raise my hand to get a question \? i 'd like to address that question ms washburn i'm getting to you mr keyes i would like no , you 're not you have n't since several goarounds so i have to make an issue out of it i would like to address the question of education ms washburn go ahead mr keyes i do n't wish it to ms washburn go ahead you have 30 seconds mr keyes they had a minute why do i get 30 seconds \? \( laughter \) see your unfairness is now becoming so apparent that the voters in iowa must understand there s a reason for it , and the reason for it is what i'm about to say governor huckabee just addressed the question of education he has stood before values voters and moral conservative claiming that he is their spokesman you know the major problem in american education today \? we allowed the judges to drive god out of our schools we allowed the moral foundation of this republic , which is that we are created equal and endowed by our creator , not by our constitution or our leaders with our rights if we do n't teach our children that heritage and the moral culture that goes along with it , we cannot remain free they will not be disciplined to learn science , to learn math , to learn history , to learn anything , and they do n't want to talk about this except when they 're squabbling about their own personal faith and forgetting that we have a national creed and that national creed needs to be taught to our children so that whether they are scientists or businessmen or lawyers , they will stand on the solid ground of a moral education that gives them the discipline they need to serve the right , to exercise their freedom with dignity , and to defend the justice because they understand it is our heritage ms washburn congressman paul , what s the biggest obstacle standing in the way of improving education in the united states , and how would you address it \? rep paul probably the federal government we 've been involved at the federal level for our 50 years we 've had a department of education it used to be the policy of the republican party to get rid of the department of education we finally get in charge and a chance to do something , so we doubled the size of the department of education and we have no child left behind the teachers do n't like it , the students do n't like it , and the quality of education has n't gone up the cost of education has gone up so we need to look to our local resources , we need to release the creative energy of the teachers at the local level but we can do immediately is to give tax credits i have a bill that would give tax credits to the teachers to raise their salaries at the same time , we should encourage homeschooling and private schooling and let the individuals write that off the parents have to get control of the education it used to be parents had control of education through local school boards today it s the judicial system and the executive branch of government , the bureaucracy , that controls things , and it would be predictable that the quality would go down the money goes to the bureaucrats and not to the educational system at home ms washburn thank you senator thompson , how would you answer that \? mr thompson the question was what s the biggest impediment to education \? ms washburn what is the biggest obstacle standing in the way , and how would you address it \? mr thompson the biggest obstacle , in my opinion , is the national education association , the nea i read time and time again every time someone wants to inject a little choice into the equation for the benefit of the kids , inject a little freedom , inject a little competition because we 're not exactly doing that well because of the things that you pointed out earlier , the nea is there to oppose it , and bring in millions and millions of dollars to go on television and work and scare people and misrepresent the situation on the ground i think that that just goes against everything that we know , that can make progress in this country we 're a nation of freedom and innovation and choice , and wellto do people are out in the suburbs they do n't seem to care that much inner city people need a chance to enjoy the choice that the mayor s talking about for colleges and universities other people have choice too if they 're wealthy enough to move into a neighborhood because they want their kid to go to school there , that s choice too let s give it to everybody else and let s stop people from standing in the way of that ms washburn thank you congressman tancredo , what s your take on all that \? rep tancredo yeah , the i had the opportunity to serve under ronald reagan as the regional director for the us department of education our task was to try to narrow it down , because we knew we could n't legislatively get rid of it although we wanted to and so i went in my region , we went from about 222 people it took us about four or five years to get down to about 60 people i used to always say , we 've gotten rid of 80 percent of the people in this department has anybody been able to tell the difference \? and you know what \? not a single soul said they had and something else if we had gone to 0 , you 'd never know the difference that s because we do n't need the department it s an encumbrance on our attempt to actually teach children in this country , as is the federal government and its intervention and its rules but you ca n't , i do n't think , governor , with all due respect , you ca n't say on one hand , you 're against having government intervention and on the other hand , tell us that you want music and art and everything else in the school that s not the job of a president it is the job of a governor that s what you should run for if you want to dictate curriculum \( applause \) ms washburn governor huckabee , would you like a rebuttal \? you have 30 seconds mr huckabee well , i made very clear to the congressman that what i suggested was that the federal government become the clearinghouse it chose the best ideas i was a governor 10anda half years i had executive experience longer than anyone on this stage running a government and i had also the most , i think , impressive education record and you know what \? i looked for what other states were doing that worked i was looking for all the ideas we raised standards , we measured , and we held people accountable for the results any time you give governors the opportunity to know what will work , they 'll use it , because it means jobs , it means economic development that s exactly the only role but if anyone doubts that the president ought not to use the bully pulpit to encourage the best practices , i would say the secondmost job of importance to the president , second to being commander in chief , is to be the communicator in chief and we 're losing a lot of kids in this country a third do n't graduate for a president to say , that s none of my business , is recklessly irresponsible a president needs to say it s unacceptable that that many kids leave our schools every single day ms washburn okay governor romney mr romney just one small adjustment to what governor huckabee had to say and i do n't believe you had the finest record of any governor in america on education \( laughter \) and because there s another one on the stand who who whose kids outperform me the the kids in our state , as i indicated , scored number one in all four measures on the national exams , and they did that because of republican principles , free market principles , applied and there was a partnership you see , education is not just the teachers' union i agree with with senator thompson on that boy , they 've been the biggest obstacle to change in education and and choice it s not just that the one side of this it s teachers , it s parents , it s the state , it s the federal government , it s all levels coming together and working together for the benefit of our kids and we face right now an education challenge that s really unusual we 're behind america s behind in education our kids score in the bottom 10 or 25 percent in exams around the world among major industrial nations ms washburn thank you mr romney and we 've got to have the kind of change that requires all of us working together , not just poking and saying it s someone else s job ms washburn thank you in light of the big needs and the financial realities we 've just discussed up to this point , realistically , what do you believe you could accomplish in your first year as president \? we 're going to go down the line , starting with mr giuliani and so that everyone gets a chance to talk , i need you to keep your remarks to 30 seconds mr giuliani we can make sure that the country is secure against islamic terrorism and on the road to winning the war against islamic terrorists we could end illegal immigration by beginning a border stat system it might take two or three years , but we could begin it we could do a major tax reduction , the ones that i indicated earlier , to stimulate the economy i would immediately begin to reduce the size of the federal government the way i did when i was mayor of new york and i would move toward energy independence as a goal similar to putting a man on the moon , the manhattan project you can use a lot of ways to describe the imperative nature of it , but i would make sure that we accomplish energy independence we would do things that we had n't done before and that we previously thought were impossible and you need bold leadership to accomplish that , and i think i can do that ms washburn congressman rep hunter first , you got to strengthen the us military you know , we have to look at the horizon past iraq and afghanistan and see the emergence of a north korea with nuclear capability , iran proceeding on that path despite what the nie says , and also the emergence of communist china as a new superpower stepping in the shoes of the soviet union so strengthening the military and meeting those horizon threats , and also strengthening our border , enforcing the us border that means building the border fence and making sure that we know who is coming into this country , what they 're bringing with them lastly , bringing back the industrial base of the united states that right now is fragmenting and being sent off to china and to other places around the world , which also is a security threat bringing back highpaying manufacturing jobs to this country that will serve this next generation well ms washburn thank you that s a tall order for a year congressman paul , what about you \? rep paul well , there s a limit of what you can do in one year , and at home it s more difficult you would have to work with the congress , but a commander in chief could end the war we could bring our troops home that would be a major event it would be very valuable we could be diplomatically we could become diplomatically credible once again around the world right now , today , we 're not even our allies resent what we do we would n't have no more preemptive war we would threaten nobody we would not threaten iran now it is proven once again iraq did n't have the nuclear weapon , had nothing to do with 9 11 the iranians have no nuclear weapon , according to our cia there s no need for us to threaten the iranians we could immediately turn the navy around and bring them home , and i think this would be a major step toward peace ms washburn thank you thank you congressman \? rep tancredo the first five minutes after taking office i would free ramos and compean , and that s for sure then the second thing i would do is to make sure that we begin the process of securing those borders and enforcing the law inside the united states against hiring people who are here illegally then i would use that bully pulpit that the governor talked about and is absolutely accurate in terms of the importance of it for a president of the united states for this reason , to explain that it is in fact a war a war is not going on in iraq that s a battle we are fighting a war against radical islam it is a threat to our existence as a nation it s a threat to western civilization it will take someone who s willing to say that ms washburn thank you rep tancredo and lead western civilization in this clash ms washburn thank you senator thompson , your first year mr thompson well , it would n't take me a year i 'd go before the american people and tell them the truth and try to establish my credibility , and tell them that we have n't come to terms yet with the nature of the threat that we 're facing or what we 're going to have to do to defend ourselves over the years i 'd tell them that if they did n't already know it , we 're bankrupting the next generation and nobody even wants to talk about it , much less do anything about it i 'd tell them that judges are setting our social policy now in this country and that s going to stop and then i 'd bring in members of congress and say , look , i just got a mandate we can work and cooperate together or i 'll go over your head to the american people ms washburn governor romney \? mr romney i want to do more than talk in my first year there are a lot of things i want to get done first of all , i want to establish a strategy to help us overwhelm global jihad and keep the world safe i want to end illegal immigration we can get that done i want to end the growth the expansion growth of entitlements , rein them in i want to end the extraordinary growth in federal spending and i want to keep our tax burden down and reduce our tax burden on middleincome families i want to get us on a track to become energyindependent i want to get our schools on a track so they can become competitive globally , and i want to get health insurance for every citizen in america it s going to take four years for that to happen , but i 'll get us on track in that we 'll have a stronger military , a stronger economy and stronger values , with stronger families , after my first year in office ms washburn governor huckabee mr huckabee well , i like the laundry list that everybody s had , and i would agree that every one of those things is important reality is , none of that s going to happen till we bring this country back together i think the first priority of the next president is to be a president of all the united states we are , right now , a very polarized country , and that polarized country has led to a paralyzed government we 've got democrats who fight republicans , liberals fighting conservatives the left fights the right who s fighting for this country again \? and somehow , we 've got to quit even fighting among ourselves as conservatives and as republicans , and start putting the better interest of our nation if that does n't happen , we 'll get none of these things done we 've got to be the united people of the united states , and a president has got to somehow remind us that we are a great , resilient nation that has to stick together to solve all of these problems ms washburn senator mccain sen mccain our first obligation , and my qualifications lend to making america safe we must make america safe this is a military , diplomatic , intelligence and cyberspace challenge and i have the credentials and the knowledge and the background and the judgment to do that the second most important thing , if we 're going to complete that laundry list , is restore trust and confidence in government there is none today we have to fix medicare we have to stop this wasteful porkbarrel spending that has led to corruption in washington of course we have to fix our borders we have to sit down together and fix medicare and social security but i can lead i can inspire confidence and restore trust and confidence in their government again that s the key to any success we want to achieve ms washburn ambassador mr keyes well , what i would concentrate on is restoring the sovereignty of the people of this country i would restore their moral sovereignty , which is something i think i can do very simply as president by declaring that no action taken by the executive branch would support , aid or abet anyone who is destroying the constitutional rights of those who are in the womb i would sign an executive order to that effect day one , and we would reestablish this government s commitment to the constitutional rights of our posterity these folks talk about our posterity , but you ca n't really respect them if you 're killing them in the womb it does n't make any sense and i would also want to abolish the income tax and you say , well , it ca n't be done in a day we need to start talking about it and talking about actually implementing the fair tax proposal that will end the wasteful spending by putting them under the discipline of a people who can actually withhold their taxes by changing their patterns of spending ms washburn thank you mr keyes and finally , i would establish a national border guard i would seal the borders of the united states so that only those would cross our borders who are subject to our laws and the terms of those laws ms washburn thank you mr keyes and i would encourage , through this national border guard , a real respect for the security that must be maintained along that border if we 're serious about the war on terror ms washburn we 're going to move to the last three candidate statements governor romney has 30 seconds , followed by mr keyes and finally mayor giuliani mr romney i want to begin by saying thank you to the people of iowa over the last year my wife and i have visited many , many homes , many places , over 70 town meetings , 67 counties josh , my son , has visited all 99 counties people here have warm hearts they 've welcomed us , and it s something that s made me feel very good about america anybody who s worried about the future of this great land just needs to come to iowa , meet the people with the kind of heartland values that you have here people here also recognize we face real challenges , and they want somebody who will strengthen america i know how to keep america strong i know a lot about the economy i 'll make sure we keep good jobs i learned a lot about education and health care i 'll improve our schools , get our health care system working for all americans and i 'll make sure that we have the kind of values that we can be proud of that are so essential to the great strength of this nation and finally , i want to say to the people of iowa i need your help i 'd like your vote i want you to get get out and participate in that caucus thank you ms washburn mr keyes \? mr keyes i think that the critical thing here is what you need to do if you really want to see a change in government , then we need to restore the credibility of the republican party , a credibility that has been destroyed by the betrayal of promises to keep government limited that resulted in outrageously high budget deficits at a historic level in this country the betrayal along the border , with the president telling us that he suddenly discovered we did n't have a secure border six years into his term and if you want to accomplish that , join the political army of america s revival at alankeyescom , and make sure you become part of that change we 're not going to restore selfgovernment until you become an active people not willing to take the inadequate choices you have , but lifting up the choice that this country needs ms washburn thank you thank you mayor giuliani \? mr giuliani i 've been tested by having to provide leadership through crisis , through difficult crises , not just september 11 but in my time as united states attorney , associate attorney general , mayor of new york city and america needs bold leadership we have big problems we have problems that we have n't faced in the past and solve problems about how to deal with terrorism effectively , problems about our border , problems about our economic security that we 've talked about and to do that , we need bold leadership , we need the kind of ideas that i 've put forward in the 12 commitments to the american people , but most importantly , we need an optimistic leader who can bring us these kinds of solutions i 've gotten results in the past i would like the opportunity to do that for my country ms washburn thank you we 're going to shift gears a bit voters have told us that character and leadership qualities matter as much or more than many issues over the past few months , we asked candidates who have spent time in iowa about some of their core values , and we videotaped the answers since we 're pitching websites , you can see all the insights videos at desmoinesregistercom , but today we 're going to see a few of them and then expand the conversation let s watch the first one \( from videotape \) mr giuliani and i would do this as president when i was mayor of new york , i would go get people s opinions i 'd go walk the street , sit down at a restaurant and i 'd ask people what they think , and i 'd go on radio , have them do a callin show i did 96 town hall meetings it was all for the purpose of hearing what people had to say because maybe , even with multiple sources of advice within government , maybe if you do n't hear from the people every once and awhile , you get wrong perspectives rep hunter legislation is a function of compromise , and when you put together a budget for example , a budget to increase defense spending and that budget which increases defense spending may have also pork barrel programs that you do n't like , and you promised your constituents you 'll fight against pork barrel programs in the end , if you vote for the budget of the united states , you vote for a lot of things rep paul the internet is delightful it is just delightful for finding the information , and if there s a question that i need asked , you can find it so i spend a lot of time getting information that was at one time in my life was very difficult to find there should be no excuse in this country anymore for not finding correct answers and analyzing the problems that we face , because the correct answers are out there and judgments should be made to the best of one s ability \( end videotape \) ms washburn so this next set of questions is entirely about character and leadership mayor giuliani , your administration in new york has been accused of handling your security expenses in a way that obscured public disclosure what specifically will you promise to do to ensure that a giuliani white house is open with information that might be inconvenient to explain to the public \? mr giuliani the reality is that all that information ms washburn thirty seconds , please mr giuliani the reality is that all that information was available and known to people , known six years ago and i would make sure that government was transparent my government in new york city was so transparent that they knew every single thing i did almost every time i did it \( chuckles \) so i would be extremely \( laughter \) i would be extremely open i'm used to it i'm used to being analyzed i have n't had a perfect life i wish i had and i do the best that i can to learn from my mistakes but as far as , you know , open , transparent government , i think i 've had both an open , transparent government and an open , transparent life , and it allows you to lead , then , with honesty and truth ms washburn so are there things you could have done in this situation that would have been more open and not raise these concerns about obscuring public mr giuliani no the reality is that this was a bookkeeping practice the way it was done actually made it more available to freedom of information act requests had it been done just in the police department , nobody would have ever found it and everything that was laid out a few weeks ago had been laid out six years ago , very well known some of the things that i wish , if i had lead a perfect life , would had happened differently , but it was all very well known and on the issue of transparency , i ca n't think of a public figure that s had a more transparent life than i 've had ms washburn mr keyes , how would you guarantee an open white house \? mr keyes i think the most important thing is to be absolutely authentic about who you are , not to say things today that contradict what you were two years ago , like , sadly , governor romney not to take a stand on the most important principle that faces our nation today , the question of whether we are all created equal and endowed by our creator not the constitution , but our god with our unalienable rights from the womb to the tomb , and not to abandon the heritage of the republican party as rudy giuliani would do and as i could not follow him in doing , so i would not support him if he were nominated and finally , i think it would be important to do what i'm doing in my campaign we have three phone calls every week people from all over the country gather online to talk to me , to interact ms washburn thank you mr keyes state their views we have technologies now that allow people directly to communicate to their leadership ms washburn thank you mr keyes and i would make creative use of those technologies ms washburn governor romney , would you like to respond \? mr romney i'm not sure \( laughs , laughter \) ms washburn it s entirely up to you \( laughter , applause \) mr romney this audience and the whole nation has heard time and time again the fact that i was effectively prochoice when i ran for office when i became governor of massachusetts , the first time a bill came to my life that dealt with life , i simply could not side with with taking a life , and i came on the side of life every bill that came to my desk , every issue that related to protecting the sanctity of life , i came down on the side of life i'm prolife i'm not going to apologize for becoming prolife ronald reagan followed the same course , as did henry hyde and george herbert walker bush and i'm proud to be prolife thank you ms washburn mayor giuliani , would you like to respond \? mr giuliani i think i 've explained my position on abortion , which is that i oppose it , but i believe that ultimately the government should leave that decision to a woman and her conscience i would like to see limitations on abortion i brought those about in new york city we reduced abortions we increased adoptions by 135 percent but ultimately , it s a position that i thought out a long time ago for me it s a position on conscience , and it s a position that , in spite of the fact that alan would n't vote for me , i'm not going to change \( laughter \) ms washburn senator thompson \( applause \) senator thompson , you 've expressed doubts that the recent report on iran s nuclear capabilities is accurate as president , how would you decide when to disagree with available intelligence , and then what would you do \? mr thompson well , that s probably the most important question that s been asked today we have a real problem with our intelligence community it , along with certain parts of our military , were neglected for a long , long time in this country , and we 're paying the price for it now the fact is that nobody has any real confidence in the result that they 're getting the result you 're talking about was directly contradicted by their strong beliefs just two years ago so you 've got to rebuild from the bottom up i think that , in the meantime , we have to rely on other people the british are helpful to us the israelis sometimes are helpful to us ms washburn thank you mr thompson in many respects , they have advancements that we do n't have in terms of our intelligence capabilities but the president cannot let ms washburn thank you mr thompson a piece of paper by a bureaucrat determine solely determine what his actions must be ms washburn okay , thank you we 're going to have to move on let s watch the next videos mr huckabee \( from videotape \) if a person says , i'm a person of faith , but i do n't let it influence me and i do n't talk about it , what they just told me is that their faith is so immaterial , insignificant and inconsequential that it really is n't a faith at all if it s a faith , it will drive their judgment , it will drive their value system , and therefore , it 'll help define them it s ludicrous to say that i have faith , but it does n't impact me at all sen mccain \( from videotape \) i think the hardest thing in this age of struggle against radical islamic extremism is balancing the rights of everyone s privacy plus our ability to combat this great evil of radical islamic extremism , and that s why i think that there has to be the participation of the courts , the legislature , the executive branch and the american people to what measures we take ms washburn governor huckabee , you are distinguishing yourself from other candidates by focusing on faith you say your faith does n't just influence you , that it defines you a person who chooses you for president , then , would expect that to translate to public policy so give me two examples you 've not previously given one in health care and one in education where your faith would define change you want to see in policy mr huckabee the two overriding principles are you treat others as you wish to be treated as it relates in health care , that means that we recognize that a person who is sick should n't be treated differently because they 're in poverty than a person who has extraordinary wealth that we have some sense of balance in how we approach that that s the essence of what america is about the second basic principle is that inasmuch as you 've done it to the least of these , my brethren , you 've done it unto me as it relates to both health , education or any policy , what it really means is that you go back to what the founding fathers said , all of us are created equal , endowed by our creator with those rights life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness ms washburn but two specific changes in policy mr huckabee well , i think i just tried to give them to you , both in education that everyone has an opportunity you give education and health care , that you do n't have some that are more equal than others so there has to be a sense in which you have opportunity , whether it s through choice in charter schools , in the education field , you have a curriculum that touches every child , not just a few and in health care you do n't have a health care system , like congress has , that is incredibly almost platinum , but there are a lot of americans who ca n't even go to the doctor and find out if they 're critically ill ms washburn thank you mr huckabee or if they have \( a terminal disease \? \) ms washburn thank you governor romney , as you look at the most pressing problems facing our country and the best opportunities to effect change in the next four years , do you think it s more important for the next president to be a fiscal conservative or a social conservative \? mr romney i think it s incredibly important that he be a conservative and i'm going to build on the same foundation ronald reagan built we 're not going to get the white house nor strengthen america unless we can pull together the coalition of conservatives and conservative thought that has made us successful as a party and that s social conservatives , it s also economic conservatives , and foreign policy and defense conservatives those three together form the three legs of the republican stool that allowed ronald reagan to get elected and allowed our party to have strength over the last several decades and i'm going to continue to draw , as many of the states try and do , upon those strengths and to build america by virtue of those conservative principles ms washburn okay mr romney whether in health care , education , defense , spending , entitlement reform , you name it , conservative principles work ms washburn thank you mr romney they 've been tested time and again , and they 'll keep working ms washburn thank you congressman hunter , same question rep hunter repeat the question i was lost in governor romney s explanation ms washburn do you think it rep hunter i thought it was quite good , though \( laughter \) ms washburn do you think it s more important for the next president to be a fiscal conservative or a social conservative \? rep hunter i think i think they both go to the core of this country , because you have to keep the economy running , you 've got to keep the wheels turning , and of course the the heart of our country is is this idea that that that human beings have value , that they are given these inalienable rights that have been described by my friend so those are two very important things but one thing that s extremely important that governor romney did n't touch on is this we also , in being conservative , having a conservative leader part of that means not sending technology to our adversaries and that s going to be the big threat of this next 15 , 20 years governor romney s corporation that he founded , the bain capital corporation ms washburn thank you rep hunter has joined up with a with a chinese corporation to to buy an american defense contractor ms washburn thank you rep hunter i think that is a mistake , and that s a defense contractor that did business with saddam hussein and with the taliban ms washburn thank you , congressman rep hunter so that , i think , is a very important part of conservative leadership ms washburn thank you , congressman rep hunter and thank you ms washburn we 're going to look at the last video mr okay mr romney \( from videotape \) i think we 're better off by strictly following the constitution as it existed and it was brought forward , and if we think there s a need for a new right , then going to the people or their elected representatives to establish that right , rather than having judges from their own heart or their own mind establishing new rights and new laws it s not for judges to legislate or to create a new constitution that s something that only the people and their elected representatives should be able to do rep tancredo \( from videotape \) there are two sides to your human component , you know one is the godfilled side one is the human side and there are things that feed either side , you know \? and whichever you feed the most becomes the dominant side and so you have to kind of concentrate on feeding the good side , or else you will lose control over it mr thompson \( from videotape \) the least we can do is look at our social policies , and not just be concerned about the consuming of what s before us in the short view but what s best for the overall country , what s best for the future generations of this nation and are we going to leave this place a better place than when we came into it \? to me , that s real patriotism ms washburn congressman tancredo , your foreign policy positions , on your campaign website , consist of five sentences on iraq what assures americans you 're ready to lead our foreign policy \? rep tancredo because the issue , of course , as i mentioned earlier , it s just a battle going on in iraq the major battle is , of course , this clash of civilizations i believe that the whole idea and the whole debate can be narrowed to a relatively small area , on my website or anyplace else , and that is this we cannot leave iraq we are committed there and will be for a long time , and that does n't i do n't care who s elected president that s the reality of the situation we can , however , stop , in fact , being the police force in iraq we are doing it we are moving in exactly the direction that my website , the statement , anticipates ms washburn thank you rep tancredo what more do i have to say \? we 're getting it done ms washburn thank you congressman paul , your you call your campaign a revolution , and i think it s safe to say that your brand of change is one of the most sweeping proposed by any candidate of either party but getting your agenda through congress would likely require a revolution of an entirely different sort so how would you adjust your plan in light of political reality in washington \? rep paul well , the secret is is the term revolution was n't my word , and it did n't come up on our web page it was coined by the supporters but in a way , it is revolutionary to go back to the constitution , and we 'd like to continue the old revolution and believe me , freedom is unifying we bring a lot of people together people then are free to choose what they would like to do with their lives , free to choose how they would spend their money , and all of a sudden , we would be telling other countries how to live ms washburn so getting through congress rep paul this brings people together and i think it s appealing to both left and right and middle , and our campaign really has that appeal so therefore , we would bring the congress together ms washburn okay thank you senator mccain , your reputation as a maverick has put you at odds with your own party leadership from time to time give us an example of a time you wished you had compromised to get something done instead of holding firm on your ideals sen mccain i cannot think of a time , and i hope that i could never think of a time , because i came to washington because i had a set of principles and ideals but at the same time , i have more legislative achievements than anybody on this on this stage by far i have joined together across the aisle on a number of pieces of legislation , many of them very important i'm proud of my legislative record , of conserving my ideals and my conservative principles and getting things done in washington and i am proud of that and i will continue to hold to those ideals , but i will reach across the aisle to the democrats , who ms washburn thank you sen mccain i have worked with , who know me , and we know we can work together for the good of this country ms washburn thank you we 're going to talk about new year s resolutions you have 15 seconds we 're going to start with mr keyes and go this way please suggest a new year s resolution for one of your opponents here today \( laughter \) mr keyes i think the most important new year s resolution is the one i suggest to the american people resolve to return to your respect for the principle that makes us free , that we are all created equal and endowed by god with our unalienable rights ms washburn fifteen seconds , please senator mccain \? sen mccain let s raise the level of dialogue and discussion and debate in this campaign let s not accuse each other of a lack of patriotism or a lack of character there are differing views on differing issues there are difference in qualifications there are difference in experience ms washburn governor huckabee \? sen mccain but i think we should all be respectful of one another , and the american people , i think , will benefit from it ms washburn governor huckabee \? mr huckabee i'm going to be a lot more careful about everything i say , because i find that it gets amplified to a new level so that s my resolution ms washburn \( inaudible \) resolution for an opponent mr huckabee well , i would make it of them , too \( laughter , applause \) ms washburn governor romney mr romney let s have a resolution amongst all of us that we 'll have a spirited campaign , as we have , but we 'll come together , come together real soon when this is resolved , and we will fight to make sure that one of the people on this stage is the next president of the united states not one of the people on that democratic stage you 've had more than once ms washburn senator thompson mr thompson yeah , well , it would be for myself , to try to be a better man , be strong , have faith , try to be a better husband and father ms washburn congressman rep tancredo all sounds good , but you asked what we would do , what somebody else , we think , should do in terms of a resolution i have to say it , because you 're leading the pack now , and congratulations to you , governor but i have to ask you , no , no , no , pointing right over there , right over there \( laughter \) ms washburn okay rep tancredo no , just a minute , you know , laughter does not count ms washburn okay , i 've got to rep tancredo i have to ask you a question ms washburn i have to keep moving rep tancredo and the question is , how are you going to convince america that you in fact changed your mind , on the issue of immigration , from when you were a governor \? that s all i want to know ms washburn congressman paul rep paul my advice would be to reread the oath of office , take it seriously , obey the constitution we can we are well defended against all enemies foreign we should be much more careful about defending against the enemies domestic ms washburn congressman hunter rep hunter yeah , to all my colleagues and , i think , to the american people , we 've got lots of folks coming back from the afghan and iraqi theaters , lots of young people who need jobs one thing we could do here , just a couple of weeks before christmas , is buy american goods and if we buy american goods , we may save the job of our neighbor or provide a job for that young serviceperson mr giuliani i would resolve to all of us to take a better look at america and realize how lucky we are , how fortunate we are , not to have this kind of pessimistic feeling that some have abroad in this land america has accomplished great things we 've faced crises like this before ms washburn thank you mr giuliani we 've always overcome them a sense of optimism ms washburn thank you mr giuliani is the thing i would wish for ms washburn and we 're out and we 're out of time you can find out more about this debate at pbsorg and at desmoinesregistercom and tomorrow at 1 00 we 'll have our debate with the democratic presidential candidates i want to thank all of the candidates for being here today , as well as our broadcast partner , iowa public television , our studio audience , and everyone at home and at work happy holidays , everyone \( applause \)
as democrats in congress and the bush administration look for common ground on a workable trade policy , it is worth taking a harder look at the capricious system of tariffs that raise the price of goods and are all too often based on outdated political considerations that defy logic and good sense take the article in the times by michael barbaro that detailed the disparities in the fees levied on imported apparel there is an 85 percent duty on an imported wool suit for a woman , but none for a man s , a 10 percent duty on women s hiking boots and an 85 percent levy on men s a vast majority of these tariffs go back to 1930 , preserved in round after round of tradeliberalization talks by politicians who won exemptions for their most favored constituents the reasons for many of them are as forgotten as the factories they were meant to protect unfortunately , the costs today are real , and it is often the poorest consumers who are hit the hardest some of the highest tariffs are on necessities like clothes , shoes , food and household goods simple but laborintensive industries where the united states is less competitive and they act as a regressive tax system , disproportionately affecting those who spend most of their incomes on the basics there s a similar effect abroad the progressive policy institute , a democratic research group , found that the american tariff system is uniquely tough on poor countries in asia and the muslim world that produce laborintensive goods it said the united states imported 22 billion worth of goods from cambodia last year and goods totaling 368 billion from france both paid 367 million in duties the current series of global trade talks , begun just months after the attacks of sept 11 , 2001 , was supposed to address the gross inequities in the international trade system in hopes of heading off the hopelessness that helps add to terrorists' ranks shamefully , the talks have stalled as the interests of a small number of heavily subsidized and protected farmers in rich countries have again taken precedence president bush needs to make a concerted push to revive this crucial economic front , making sure that it lives up to the ideal of economic development for the most disadvantaged mr bush and congress must also look at ways to fix the outdated system of tariffs that punish american interests at home and overseas
the three grew up in africa , migrated to the united states , became american citizens and made their mark as worldclass runners on the track and the roads all three were given strong chances to make the united states olympic team in the marathon none did meb keflezighi of san diego , born in eritrea , won the silver medal in marathon at the 2004 athens olympics abdi abdirahman of tucson , born in somalia , has run in two olympics in the 10 , 000 meters of ossining , ny , born in morocco , has set two world records in the marathon in yesterday s united states men s olympic trials , mostly in central park , only the first three finishers made the team for next year s beijing games khannouchi finished fourth in 2 hours 12 minutes 34 seconds and will serve as an alternate , and keflezighi was eighth in 2 15 09 abdirahman dropped out between the 18th and 19th miles with an aching hip flexor when khannouchi and keflezighi spoke afterward , they did not know that ryan shay , another elite runner , had died during the race so they were almost upbeat as they talked about what did and did not happen to them khannouchi has been plagued for years by foot problems he wore new racing orthotics in what he called a truly emotional race i'm very proud , he said it is difficult for a pro athlete when you lose confidence in yourself what i had to go through , if it happens to another athlete , i think they 'd be very tired by now of it as the alternate , khannouchi still has a chance to run in the olympics dathan ritzenhein , who finished second , had said he expected to run the 10 , 00 meters in next summer s track trials and seemed to prefer that distance but after this race , he said he was leaning toward the olympic marathon keflezighi was in the lead pack until the 16th mile of the 26mile385yard race my plan was to win it , and things happened , he said both my calves cramped up , and i could n't go on that s part of the marathon you can never predict what s going to happen it s just a disappointment for me , but it s not the end of the world at the same time keflezighi said he planned to run the 10 , 000 in the track trials so did alan culpepper of lafayette , colo , who won the 2004 olympic marathon trials , but did not finish here so did abdirahman i started feeling my hip after 13 miles , abdirahman said , and it was getting worse it was just brutal for me i 've had so many good races this was n't a bad race i just could n't do anything about my hip culpepper said obviously there s disappointment for myself and for guys like meb that we 've both been up there hammering it out for quite a while i think i stopped at 16 miles because it was closest to the finish line i was ready to stop five miles before that within four miles , both my hamstrings were sore i never felt right i did n't see the point of staggering to go 10 more miles of agony the first two finishers were 25yearold ryan hall in 2 09 02 and the 24yearold ritzenhein in 2 11 07 khannouchi and culpepper are 35 , keflezighi 32 and abdirahman 30 culpepper would not concede that the torch had been passed maybe in the marathon , he said , but i know guys like myself , meb and abdi are n't going to give it up easily i have too much trust in our ability and our commitment to what we 're doing notes the hansonsbrooks distance project placed brian sell \( 2 11 40 \) third and on the olympic team , mike morgan \( 2 16 28 \) 12th , nick arciniaga \( 2 17 01 \) 17th , clint verran \( 2 17 10 \) 18th and chad johnson \( 2 17 58 \) 20th macharia yuot , one of the lost boys of sudan who became a sixtime ncaa champion at widener university , finished 33rd in 2 18 56
the times s political reporters and editors answered reader questions this week on the 2008 election candidate biographies q while i love your series , , since the summer i ve noticed more profiles related to hillary clinton than barack obama and the other democratic candidates \( granted , obama does seem to get the second most coverage of the democrats in this series \) and significantly more positive attention paid in the series to democrats in general than republican candidates first , how do you find the stories about the candidates that you ve been telling with this series , and second , why do you think there has been this decidedly prodemocratic slant within the series coverage \? thanks for all that you all do bernie zipprich richard w stevenson , politics editor mr zipprich , one of the first decisions we made about our political coverage this year was to put some of our most talented reporters and editors to work on ambitious biographical stories about the major presidential candidates , all of whom have pretty fascinating backgrounds and many of whom are relatively unknown to most voters most of the stories , as you point out , have run under the rubric of the long run , although we have published other pieces about the lives and careers of the candidates without making them a formal part of that series so far , we have published three long run installments on barack obama , on his years in the illinois state legislature , his losing race against bobby rush for a house seat and the period he spent going to school and working in new york city we have also run three other lengthy pieces about his life one on his love of basketball and what his style on the court tells us about him one on his faith , and one on his years at harvard law school  as of today , we ve run two long run stories about hillary rodham clinton , one on her experiences in the pivotal year of 1968 and the other on her style as a manager in addition , we wrote a story about a cache of letters from her college years and what they tell us about her and of course we have done all kinds of other pieces about her , given her history as first lady and her current status as a senator from new york in 2006 we produced a lengthy look at the clintons marriage  we ve also published long run installments on rudolph w giuliani , fred thompson , mitt romney and john mccain , and there s more to come the total tally right now is seven long run stories about republicans and five about democrats plus we have been doing stories looking at the policy positions of the candidates and pieces examining their finances and their relationships with people and interest groups that might want something from them we develop story ideas through discussions among reporters and editors who have spent time thinking and reading about the candidates and going out to see them we certainly don t set out to produce quotas of positive or negative stories for individuals or for the parties we re looking for interesting and telling chapters in the lives of the candidates that we can recount in a way that might help voters understand them better if there s a bias that comes through , i d argue that it s in favor of tales that help make the candidates seem like real human beings \( a character trait that many of them seem to lose or at least keep out of sight when the campaign is going hot and heavy \) thanks for your interest mayor bloomberg q how likely is a presidential run for \? frankly , if our choices in 2008 are hillary and rudy , i will need someone to vote for , and bloomberg has some appeal by comparison i hate to think that the best our country can get in these troubled times is another clinton or giuliani elaine f momsen adam nagourney , national political correspondent i would say very unlikely , but not impossible \( how brave of me is that \? \) first of all , i am not convinced at all he really wants to do it , notwithstanding what some of his aides are suggesting second of all , knowing mr bloomberg , he will only do it if he thinks he has a really good chance of success he is not afraid of a fight \( and of spending money \) but he s not the type of guy who is going to do a losing battle another thing if he ran as an independent candidate , there is an excellent chance the result of that would be that he would take enough votes away from the democrat to elect a republican i suspect that is something that would weigh heavily against running in the mayor s mind but again , it s an odd year and things could be very different in a few months thanks for writing adam the california initiative q what is the status of the proposition in california to allocate delegates proportionally in the general election i heard that the clinton camp was trying to take that on , but i haven t seen any reports on it recently what s the likelihood that this democratkiller will become law \? thanks for the great reporting adam gidwitz jennifer steinhauer , los angeles bureau chief the initiative you are asking about , the brainchild of a prominent republican lawyer , would ask california voters to replace the state s winnertakeall system of allocating its 55 electoral college votes with one that parses the votes by congressional district the measure has attracted strong opposition from democrats because it would transform california from a reliably democratic state in presidential elections by handing the republican nominee roughly 20 votes from safe republican districts roughly the size of ohio while california republican party backs the measure it gave 80 , 000 toward the effort , making it the biggest donor in the 538 , 000 pot so far the proposition has had a rocky road toward its goal of the june ballot the initiative began under the aegis of thomas w hiltachk , a lawyer but he quit in september after it was revealed that the effort s only donation at the time had come from a top fundraiser for rudolph w giuliani , via a remote group in missouri also tied to donors to the former new york mayor the effort to out the donors and to bring the whole initiative to its knees before it could even get on the ballot was largely executed by supporters of mrs clinton supporters , how who broad the support among republicans is for the measure is far from clear , as even gov arnold schwarzenegger has more or less derided it after mr hiltachk quit , the measure seemed left for dead but many ballot measures in california seeminglyorphaned by a lessening of support or lack of money find new parents , and that has been the case with this one , too a new group here replaced the missouri group last month , and has gone about raising money and gathering support the measure needs roughly 400 , 000 valid signatures from california voters by the middle of this month to qualify , and proponents are trying to gather about 700 , 000 signatures to make sure they pass muster with the state they have collected more than 400 , 000 signatures already the measure is still at least loosely tied to supporters of mr giuliani its main fundraiser is anne dunsmore , who until recently was raising money in california for him , and ed rollins , the initiative s political consultant , also has ties to the giuliani presidential effort here many of the donors have also given money to mr giuliani s presidential campaign democrats have not given up fighting the effort , of course they have said they will sue on constitutional grounds , and rest assured that should the measure make it to the ballot , large sums of money will be paid to consultants and people who make political advertisements , both to attempt to kill the measure in the voting booth and to garner support for it the horse race q i am deeply disturbed by what i believe is true the press , liberal and conservative pays far more attention to the horse race aspects of the 2008 primary campaign than it does to the specifics of what each candidate is proposing and how this fits with past actions and statements why is that \? jerry bakker grand haven , mich katharine q seelye , political reporter hi jerry , it s a good question that we don t stop often enough to ask ourselves but a recent study has documented what you believe to be true in the first five months of this year , almost twothirds of the mainstream media campaign coverage was devoted to the horse race \( and subsidiaries thereof , like polls , tactics and fundraising \) why do we do it \? lots of reasons i ll start with the obvious we can t help ourselves ! it s instinctive the term horse race reflects what everyone wants to know who s winning \? another reason it s easier it takes time and patience to dig through records , to get answers from candidates that go beyond spin and talking points and often , candidates don t want to be pinned down , especially on where they will find the money to pay for all of the wonderful plans they are proposing but sometimes , the horse race is more than just a horse race when you see how someone runs a campaign , you can find clues about what kind of people the candidates are , what kind of people they surround themselves with , how effective they are at managing a staff and raising money \( a test of persuasiveness , an important political trait \) the horse race is about issues too who has a better plan for iraq \? whose healthcare plan will help my family \? whom can i trust \? voters are making those horse race judgments all the time , and we try to address them in a variety of ways in the detailed backgrounds of the candidates lives , in our heavy coverage of the debates , in stories where the reader can compare the candidates views on a single subject , the way our own marc santora did recently in examining the republicans views on torture and national security sure , after the debates there s an element of who won \? like everyone else , we want to know if obama gave hillary the knockout punch that some supporters and commentators in the media have been egging him to do but those are all pieces of what makes up the campaign , and the campaign is a race for the hearts and minds of voters and that s a horse race at this point it s where the thrill is , and the mystery and it counts why iowa and new hampshire \? q i have always wondered why the states have to compete with each other on how soon they can have primary elections for the race of us presidency ! why can t all the states hold primary elections on the same day , just as they do in the case of the general elections \? it doesn t make sense that iowa and new hampshire get an edge over other states by holding the elections before other states get a chance to hold them ! thanks , pradeep srivastava adam nagourney , national political correspondent dear pradeep , there is a lot of discontent in both parties with the current nomination process , and that accounts for the carcrash that is this primary season right now the argument for iowa and new hampshire leading the process is that they are small states which lend themselves to the most intimate kind of retail campaigning , giving voters a chance to see candidates up close and the candidates to a deal with often detailed questions about issues big and small in previous campaigns , there has been a dramatic turn in the tone of the campaign the minute the winner was declared in new hampshire it moved from living rooms and country roads to television sets and airport tarmacs , as the candidates began to campaign on much bigger stages this year , reflecting the argument you make why should iowa and new hampshire go first \? over 20 states have moved their dates to feb 5 others have moved even earlier , prompting iowa republican and democrats to set their caucus for jan 3 \( as of this writing , we still do not know when new hampshire is going \) there are a lot of proposals being discussed about how to deal with this i suspect though the one you suggest here would be problematic if you had all the primaries and caucuses held on the same day , that would be something close to a national primary you would completely lose the retail campaigning that distinguishes new hampshire and iowa , and might find that the only candidates who can compete are the ones with the most money or name recognition thanks for writing adam the future of the caucus q will the caucus blogs cease to exist after november 2008 \? i hope not it should remain a constant and credible source for debating the important issues of the day , long after a new leader is enthroned also , does nyt accept qualified volunteer reporters \? thanks , maya teague kate phillips , online politics editor dear maya , thank you for writing , and thank you always for your thoughtful comments on the caucus they do not go unnoticed , nor do those of our other regular readers and for wont of a better term , commenters it s a little difficult to predict what will happen to the caucus more than a year out , but i d hazard a guess that we ll be around at least through the inaugural festivities in january 2009 and then , who knows \? i m pretty sure we ll keep a forum for you and others to gin up more conversation , because whatever happens in the november 2008 elections , politics whether on capitol hill or in the white house or out in the country will matter to all of us going forward and as i guess we ve all come to realize , the war in iraq won t end any time soon what has been created inside the caucus , with what you keep on keeping on this dialogue , this polyglot of readers and politics junkies and all in between evolved into a place for serious debate and for frivolous asides why should the fathership give up a real forum for your ideas and for your take on how the country moves forward \? as for volunteer reporters , however qualified , i m not sure \( yet \) where that will go we treasure the observations of those among you who have become citizen journalists , people who are out and about among the electorate and want to share their take on things for the times , i guess it s an open question as to how we incorporate and consider the voices , the writings \( and youtubeylike video \) of those who want to share their considerable expertise the jworld \( journalistic world \) and the socalled msm \( mainstream media \) quite beyond the times are moving toward a more open sharing of information , of news , of allowing much more of an influx from all who are engaged the socalled democracy of the internet provides us with a flow of information and news that stretches way beyond our own reporters and editors reach i would say this for now the times has deployed an army of reporters , some assigned to candidates , some not , to cover all aspects of the 2008 campaigns many of our correspondents have been through umpteen elections they know the history , they know the trends , they get the blips and the longstanding themes they know when , for example , if a foreign leader raises an eyebrow , that he or she has done that 9 , 000 times , and they can read these signals better than most the times brings you the expertise , the analysis , the experience that a newbie might not and i by no means am suggesting any arrogance here just citing experience and we have more people on the ground covering the campaigns right now than pretty much any other organization that s just a fact and that said , i for one understand this fresh eyes , new eyes , new insights from our readers , from what are now called citizen journalists and the caucus commenters , offer up wideranging insights we wouldn t know otherwise we don t have our eyes closed sometimes we can only be in so many places at once so when you see something , hear something that seems opposite of our take , don t ever hesitate to check us to be honest , from my vantage point , your word , your take is totally worth consideration and it will be heard or read , in the parlance of our cyberworld kate a brokered convention \? q without a clear leader among the republican presidential candidates , what is the chance of the party not selecting a candidate prior to their convention next summer \? when was the last time that either party had to select a candidate at their convention and what was the outcome \? john gibbons adam nagourney , national political correspondent hi john it s the dream of every political reporter i know a brokered convention is it possible \? totally one of the big debates this year is whether or not the crush of states holding primaries on feb 5 i think we are up to 22 now is going to mean that that the democratic and republican nominees are going to be clear by the end of he voting that day most people i know think that is likely but given how divided the republican field is , it is hardly inconceivable that the race will go right through the spring consider this possibility mitt romney wins iowa , john mccain or rudolph giuliani wins new hampshire , fred thompson wins south carolina , rudolph giuliani wins florida and than the candidates divide the take on feb 5 that leaves none of them with enough delegates to claim the nomination , and it means they are going to keep slogging it out through the spring and maybe right to the convention keep in mind though that if the democrats have a candidate in place by feb 5 or so , there is going to be a lot of institutional pressure on the republicans to rally around a nominee and to stop the kind of attacks that could hurt their eventual nominee but one can always hope adam republican nominating process q what will the rnc rules awarding states who voted overwhelmingly for president bush in the last presidential election have on the republican nominating process \? i have heard about it , but haven t seen any of the political pundits discuss the possible outcomes or who they will help and hurt mathew from iowa michael cooper , political reporter the republican party s rules do indeed give bonus delegates to states that voted republican in the last presidential election , and also to states which have republican governors , senators and state legislatures those extra delegates have been very much on the minds on aides to former senator fred d thompson , who have said that they hope to clinch the nomination in part by concentrating on delegaterich republican strongholds in the south and midwest where they say mr thompson , a southerner , shows strength as michael luo and i reported in september , spencer abraham , the former federal energy secretary who is a senior adviser to the campaign , said , if you look at the delegate count , north carolina , south carolina , kentucky and georgia have more combined delegates than new york , new jersey and pennsylvania just how important such bonus delegates prove depends very much on how this year s nominating contests shape up , with its big field of serious candidates and its new , earlier primary calendar it could become a long , painstaking hunt for delegates if the candidates split the early states and have enough resources to keep competing in which case each delegate will matter very much or , if any one candidate pulls away from the pack early , the other campaigns could run out of steam before all the delegates are won staffing up for 2008 q given the large increase in political coverage did you increase the staff by outside hiring or did you reallocate reporting staff that you already had \? thanks ! cate q can you explain whether a specific reporter is assigned to each presidential candidate and if so , who has been assigned to whom \? additionally , if a candidate wins , does that mean that the assigned reporter then becomes the white house correspondent \? is that a coveted position \? if so , isn t there an incentive for reporters to write a positive coverage of their assigned candidate \? thank you for your political coverage helen richard w stevenson , politics editor and gerry mullany , deputy editor we began planning our coverage of the presidential campaign more than a year ago we went into it knowing that the field of candidates would be large and full of interesting and compelling characters , that the differences between the parties would be stark and that the issues facing the country would be complex and urgent and we knew that to cover it right was going to require a lot of people , nearly all of them from inside the paper to report on the race and everything associated with it , we began recruiting journalists from all over the times we have reporters assigned to cover the major candidates on a day to day basis but our deployment of reporters only begins with our coverage of the campaign trail we have a separate crew writing biographical stories about the candidates some of our most tenacious diggers are examining the finances , business dealings and other aspects of the candidates backgrounds we employ some of our most experienced hands to weigh in on specific issues \( check out the interviews that michael r gordon , our chief military affairs correspondent , has done with the candidates on iraq \) we have specialists in areas like media and campaign fundraising they have come from the washington bureau , the metro desk , the national desk , our web operation , the culture desk and styles the smart folks in research and computer assisted reporting are devoting a big chunk of their time to politics our graphics desk has found incredibly creative ways of using data to tell stories visually our photographers and videographers have captured one remarkable image after another everyone involved in nytimescom has seen the campaign as an opportunity to employ the web to add new elements to our coverage , including the caucus blog , video reports and interactive graphics it s quite an army , and we re proud that the times has been able to amass it during a period when many news organizations have had to scale back their ambitions because of financial pressures \( note to bosses that doesn t mean we re giving up on getting more bodies assigned to the race \) as far as covering particular candidates , we switch things around from time to time to provide a fresh perspective , and our deployment of reporters has evolved along with the race but here s the basic lineup at the moment pat healy , who covered hillary rodham clinton s 2006 senate race as a metro politics reporter , is now covering her presidential campaign jeff zeleny covered barack obama for the chicago tribune before joining the times last year , and now he s our obama campaign reporter christine hauser , from our continuous news operation , is covering john edwards in the republican field , michael cooper , who used to cover city hall for the metro desk , and is now covering rudolph giuliani s presidential bid mike luo , a former religion reporter who did a stint covering the war in iraq , is covering mitt romney and marc santora jumped from the metro desk and covering the iraq war to now covering two candidates john mccain and fred thompson yes , the white house beat is indeed a coveted position , since the reporters typically end up covering some of the biggest stories , with their bylines frequently landing on the front page but covering a winning presidential candidate is not necessarily a ticket to a white house beat frank bruni was assigned to the bush campaign in 2000 and ended up covering the first term of the bush presidency jim rutenberg , who covered media in the 2004 campaign , covered the white house in 2006 and 2007 before coming back to the campaign but neither of our current white house correspondents , sheryl gay stolberg and steven lee myers , came out of campaign coverage as to whether the campaign reporters try to steer their coverage to help their candidates , check out these recent articles by michael cooper and marc santora and pat healy s pinning hopes , and fears , on a clinton candidacy , from our sunday look at the state of the 2008 race  nbc msnbc partnership q i think your washington reporters such as and are much better than our local reporters aren t you worried to have them appear on msnbc shows which seem tilted against the current administration \? what is the nature of the relationship the new york times has with msnbc \? many thanks in advance , cd monroe washington , dc richard w stevenson , political editor earlier this year , the times began a partnership with nbc msnbc for the coverage of politics the partnership has several basic components we give them a certain number of stories each week for publication on their web site they provide us with video that we can use to augment our own increasingly ambitious multimedia journalism and we look for opportunities for the two news organizations to coordinate on coverage of the presidential campaign for example , nbc has featured some of our reporting , with credit to us , on the nbc nightly news and the today show we did a qa on the caucus about the new hampshire primary with david gregory , nbc s chief white house reporter , and adam nagourney , our national political reporter as the campaign progresses , we ll try to find new ways of using each other s capabilities to our mutual benefit on television , on the web and in print one of our goals at the times is to seek out ways of giving our journalism greater visibility , and from time to time that means encouraging our journalists to appear on television , especially on nbc news and msnbc as you suggest , there are some msnbc shows that have a distinct ideological tilt to them , and we have been open with our partners at nbc about our wariness of associating our reporters with the points of view expressed on those shows as a result , we try to ensure that if one of our people is to appear on one of those programs and it doesn t happen regularly they will not be pulled into discussions that would require them to support or rebut a political position , defend or attack the bush administration or express an opinion we tell our reporters that they should not appear on any show where they might feel uncomfortable , and we stress to them that whenever they are on television on msnbc or anywhere else they are bound by the same rules of fairness and impartiality that govern what they write for the paper having said all that , we re still feeling our way in television , and to put it nicely , it s not a natural medium for many of us inkstained wretches but with technology upending our business , we want to be certain that we have the skills to tell our stories via whatever channels are available to us , and video is one of them the gore question q since he has missed the new hampshire filing deadline , is it now safe to assume that vice president gore is officially not running for president in 2008 \? if this election is going to be yet another republican warmonger \( mayor giuliani \) versus a democratic senator whose number is next in line \( senator clinton \) , i d prefer to tune the whole thing out for a year vice president gore s potential candidacy is the only thing keeping me from hitting the snooze button best regards , mike d emilio q can you envisage a scenario in which al gore would be willing to enter the race \? jim klosty adam nagourney , national political correspondent hello mike and jim , i m not sure that the simple act of missing the new hampshire means that al gore can not run for president \( as a democrat or for that matter as an independent \) if he wants to stress the word if i have always taken mr gore at his word that he is not going to run for one thing , by all appearances , he is having the time of his life for another , i do not think he would run again for president unless he thought he had a really good shot at winning , and this is one very competitive field that said , could i think of a scenario where it might happen \? the only one that comes to mind would be if the candidacies of say hillary rodham clinton , barack obama and john edwards imploded , and the party turned to al gore seems a bit of a long shot , but longershot things have happened best , adam dealing with oppo research q every day , campaigns try to push negative stories to reporters via compilations of opposition research and various forms of prodding can you explain when the times determines that it s worth acknowledging that a particular campaign is the source of a particular story \? adam bonin richard w stevenson , political editor this is a great question , and one we wrestle with all the time you are right that campaigns are always trying to dish out facts , gossip and innuendo about their rivals most of the time we brush it aside sometimes we bite when we do , we always do our own reporting to verify the information independently but there is no hard and fast rule for how we describe the genesis of the story our national political reporter , adam nagourney , frequently invokes a rule that we encourage other reporters to follow \( and campaigns to ignore at their peril \) we will not honor any assumption that information is off the record or not for attribution if it comes to us unsolicited so as a practical matter if a campaign emails a document to one of our reporters without a prior discussion of the ground rules , and that document says it is not to be sourced to the campaign that sent it , we feel free to identify the source because we never agreed to any condition of anonymity similarly , we do not accept that information is not for attribution just because other news organizations have agreed to that condition here s what we wrote in june , in a story by patrick healy , with help from david d kirkpatrick and adam , about the clintons financial holdings shortly after the clinton campaign released the financial information , the campaign of senator barack obama , the illinois democrat , circulated to news organizations on what it demanded be a notforattributionbasis a scathing analysis it called mrs clinton hillary clinton \( dpunjab \) in its headline the document referred to the investment in india and mrs clinton s fundraising efforts among indianamericans the analysis also highlighted the acceptance by mr clinton of 300 , 000 in speech fees from cisco , a company the obama campaign said has moved american jobs to india a copy of the document was obtained by mrs clinton s campaign , which provided it to the new york times the clinton campaign has long been frustrated by the effort by mr obama to present his campaign as above the kind of attack politics that mr obama and his aides say has led to widespread disillusionment with politics by many americans asked about the document , bill burton , a spokesman for mr obama , said we did give reporters a series of comments she made on the record and other things that are publicly available to anyone who has access to the internet i don t see why anyone would take umbrage with that asked why the obama campaign had initially insisted that it not be connected to the document , mr burton replied , i m going to leave my comment at that even among our own reporters , there are differing opinions about how far to push the idea of transparency in sourcing , and i don t want to leave you with the idea that we never play with campaigns when it comes to oppo research reporting on any competitive beat and a presidential campaign is nothing if not competitive requires scooping up credible , verifiable information from many types of sources , including , at times , sources with an interest in the outcome we try hard to flag that type of situation for readers here s how adam handled it on a story in may about the leak to us of a memo written by senator clinton s deputy campaign manager recommending that she not compete in the iowa caucuses howard wolfson , the clinton campaign s communications director , said neither mrs clinton nor mark penn , her chief strategist , had seen the memorandum a copy of it was provided to the new york times by an intermediary who said it had come from a rival campaign there have been other situations where we have not been successful in making clear where a piece of information or a tip originated , and no doubt situations where reporters and editors did not press sources hard enough to agree to some form of attribution but we are trying to limit those instances as we continue to seek greater transparency in our journalism why not nevada \? q why is nevada being ignored by the candidates and the press in this election \? it s an early state , and has significant latino and native populations \( much as sc has a significant africanamerican population \) it s a barometer for shifts in the west and southwest at least , that was the plan so why isn t it working \? will the nevada results , if they re a surprise , have any impact on candidates standing \? susan breslin adam nagourney , national political correspondent dear susan , fair question \( and full disclosure here i am writing this in a car as it rolls through the corn fields of iowa , and no i am not driving \) a few reasons 1 the calendar or primaries and caucuses is not set yet , so the candidates are not sure yet just how important nevada will be we do know that iowa and new hampshire are going to be key , which is why the candidates are spending so much time there 2 i m not making any dogatemyhomework excuses here , but reporters go where the candidates go i have spent a lot of time in iowa this year that is because the candidates are here 3 logistically , nevada is a long plane trip from washington or new york that is something the campaigns , which are trying to be careful in allocating a candidate s time , need to keep in mind do they want to be up in the air for 10 hours \? oh , and don t hate me , but i hate gambling see you in december polling and cellphones q is it possible that the current polling numbers putting hillary up by so much are skewed because of a tendency for polls to be conducted over telephone landlines \? as has been widely reported , many obama supporters come from a younger demographic , who i imagine , much like myself and all my friends , only use our cellphones and never bother to get a landline because there s no point paying the extra bill that comes with it thanks , keane janet elder , editor of news surveys and election analysis we get a lot of questions about cell phones our own telephone polls , those we conduct with cbs news actually include responses from some people who were reached on their cell phones the american association of public opinion researchers \( aapor \) , the professional organization for public opinion researchers is continuing to look at the impact of cell phones on sampling so far , those in the profession who have been looking at it have broadly concluded that people who rely on cell phones as their primary telephone are attitudinally no different than those reached on land lines from the same demographic group but it is something that everyone in the industry has their eye on we ll know more when aapor releases their latest study early next year please submit any questions or comments to
nashville miles from downtown , nashville s southern neighborhoods are home to a thriving enclave of kurdish immigrants just off a wide commercial strip called nolensville pike , women in head scarves shop at the judy international market lunch traffic is brisk at alrasoul restaurant , and on the door of a local mosque , a flier announces kurdish soccer league signups bound by a common language and ethnicity , kurds here tend to shun attention but a growing problem has turned an unwanted spotlight on them a group called the kurdish pride gang , thought to be the nation s only kurdish street gang after a series of highprofile crimes , a teenage suspect s suicide and four arrests connected to the attempted murder of a policeman , kurdish pride has become a source of deep shame and frustration , as kurds find that their youth are as vulnerable to gang culture as are those of other populations kirmanj gundi , an associate professor of educational administration at tennessee state university who came to nashville in 1977 , said the gang s activities had upended decades of hard work we did everything to build a good reputation here in nashville and elsewhere , and tried to be good americans , said mr gundi , 46 , who is kurdish , and all of a sudden a few irresponsible hoodlums have tried to tarnish the reputations we 've been working so hard over the years to create that s sad kurds are an ethnic group spread across parts of iraq , turkey , syria and iran , in a region collectively called kurdistan nashville s community grew up around those who fled iraq in the 1970s after the collapse of an autonomy movement kurds from elsewhere followed now numbering about 8 , 000 , the kurdish community is well established here public access television carries a show called who are the kurds \? community members boast of their college students and business owners a popular bar in the city s rock block of nightclubs is kurdish owned but some see the success of their diligence losing ground because of the gang , which is estimated to number just 20 to 30 members ranging in age from their teens to mid20s police officials say that kurdish pride members have grown increasingly vicious and brazen investigators believe that the gang has committed about 10 home burglaries since january , including two involving rapes , said mark anderson , a nashville police detective who works in a gang unit in a case involving the rape of a pregnant victim , a 17yearold suspect , zana noroly , hanged himself in his jail cell in april messages in his memory are ubiquitous on the web pages of kurdish youth there was an assault in which a student was dragged from a high school classroom and beaten , and another during the school graduation that left the victim hospitalized kurdish pride members have been accused of shooting at a rival gang , injuring three , and also beating a man to death in january at a motel , mr anderson said earlier this month , a grand jury indicted four members of the gang for conspiracy to commit firstdegree murder in a case in which a gang leader , ako nejad , is accused of shooting at a park policeman who interrupted a drug deal last year the members have adopted older gangs' symbols , adorning their myspace pages with photos of the rapper tupac shakur and slogans like live and die 4 kurdish pride they sport tattoos and gang colors , and flash hand signals the gang s origins are murky , but many people believe it probably formed to present kurdish bravado to this city s mix of latino , asian and black gangs i think they 're really confused , said rebaz qaradaghi , a 22yearold regional director of the national kurdish american youth organization who lives here they really think that they 're helping , but they 're actually messing it up bad police view kurdish pride as being as serious a problem as older , more established gangs , mr anderson said but there is a difference kurdish pride are not the kind of kids that normally join gangs for the most part , they come from twoparent homes , they come from middleclass families with a strong work ethic , where education is important , he said there are kurdish gangs in europe , but the one here may be the first in the united states police in other cities with large populations of kurds have not seen such gangs nyma ardalan , a board member of the kurdish national congress of north america , a nonprofit group promoting unity among kurds , said he knew of no other at the salahadeen center , a mosque and community center here for kurds , the director , nawzad hawrami , says he addresses the problem during friday services and will speak at schools in the fall even the mosque is not immune from the gang s shadow a few years ago , it was vandalized after a frank discussion there about kurdish pride education , mr hawrami said , is crucial to combating the gang none of the people in the kurdish community like this happening , mr hawrami said , and they advise their kids , they advise their sons and daughters , to not violate the laws ronald huff , a criminology professor at the university of california , irvine , said that immigrant children , torn between cultures , could drift into gangs , but that community pressure could stop it when the community rallies around and pulls together and lets the kids know that they expect them to stay out of trouble , it s very , very helpful , mr huff said along a neighborhood street here , kp is spraypainted on road signs aram torabian , 22 , another regional director of the youth organization who lives nearby , acknowledges the seriousness of the gang s crimes , but is adamant that the kurds are getting unfair attention and that more dangerous gangs are being ignored in the news media the gang , he said , will be a scar on our kurdish culture and history in nashville his father , mohammed torabian , said he spoke with his son about staying out of trouble when they arrived in nashville today , mr torabian hopes gang members' families will do the same with their children the best thing we could wish for is that word gets to them , family to family , mr torabian said in kurdish , to get them to think
two seasons ago the pittsburgh symphony orchestra announced it was moving in a bold new direction by hiring three conductors , rather than following the lone music director model that dominates american orchestras so much for audacious experiments the orchestra said yesterday that it had appointed manfred honeck , an austrian conductor , as its music director , starting in september 2008 mr honeck made his debut with the symphony in may and has conducted five concerts the pittsburgh musicians and newspaper critics warmly embraced him during the brief courtship he is fresh off a sixyear stint as music director of the swedish radio symphony orchestra in september 2004 the pittsburgh symphony said it was responding to the desires of its audiences and players by appointing sir andrew davis as artistic adviser , and yan pascal tortelier and marek janowski as regular guests mr davis recently said he would not renew his contract in a telephone interview lawrence tamburri , the orchestra s president , declined to call the experiment a failure rather , he said , the orchestra benefited greatly from the troika we learned a lot from that process , he said we had three excellent conductors conducting strong repertoire for them ticket sales , particularly subscriptions , are up , he said , but it became clear over time that both the audiences and the orchestra needed central leadership underlying the threeheaded approach was the orchestra s difficulty in finding a conductor of international stature willing to spend the time in pittsburgh cultivating donors , making public appearances and handling administrative matters such activities are part of the job description for american music directors , but europeans are not used to the fundraising tasks mr honeck , 48 , began his career as a violinist in the vienna philharmonic by the time he takes over , he will also be music director of the staatsoper stuttgart and principal guest conductor of the czech philharmonic orchestra mr tamburri said mr honeck had committed himself to extramusical tasks like fundraising and serving as the orchestra s public face he s going to be a music director in the full sense of a music director in america , mr tamburri said the contract calls for him to conduct 8 weeks the first season , and 10 weeks each of the next two mr honeck , speaking from pittsburgh , embraced the role i regard this position as the fullest thing of what a music director means , he said i know this conflict between the european thinking about music and the american thinking it s so important to do everything that helps the orchestra i'm absolutely responsible for the quality of the orchestra , he continued if the quality is very high , the people will long for more fundraising is of course a part of the music director s life here in the united states it is for me clear that i have to do it mr honeck said he had been seduced by the pittsburgh musicians' high level of playing he also cited their inner strength , and this will to play very , very good , and to go 100 percent with the conductor as for repertory , mr honeck said he would concentrate on the music of his heritage , the viennese tradition mahler , mozart , brahms and bruckner as well as contemporary works it s very important that we do this , that we help people to understand our time , he said mr honeck s brother rainer is a concertmaster of the selfgoverning vienna philharmonic , which has another solution to the music director problem it has none only guests
the colts are the nfl champions thanks for staying with the fifth down blog on this super sunday we ll have another day or two of this , so you can keep reading along and sending in your comments in the meantime , congratulations to the bears fans for a great season , and big congratulations to colts fans everywhere and finally , congratulations to the biggest winner of all prince ! still more postgame revelry really , i would ve given the mvp to addai or rhodes in the colts backfield the announcer is that nantz \? points out all that coach dungy has been through in winning this super bowl i thought that was a reference to dungy s having lost his son last year , which really would count as terrible adversity but no , apparently it s a reference to the colts having had a losing streak in the second half of the season yo , reader gaia no tv signal in northwest ohio all day \? are you kidding me \? that s terrible ! this is the 21st century at least in central and eastern ohio the stands are pretty much empty , even as the nfl s rather weak trophy presentation continues in the drizzle at miami we should probably wrap this up soon first , lovie smith is interviewed outside the chicago locker room he says some gracious things about dungy winning , while back outside , the pictures show the colts milling about chatting not exactly the jubilant scenes you associate with a championship , but whatever i ll take this space to say that my personal mvp , though i was only able to type his name once tonight , is booger mcfarland ! more postgame revelry we re going to stay with this a few more minutes to describe the trophy presentations , expressions of joy , faith , etc so hang with us if you like and now the whole stage thing is set up on the field luckily the rain has stopped don shula comes out with the lombardi trophy and parades it down a tunnel of colts players , who all reach over and touch it omg , is that mark messier on the field \? looks like him big bald guy anyway , shula ascends the staircase to the podium nfl commissioner roger goodell now awards the trophy to colts owner jim irsay thank you , roger a big cheer irsay says some nice things about the people in central florida who were hit by the deadly tornadoes on friday then no segue , and it s we re champions ! some more words about god , and all glory to him , and the expressions of love to the city of indianapolis , the fans , and the guys now dungy is prattling on , i m sorry , about the lord this is because he s just said that devin hester s opening kickoff td for the bears caused him to reflect that this is going to be a storm , and the lord doesn t always make it easy some more words on being proud to be the first africanamerican coach to win the super bowl and now to peyton manning , who has been named the game mvp which i disagree with , but they show him the new cadillac he won postgame revelry the field fills with photograhpers and sound men dungy makes his way over , and in the middle of the milling throng he and his friend lovie smith embrace and now dungy is put on his players shoulders , no longer wearing his blue colts cap , but now one of those white super bowl champion caps 0 00 , fourth quarter the colts are champions ! 0 20 , fourth quarter are the bears daft \? they run the ball to jones , for 9 they ve given up now dungy gets doused on the sideline by his jubilant players ! one more play , a completion to clark and that s it ! time runs out ! 1 10 , fourth quarter bears come out and complete two quick passes to clark and muhammad now on second down a holding call against the bears chicago on their 29 they go over the middle why \? a short gain 1 40 , fourth quarter the colts go for it on fourth down rather than try a fg so that they can eat up more time and avoid a blocked kick it s run off the left side for a tactical 2 yards bears take over on their 16 1 49 , fourth quarter rhodes on third and 6 gets nothing bears take timeout , their last 1 56 , fourth quarter another run up the middle for 4 yards and now the twominute warning look , you people who are arguing about this in comments , whenever muhsin muhammad gets the ball , the bears fans go mooooo , like all sports fans do for guys with ooo sounds in their name like lou angotti , you blackhawks fans will remember 2 01 , fourth quarter rhodes up the middle , stuffed at the line , and there s also a holding call against the colts lineman ryan lilja 2 40 , fourth quarter rhodes again ! enough for a first down at the bears 21 now he , like jones of chicago , has gained over 100 yards tonight 4 00 , fourth quarter first down , a short gain by rhodes second down , rhodes right up the middle , another big gain ! 15 yards to the chi 32 ! the colts ol scott pushed the man he was blocking literally a dozen yards downfield ! 5 00 , fourth quarter grossman over the middle to desmond clark , but giordano knocks him flat and the ball comes loose incomplete ! and the colts take over on downs that s pretty much it c est fini for the bears 5 15 , fourth quarter another sideline throw to jones , but he s cut down after no gain marlon jackson , the colts db , must be helped off but now , fourth down and 9 ! 5 55 , fourth quarter jones off the right side for 12 to the chicago 46 ! first down , throw too far for clark second and 10 , bears ! grossman a safety valve to jones , and he s cut down after gaining only 2 third down and 8 ! 7 00 , fourth quarter grossman throws to clark , who bobbles but hangs on for 9 another throw to clark for another 10 and again ! to clark for another 6 bears in the hurryup ! 8 00 , fourth quarter a nice punt by smith , hung up high , and hester must take a fair catch on his 7 it s pointed out by jim nantz , the cbs playbyplay man \( who s very good by the way , in that he s straightforward and unobtrusive \) , that hayden , the colt db who returned the int for the touchdown , is from chicago there are a couple of chicago guys on the colts , but no chicago guys on chicago not one one bear was born there and then moved to nigeria when he was 1 can you believe it \? also , the colts have only one guy from indianapolis , a rookie receiver pathetic , no \? 8 09 , fourth quarter addai up the middle for 2 yards not close enough for a fg try so indy will punt smith standing on the center stripe hester back on the 2 yard line now a flag what \? delay of game against indy so smith will have five more yards to punt with 8 30 , fourth quarter right ! vegasmike writes in from sin city to tell us that out there and for millions of pepole all over , this game is still close , depending on how you bet in that universe , the colts are winning by only about 5 big rush on manning , and for once gthey get to him the first sack of manning in the game 9 00 , fourth quarter manning throws to harrison , who s back in the game incomplete near the end zone second and 10 a leisurely snap count and now manning calls time 9 30 , fourth quarter from the chicago 41 , it s addai up the middle , and they can t tackle him ! he s down to the bear 29 ! first down , indy ! 9 55 , fourth quarter grossman throws long he hangs it up

end zone for a touchback first down now for chicago at their 20 jones off the left side , good for 4 second down , bears have to get a copule of scores here in the rain mckie on a safety valve , good for another 3 yards third down ! great protection , and it s complete for 11 to desmond clark for a first down ! 11 44 , fourth quarter it s a touchdown ! and again the moral bankruptcy of the replay review is exposed so the colts have applied what might be the coup de grace , through db hayden , who had never returned an interception for a td in his pro career before ! now the vinatieri convert it s good ! indianapolis 29 , chicago 17 11 44 , fourth quarter a 56yard interception return ! the ball was throw to muhammad , but it was hayden getting it all the way ! and now chicago are challenging , saying that hayden stepped on the sideline as he returned the ball it s very close ! 11 44 , fourth quarter first and 10 grossman throws to the right sideline picked off ! picked off by hayden ! he picks his way up the sideline he moves inside , back outside ! he s still going ! he s going to score ! touchdown indianapolis ! touchdown hayden ! 13 10 , fourth quarter a jones run for 12 is nullified by a holding penalty so first and 20 from the 10 for the bears jones again up the middle , spinning for 6 yards second and 14 now grossman fades , throws , caught over the middle by muhammad ! a colt misses a tackle , and he runs laterally some more before being brought down ! a gain of 21 yards to the 37 ! first down ! it was bethea who missed the tackle for indy 13 38 , fourth quarter so now the colts must punt smith s punt bounds into the end zone they show the replay of harrison s injury his leg was bent like a pretzel under him as the bear secondaryman landed on him still , he s walking it off on the sideline 14 00 , fourth quarter hey , lemme ask you readers who are sending in comments , once the game is over , to describe what it s like where you are , especially if you re in indy or chicago ok , second down manning chased in the backfield ! he throws on the run over the middle to harrison , and he comes down awkwardly and can t hold on he limps off 14 00 , fourth quarter second and 13 trap up the middle to rhodes good for 5 yards and the bears call time ! indy s hurryup offence caught them offguard ! anyway , 150 yards gained by the indy running backs today i hope that helps defuse the cult of the quarterback that informs so much commentary about the super bowl and football in general there s more than just one guy out there , making things go 14 30 , fourth quarter the colts embark on their 67th play of the game ! right up the middle to rhodes , good for 2 yards to the center stripe second down quick huddle a whistle ! false start by an indy lineman 0 00 , third quarter that was the last play of the quarter it s still a game , and we head to the home stretch ! 0 10 , third quarter big play here manning in the gun to throw caught ! a buttonhook to wayne for 8 yards ! first down on their own 48 for the colts 0 30 , third quarter by the way , this perhapscatch was for 9 yards and would leave them a yard short of the first down taking forever , ruining the momentum of the game now the call it s a catch ! third and a long yard to go ! 0 30 , third quarter manning on second down , an out pattern to harrison , who drags his toes to the sideline they call it incomplete it s close ! dungy challenges , and i think he s going to lose this one as well i don t think harrison got his toes down on his right foot very close ! 1 10 , third quarter kickoff returned to the 32 now the colts begin handoff to rhodes , and he s swamped at the line by a newly energized bears defence 1 14 , third quarter gould on for a 44yarder in the rain ! it s up and good ! indianapolis 22 , chicago 17  2 00 , third quarter grossman throws as he s hit incomplete ! second down , 3 yards for jones up the middle third down grossman scrambles ! he throws it up almost picked off ! but incomplete , and the bears will try a fg 3 00 , third quarter up the middle to jones on first down for chitown good for 7 yards they ve been outgained by like 350 yards to 100 second and 3 , jones to the outside , stiff arms brackett , who struggles against him , but enough for the first down at the 28 ! 3 10 , third quarter at last ! the kevin federline commercial ! read about in a couple of minutes here  3 16 , third quarter still only a onescore game it s unbelievable , but the bears could still tie this game on two plays the kickoff taken by gilmore again on the short kick he gets piled into along sideline , and a flag ! it s against mathis of the colts for unnecessary roughness ! what a bonehead play in fact , mathis actually tried to spear gilmore out of bounds with his helmet so the bears get the ball on the colts 40 ! 3 16 , third quarter vinatieri in for a 20yard field goal it s up and good ! but wait ! vinatieri got knocked down a penalty ! we await the call a minor penalty only , running into the kicker dungy declines , and the colts take the points indianapolis 22 , chicago 14 3 45 , third quarter manning audibilizes ostentatiously hands off to rhodes ! he rumbles down to the 2 and he might ve gotten in if he hadn t collided with reggie wayne ! so a bold call almost pays off but once again the colts fail to get the td 4 00 , third quarter manning throws to wayne in the end zone ! but he catches out of bounds second and goal manning over the middle , but dallas clark can t hold it third and goal ! 4 35 , third quarter rhodes again off right tackle for 8 yards ! and now a facemask penalty against danieal manning so now the colts start from the 10 , first and goal ! 5 10 , third quarter handoff to rhodes and he s off ! a bear misses him behind the line , another misses him 10 yards upfield , and another misses him still later finally brought down on a 36 yard gain ! rhodes , a hot knife through the butter of the chicago defence ! 5 30 , third quarter chicago must punt they re really a mess right now maynard s boot is a good one , taken by wilkins , who spins his way up the sideline for 12 yards at the indy 36 that s where the colts will take over let s see if they can put their foot down on the bears now 6 00 , third quarter grossman ! another fumble on the snap ! a keystone kops moment as grossman stumbles and bumbles trying to pick the ball up he finally falls on it and loses 11 more yards ! 6 37 , third quarter first down grossman to mooosin muhammad , for 8 yards second and 2 grossman being chased and sacked ! by booger mcfarland ! a loss of 10 ! third and 12 7 20 , third quarter grossman on first down complete ! over the middle to jones for 13 yards , grossman s longest completion of the day ! 7 20 , third quarter indy to kick off the usual games as to whether they ll kick to hester or whether the bears will hide hester among the blockers straight kickoff , but short taken by te gilmore , he goes maybe five yards and is taken down bears take over on their own 32 7 26 , third quarter well , indy are moving pretty easily through the bears defence , but they cannot seal the deal they keep bogging down in the red zone they should have a pretty big lead by now , but instead it s just 5 points 7 26 , third quarter so vinatieri on for the field goal he missed a short one at the end of the first half , and it s raining hard out there this is from 24 yards up and good ! indianapolis 19 , chicago 14 7 30 , third quarter well , the dispute is whether the bears , who were changing players , got everyone off the field before the snap this is the kind of legalistic silliness that often ruins football games here s the call taking forever and no , the bears had 11 men , indy are charged with a timeout , it s gonna be fourth down , and that was a colossal waste of time 7 30 , third quarter the challenge , oddly enough , is to see whether chicago had too many men on the field still checking 8 00 , third quarter another screen to addai , stopped by urlacher after a gain of 4 third down manning to clark caught , but short of the first ! fourth and 2 from the 6 they ll have to kick a field goal but now a challenge by indy ! 8 27 , third quarter first and 10 from the 14 addai up the middle for 2 second and 8 flag false start , indy so now it s second and 13 from the 17 10 25 , third quarter flare pass to addai , he s wide open , good for a first down on a pickup of 8 ! urlacher a picture of impotent frustration as he pumps his arms angrily after the play 11 00 , third quarter addai off the right side first down ! a 10yard pickup to the chicago 28 ! he got a nice block from the replacement te , the guy who came in for utecht , fletcher now on first down , addai off the right for 3 yards , almost fumbles but manages to hang on second and 7 , addai again for just three third and 5 ! 13 30 , third quarter manning third and 8 , form the gun , complete over the middle to utecht just enough for the first down he got shaken up , and is walking off slowly utecht was critical to that second colts td he actually pushed rhodes across for the six points and here , he gets a first down 14 00 , third quarter another flare pass to the right to addai , good for just 1 yard second and 9 for the colts rain still coming down pretty hard a lateral pass to the left to te dallas clark , good for only another yard they have not been using clark enough today , and it s been hurting them 14 35 , third quarter first down , manning to addai for five yards on a flare pass on second down , manning hands to addai , who goes off the right side for 8 more yards and a first down 14 55 , third quarter and chicago kicks off , taken by wilkins , who returns nicely to the 38 , slipping several tackles en route still more halftime not a great first half , in terms of skill level , but very exciting nevertheless , the colts are slowly establishing dominance , and you can see why they were installed as 7point favorites simply because the afc has been so much better against the nfc for so many years more halftime hello football fans , jeff here , taking over for john woods , whose back on his regular work shift now i , on the other hand , am at home and will do my best not to annoy you , though i can t guarantee anything for those of you who didn t see prince s halftime show , it was awesome virgnia heffernan has more on it , along with what she s been saying about all the commercials , here  halftime lots to keep the youngsters interested in this super bowl five turnovers , three by the bears twice , there were backtoback fumbles the colts really pushed their advantage in total yards during the second quarter , and now it s 25795 which means the bears gained only 15 yards in that second quarter it s mostly been turnovers that have bogged the bears down , but it doesn t bode well grossman , for his part , is playing \( mostly \) mistakefree he is 6 of 8 for a touchdown , but only 32 passing yards and he flubbed an exchange with his center manning has been working harder , completing 17 of 26 passes for 193 yards with a touchdown and a pick 2q 00 well , you won t believe it vinatieri missed it he pushed it to the left , long enough but offtarget whoops 2q 10 rhodes , on first down , another explosive run right up the middle 10 yards , like a streak and a first down manning passes incomplete to the right side on second and 10 from the bears 25 , manning in the gun is flushed out of the pocket , and runs an impromptu option play with rhodes , who takes the pitch \( saving manning from a splatting \) and bulls ahead close to the first down third and 2 , from the 17 , manning under center addai gets the ball , and disappears into brian urlacher s armpit blam ! here comes mr magic legs to try another kick 2q 1 18 egad , mortimer backtoback fumbles again ! this time , on the exchange grossman can t find the handle , and the colts get it right back at the bears 35 2q 1 26 third and 1 , like i said , two tight ends , and manning under center addai takes it inside and gets the first down down to the bears 43 manning to throw on first down , and that looks like it was incomplete wayne had it , but couldn t hang on second and 10 , manning passes again a catch by fletcher , but the ball pops loose ! oh , no ! the bears are on it like a dog on a meatball bears take over at their 36 2q 2 09 addai , again , catching a pass in the flat and he has some room zoink ! but addai is pulled down just short of the marker third and 1 , from the bears 45 and , now , the twominute warning 2q 2 26 colts get a nice return , out across the 30 to the 35 first and 10 , three wide again manning hands off to addai , and he finds a little room , but is pulled down after a gain of 3 second and 7 , manning in the gun addai is open near the left sideline , and he picks up the first down dink and dunk , and that s addai s fifth catch of the day on first down , from the colts 45 , addai is jammed up on an inside give no gain 2q 3 57 grossman passing on first down , goes to the flat and finds jones for a short gain rex has done well , completing 5 of 7 passes but for only 28 yards , kids second and 7 , an inside give to the fullback and another short gain third and 4 , jones gets the handoff and he is tied up , well short of the marker ugh he had room to push his way for a first down , but just did not show any power on that play punt 2q 6 03 woof what a ballgame stinks that i am at work not that i am not grateful to have a job \( ahem \) the bears return of the ensuing kick is out across the 30 to the 37 nice field position and , then , more commercials my time with you all is short the tag comes at halftime , and jeff z klein is taking it from there be kind to him he likes hockey 2q 6 09 rhodes , on first down from the 8 , absolutely cannonballs out of the backfield , right up the middle , and rumbles down close to the goal line on second down , rhodes finishes the job wham ! touchdown ! the extra point is good , and the colts sneak ahead , 1614 2q 6 29 colts take over , and it looks like the rain is coming down harder three wide for the colts , a formation they haven t shown much today manning drops back and hits harrison , zip ! running free on a crossing route ! he is across midfield and shoved out of bounds at about the bears 36 first and 10 , manning drops back , feels a little heat , but rolls right and steps back up and finds clark , wide open , coming back to him complete , gain of 17 , or so first down from the 19 inside give to addai , gain of 3 manning in the gun on second down , a complete pass to clark who is rolled up , just short of the marker third and 1 manning under center , a stretch play to rhodes , and he spins to the outside and gets the first down ! 2q 9 17 punt is returned about a dozen yards , and the colts take over at their 42 2q 9 26 jones on an inside give , from the 22 , gets 4 on first down another handoff to jones on second down , and he gets nowhere third and 6 and a short pass over the middle , and there are a lot of people flying around but it s a gain of 2 , maybe so the bears have to punt 2q 11 11 a solid game so far well worth all the pregame noise and headache colts kick off , and continue to keep it away from hester this time , because the bears moved him up , and so he was not the deep back kick is returned to about the 20 2q 11 17 and it s good ! vinatieri is still money colts creep closer , and trail by 149 2q 11 23 manning under center , a stretch play to addai he is run out of bounds , loss of 3 second and 13 , manning under center short drop , has pressure in his face , and retreats a few more steps , turns back to his right and hits harrison gain of , maybe , 4 someone better tell vinatieri to dry off his helmet third and 9 , manning passes to addai on a screen nothing doing here comes vinatieri , the greatest kicker since the first rockette 2q 14 00 manning passes to harrison on first down , and harrison has a first down and a little more just a little out pattern first down from the bears 31 manning under center a give inside to addai , and he rumbles forward for about 6 second and 4 manning changes the play another give to addai , and he bulls across the 20 , to about the 17 first down 2q 15 00 so far , the rain has been a bit of a factor a couple of fumbles so far , two by the bears , in fact i guess a florida rainshower is not quite the same as a chicago blizzard both teams look ok the colts have outgained the bears , 11880 but they trail by 8 1q 09 no return on the punt it s downed at the colts 42 manning back in the gun , he has time hits addai in the flat , and addai charges out along the right sideline for a first down that s the end of the first quarter , kids time to take a breather 1q 39 grossman , on second down , passes to berrian on a fade route it s a nice pass and complete but berrian is way out of bounds so , third and 7 a draw play , inside to thomas and he is short of the first down bears will punt injury timeout benson is still down they are futzing his his left leg now , he is up and walking to the sideline 1q 1 16 on first down , from their 4 , a nice hard run by benson , but not really redeeming himself gain of 3 and a bear is down it s benson 1q 1 33 flag on the bears on the punt a neutralzone infraction not enough yardage for a first down , though so , the punt still goes it bounds inside the 10 , and is downed at the 4 1q 1 46 first down from the bears 43 , rhodes churns outside for not much on second down , manning drops back and his pass is tipped away third down and 9 manning in the gun , a fade route to harrison and that ball was probably too long for him , but he almost came up with it good defense by vasher , but harrison had it in his hands so close punt 1q 2 34 hester has everyone s attention now , and he backtracks on his return before being run out of bounds first down from their 35 grossman gets jostled as he passes , and finds berrian complete \? it s close to midfield , but they are wondering if he had his feet in bounds he doesn t , but was probably shoved out by a couple of colts no challenge from the colts , so who cares first and 10 , from the 38 cedric benson powers off tackle and gets smacked pretty hard and bloop ! out comes the football ! yeek ! colts scoop it up 1q 3 18 two tight ends the camera lens starting to fog over inside give to dominic rhodes and a big collision , a powerful hit and he hits the turf no gain second down , manning slips into something more comfortable the shotgun a quick pass , to fletcher , and a short gain third down and 7 in the gun again the bears getting a solid pass rush , but they haven t knocked manning over yet another quick pass , this time a slant route incomplete colts punt 1q 4 27 so many big plays in a row barely any time to blog first , the long pass by manning to wayne for a score then backtoback fumbles then jones on a straight , freighttrain run for 52 yards and another score by the bears eight minutes into this thing , and it s , like , wow someone bring me a cold drink on the ensuing kick , the returner is jacked up at the 17 colts take over 1q 4 34 grossman hits muhammad on a jagged outandin route , and bing ! just like that , another touchdown ! nothing you can do just snap , drop and throw extra point is good , and the bears come right back and expand their lead , 146 1q 4 45 the hits keep coming ! thomas jones , on an inside give , skips into the open field and voom ! he is gone ! 50plus yards in a foot race and , finally , down at the colts 5 ! first down , a short gain on a running play second down , jones heads for the sideline , and can get no headroom at all third down and goal 1q 6 00 the kick , now , and an upman fields it and , whoops ! he drops it ! doubleyoy ! and the colts have it ! at the bears 34 first down , colts another fumble ! it really is raining , kids that was supposed to be a little stretch play to addai , but a bear was right at his feet and jammed the whole play up bears take over , now from their 43 1q 7 14 it s a real gully washer down there the seconddown pass is incomplete manning s throw tied up the receiver running a crossing route , a little behind him third and 10 manning in the gun has time , flushed a little bit , hit as he throws and reggie wayne is wide open ! holy mackeral ! wide open and scores a touchdown ! just like that ! the extra point , uh , is not good the long snap hit the holder in the hands and he just flubbed it yike colts get close , 76 1q 9 13 colts hurry up short pass to addai on first down for about 5 one second down , a draw play to addai and he gets tied up in traffic short gain third and 4 manning in the gun he has time , passes to dallas clark on the sideline first down , from their 48 manning under center , another draw to addai and not much there 1q 11 20 touchback colts take over a their 20 , a give inside to addai he gets about 6 it s raining pretty good second and 4 , two tight ends manning audibles a stretch play to addai , and he bulls ahead for about 2 more third and 2 manning drops back in the gun passes on a short slant to marvin harrison , first down ! to about the 35 1q 11 30 manning did the same sort of stuff against the ravens , earlier in the playoffs the bears had coverage over the top first down , and grossman completes his first pass gain of about 7 second down , and a running play right up the gut no gain the colts celebrate a little after that stuff third down and 7 , grossman passes long and the ball hangs way up in the air no one really has a chance to catch that , but the colts defenders give it a game effort fourth down and the first punt coming up 1q 12 48 third and 12 , a long pass up the right sideline and and this time manning is picked ! yoink ! he let it fly , and it was caught by the bears chris harris he just jumped up and caught it , like he and manning planned it that way first down bears , at their 35 1q 13 10 another pass from manning , and also almost picked the receiver fell down before the ball got there , maybe he slipped no call second and 15 , from the 39 addai catches a pass in the flat , and gets about 8 on third and 7 , another flag another false start on the colts 1q 14 30 manning , on first down passes incomplete almost picked by urlacher second and 10 , out of the run manning hands off to his blocking back and joseph addai has firstdown yardage and more on first down from the colts 39 , a false start on the colts 1q 14 45 better still than starting on defense is to run the kick back for a score hester broke through a few colts milling around right at the beginning , and then just veered to the right sideline pure speed nifty running on the ensuing kick , the colts get the return out to about the 31 and , so , here comes manning kickoff last thoughts from the talking heads esiason says it s always better to start on defense , so a crushing blow dealt the bears vinatieri puts the ball on the tee , and we will be cooking with gas here , only two minutes late ! the boot sails to about the 5 , and hester takes off he is absolutely gone touchdown ! the crowd goes nuts what a return here comes the extra point it s good bears take an early lead , 70 1 minute to kickoff bears win the toss ! chicago , with a crushing victory in the first test of the day ! 3 minutes to kickoff oooh ! the coin toss ! first , a plodding introduction of the team captains and lamar hunt s widow and dan marino as honorary captains and the ref steps forward here s the toss , kids ! 5 minutes to kickoff it really is raining a bit they just showed urlacher , sans helmet , and the raindrops were plinking him in the head it was kind of pretty the game is being showed , the tv dudes just said , in 176 countries anyone in malaysia today \? 8 minutes to kickoff a moment of silence , and now billy joel singing the national anthem 12 minutes to kickoff and there are the bears , in their standard white pants navy top home unis rex grossman immediately reaches for a football and starts to warm up every little bit helps , rex technical problems during brian urlacher s onfield interview may have been the wisest he has sounded all season 14 minutes to kickoff a whitebread voice comes over the pa welcome , to dolphin stadium and super bowl fortyone ! the colts get introduced first they are wearing their all white road unis peyton jogs out purposefully and calls a huddle of his boys don t embarrass me , he says they got a microphone in tony dungy s face he says coming out on the field for the super bowl feels a little different huh you think \? 18 minutes to kickoff esiason is holding forth on defensive theory now he muses , is brian urlacher up to the job \? why wasn t i \? why do i always have to call a football game in a blue blazer \? it s raining in miami , kids player introductions are next 21 minutes to kickoff ooh is this exciting , or what \? i m excited i really am now , it s a strange montage , which must be a commercial for something no , it can t be a commercial it s still going blah , blah on and on it appears to be pep talk of sorts , by cbs for its viewers to sum up the super bowl is only a few minutes away submit to our advertisers will on the field now , i think , is some version of the air force band and the playbyplay guys are warming up their gabbers 32 minutes to kickoff and a faux marching band with all its members dressed in colts uniforms apparently , there is some kind of dance competition going on the soleil people have a scoreboard of their own running , and the colts are ahead \( i am not making any of this up \) 35 minutes to kickoff gloria estefan introduced , i think , an onfield performance by cirque du soleil it s going on right now and , frankly , it doesn t blog very well suffice it to say , if you were feeling woozy when you turned on the tv right now , you have probably passed out it s very las vegas large colorful balloons of animals and , uh , whatever streamers a bizarre flag corps of wigwearing men and then a couple of guys wearing football jerseys , who might be interlopers from the grandstand 42 minutes to kickoff here come the picks from the cbs brain trust boomer esiason , another oneanddone super bowl quarterback , picks the colts , 3121 marino starts off by making excuses for manning , saying he doesn t have to have a big game marino picks colts , 3124 and now the evercomposed shannon sharpe he picks the colts , too , though he says he would not be surprised if the bears win the ultimate hedge 50 minutes to kickoff the colts are going back to the locker room after warming up on the field cbs just showed an interview of peyton manning by dan marino a little career advice for manning stay away from marino that s one name you don t want associated with yours today  which team , after winning the super bowl today , is better poised to turn into something like a dynasty \? the colts , with a young running back in joseph addai and a notyet old quarterback in peyton manning \? or the bears , with an enduring defense that has blended reliable veterans with sparkling rookies \? now for pregame posturing if you believe what s been written and said about super bowl xli , the colts are pretty much a sure thing to win never mind that they have been dismissed for years as postseason choke artists they are 7point favorites , not an insignificant spread in the paritydriven nfl , and they are picked by an overwhelming number of talking heads and bloggers few would have picked the colts four weeks ago they have had better teams , on paper anyway , in recent seasons and none were the last team standing but the bears are not even familiar with that much success everyone knows it s been 21 years since their last super bowl , but this year s bears team is only the third over the past decade to have a winning record call it a mishmash of the midway colts fans have kept the faith , stoically believing that manning will someday do what no one in his family ever has and bears fans , many of them carrying on like a reallife saturday night live skit , are hungry to once again talk with a swagger about their team let s start with this a lot has been made of manning and his highpowered offense , but this game is not that simple to break down the colts averaged more than 379 yards a game , ranked third in the league that s a long touchdown drive better than the bears , who averaged 324 , in itself about average among nfl teams turn to scoring , though , and the picture changes the colts were second with 267 points a game , tied for second in the league with guess who \? the bears the colts may possess the offensive blue chips , but the bears seem to have a diversified portfolio of points off long returns and turnovers and move on to this just as much has been made of the struggles of bears quarterback rex grossman , and those are just as deceptive his regularseason numbers have been compared favorably by this newspaper to those of hall of famers , but the statistics mask an inconsistent season grossman was a fantasy darling at times he had a passer rating of 986 or higher in eight games this season but his game log is pockmarked with real stinkers 16 of his 23 interceptions came in five games lately , though , grossman has been mostly blemishfree over his past five games , he has thrown only three picks , all of them in a meaningless seasonending loss to the packers and , finally , this arrayed against grossman is a colts defense that is a similar picture of inconsistency the colts are allowing an average of 332 yards a game , ranked 21st in the league that includes a stingy pass defense , ranked second at 159 yards a game , and a generous run defense , ranked dead last at 173 yards a game the colts were memorably routed by 4417 on dec 10 when the jaguars rang up 375 rushing yards , but they also defeated two topfive offenses this season the saints and the eagles not to mention shutting down powerful ground games in playoff wins against the chiefs and the ravens the prediction for my money , none of it wagered on this game , one thing will keep bears fans from pounding their chests and sputtering , sausage ! ditka ! sausage ! and that s a scheme that can contain manning long enough for the bears offense to score enough to win scheming manning is no easy trick , though over the past four regular seasons , manning and the colts have fared predictably well against the league s top defenses or , for the purposes of my nonscientific survey , any defense that allowed an average of fewer than 300 yards a game over a season the colts played 21 games against those teams and won 13 times this season , they won five of six games against such defenses , including playoff victories against the ravens and the patriots defense wins championships , they say but offense scores touchdowns no doubt this will be a close game if the bears could count on their defense producing points , i think that would be enough to tip the scales in their favor but turnovers aren t about planning in the end , i think manning will come through in his biggest game yet and the colts defense will show a flash of whatever it was that coach tony dungy used to polish the buccaneers grossman won t melt down but , by the end of the game , he won t

the international community s policy in afghanistan is based on the claim that afghans are willing partners in the creation of a liberal democratic state senator john mccain finished a recent speech on afghanistan by saying , billions of people around the world now embrace the ideals of political , economic and social liberty , conceived in the west , as their own in afghanistan in january , tony blair thanked afghans by saying we 're all in this together and placing them in the group of people who want to live in peace and harmony with each other , whatever your race or your background or your religion such language is inaccurate , misleading and dangerous afghans , like americans , do not want to be abducted and tortured they want a say in who governs them , and they want to feed their families but reducing their needs to broad concepts like human rights , democracy and development is unhelpful for many afghans , sharia law is central others welcome freedom from torture , but not free media or freedom of religion majority rule , but not minority rights full employment , but not freemarket reforms warlords retain considerable power millions believe that alcohol should be forbidden and apostates killed , that women should be allowed in public only in burqas many pusthu clearly prefer the taliban to foreign troops yet senior officials with long experience with afghanistan often deny this reality they insist that taliban fighters have next to no local support and are purely pakistani agents the un argues that warlords have little power and that the tribal areas can rapidly be brought under central control the british defense secretary predicted last summer that british troops in helmand province could return without a bullet fired afghan cabinet ministers insist that narcotics growth and corruption can be ended and the economy can wean itself off foreign aid in five years none of this is true and most of them halfknow it it is not only politicians who misrepresent the facts nonprofit groups endorse the fashionable jargon of statebuilding and civil society , partly to win grants military officers are reluctant to admit their mission is impossible journalists were initially surprisingly optimistic about transforming afghanistan no one wants to seem to endorse a status quo dominated by the taliban and drugs humankind cannot bear very much reality , particularly in afghanistan does it matter \? most people see our misrepresentations as an unappealing but necessary part of international politics the problem is that we act on the basis of our own lies british soldiers were killed because they were not prepared for the helmand insurgency in the same province , the coalition recommended a westernfriendly technocrat as governor he was so isolated and threatened he could barely leave his office hundreds of millions of dollars invested in anticorruption efforts , and the police and the counternarcotics ministry , has been wasted on afghans with no interest in our missions other programs are perceived as a threat to local culture and have bred anger and resentment still others have raised expectations we cannot fulfill , betraying our friends i experienced this in iraq , where i encouraged two friends to start gender and civil society programs we were unable to protect them , and both were killed even when we fail , instead of recognizing the errors of the initial assessment and the mission , we blame problems in implementation and repeat false and illogical claims in order to acquire more money and troops the time has come to be honest about the limits of our power and the afghan reality this is not to counsel despair there is no fighting in the streets of kabul , the hazara in the center of the country are more secure and prosperous than at almost any time in their history , and the economy grew last year by 18 percent these are major achievements with luck and the right kind of international support , afghanistan can become more humane , prosperous and stable but progress will be slow real change can come only from within , and we have less power in afghanistan than we claim we must speak truthfully about this situation our lies betray afghans and ultimately ourselves and the cost in lives , opportunities and reputation is unbearable
the census bureau typically uses the decennial census to test datacollection methods that become routine later on the 2010 census should include a test run at counting the nation s 14 million prison inmates at their permanent addresses instead of in prisons that would help bring an end to a corrosive but little known practice that distorts the political process in virtually every corner of the country inmates are denied the right to vote in all but two states but state lawmakers treat them as residents of the prisons when drawing legislative maps , to inflate the head count in lightly populated rural areas where prisons are typically built this creates legislative districts where none would ordinarily be , shifting political influence from the heavily populated urban districts where inmates live once inflated , these towns and counties siphon an outsized portion of state and federal aid politicians in districts with prisons sometimes brag openly about the windfall , as they mock constituents who are powerless to remove them from office and are packed onto buses and driven hundreds of miles to their real homes the minute they leave the prison walls the census bureau was made pointedly aware of this problem last fall a report it commissioned noted that counting inmates at prisons distorted the political process and raised legitimate concerns about the fairness of the census itself that report , by the national research council , recognized that the methods would not be simple to change , but urged the bureau to seeks ways to do it collecting and verifying residential information for prison inmates is a complicated job but the report suggested a perfectly reasonable interim solution the bureau could publish detailed counts of the prison populations , so that the inmates could be subtracted at redistricting time these figures would illuminate corrupt redistricting committees that use prison counts to pad districts that fall short of federal population requirements the census bureau has a crucial role to play in putting and end to this despicable practice the 2010 census is as good a time as any to get started
marseille , france , july 18 when c dric vasseur crossed the finish line here to win the 10th stage of the tour de france on wednesday , he did so in the signature image of the world s biggest cycling race arms raised , the logo of his team s corporate sponsors , quick stepinnergetic , splashed across his chest the overall standings were little changed , with michael rasmussen of rabobank remaining in the leader s yellow jersey but there was good reason for vasseur s celebration as much as cycling is about sport , it is also about advertising and the tour de france , more than any other event , is the time when companies hope to reap the benefit of the millions of dollars they spend each year supplying teams with salaries , uniforms , bikes , hotel rooms and all manner of luxury the presence of advertising at the tour can hardly be overstated each of the main prizes in the race for the overall winner , the best mountain climber , the best sprinter and so forth conforms to the colors or logo of its corporate sponsor the race is preceded each day over its entire route by a publicity caravan , a milelong parade of 45 corporate floats it should not be surprising then , that the racers' strategies and their sponsors' goals may coincide while every sponsor wants to see one of its riders cross the finish line first , there can only be one winner of each stage but there is another , relatively simple way for a sponsor to get hours of television time the breakaway usually a feature of the long , flat stages that travel 120 miles or more , a breakaway occurs when a small group of cyclists rides away from the pack , or peloton , gaining several minutes' advantage in the hope of staying ahead until reaching the finish line most often , a breakaway can look like an exercise in futility a few cyclists riding alone for hours , only to be caught by the pack within a mile or two of the finish even when the group makes it alone to the end of the stage , the charge to the finish inevitably brings disappointment for all but one of the riders disappointment that would appear to outweigh the effort not for the sponsors , however it s just a great advertising board , said bradley wiggins , a british rider who went on a solo breakaway of 118 miles in the sixth stage wiggins s effort was particularly appreciated at the offices of his team s sponsor , cofidis , a french company that provides consumer loans i had nearly four hours television coverage the other day on my own , which is for free in many respects , wiggins said if cofidis were to buy that advertising space , it would cost them a lot of money fabrice lepeu , the corporate liaison to the team sponsored by bouygues telecom , a french mobile phone company , said that a sponsor prefers for a rider on its team to win the stage but especially when a team is looking for a sponsor for next year , lepeu said , it is important for them after the tour to be able to go to potential sponsors and say , look , you would have been seen for two or three hours on television on the tour' the level of television exposure is significant , indeed , particularly for companies doing business in france the french television broadcast of the tour has regularly been reaching more than 45 million viewers in france , accounting for nearly half the television audience , according to figures released by the broadcasters almost immediately after the start wednesday , riders began jockeying for position by little more than a mile into the stage , six riders had moved away from the peloton they quickly opened a lead of more than a minute on the main pack , and with the highestplaced of the six riders more than an hour behind the race leader in the standings meaning that none of the riders were a threat to the overall leaders it looked like the group might succeed at its escape but not everyone was happy bouygues telecom did not have a rider in the breakaway , this on a day when the racers were headed toward marseille , france s secondlargest city cofidis and gerolsteiner , a german team sponsored by a mineral water company , also had no riders in the breakaway , so the three teams worked together to close the gap by the 23mile mark , less than an hour into the chase , the breakaway was caught the entire peloton rode together until the first hill of the day , 35 miles into the stage , when marcus burghardt of tmobile escaped burghardt was let go because he was more than 90 minutes behind the race leaders in the standings , but he soon was joined by a group of 10 others who wanted some share of the glory the 10 riders , all of them more than 24 minutes behind the race leader , represented nine teams csc , liquigas , rabobank , lampre , cr dit agricole , cofidis , fran aise des jeux , quick step and milram the group , which led the peloton by as much as 14 minutes , was a mix of experienced riders and relatively new ones on a scorching day , with temperatures above 100 degrees on the road , it was the experienced riders who put their wits to work seventeen miles from the finish , five men broke away from the breakaway , among them three of the more experienced riders in the peloton vasseur and sandy casar of france , and jens voigt of germany the fiveman group opened an advantage of more than a minute , and then , in the final two miles , the riders began their own attacks , counterattacks , feigned sprints and all manner of riding to gain an advantage in the final half mile , most of the riders were watching one another , so vasseur took off to the right he edged casar at the finish line by little more than an inch crossing the line , vasseur thrust his arms into the air there , for all to see , was the logo of quick step , a belgian maker of laminate floor coverings , and innergetic , which makes latex foam mattresses both products available in france
the northampton community college softball team is about as unlikely a success story as you can get the college , in bethlehem , pa , offers no athletic scholarships most of the players work full time while attending classes as community college athletes , they spend a maximum of two years on the team before moving on , so turnover is a constant problem yet the lady spartans have somehow managed to put together a 93game winning streak one of the longest in the history of college athletics and what the school says is the record number of consecutive wins in a team sport northampton completed a threegame sweep of montgomery college of rockville , md , last sunday to pass the 92game winning streak of mia hammled north carolina in women s soccer from 198993 the mark also surpasses the 88game winning streak posted by john woodencoached ucla in men s basketball from 197173 the lady spartans , the twotime defending state champions , have beaten up plenty on fellow community colleges in pennsylvania , some of whom have trouble even fielding teams from year to year but many of northampton s victories have come against squads from much bigger programs that , at least on paper , should have had no trouble winning the longtime coach sam carrodo , 46 , credits good pitching and defense , excellent team speed and smart hitters \( through 15 games , northampton is batting 497 with 155 runs \) but what really binds his players , he says , is a love of the game they just have a drive and a passion , he says i just let them go i just let the reins out and let them fly the lady spartans have not lost since april 24 , 2004 , when nearby lehigh carbon community college ended their season with a 95 victory the team was 400 in 2005 and 380 last year they were 150 heading into yesterday s game perhaps the most amazing aspect of the streak is that no one is left from the 2005 squad only three players returned in 2006 , and six in 2007 carrodo has overcome the turnover problem by recruiting as heavily as a bigtime college coach he scours club rosters and attends lots of tournaments , then targets the players he wants recruiting has become easier in recent years as the wins mounted good players now seek out northampton carrodo recently brought 14 recruits onto campus for a tour , and all 14 committed the 2007 roster is stocked with good stories as well as good players there is pitcher and outfielder kristy kroll , 23 , a dental hygiene major from nearby nazareth , who joined the team this year after completing a yearlong tour of duty in iraq with a national guard medical unit this is good stress , compared to life or death , she says there is right fielder katie sculley , 19 , who logs 35 hours a week as a waitress while majoring in legal administration once you come out and start playing , it s like an awakening , says sculley , who worked till 12 30 am on a friday , then showed up for practice , then had to write an english paper , then was due back at work at 4 30 pm once you 're on the field , she says , you just forget about being tired there is the nursing major tami kilousky , 21 , a star pitcher on the 2002 kutztown \( pa \) high school state champion softball team , who overcame a broken collarbone , a long layoff from the sport and the objections of her academic advisers to earn the team s 93rd consecutive win last sunday the nursing department told me not to play softball because of the demands of the major , kilousky says they highly advised against it carrodo says his players have been calm and collected throughout the streak unlike their coach , who , until last sunday , had been utterly stressed out they 're more worried about me because they see the concern on me , and the worry on me , and the stress it s been on me and they try to take that way by saying , coach , just relax do n't worry about anything' carrodo rarely , if ever , yells he keeps his tiny office stocked with candy , cocoa and oatmeal for his players they do n't call him coach , but sam above all , carrodo says , he just wants them to have a good time , because they have plenty else in their lives to stress over the thing that keeps them around and keeps them focused is we let them have fun , carrodo says i do n't put pressure on them i do n't make this the no 1 priority in their lives northampton has racked up some impressive wins during the streak , including a 54 victory over brookdale \( nj \) community college , the defending national junior college champion but many of its victories have been rather lopsided affairs dominant in its own league the 13member eastern pennsylvania collegiate conference , none of the members of which offer athletic scholarships northampton hungers for better competition , but is having trouble finding it for example , the softball team of nearby lafayette college , which plays in ncaa division i , has declined carrodo s invitation five years running , he says and who can blame it \? there is little incentive for a team from a fouryear school to play the lady spartans it s a nowin situation for them , says carrodo , who has compiled a 22034 record in 10 years as head coach if they beat us , they 're supposed to if we beat them , it s not supposed to happen northampton initially claimed the longest winning streak in any college sport , but subsequently learned that a trio of racket sports teams a squash team from connecticut , a men s tennis team from florida and a women s tennis team from hawaii all claimed longer streaks

of all the possible vulnerabilities facing senator s presidential campaign , mrs clinton has long believed that the one of the biggest was money , friends and advisers say some sort of fundraising scandal that would echo the clintonera controversies of the 1990s and make her appear greedy or ethically challenged as a result , mrs clinton told aides this year to vet major donors carefully and help her avoid situations in which she might appear to be trading access for big money , advisers said also to be avoided , the senator said , were fundraising tactics that might conjure up the clinton white house coffees and the ties to relatively unknown donors offering large sums , like the asian businessmen who sent checks to the democratic national committee yet nine months into her campaign , mrs clinton is grappling with exactly the situation she feared giving up nearly 900 , 000 that had been donated or raised by norman hsu , a onetime fugitive and one of her top fundraisers , whose actions raise serious questions about how well the campaign vetted its donors as a result , mrs clinton now finds herself linked to a convicted criminal who brought in tens of thousands of dollars from potentially tainted sources the hsu case has revived ugly memories for voters about the democratic fundraising scandals when bill clinton was president , the senator s campaign advisers acknowledge , a time when both clintons were often photographed with people whose money later turned out to be dirty , including johnny chung and charlie trie mrs clinton is running on her white house experience in the 1990s , and any attention cast on past fundraising controversies could threaten her image with voters even some of her own major donors are aghast that , given the clintons' past problems with fundraising , mrs clinton s vetting process did not uncover mr hsu s criminal history even though mr hsu had previously donated to other politicians and charities without his past surfacing , these donors say , the clinton operation had been widely considered one of the bestrun in recent campaigns until now people have often said about the clintons , they do n't care who they hang out with as long as the people can be helpful to them , said one of mrs clinton s major fundraisers the larger point in all of this is that the clintons are the ultimate pragmatists in who they hang out with if you can be useful to them , they will find a way to make it work advisers say mrs clinton is not so much furious about the scandal , as she is worried about containing the political damage to that end , clinton campaign aides refused yesterday to release the names of the 260 donors whom mr hsu recruited to the campaign , preferring to wait until they finish their own research on the individuals mrs clinton and her advisers are concerned that rival campaigns or the news media will dig into the background of each donor , and they want to be prepared if some of the donors end up having money funneled to them from mr hsu or have shady backgrounds the campaign is refunding 850 , 000 to these donors , viewing the money as tainted yet the campaign is also risking another public relations mess by saying that it would take back the money if it clearly came from the donor s bank account , not from mr hsu or another source the risk is that mrs clinton will appear to want more cash no matter whether it was once colored by a disgraced donor the campaign will try to get most of the donors to give the money back right after the refunds , said a senior democratic strategist who advises mrs clinton s campaign that s the plan , the strategist said the strategist , who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal campaign deliberations , added that the clinton campaign was deeply worried that the controversy could grow they are worried there are more out there , the strategist said bundlers the feeling is there are a few more that will have hsu problems in defense , clinton advisers note that her top democratic rivals , senator barack obama and john edwards , have their own fundraising problems that will prevent them from attacking her over mr hsu mr obama has taken only a measured approach when dealing with donations raised by antoin rezko , a chicago developer facing federal corruption charges while mr obama has given to charity contributions from people connected to the criminal case involving mr rezko , he has kept thousands of dollars more that mr rezko raised from others mr edwards , a former north carolina senator , is saddled with geoffrey fieger , a lawyer who was indicted last month on charges of using straw donors to funnel illegally more than 125 , 000 to mr edwards s 2004 presidential campaign the clinton campaign has done as much if not more than any campaign to protect itself from situations such as this , and none of the other campaigns , other than hypocritically , can point a finger at the clinton campaign on fundraising problems , said hassan nemazee , who is a fundraising bundler for mrs clinton , as mr hsu had been advisers to mr obama note that mr hsu has been convicted on a fraud charge while mr rezko s trial is pending next year asked whether the rezko case would hamper an obama attack over mr hsu , an obama spokesman , bill burton , said yesterday ultimately we assume that voters will choose based on the record and the vision that candidates have in reforming the role of money in politics an edwards spokesman , eric schultz , declined to say whether his campaign had decided to attack mrs clinton directly over mr hsu mr schultz added , if geoffrey fieger is found guilty , the campaign will donate all the money in question to charity the clinton campaign has been monitoring coverage of the hsu case we do n't think the hsu story has broken through with voters at this point , one clinton adviser said and we 're going to keep trying to make sure it does n't overshadow her message
moscow , nov 8 the president of , mikheil saakashvili , today called for a special presidential election on jan 5 , saying he would test whether he retained a mandate a day after a police crackdown and clashes with opposition demonstrators led the government to declare a state of emergency mr saakashvili , said that a referendum would also be held on jan 5 to determine the timing of parliamentary elections , which the opposition had demanded for next spring mr saakashvili s surprise announcement marked an effort to alleviate the domestic unrest and international concern after the police action in tbilisi , the country s capital , and the suspension of civil liberties the president also said that the state of emergency would end soon , although he did say when more than 500 people were injured in the crackdown and clashes , none of them fatally , the government said in the aftermath , public assembly was banned by mr saakashvili s emergency order and two opposition television stations were forced off the air one of the stations , imeditv , carried the country s most popular news programs it was occupied by special forces officers the government accused it of inciting unrest after it broadcast a statement from one of its owners , badri patarkatsishvili , calling for the end of mr saakashvili s government newspapers and foreign news broadcasts were not available in the capital today and the police filled the streets residents wondered whether their country , a young and fragile democracy in a turbulent corner of the former soviet union , would backslide into authoritarian rule appearing on national television at 7 pm , three hours after calling the american ambassador in tbilisi and notifying him of his plans for snap elections , mr saakashvili both defended the police action and expressed a degree of regret he said he had been forced to act against a plot organized by russia to destabilize georgia and threaten its independence and experiment in democracy , and insisted that he was protecting the country and not his own power my chair is worth nothing to me we care about countries , not chairs , he said demand and you will receive you demanded early elections here they are early elections come and decide who you want to vote for i do not want to be the president of a country that limits mass media and that declares emergency rule , he added i can only rule the country if i have a renewed mandate from the people he called on international organizations to send as many election observers as possible to ensure that the campaign and the voting would be free , fair and clean russia has denied playing a role in the protests , which mr saakashvili has said were coordinated in part by russian intelligence officers working with several opposition leaders this is nothing but an attempt to cover their own helplessness in resolving internal problems , said mikhail kamynin , russia s foreign ministry spokesman , said on russia s national nighttime news relations between the kremlin and georgia , which was occupied for decades by the soviet union , are bitter mr saakashvili , in his nearly four years in office , has made membership in nato and the european union among his top foreign policy goals , and had eagerly developed relations with the united states the opposition has also said it was determined to remain free of moscow s influence and protect georgian independence mr saakashvili s announcement effectively shaved nearly a year off his presidential term it also marked a sharp shift from his emphatic refusal to change election dates or compromise with opposition demands the opposition accuses mr saakashvili , an energetic politician , of running georgia through a clique and of punishing dissent and using the police , prosecutors and judges for political tasks it also says that mr saakashvili has hoarded power and become aloof in the four year since peaceful protests led to the collapse of the postsoviet government of eduard shevardnadze and brought him to office the government clearly hoped the announcement would shift the opposition from a protest stance to a campaign stance , and demonstrate to voters and georgia s international allies alike that mr saakashvili , under intense pressure , was committed to democracy and had not chosen an autocratic path although it was not clear whether mr saakashvili s concession would calm the anger among georgia s citizens after the events of the previous day , the declaration of a special election was cheered by opposition leaders , who called it a victory and vindication of their protests saakashvili , i think , understood when he woke up that he basically fought against the whole country , tina khidasheli , a leader of the republican party , one of the many parties in the opposition movement , said by telephone i think that is what broke him finally the reaction of the people there has not been an opposition politician in georgia of mr saakashvili s stature since he rose to power but opponents said he had severely miscalculated with the crackdown , and that voters would reject him at the polls on jan 5 i believe he is done , ms khidasheli said i believe he has no chances mr patarkatsishvili , the coowner of imeditv and widely seen as georgia s wealthiest man , cautioned the opposition and its supporters against overconfidence he issued a statement from outside the country warning that much remained uncertain about how the election would be conducted , and predicted that mr saakashvili s government would prevent prominent candidates from seeking office some of the potential candidates are too young under the election law , he said , and one , salome zourabichvili , a former foreign minister , has not held citizenship long enough to seek the office in what appeared to be a reference to himself , he predicted that others would be declared enemies of the state the authorities are doing their utmost to prevent the real opposition from participating in the elections , he said , and added that the opposition must consolidate and nominate a single candidate with a clear program one western diplomat that while mr saakashvili s future as president was not guaranteed , he appeared for the moment to remain the country s preeminent politician the diplomat expressed relief that mr saakashvili had offered a political solution to the crisis as i understand it , this was the result of a lot of discussion within the government , the diplomat said by telephone he requested anonymity in keeping with diplomatic protocol there is obviously a calculated risk here but he has reversed course many questions remained about the campaign and election ahead lincoln a mitchell , a columbia university professor who closely follows georgian politics and lived in tbilisi from 2002 through 2004 , said , for example , that to ensure a chance at a fair election imeditv would have to be allowed to broadcast as an independent station the station remained off the air tonight he said that mr saakashvili had assessed the political field and scheduled an election that would be difficult to lose this election is not the election the opposition wants , because oneonone no one can beat saakashvili , he said by telephone is this really a gesture \? or is it a clever trick \? the shift in the government s position was made as mr saakashvili and his government faced mounting international dismay aside from the question of who would win the election on jan 5 was the question of whether mr saakashvili had tarnished his image permanently witnesses , diplomats , journalists and demonstrators described a frightening clampdown , as riot police used tear gas , rubber bullets , batons and water cannon to chase demonstrators from the streets of tbilisi there were reports and video recordings of the police beating demonstrators who offered no resistance and of demonstrators in custody or prone on the ground the police also attacked some of the journalists on the streets , and seized or destroyed their equipment there was also a brief clash today between demonstrators and the police at a university in batumi , on the black sea the united nations , nato , the european union and the organization for security and cooperation in europe all expressed concern at the country s descent into official violence or the imposition of a state of emergency thomas hammarberg , the commissioner for human rights of the council of europe s parliamentary assembly , decried the crackdown my reaction is that , obviously , according to the reports we have received , there was excessive use of violence by the police against the demonstrators , he said by telephone mr hammarberg said he was also alarmed that georgia s human rights ombudsman , sozar subari , was severely beaten by the police , even after he identified himself , and that independent news sources had been shut down he said that international human rights observers remained uncertain how many people had been arrested and how they had been treated the blockade on news is a problem there , because the facts did not come out , he said there were indications that the authorities themselves , while they said that a police action was justified , were disturbed by elements of the events shota utiashvili , a senior official in the interior ministry , said that the ministry planned to investigate allegations of police misconduct and brutality once the state of emergency was lifted we will sit down and investigate these cases once the crisis is over , he said by telephone he added that officers who beat journalists and seized or damaged their equipment had acted illegally every officer had clear instructions not to touch the journalists , which they did not all follow , and we will investigate , he said mr utiashvili said none of the opposition leaders were in custody he added that a few dozen demonstrators had been arrested and would be charged in administrative court with charges , including hooliganism , that carry fines or sentences of not more than 30 days in jail
isa chandra moskowitz , a vegan chef , does not particularly like to talk about tofu ditto seitan , tempeh and nutritional yeast i think vegan cooks need to learn to cook vegetables first , she said last week during a cupcakebaking marathon then maybe they can be allowed to move on to meat substitutes ms moskowitz , 34 , was born in coney island hospital , lives in brooklyn , and is a typically impatient and opinionated new yorker she ca n't stand how slowly most cooks peel garlic , makes relentless fun of rachael ray and rolls her eyes at the mention of california hippies but as a vegan and a follower of punk music since age 14 , she is also part of a culinary movement that helped turn the chaotic energy of punk culture of the 1970s and 1980s into a progressive political force punk taught me to question everything , ms moskowitz said of course , in my case that means questioning how to make a hostess cupcake without eggs , butter or cream the charm of ms moskowitz in person , in her cookbooks and on her publicaccess television cooking show , the postpunk kitchen \( theppkcom shows \) is that she makes even the deprivations of veganism and the rage of punk seem like fun like feminism that embraces makeup and miniskirts the frivolous bits ms moskowitz s veganism embraces chocolate , white flour , confectioners' sugar , and food coloring wearing a black made out of babies tshirt \( it s a friend s band \) above a redandwhite checked apron , she bent maternally over a batch of strawberry cupcakes do n't you just want to pinch their little cupcake cheeks , she said but can a cupcake be cute and punk at the same time \? in the early days of punk , bands like the sex pistols were notorious for nihilism , anarchism and epic consumption of drugs and alcohol none of which would seem to lead to tofu and chamomile tea but as punk became more political \( and as bands selfdestructed \) in the 1990s , many punks adopted a more profoundly rebellious stance against drugs , against alcohol and against the whole habit of mindless consumption it was about purifying the movement , about being poisonfree , said ted leo , of ted leo and the pharmacists , who led the band chisel in the 1990s he became vegetarian in 1988 and has been vegan since 1998 many punks became vegetarian to protest corporate and government control of the food supply veganism takes vegetarianism farther into crueltyfree territory by avoiding anything produced by animals milk , cheese , eggs , honey , etc i would love to live in a world where i knew the eggs came from happy chickens , ms moskowitz said but in brooklyn \? that s not going to happen besides , eggs are the big lie in baking all the books say they provide structure , but that s kind of crap at 16 , ms moskowitz dropped out of the high school of music and art in new york to follow bands , live in squats in the east village and cook for social justice i learned knife skills by cooking for food not bombs , she said , referring to the activist group that protests corporate and government food policy but i also learned to love julia child and martha stewart vegan food can and must be pretty , she said , pounding a fist on the butcherblock counter ms moskowitz s kitchen , like punk music itself , has a strong doityourself aesthetic her husband , a carpenter , builds more shelves when the ingredients threaten to take over , the oven needs frequent coaxing to get up to temperature , and if fizzle the cat wants to sit on top of the refrigerator , the cupcakes must move over and make room here is the hideous curdled face of vegan baking , ms moskowitz said , gesturing to a bowl of soy milk mixed with vegetable oil and cider vinegar baking , she said , has long been the final frontier for vegan cooks her second cookbook , vegan cupcakes take over the world , was published by marlowe and company last fall her first , vegan with a vengeance \( marlowe , 2005 \) , has sold more than 50 , 000 copies omnivores that s meatanddairy eaters ca n't imagine baking without eggs and butter , she said but we use cider vinegar instead of buttermilk for tenderizing , and really good shortening for the fat , and the rest just happens nonhydrogenated shortening and margarine produced by earthbalance and fullfat soy milk from silk are her baking staples from them , instead of lumpy , penitential scones and muffins \( the usual vegan baked goods \) ms moskowitz and her coauthor terry hope romero produce insanely fetching cupcakes with mousse fillings , butter cream frostings , chocolate ganache icings and sprinkles galore ms moskowitz says that she has received passionate email messages not only from vegans but also from parents of children allergic to eggs or dairy products , who are thrilled to find vegan baked goods that are not made with wholewheat flour and egg substitutes and that actually taste good the next book by the two women , to be published in the fall , will be the longawaited vegan joy of cooking , ms moskowitz said vegan food is everywhere
colorado springs , aug 30 the dj puts on the popular song no problem by lil scrappy , and a sea of young men and women rush the dance floor as the party anthem bursts through the speakers and lil scrappy drawls , but you do n't want no problem , problem , the crowd swerves in a sweaty , liquorsoaked rhythm the scene , heavy with the sweet smoke of cigarillos and exploding with hiphop s unmistakable pounding bass , could be almost anywhere new york , chicago , memphis , oakland , calif the only sign that this is colorado springs is that two churches sit adjacent to the club , la zona roja , in an empty strip mall the club is part of a thriving hiphop community that has grown as colorado springs , known for its military installations and evangelical groups , has grown but not everyone is happy that hiphop has taken root here after a spate of shootings , and with a rising murder rate , the police here are saying gangsta rap is contributing to the violence , luring gang members and criminal activity to nightclubs the police publicly condemned the music in a news release after a killing in july and are warning nightclub owners that their places might not be safe if they play gangsta rap we do n't want to broadbrush hiphop music altogether , said lt skip arms , a police spokesman , but we 're looking at a subcomponent that typically glorifies , promotes criminal behavior and demeans women the actions of the police have angered the hiphop community here , mostly blacks and latinos , many of whom live in this city because of ties to the army and air force bases here if we were talking about a rock bar or a country bar here , none of this would be happening , said james baldrick , who runs a local hiphop promotions company , dirty limelight this city wants to shut down hiphop , said mike cross , 26 , who was outside eden nite club , a popular downtown venue that plays hiphop , with a group of friends on a recent night they do n't want it to survive calling the police s approach ignorant , a group of club promoters and rappers in colorado springs organized a night of hiphop performances and music at la zona roja last month , seeking to prove that such events could occur without incident when two cowboys got into an argument at a saloon , went outside and had a draw , nobody blamed the music that was playing at the saloon , said a local rapper known as b serious , who performed at the event but with 19 homicides already this year , compared with 15 in 2006 , the police insist on a correlation between gangsta rap and violence , and point to three recent shootings on april 17 , a stray bullet killed a taxi driver during a fight between two groups who had left eden nite club after a fight at a concert at a local park on memorial day , a man was shot to death in a nearby liquor store parking lot on july 9 , a former high school football star , diontea jacksonforrest , was shot and killed the authorities said the suspect was involved in an altercation at eden before the shooting two days after mr jacksonforrest s death , the police issued a news release blaming the violence on gangsta rap the release mentioned an event planned at eden , called a pimp , thug and ho party , as the type of behavior that causes concern the club s owners called off the party mr baldrick noted that the shooting after the memorial day concert , which his company sponsored , occurred two hours after the event , yet the police linked the two he said that since the authorities began speaking out against gangsta rap , there had been a drop in attendance at events promoted by dirty limelight , down to 200 from about 700 per event but lt thomas harris , who leads a unit that deals with gangs , drugs and guns , insisted there was a link between the violence and the music when you have music that says it s basically ok to treat women poorly , to steal things and to confront and shoot police officers , said lt harris , you 'll attract a small percentage of the population that wants to lead the thug life others here say the police are focusing on hiphop instead of addressing the growing pains of this largely white , conservative city , home to the evangelical groups focus on the family and new life church since 1990 , the metropolitan area of colorado springs , which sits south of denver , has swollen to nearly half a million from 397 , 000 though outright racial tensions , which led to marches here in the 1970s and '80s , are largely of the past , there remains a sense of benign neglect toward minorities , said dr jos j barrera , former director of ethnic studies at the university of colorado at colorado springs that neglect has translated into a chasm between the city and its minority youth , dr barrera said if you examine the history of ethnic and race relations in this community , you will detect a pattern of ignorance of minority cultures and problems , dr barrera said no serious observer believes that current manifestations of youth culture and pop culture actually fuel criminal activity at the recent hiphop showcase at la zona roja , the genre s positive side eclipsed all else after the show , the crowd tumbled out of the club young men politely chatted up a group of women a couple tried to coordinate a ride home two men exchanged solemn stories of prison the only sign of trouble was a flat tire on someone s customized sedan
in the politico survey , of the 62 remaining senators who voted to authorize the war in iraq , only four democrats said they do not regret it the democrats who did not regret their yes vote are schumer , both nelsons and hillary clinton , bowers writes this honestly makes me sad to be a democrat from new york i thought us upstaters were supposed to be the conservative ones bowers compares sen clinton to joe lieberman during his senate campaign in connecticut against ned lamont an absolute hawk trying to appear antiwar in order to pick up democratic votes edwards continues to fly blind on foreign policy , writes the new republic s john judis , a war critic , at the plank he says whatever he thinks an audience wants to hear it s not that he has a fairly definite foreign policy , but adjusts his views to audiences and the circumstances he has none , zero the washington post editorial page complains that john edwards and hillary clinton are the only two democratic presidential candidates who have not pledged to disclose the identities of their fundraising bundlers , who raise large sums of money for candidates by collecting many smaller checks v oters have every reason to be suspicious of those who would be president but don t want to be transparent about how they re going to collect the cash they need to reach the white house the los angeles times editorial page explains why digital locks on downloadable music are counterproductive they hurt the people who actually pay for music by making the tracks they download harder to use music pirates and thieves , meanwhile , prosper despite the locks locks on 99cent downloads are not the way to deter piracy , given that the vast majority of music is still sold on unlocked cds bootlegged copies of recorded music show up online as soon as they come out on cd , if not before locking up the downloadable version is akin to padlocking the barn after the cows have run for the hills
in a final effort to clear his name and regain the 2006 tour de france title that was stripped from him last month because of a doping violation , filed an appeal with the court of arbitration for sport in switzerland this week the appeal , filed monday , is landis s last chance to overturn the united states antidoping agency s charge that he used performanceenhancing drugs to win the tour last month , an arbitration panel upheld that charge and ruled , 2 to 1 , that landis had used synthetic testosterone to win a grueling mountain stage of the tour landis , who turns 32 on sunday , was subsequently stripped of the tour title and barred from the sport for two years , retroactive to jan 30 , 2007 now the court of arbitration for sport will take one last look at the evidence in the case its decision will be final , with no possibility for an appeal i want to take this opportunity to say again , that i am innocent of the doping allegations against me , landis said in a statement i hope that the arbitrators of the case will fairly address the facts showing that the french laboratory made mistakes , which resulted in a false positive although the process of proving my innocence has been difficult for me and my family , i will not stop trying to prove my innocence landis s fate , in limbo since he tested positive more than a year ago , should be known in about four months , when arbitrators are likely to make their ruling , said maurice suh , landis s lead lawyer travis tygart , usada s chief executive , said , we expect the same outcome if the decision is based on the evidence landis , who was the first champion in the history of the tour to lose the title because of a doping offense , has spent more than 2 million on his defense against the antidoping agency , which he says works under a system that is unfair to athletes most of that money was spent preparing for an arbitration hearing in may that lasted more than a week while that arbitration panel ruled against landis , it agreed with some points he made , including the argument that the french lab that tested landis s urine samples was sloppy in conducting the tests and in handling paperwork in the decision , the panel said that actions like those in the future could lead to a dismissal of a case still , according to the decision , none of those problems affected the final result that landis s body contained synthetic testosterone landis and his legal team , which now includes swiss lawyers , disagree with that conclusion this was n't a technical defense , suh said yesterday in a telephone interview it was n't you did n't do this right you did n't put the beaker in the right case' this was a case that showed that they came to the wrong result suh said it was difficult for landis to decide whether to make this final appeal there has been a financial and emotional toll on him through this case , he said , but landis just did n't feel like simply walking away this is as much about vindication of his own character as it is about some tour goal or some bike race , suh said landis said on his fundraising web site that this appeal was worth the trouble no matter the outcome of his case , he said , he hoped his case caused a change in the antidoping system , which he called cynical and corrupt there must be change in the current system if athletes can ever hope to compete on a level playing field , he said while landis and his lawyers prepare their case , tour de france officials continue to move forward scar pereiro of spain , the runnerup at the 2006 tour , was declared the winner of the race sept 21 , one day after the arbitration panel ruled against landis tour officials plan to award him the yellow jersey monday in a ceremony in madrid
guatemala city it is election time in and that means rallies and banners and body bags in the campaigning leading up to elections on sept 9 , the authorities have reported 61 violent attacks on candidates and political activists the death toll is 26 , including seven national congressmen and numerous other office seekers the flurry of bullets , and the occasional machete attack , make this the bloodiest campaign season in the history of a country with a long tradition of political violence , including 36 years of civil war that ended in 1996 but what makes the bloodletting different this time is that it has been attributed to narcotics traffickers and their allies intent on infiltrating guatemala s political system so dangerous is campaigning that lvaro colom , the leading presidential candidate , flies in a helicopter to avoid being ambushed and travels with a physician with extensive experience in bullet wounds he is careful what he eats , lest someone poison it i hate to say this , but it s more violent now than during the war , he said it is not only south america s drugproducing countries that are at risk these days from the impact of the drug trade , or even of becoming narcostates more and more , corrosive effects are being felt in the countries where the drugs transit , like guatemala , mexico and haiti , as competition grows , in effect , to set up toll roads on the drug routes to the united states somewhere between 60 and 90 percent of the south american cocaine that enters the united states now comes through central america , american officials say , pulling rising levels of political instability , violence and corruption in its wake the most popular trafficking routes shift constantly to stay one step ahead of law enforcement efforts , the officials say if you attack the cockroach in one corner , the son of a gun shows up in another , said a senior american counternarcotics official in the region , who spoke on background to avoid compromising future investigations cartels active in colombia , where much of the region s cocaine is produced , have connections with politicians , military officers and others throughout the area to assist them in getting drugs and drug profits out , whether on small planes or boats guatemala provides an increasingly important transit point , american officials say , as traffickers take advantage of the country s dire poverty and lawlessness they have already made considerable progress over the years , political analysts and law enforcement officials say , by installing sympathetic politicians in congress and in local city halls controlling the political system is their goal , said iduvina hernandez , an analyst at a guatemalan research group called security in democracy if they can control a small town , they can build a landing strip there and use it as a base if they have someone in congress , all the better with plenty of money to spend , drug dealers finance as many campaigns as they can and put forward candidates who are on the take resistance is met with gunfire jos carlos marroqu n , mr colom s chief strategist , might have joined the list of victims as well last year , as campaigning got under way , assailants lobbed three grenades at his motorcade and opened fire on the vehicles with automatic weapons he survived but the threats against him and his family have not let up politics is dangerous here , said mr marroqu n , a former newspaper editor along with the regular campaigns , there is a campaign of fear in addition to the traffickers , an array of other heavily armed groups , including rogue soldiers , paramilitary groups , street gangs and smugglers , are fueling the violence none of them are trigger shy street violence is part of life in guatemala even when an election is not around the corner people are shot by muggers , caught in the cross fire of rival gangs and taken out by hit men as a matter of course campaign season brings a spike in the killing , although homicides are only rarely solved here and political crime is no exception guatemala s congress voted aug 1 to approve an initiative backed by president scar berger s administration that would allow united nations investigators to aid in the prosecution of armed groups it is being called the international commission against impunity in guatemala in one example of how hard it is to crack a case here , three salvadoran members of the central american parliament and their driver were murdered in guatemala in february the suspected killers , four police officers , were themselves later murdered in prison a police officer and five men with links to a drug cartel have been arrested , although the motive for the attacks and counterattacks remains unknown mr berger s security minister resigned in the wake of the killings the effect of all the violence on the candidates is profound they move around with their own private armies , usually in bulletproof vehicles loaded with small arsenals one of those who feel most vulnerable is mr colom , a businessman who is leading the pack in the presidential race people affiliated with his party have suffered more attacks , 16 of the 61 , than any other besides the recent attacks on members of his party , he is haunted by the past his uncle , manuel colom argueta , was a leading presidential candidate in 1979 , when he was gunned down one candidate forced out of mr colom s national unity for hope party in 2005 was manuel de jes s castillo , a congressman who has been accused but never convicted of links to drug interests he is running for mayor of the provincial town of jutiapa as an independent it is a campaign he is expected to win , largely because of his precampaign giveaways of everything from farming tools to livestock the raffles he sponsors even offer free plots of land to lucky residents but only if he wins i'm clean , and it s a lie what they say about me , mr castillo , who has formed his own civic organization called el castillo , or the castle , has told reporters he travels his rural district in a yellow hummer and has burly men nearby to protect him with the murder rate at roughly 6 , 000 deaths a year , it is not hard to understand why security has emerged as the chief issue of the campaign there are presidential candidates who are trying to scare the people , mr colom said the other day , an indirect attack at otto p rez molina , a toughtalking former general who is considered to be no 2 in the polls we have a plan to bring security but also health and education and jobs mr p rez molina s campaign symbol is a fist he is all about mano dura , or strong hand , his shorthand for a noholdsbarred crackdown on delinquency the tough message has appeal among crimeweary guatemalans , who were shown in a recent survey to back extreme methods , even vigilantism , to cut the country s murder rate the population applauded alejandro giammattei , a former director of prisons and the candidate of the ruling party , when he ordered a raid on a notorious prison last year that had become a center for organized crime subsequently , gunmen tried to end his life , mr giammattei said after that , guatemala s top human rights official said there was evidence that the police had shot and killed seven prisoners after they had been detained in the raid mr giammattei denied that account , although public sympathy for the prisoners who were killed has been minimal even the candidacy of efra n r os montt , a former dictator who is running for a congressional seat , has not prompted much of an uproar here mr r os montt is expected to win a seat , which will make it harder to prosecute him on charges of violating human rights during the country s long civil war in april , 31 members of the united states congress sent a letter to guatemala s attorney general calling for the immediate arrest of mr r os montt , who ruled the country from 1982 to 1983 , which was considered the bloodiest period of the civil war warrants for mr r os montt s arrest , issued by a spanish judge , stem from complaints filed by another presidential candidate , rigoberta mench , winner of the 1992 nobel peace prize for her work on behalf of guatemala s marginalized indigenous communities , which bore the brunt of the violence during the war with little in the way of resources , her campaign is struggling , despite its message of breaking with the country s violent past a quiche indian , she would be the first woman and the first indigenous person to serve as president as a symbol of the peace he wants , mr colom , who is in his third bid for the presidency , threw a dove in the air at a recent campaign rally it went up for a moment , its wings flapping furiously , then quickly plummeted to the ground

the gunman who killed 32 people and himself on the campus of monday was identified today as a student who lived in a dormitory on campus and kept to himself but caused deep concern among some of his professors who considered him troubled law enforcement authorities said the gunman was , 23 , a senior english major at virginia tech who came to the united states with his parents in 1992 today , a police affidavit said that a bomb threat note was found near his body and that the police believe two previous bomb threats in the past three weeks could be connected to him it added that the suspect recently purchased a handgun at a gun shop in roanoke , va questions have been raised about whether university officials had responded adequately to the shootings , and virginia gov tim kaine said in a news conference today that an independent panel would review the events and the official response to the attack mr cho was described by fellow students in television interviews broadcast today as being thorough as he moved through the classrooms opening fire he wore an outfit that resembled a boy scout uniform and tried to push through doors that were barricaded by students in a german class in norris hall mr cho entered the room and opened fire on the professor before turning a gun on the students trey perkins , a 20year old mechanical engineering student , was among the students who got down on the floor and tried to shield themselves with desks when mr cho opened fire there were a couple of screams but for the most part it was eerily silent other than the gunfire , he said he never said a word the whole time i 've never seen a straighter face in a news conference today , authorities said ballistic tests showed that one of two weapons found in norris hall had also been used in the other location , west ambler johnston hall , a 900student freshman dormitory mr cho moved to the united states with his family as a grade school student in 1992 , government officials in south korea said he lived in centreville , va , a suburb of washington , and graduated from westfield high school in nearyby chantilly , va , 2003 at virginia tech , mr cho was living on campus in harper residence hall he was described as a loner by the university s associate vice president , harry hincker carolyn rude , the chairwoman of the english department , said that she had spoken to a professor who taught mr cho and was told that the general impression of him was that he was troubled and that the professor had been alarmed by some of mr cho s writings ian mcfarlane , a former classmate of mr cho s at virginia tech , today released obscenity and violencelaced screenplays that he said mr cho had written as part of a playwriting class they both took when we read cho s plays , it was like something out of a nightmare , mr mcfarlane wrote in a blog on aol , where he now works the plays had really twisted , macabre violence that used weapons i would n't have even thought of the attack at virginia tech was the deadliest shooting rampage in american history and came nearly eight years to the day after 13 people died at columbine high school in colorado at the hands of two disaffected students who then killed themselves officials had initially believed that the first shootings , in west ambler johnston dormitory , where two people were killed , was a selfcontained event related to a domestic dispute , and they did not send out an alert for a little more than two hours col w steve flaherty , the state police superintendent , said in a news conference this afternoon that mr cho was the shooter at norris hall , but investigators were still following multiples leads and reviewing a great deal of evidence we do n't know , we ca n't prove at this point , whether he did or did not have any accomplice , said col flaherty there is no evidence that he did , but we are following through to make sure that that s not the case in the second attack , the gunman walked through the halls of norris hall , across campus from the first attack , shooting at professors and students in classrooms and hallways , firing dozens of rounds and killing 30 officials said he then shot himself so badly in the face that he could not be identified the police and witnesses said some victims were executed while other students were hurt jumping from upperstory windows of norris responding to criticism and suggestions that there was a delay between the first shooting and the first email notifying students that something had happened , the virginia tech president , charles w steger , said earlier that the first dormitory was immediately closed down after the first incident and surrounded by security guards streets were cordoned off and students in the building notified about what was going on , he said investigators were trying to sift through what colonel flaherty described earlier in the day as a horrific crime scene at norris hall , where the shooting had caused tremendous chaos and panic a 9millimeter glock handgun and 22caliber walther handgun were recovered from the building personal belongings were strewn about on the second floor victims were found in four classrooms and a stairwell we know that there were a number of heroic events took place , he said a university spokeswoman , jenn lazenby , said on monday the university was looking into whether two bomb threats at the campus one last friday , the other earlier this month might be related to the shootings today , a virginia state police affidavit said that a bomb threat note was found in the vicinity of the shooting suspect , and it was reasonable to believe it was connected with the shootings a warrant was issued for mr cho s dorm room to search for tools , documents , computer software , weapons , ammunition and explosives the authorities also released an affidavit for a police warrant to search the apartment of a man identified as karl david thornhill to look for firearms , ammunition , bloody clothing , footwear , and other tangible evidence associated with the alleged murders mr thornhill was said to have given the police conflicting information about the location of his guns and his whereabouts over the weekend reporters who went to the address on the affidavit were told by a young man at the door the person you are looking for is not here according to the college newspaper , the collegiate times , many of the deaths took place in the german class in norris hall survivors told dramatic stories of the events mr perkins said that during class , someone opened the door to the room twice and peeked in , but the class assumed that it was a student looking for his room it was someone of asian descent , so it might have been the same guy , mr perkins said about 10 minutes later , the door , which had no window , opened again and the shooter fired first at the professor , and then began methodically shooting the students , beginning with those in the front row the gunman then left but tried to return , managing to open the door a few inches as students inside pushed back derek , who is my classmate , he was shot in the arm and it was just amazing to me that he was still up and leaning against the door , mr perkins said the guy tried to come back in and we were able to hold him off another student , erin sheehan , helped tend to the wounded in the class as her fellow students tried to hold the door closed he seemed very thorough about it , she told cnn , referring to the way the gunman carried out the shooting there were 14 of the wounded still in area hospitals this afternoon one of them was the girlfriend of a student , paul geiger , 21 , who was at montgomery regional hospital this morning to visit her she was part of the german class that got hit , he said of his girlfriend , who had been shot in the hand she helped barricade the door for me , she is my hero joseph cacioppo , a surgeon at montgomery regional hospital who treated some of the injured , said on cnn that the injuries showed that the gunman was brutal none of the injured that he treated had less than three to four wounds in them , he said today , the university hosted a convocation attended by president bush , who called it the worst day of violence in college history it s impossible to make sense of such violence and suffering , he said those whose lives were taken did nothing to deserve their fate they were simply at the wrong place at the wrong time mr bush has ordered flags at halfstaff through sunday at sunset classes have been canceled for the week to allow students to grieve norris hall is to be closed completely for the semester we also had to find witnesses because we did n't know what had happened , he said wounded people were sent to hospital and , based on the interrogation of witnesses , they thought there was another person involved students said a gunman had gone room to room looking for his exgirlfriend he killed two people , a senior identified as ryan clark , from augusta , ga , and a freshman identified by other students on her floor as emily hilscher the shootings at the engineering building , norris hall , began at about 9 45 the university has more than 25 , 000 fulltime students on a campus that is spread over 2 , 600 acres asianamerican students at virginia tech reacted to news about the gunman s identity with shock and some anxiety about a possible backlash my parents are actually worried about retaliation against asians , said lyu boaz , a thirdyear accounting student who was born in south korea and became an american citizen a year ago after 9 11 , a lot of arabs were attacked for that reason mr boaz , a resident adviser at pritchard hall , said many koreanamerican students left campus immediately parents of other koreanamerican students were preparing to pick up their children this afternoon and take them home until monday , the deadliest campus shooting in

to the editor re , by gen john m shalikashvili , a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff \( oped , jan 2 \) i am on my second yearlong tour in iraq , the first having ended 15 months ago in my opinion , troops here want only someone next to them who is dependable in a firefight , knows first aid and keeps a good morale we do n't care if that person is male , female , gay , straight , white , black , cheats on his wife or her husband , is catholic or jewish , rich or poor when you live in close quarters in combat over a long period , all you care about is whether the person knows his job and is trustworthy with all that is going on here , it amazes me that gays in the military is still being debated by those out of uniform charles mitchell baghdad , jan 2 , 2007  to the editor gen john m shalikashvili writes that in the mid90s , he supported the do n't ask , do n't tell policy because he believed that openness would have lowered morale , hurt recruitment and undermined cohesion but now that the army is strained beyond belief , he believes that we must welcome the service of any american who is willing and able to do the job it would be great progress to end the do n't ask , do n't tell era , but as a gay man , i'm less than grateful for general shalikashvili s heartwarming invitation he now welcomes the day when gay men and lesbians will no longer have to conceal who they are apparently , that was previously acceptable abuse of gay people in the armed forces is rampant , and for years people have had no recourse because they feared dismissal now that the army needs recruits for a violent , unpopular war , we are more than welcome no thanks andrew hiller brooklyn , jan 2 , 2007  to the editor in explaining his change of position on the do n't ask , do n't tell policy , gen john m shalikashvili correctly observes that dozens of other countries , including most of our nato and coalition allies , now let gays serve openly , with none reporting morale or recruitment problems nonetheless , the pentagon continues to say that the policy is necessary to preserve unit cohesion this argument is an insult to the professionalism of the united states military stripped of euphemism , the unit cohesion rationale suggests that straight service members would not be capable of doing their jobs and completing the military mission if they served alongside gay people who have gone public this argument , always implausible , is now an embarrassment i believe that our men and women in uniform are as professional as their counterparts in canada , britain and france is the pentagon ready to say the same \? tobias barrington wolff philadelphia , jan 2 , 2007  to the editor forgive me my cynicism , but i find it incredibly laughable that with the bush administration stuck neckdeep in the iraq quagmire , and the armed services facing a shortage of recruits , it is time to reconsider allowing gay people to serve their country perhaps i might take gen john m shalikashvili s opinion more seriously if he had mentioned my right to marry my partner patricia esgate south piermont , ny , jan 2 , 2007  to the editor congratulations to gen john m shalikashvili ! his view on discrimination reflects a national change in various sectors of american life , the secondclass status of gay people is becoming less prevalent but a typical gay person chooses to remain closeted rather than to cope with homophobia hypocrisy and inequality usually describe life in america for a gay person for those of us born in the 1930s with military experience , we observed , or learned in conversations as veterans , that career men and recruits secretly engaged in consensual sex this fact exists in spite of our insistence to the contrary so a change from homophobia to tolerance would be advantageous to our national defense and to gay people bob geary portland , ore , jan 2 , 2007  to the editor in 1975 , len matlovich and i were the first to challenge the ban on gays in the military he challenged the regulations , and i challenged the statutory ban in the uniform code of military justice , and both of us had the same lawyers then , the ultimate issue was less the soldiers' morale than image if the united states had gays in uniform , then \( as the logic went \) our enemies would perceive the country as weak , perverted and less than masculine from a recruiting perspective , ma and pa would be less willing to allow johnny to be signed up for fear of his being seduced today , the same logic applies , but more so since homosexuality is considered a complete scandal in the muslim world , often punished by death gays should , of course , be allowed into service , yet those who support the ban will point to how islamists will mock the american military as immoral and worthy of jihad jay hatheway stoughton , wis , jan 3 , 2007  to the editor gen john m shalikashvili presents many reasons that led him to say , i now believe that if gay men and lesbians served openly in the united states military , they would not undermine the efficacy of the armed forces but he then urges congress to be cautious in fighting to lift the ban on openly gay service members , considering it still a divisive , lowpriority issue despite his research supporting the inclusion of gays , he s simply replacing do n't ask , do n't tell with yeah , but not yet sally k chrisman princeton , nj , jan 2 , 2007  to the editor it s hard to fault gen john m shalikashvili s call for a reassessment of gays in the military even britain , which officially banned gays until it was forced by a european court to admit them , reports no problems as for the bugaboo threat to morale , if you 're pinned down by enemy fire and joined by a gay soldier in your foxhole , the last \( and least \) of your fears is an indelicate overture i remember watching a piece about a danish platoon that had just spent a week on maneuvers with its openly gay captain when asked if it had made them uncomfortable to be at such close quarters sharing a tent , one soldier said we do n't mind that he s gay what we mind is that he smokes peter brodie palo alto , calif , jan 2 , 2007
kabkabiya , sudan , oct 3 \( ap \) former president confronted sudanese security services on a visit to on wednesday , shouting , you do n't have the power to stop me ! at some who blocked him from meeting refugees of the conflict the 83yearold mr carter wanted to visit a refugee camp in south darfur , but the united nations mission in sudan decided that such a visit would be too dangerous instead , mr carter agreed to fly to the world food program compound in this north darfur town , where he was supposed to meet with refugees but none of the refugees showed up , and mr carter decided to walk into the town , a volatile stronghold of the progovernment janjaweed militia , to meet refugees who were too frightened to attend the meeting at the compound he was able to make it to a school , where he met with one tribal representative , and was preparing to go farther into town when sudanese security officers stopped him you ca n't go it s not on the program ! the local security chief , who would give only his first name , omar , yelled at mr carter , who is in darfur as part of a delegation of respected international figures known as the elders we 're going to anyway ! mr carter retorted angrily as a crowd began to gather you do n't have the power to stop me ! but united nations officials told mr carter s entourage that the sudanese state police could bar his way mr carter s traveling companions , the billionaire businessman richard branson and gra a machel , the wife of the former south african president nelson mandela , tried to ease the situation , and his secret service detail urged him to get into a car and leave in an interview later , mr carter played down the encounter , saying the security chief was only doing his job for the most part , the refugees here appeared too frightened to speak to the visiting delegation mr branson said some refugees had slipped notes in his pockets one note said that on sept 26 , a group of girls was raped , and a refugee was shot two days ago
if you have missed heroes , the nbc mondaynight series about a group of people with extraordinary capabilities , then you have missed everything , which is to say , you have missed a show that exempts almost no subject of current political or social fascination from the roster of its interests more than a quarter of the way into the second season , the ratings have slipped somewhat , but it remains the most engaged drama on television at the moment , a big hand with fingers dangling in every pot set across the presentday united states \( and this season , digressively , also in 17thcentury japan \) heroes concerns itself with a growing assemblage of supernaturally empowered men , women and children who can variously divine and forestall terrible , worldending events for the most part each hero brings to the party a different bonus feature one can read minds one can timetravel another , a teenager , claire , possess the powers of regeneration , which means that when she smashes her collarbone or breaks her fibula , they snap back into place she is her own magical chiropractor with none of the blue cross forms or fees this season finds claire \( hayden panettiere \) relocated into culdesac seclusion with her family in costa verde , calif \( it s a long story \) at home in texas , she was a star cheerleader , but here her father orders her to do everything she can to go unnoticed so his enemies do n't find her this means she must suppress the instinct to raise her hand and answer difficult questions in a high school that looks like a brightly colored facsimile of the pompidou center costa verde is apparently nothing like the dullards' suburbia of the incredibles , where superhero children were forced into mediocrity in this television evocation of southern california , nothing and no one is supposed to fade into the background , and so the subplot functions as a wry indictment of the exorbitant pressures placed on teenagers to imagine themselves as madeleine albrights in the making claire understands that averageness will save her life , but she also knows that invisibility is its own death they have metal detectors for people who lay too low , claire , unable to quell her competitive impulses , tells her father i have to be someone i ca n't not be what i am , whatever that is though heroes traffics in themes of global terrorism , its willingness to veer into the vacation land of the oc makes it a lot easier to watch than something like 24 , which during its best seasons sustains an anxiety level so high that if you happened upon it while knitting you could stab a vein with a needle heroes is engrossing , but it never seduces you into obsession , and this serves as its own kind of relief like the spiderman movies of recent years , heroes is deeply interested in the challenges of exceptionalism what does it cost us to be indelibly gifted in a culture that increasingly demands specialization and personal branding \? it is fairly safe to say that none of the heroes meet any standard psychological definition of happiness one has a multiple personality disorder the seeds of good fortune are , of course , so often the flowers of despair what sense of fulfillment or purpose there is comes in the collective effort to avert horrible outcomes , planned last season by a sinister organization called the company , whose motives this year are less clear heroes borrows the stylistic elements of comic books and unfolds novelistically but it derives its philosophy from theories of opensource culture that flourish in the field of technology , the belief that some greater good can be better achieved through the collaboration of people joined by skills and affinities that transcend institutional allegiances some of the heroes are related by birth others find one another haphazardly and bond over their shared talents in the mindset of heroes , these sorts of affiliations surpass the efficiency of governments and companies no other series on television aligns itself so affirmatively with the spirit of the wiki age family is just another institution in which heroes , like 24 , places very little faith parents are typically manipulative or outright dangerous a son might kill his mother but the show s politics are hard to isolate at any point on the spectrum among the new characters introduced this season are twin hispanic border crossers , one of whom inadvertently kills certain people when she looks at them this , needless to say , is not the kind of special ability that would meet the extraordinary alien requirements of the immigration and naturalization service maya , one of the foreigners , and her brother are desperately trying to make their way into the united states to find a cure for her , but we suspect she may also be carrying a virus that will eliminate most people in the country i'm not sure that even lou dobbs could come up with a more offensive argument for a tighter border patrol last season heroes seemed to take a disparaging view of a possible giuliani presidency , casting aspersions on an italianamerican congressional candidate \( played with delightful creepiness by adrian pasdar \) who considered capitalizing on a disaster in new york to forge his political future by the end of last week s episode new york was in peril once again the plot lines of heroes have been more diffuse this season than they were in the first , but now suddenly there seems to be a distinct mission and the narrative appears headed for a more precise track i am excited for what is to come if certain forces are n't stopped , the city is doomed , felled , ostensibly by bioterrorism in a final scene last week that looked seven months into the future , times square stood as a bleak and vacant artifact , the only signs of survival billboards for wicked , avenue q and hairspray ratings will do what they will , but certain kinds of massmarket entertainment can never be killed
osaka , japan , tuesday , aug 28 at the hotel for the united states track and field team , inside a room usually used for latenight karaoke , a team of massage therapists awaited its next clients monday , with creams , sprays and lotions at the ready here , every day , every night , nearly every 30 minutes for the nine days of the world championships , these men and women will rub , stretch and knead the athletes on the tables , tweaking them like racecars for this tuneup for next year s olympics but after justin gatlin , the 2004 olympic gold medalist in the 100 meters , blamed his massage therapist for a failed drug test , the spotlight landed on therapists like these who work for usa track and field , and on others who work for shoe companies or as freelancers on the track circuit gatlin , who tested positive for testosterone and other steroids in april 2006 , said his therapist rubbed a steroidbased cream onto his legs to sabotage him just as barry bonds said his athletic trainer gave him performanceenhancing drugs in the form of creams and other topicals without his knowledge , these therapists have also become suspects in sport s recurring drug whodunit the gatlin thing started a lot of buzz , and several athletes came in and said hey , how you doing today \? by the way , what s that stuff you 're using on my leg \? ' said benny vaughn , a massage therapist with usa track and field i'm pretty sure they were joking , but you know , just because one guy blamed his massage therapist like , my dog ate my homework , does n't mean that any one of us would ever do that kind of thing vaughn said that he did not lose any clients because of the gatlin case , but that some of them still had questions they wanted to know if gatlin s story was plausible could a steroid cream used during a massage trigger a positive drug test \? he told them yes , that some creams were used during hormone therapy and were absorbed into the skin at the same time , he encouraged athletes to read the ingredients on each of his creams , sprays and lotions , so they could rest assured that none of them contained anything banned by the world antidoping agency there has to be a high level of trust there , or the relationship is not going to work , vaughn said gatlin , who faces an eightyear ban from the sport , said that a massage therapist named chris whetstine , who traveled the track and field international circuit on contract for nike , used steroid cream on him because gatlin failed to award him a bonus in 2005 vaughn and other therapists at the world championships said whetstine had a good reputation still , they advised athletes to check the credentials and references of any new employees , particularly massage therapists who are often in each athlete s trusted inner circle coaches like the sprint guru john smith have been warning their athletes about that for years he tells them , when you lay with the dogs , you 're going to get fleas it s happened that people have spiked and tainted someone s water bottle it s that cutthroat , he said where there s money , there s always going to be someone trying to take somebody else down in the sprints , onehundredth of a second could mean the difference between a gold medal and none at all in the field events , inches could mean making the final or not moneywise , the difference between first and last could mean bringing home a fivefigure paycheck or going home with empty pockets michelle perry , a 100meter hurdler , said that jealousy ran hot among athletes who saw their competitors win the races , money and fame that feeling could cause them to lose it , she said look at what happened to nancy kerrigan , perry said of the olympic figure skater clubbed in the knee by a man associated with a top rival , tonya harding that s why when my mom heard about justin , she called and said do n't leave your water bottles around ! do n't drink from anything that s been open already ! ' she was scared that somebody was going to do something bad to me over all , the athletes here do not seem sure what to think about gatlin s accusations most are waiting to hear the outcome of his arbitration hearing with the united states antidoping agency , which took place earlier this month what these athletes are sure of , however , is surrounding themselves with people they can trust that is why tyson gay , the newly minted champion in the 100 , made an appointment with vaughn , and vaughn only , after the 100 on sunday night gay showed up on the massage table at 2 am , and vaughn was there waiting , having soaked his arms in ice and rubbed them with antiinflammatory cream to prepare for the session with justin , i do n't know what happened , and i do n't think the whole story is out there , gay said last week i'm just glad that i work with people i'm totally comfortable with i'm just glad that i have nothing to do with that whole thing
providenciales , turks and caicos , may 15 was it enraged gamblers who strangled the coach \? or vindictive players \? or a fan with a grudge \? or none of the above \? the latest twist in the jamaican police investigation into the death of bob woolmer , the pakistani cricket coach found unconscious in his hotel room in march during the cricket world cup , may be that he was not murdered at all quoting people close to dr nat carey , a top british pathologist called in to review the postmortem on mr woolmer , newspapers in britain , where mr woolmer was from , and jamaica , where he died , are raising questions about the jamaican authorities' claim that mr woolmer was strangled the papers say dr carey has determined that his review of the records does not show that mr woolmer died of asphyxia as a result of manual strangulation , as the jamaican government has maintained a jamaican pathologist , ere seshiah , originally ruled that mr woolmer s death on march 18 was inconclusive four days later , the government changed course and told the world in a dramatic news conference that the popular coach had been murdered the police say the murder investigation continues despite the news reports that mr woolmer might have died of natural causes every theory , from weed killer to aconite , has come from the media not the police , mark shields , the deputy police commissioner , told the jamaica observer newspaper on monday from south africa , where he was traveling on police business we maintain that this is an ongoing murder investigation what made mr woolmer s sudden death so suspicious is that it came in the evening after his highly regarded team lost to ireland in a huge world cup upset and became the first team to be eliminated from the tournament the key piece of evidence pointing toward strangulation was said to be a broken bone in mr woolmer s neck but that could have broken , the speculation now goes , as mr woolmer fell after dying from a heart attack or other natural causes if the case has been bungled , jamaicans worry that their country may suffer derrick smith , a member of parliament from the opposition jamaica labor party , said this week that the confusion raised by the conflicting accounts jeopardized the reputation of the jamaican police announcements emerging from police and medical authorities in both britain and pakistan indicate that mr woolmer s death was from natural causes and not murder as suggested by the jamaica police authorities , mr smith said at a news conference on monday , according to the associated press the matter has become a global embarrassment for us saying the case has gone from a great whodunit' into a farcical soap opera , the gleaner , jamaica s leading newspaper , called on the police to release the pathology report so people can decide what the authorities cannot another possibility remains , and that is that mr woolmer was poisoned instead of choked various reports have indicated that there were signs that mr woolmer had ingested a herbicide used as a weed killer on cricket pitches the herbicide might have caused the vomiting and diarrhea that mr woolmer suffered before he died
the mets summarily dismissed the hitting coach rick down and , in a somewhat more surprising move , essentially released julio franco today to clear space for two fast outfielders only one of them , lastings milledge , will play the other , rickey henderson , who will not be used if another outfielder is injured , has been added to the coaching staff his role \? tbd it could be as hitting coach or , depending on how the conversation goes tomorrow , as the firstbase coach , with the mets choosing to bump howard johnson to hitting coach henderson was flying in from oakland today and is scheduled to be wearing uniform no 24 tomorrow although he clumped himself among those who decided to fire down , willie randolph was none too pleased with the decision down was his friend and personal choice to become hitting coach when randolph took over as manager before the 2005 season he s my coach , he s my brother , randolph said before last night s game against the cincinnati reds obviously there s an affection there , an affinity there later , when asked how he responded when omar minaya notified him about the decision , randolph said he told minaya , if you want to make the decision , you re the general manager you can make that decision in a similarly painful decision , minaya was forced to let go of franco in a move that some may consider long overdue his bat had slowed considerably i don t think i ve ever seen him pull a ball and he was batting 200 even if franco felt he should be playing more a sentiment not shared by many he still held a valuable role in the clubhouse , mentoring the likes of milledge during his troubled 2006 it is not as if the mets got rid of carlos beltran or david wright , tom glavine or billy wagner in the scheme of things , these moves register about a 5 on the richter scale but i suspect the players will take notice that they are partially to blame for down losing his job we will see how long it takes
sacramento moved significantly closer to enacting a broad expansion of coverage monday when the democraticcontrolled assembly passed legislation that has the backing of the republican governor ,  but it is far from certain that the legislature will give final approval to the measure , which would provide coverage to an estimated 70 percent of the 51 million persistently uninsured californians the bill must first gain passage in the senate , also controlled by democrats , where there are deep concerns about the measure s impact on the state s widening budget gap and even if the senate ultimately joins with mr schwarzenegger and the assembly , state leaders then must persuade california voters to support billions of dollars in new taxes and fees in a november referendum the senate president pro tem , don perata , has said he will not bring his members back to sacramento until the 2008 session begins on jan 7 though mr perata , a democrat from oakland , has endorsed the plan s general concept , he is worried that the state s budget problems make it impractical on monday , he asked legislative fiscal analysts to study the assembly bill s longterm fiscal implications , particularly in light of any cuts in social services that may be made to bring next year s budget into balance nonetheless , monday s passage by the assembly , on a partyline vote of 46 to 31 , culminated nearly a year of negotiation that began in january , when mr schwarzenegger proposed an audacious plan to insure all californians three other states massachusetts , maine and vermont had passed similar plans in recent years , but all are significantly smaller than california , which is the country s largest state , and have lower proportions of uninsured residents assembly speaker fabian n ez , in the floor debate monday afternoon , called the bill truly a historic effort and rejected republican assertions that its passage was more for public relations than for policy , as it was put by the assembly republican leader , michael villines there is hope through this bill , mr nu ez said , that never again in california will someone be kicked to the curb by an insurance company the plan created by mr schwarzenegger and mr nu ez , first during the regular legislative session and then in a special session called by the governor in september , draws from both democratic and republican ideas its fundamental structure mimics the plan adopted last year by massachusetts and embraced by several democratic presidential candidates like that state , california would force insurers to offer policies regardless of a consumer s age or health status , and it would require most individuals to obtain basic health coverage senator hillary rodham clinton and former senator john edwards support such a mandate , and senator barack obama has proposed mandatory coverage for children as in massachusetts , some californians would be granted exemptions if their income is too low to afford premiums but too high to qualify for heavy government subsidies assembly aides said that about 15 percent of those left uninsured by the plan would be illegal immigrants , though children in the country illegally would be offered coverage a major sticking point in the negotiations , and a major concern for the labor unions that provide california democrats with their most reliable support , has been whether the mandated policies would be affordable for middleincome workers the california plan would offer state subsidies to purchasers with incomes below 250 percent of the federal poverty level , or 51 , 625 for a family of four a number of large unions ultimately supported the bill , including the state s largest , the service employees international union , whose president , andrew l stern , attended a buoyant news conference after the vote with mr schwarzenegger and mr nu ez but the plan also would use tax credits , a concept backed by president bush and the leading republican presidential candidates , to make policies more affordable for the middle class those earning between 250 percent and 400 percent of the poverty level \( 82 , 600 for a family of four \) would be able to deduct premium costs that exceed 55 percent of their incomes the cost of the plan , which would take effect in 2010 , is pegged at 144 billion but none of the financing mechanisms were included in the bill passed monday california requires a twothirds vote of both chambers to approve tax increases , and it became apparent last summer that the republican minority would not provide the votes needed to reach that threshold that left mr schwarzenegger and mr nu ez , a democrat from los angeles , to devise a twostep approach legislative approval of the mechanics of the health care plan , followed by a november 2008 referendum with voters asked to approve tax increases to pay for it among the taxes is a 150 increase in the 87cent levy on tobacco products , which would raise about 15 billion , and a 4 percent levy on hospital revenues , which would raise 23 billion the hospital dollars are one component that would help the state leverage an additional 46 billion in federal financing mr schwarzenegger has promised repeatedly not to raise taxes , but he has said that passage of the referendum would equate to voters raising taxes on themselves in addition to the tax changes , employers would either have to spend a fixed percentage of their payrolls on health coverage for employees or pay a comparable amount into a state insurance pool that would provide subsidized coverage during negotiations over the bill , mr nu ez dropped his initial opposition to mr schwarzenegger s insistence that individuals be required to have insurance the governor , meanwhile , demonstrated flexibility concerning revenue sources , dropping proposals to tax doctors and to use lottery proceeds before agreeing to the tobacco tax increase because it can take months to collect the more than 700 , 000 signatures needed to place the revenue measures on the ballot , aides to mr schwarzenegger and mr nu ez said it was critical that the bill win senate approval quickly but mr perata poured cold water on the emerging health care compromise last week by announcing that it would be imprudent and impolitic to support an expansion of health care before the state addressed a wide gap that has opened in next year s budget the governor s office projects the budget gap , which has worsened because of the housing slump , could reach 14 billion , or

who would have imagined that watching a stranger undress could ever be tedious \? well , over the past few years choreographers have managed the impossible , making every effort to yank skivvies off whenever remotely necessary , and especially when it is n't but fear not the french are here to save the day really on thursday martine pisani s bande part \( band of outsiders \) opened at there was plenty of nudity indeed , you could make the case that the performance hinged on it it s just that none of it was actual the work began with th o kooijman walking the audience through his conceptual disrobing ok , i got through the first part , he explained after a pause in which nothing happened , and in which you realized that nothing was going to the joke , of course , is that you felt his nakedness all the more such absurd and obvious manipulation of reality lay at the heart of this hourlong solo , cleverly disguised as a quartet christophe ives , eduard mont de palol , olivier schram and mr kooijman , delightful dancers all , took turns performing a simple movement monologue , which included things like losing yourself for 23 seconds and finding yourself in seven warming up and then passing that heat on to the audience through methods like vigorous rubbing and fanning , and that old standby , disappearing each man interpreted this script \( the soloist s story was read early on \) in his own way and seemingly off the cuff , often ceding the soloist role to another performer in midstream the revolving backup threesome served to enhance and frame the action think of the peanut gallery , not a greek chorus they burbled and chirped when it seemed their lead was in danger of nodding off they created sound effects through methods that give new meaning to the description low tech at one point mr mont de palol zipped and unzipped his fly to great effect they galloped around awkwardly like men who ca n't quite get their minds around the concept and they created , through such winning and inane shenanigans , a reality that was just as forceful as the workaday version you 're normally told to believe you know , the one that says to be naked , you must n't wear clothes
christopher ochoa graduated from law school five years out of prison and started his own practice in madison , wis he has a girlfriend and is looking to buy a house michael anthony williams , who entered prison as a 16yearold boy and left more than two years ago as a 40yearold man , has lived in a homeless shelter and had a series of jobs , none lasting more than six months gene bibbins worked a series of temporary factory jobs , got engaged , but fell into drug addiction four and a half years after walking out of the louisiana state penitentiary at angola , he landed in jail in east baton rouge , accused of cocaine possession and battery the stories are not unusual for men who have spent many years in prison what makes these three men different is that there are serious questions about whether they should have been in prison in the first place the men are among the more than 200 prisoners exonerated since 1989 by dna evidence almost all of whom had been incarcerated for murder or rape their varied experiences are typical of what the new york times found in one of the most extensive looks to date at what happens to those exonerated inmates after they leave prison the times worked from a list of dnaexonerated prisoners kept by the innocence project widely regarded as the most thorough record of dna exonerations the times then gathered extensive information on 137 of those whose convictions had been overturned , interviewing 115 the findings show that most of them have struggled to keep jobs , pay for health care , rebuild family ties and shed the psychological effects of years of questionable or wrongful imprisonment typically , testing of blood or semen from the crime scene revealed dna pointing to another perpetrator the authorities in some of the cases have continued to insist they convicted the right men , and have even fought efforts by some of them to sue for money about onethird of them , like mr ochoa , found ways to get a stable footing in the world but about onesixth of them , like mr bibbins , found themselves back in prison or suffering from drug or alcohol addiction about half , like mr williams , had experiences somewhere between those extremes , drifting from job to job and leaning on their family , lawyers or friends for housing and other support and in many cases the justice system has been slow to make amends the times researched the compensation claims of all 206 people known by the innocence project to have been exonerated through dna evidence as of august 2007 at least 79 nearly 40 percent got no money for their years in prison half of those have federal lawsuits or state claims pending more than half of those who did receive compensation waited two years or longer after exoneration for the first payment few of those who were interviewed received any government services after their release indeed , despite being imprisoned for an average of 12 years , they typically left prison with less help prerelease counseling , job training , substanceabuse treatment , housing assistance and other services than some states offer to paroled prisoners it s ridiculous , said vincent moto , exonerated in 1996 of a rape conviction after serving almost nine years in pennsylvania they have programs for drug dealers who get out of prison they have programs for people who really do commit crimes people get out and go in halfway houses and have all kinds of support there are housing programs for them , job placement for them but for the innocent , they have nothing the times s findings are limited to those exonerated inmates the newspaper reached and do not represent the experiences of exonerated prisoners everywhere \( more on the research and a full list of contributing reporters are at \) most of the 137 exonerated inmates researched by the times entered prison in their teens or 20s , and they stayed there while some of their peers on the outside settled on careers , married , started families , bought homes and began saving for retirement they emerged many years behind , and it has been difficult to catch up to be sure , many in the group were already at a disadvantage when they entered prison more than half had not finished high school only half could recall holding a job for more than a year some admitted to abusing drugs or alcohol or running with the wrong crowd but dozens of them had been leading lives of stability and accomplishment more than 50 had held a job for more than two years in fields as varied as nursing , mail delivery , welding , fishing , sales and the military five had college degrees , and 20 others had completed some college or trade school still , many of those were as unlucky as the most modestly educated when it came to finding work after their release most found that authorities were slow to wipe the convictions from their records , if they did so at all even newspaper articles about their exonerations seemed somehow to have had a negative effect in the public s mind any time that anyone has been in prison , even if you are exonerated , there is still a stigma about you , and you are walking around with a scarlet letter , said ken wyniemko , who spent more than nine years behind bars in michigan after a rape conviction before his conviction , he managed a bowling alley after his release in 2003 , he spent two fruitless years job hunting , and he estimates he applied for at least 100 jobs today , he lives off money he received in a legal settlement with clinton township in macomb county , mich many of the jobs the newly released found proved shortlived , often lasting no more than a year a few exprisoners like kevin green , who went from bingo caller to utility crew supervisor , changed jobs to advance their careers , but most drifted from job to job with little gain in status or salary ryan matthews , with a fianc e and 2yearold to support , lost a series of jobs after he was exonerated from louisiana s death row he lost a shipyard job after his employer saw a news report about his exoneration on television short of suing , few received substantial compensation from the government given the hodgepodge of state compensation laws , an exonerated prisoner s chances of receiving any significant sum depend on the state where he was convicted and whether he can find a lawyer willing to litigate a difficult case one man who served three years in california sued and won 79 million another , who had served 16 years in texas , filed a compensation claim and received 27 , 850 president bush and congress moved in 2004 to improve the compensation the wrongly convicted received , adopting legislation that increased payments for people exonerated of federal crimes to 50 , 000 per year of imprisonment , and 100 , 000 per year in death penalty cases the legislation included a clause encouraging states to follow suit , at least for wrongly convicted prisoners who had been on death row lawyers and others involved with helping the exonerated have seized on that recommendation in pushing for improved compensation laws nationwide but their efforts have gained little only one state vermont has adopted a compensation law since the bill passed twentyone other states and the district of columbia already had procedures for compensating the exonerated half cap awards below 50 , 000 per year of incarceration of the 124 prisoners exonerated through dna and known to have received compensation , 55 got at least 50 , 000 for each year in prison and most of them sued in federal court , claiming their civil rights had been violated by overzealous police officers , crime lab specialists or prosecutors lawyers say such cases are very difficult to win twentyfive were convicted in states that provide no compensation and have collected nothing among them is mr moto , who said he struggled this summer to raise his 10yearold daughter on 623 a month in disability payments you give no compensation to none of those guys who were wrongfully incarcerated and proved their innocence \? he said in an interview how can you say we believe in justice \?
as a medical examiner on one coast conducted an autopsy and a judge on another coast ordered her body preserved for 10 days , monopolized the gaudy , gossipy celebrity stage yesterday as she had tried to do in life the medical examiner in broward county , fla , called her death sudden , unexpected and unexplained , but said more tests were needed to determine the cause ms smith , 39 , a former playboy model who became a popculture punch line in the 1990s after she married an octogenarian tycoon , was found dead thursday in a hotel suite in hollywood , fla yesterday was a day of almost nonstop coverage by cable television networks , and a day when a third man said he could have fathered ms smith s 5monthold daughter , not either of the two men already fighting over paternity it was a day when the police chief whose officers were dispatched to the seminole hard rock hotel and casino put to rest a rumor that had swirled in the scramble for details on ms smith s final days that her companion , howard k stern , was flushing away drugs when paramedics arrived the chief , charlie tiger of the seminole police department which had jurisdiction because the hotel is on indian land said , none of our officers who arrived on scene saw anything like that the medical examiner said only prescription drugs were found in the room and it was a day when even ms smith s hardscrabble childhood underwent revision she did n't come from a small town , as she said she did , her mother , virgie arthur , said on good morning america ms smith had claimed the small town of mexia , tex , about 80 miles south of dallas , as her birthplace ms arthur said she once asked ms smith why she had reinvented her biography you 're born in houston , a middleclass family why do you tell that story \? she said , mom , nobody wants to read books or see people on tv concerning , you know , middleclass girl found a rich millionaire and married him there s not a story in that , ' ms arthur recalled she said , the story is i come from rags to riches , and so that s what i'm going to tell' ms arthur said ms smith told her , mom , if my name is out there in the news , good or bad , does n't matter , good or bad , i make money , so i'm going to do whatever it takes' ms arthur blamed drugs for her daughter s death i think she had too many drugs , just like danny , she said , referring to ms smith s 20yearold son , who died last fall while visiting ms smith and her newborn daughter in the hospital in the bahamas , and i tried to warn her about drugs and the people that she hung around , and she did n't listen in california , the judge in the paternity case over ms smith s daughter , dannielynn , denied a request for immediate dna samples from ms smith s body the judge , robert schneider of los angeles county superior court , also turned down a request for custody from larry birkhead , an exboyfriend who is contesting mr stern s paternity the judge ordered that ms smith s body not be disposed of until feb 20 , when he scheduled a hearing to decide the paternity claims he could order dna samples then mr stern is listed on the girl s birth certificate as the father but yet another man said yesterday that he might be the father prince frederick von anhalt , 59 , who is married to the actress zsa zsa gabor , 90 , told the associated press that he and ms smith had had an affair since the mid1990s if you go back from september , when ms smith gave birth , prince frederick said , she was n't with one of those guys she was with me he told the ap that he met ms smith when she approached him and ms gabor at the plaza hotel in new york he said this was during ms smith s 14month marriage to the texas oil billionaire j howard marshall ii , who died in 1995 at 90 in florida , officials provided some details about the scene in ms smith s hotel room when paramedics arrived chief tiger said there was no evidence of a crime and the broward county medical examiner , dr joshua perper , said he had ruled out blows to her body or asphyxiation as possible causes of death he said that more tests would have to be done to establish why ms smith died dr perper said that she had apparently been sick for several days with flulike symptoms but he said the autopsy had shown only subtle findings in her heart and gastrointestinal tract he said she had a bruise on her back from a minor fall in the bathroom several days ago he said there were medications but no illegal ones in her room , and no pills in her stomach he said the authorities had compiled a long list of prescription drugs she was taking
to the editor re commemorations for a city that needs no reminders \( news article , aug 30 \) let s face it , new orleans is president bush s domestic iraq he sees accomplishments where there are none , he promises what he ca n't deliver and all at the expense of the most defenseless new orleans is an american city with running water and lights , but the administration has yet to find a way to help it clear the debris from the streets mr bush would see this if he visited something other than a handpicked school and mingled with the citizens instead of delivering another set of stock phrases in range of any camera after two years in this stable american city , where there are no improvised explosive devices or suicide bombers or rockets aimed at workers who are attempting to rebuild , we see embarrassingly little to show for all his happy talk the administration has proved that it has no ability to restore new orleans in peacetime so why should anyone believe that george bush knows what he s doing in iraq \? marion lewish san diego , aug 30 , 2007
baghdad , aug 3 they won the asian cup on the most public of stages , but s soccer heroes returned home on friday to celebrate behind the blast walls and razor wire of baghdad s green zone , far from the gaze of their disappointed fans welcomed with a bagpipe fanfare , the team was granted an honor guard in scarlet , blue , white and khaki when they flew back to the iraqi capital , five days after their 10 victory over saudi arabia in indonesia looking exhausted , the players were ushered along a red carpet to a latenight reception at prime minister nuri kamal almaliki s heavily guarded baghdad compound missing were younes mahmoud , the captain and scorer of the winning goal , who said he feared for his life if he returned \( he had said he would go to syria to visit his family \) , and a handful of players who officials said have other contractual obligations of the players who did return , many had not been back in quite some time because they trained abroad , and many play for foreign teams ambassadors , generals , lawmakers and senior government officials spent hours waiting for the team , whose flight was delayed and then still had to make the hazardous trip from the airport to the city center seeking to associate his government with a rare feelgood moment , mr maliki pointedly noted the contrast between iraq s past and present sporting fortunes under the previous regime , however much they spent , they could not achieve anything , he said iraq could n't attain such a victory but in the environment of freedom , we achieved it , he told the assembled team while you were on the field none of you considered what sect you belong to you were only thinking of iraq , and that iraq should win giving the thumbsup sign as he arrived at the celebration , gen david h petraeus , the commander of american forces in iraq , congratulated the team members and called them an example for all of iraq a team of sunni , shia and kurd who overcame lots of adversity to achieve a common goal , and they did it by teamwork on that day we were all iraqi , too one thing missing was ordinary iraqis , with only a handful of green zone permit holders making it through the military cordon to cheer and honk at the team along the final stretch of their return across town at shaab stadium , baghdad s main soccer venue , a cluster of youths turned up more in hope than expectation that iraq s new heroes would be allowed to risk their lives at such an easily attacked location as they loitered , one new arrival appeared only to be told the squad wo n't come the players have been taken to the green zone fans were also frustrated as they gathered around televisions for hours from midafternoon , only to see daylight fade long before the players appeared it is so sad to feel that your national football team celebrates its victory inside the green zone they are iraqis and every citizen has a share in them , said rasool shibeeb , 40 , from karada , in baghdad others pointed out that more than 50 people were killed by bombers after the team s semifinal victory baghdad s streets are not secure , said ammar abdulatheem , a carpenter there are gangs and terrorists who might turn this happiness into a funeral the team members are certainly likely to be more prosperous than their predecessors mr maliki awarded each team member 10 , 000 and a diplomatic passport by contrast , the iraqi youth team members who won the asian cup in 1977 were each awarded a sovietmade lada car by saddam hussein s predecessor , president ahmad hassan albakr although mr hussein sometimes rewarded major victories , defeats became costly to the players mr hussein s son , uday , was known to torture players , and in the arab olympic games in 1998 , he threatened to make the team pay the costs of the trip if it did not achieve good results \( they did not win , but it is unclear whether the players were actually fined \) in the war on friday , the american military announced that four american soldiers were killed in baghdad , three of them in one roadside bombing
albany , aug 3 it was just about a year ago when james butler , a littleknown safety , was cleared to practice after surgery on his kidney he reluctantly met with reporters , and short stories were written about the surgery he had to unclog a blockage , the extra padding he would wear under his uniform and the extra fluids doctors told him to consume and butler , a backup , was barely heard from again but that changed with the first practice of this season s training camp in their most surprising depthchart maneuver , the giants handed butler a starting job and demoted will demps , a highpriced free agent signed in 2006 butler , befitting his personality , remained reluctant to talk about it we 'll see , man , said butler , who said he felt no effects from last year s kidney ailment we ai n't even had one game yet we ai n't started a preseason game yet so just be quiet and play the game staying quiet seems to be in his nature , but the giants are hoping to hear more noise from their safeties this season on paper last year , demps and gibril wilson looked like a fearinducing tandem in reality , they were the ones playing scared mostly of making mistakes in an increasingly complex scheme under the restructured defense of the new coordinator steve spagnuolo , who arrived after years as the linebackers coach in philadelphia , wilson hopes to rediscover the instinctive play that marked his rookie year \( 2004 \) , when he had 3 interceptions and 49 tackles in seven starts my mentality my rookie year was , see ball , go get ball , ' wilson said it was n't complicated there was nothing tricky to it it was just go get the ball i think these past couple years , i have n't done that as much as i would like to this year , with a brandnew defense , i'm going to be the way i know how to play fast , and if i see the ball , go get the ball the giants moved wilson to free safety from strong safety , and inserted butler at strong safety the differences in the positions are not always obvious , but the free safety generally spends more time roaming the middle of the field and less time near the line of scrimmage playing the run or defending the tight end giants coach tom coughlin said that safeties must be able to play both positions what makes the fight for a starting safety spot especially intriguing is that , unlike a third cornerback , a backup safety rarely plays , even on passing downs last season , demps started every game and had 116 tackles butler started none , became a leader on special teams , and had only 11 tackles on defense butler , a former high school triplejump state champion in georgia , played at georgia tech but was undrafted in 2005 at 6 feet 3 inches and 215 pounds , he is taller and rangier than the giants' other safeties he is obviously a big man who is fast and covers a lot of ground , coughlin said he is smart , and very , very focused having a chance after fighting his way through a year in which he was ill , and then to have an opportunity to come back and be healthy and have a chance to play , i think all these things are falling into place for him that sounded great to butler , who listens more than he speaks he is the youngest of six children from tiny climax , ga \( it s nine miles from bainbridge , he explained , helpfully \) , home of the notsofamous swine time festival , a celebration of all things pig , held annually on the saturday after thanksgiving a lot of people from a lot of places come down for that , butler said his eyes widened when the talk moved away from his kidney and his roster spot and toward his mother s cooking \( macaroni and cheese , collard greens and sweetpotato pie are his favorites \) and the slowpaced lifestyle of home a few moments later , with a smile and a thank you , butler was gone , destined to be seen more than heard extra points there was no indication from defensive end michael strahan on whether or when he planned to return to the team or retire but his agent said strahan may release a letter to fans this weekend it would be his first public comment since not showing up for camp the night before it started his fines , imposed by the giants , reached 114 , 304 receiver plaxico burress sat out practice with a sprained right ankle and could miss a few days he was already limited to one practice a day because of offseason surgery on his left ankle linebacker chase blackburn \( strained quadriceps \) will miss time , too cornerback kevin dockery \( concussion \) was attending meetings and watching practices again for most of the past week , headaches and sensitivity to light kept him from doing either long snapper ryan kuehl \( severe leftcalf strain \) is expected to have his foot in a walking boot for four weeks he said he was concerned that he could miss the season lightning chased the giants into the state university at albany s basketball arena midway through the twohour practice
chicago as the new democratic congress moves ahead decisively on a panoply of issues , it should confront a particularly pressing one freedom of the press congress should expeditiously enact a federal journalistsource privilege law , which would protect journalists from compelled disclosure of their sources' confidential communications in the same way psychiatrists and lawyers are protected importantly , neither congress nor the press should be unwilling to compromise when the alternative is to forgo such a privilege altogether a strong and effective journalistsource privilege is essential to a robust and independent press and to a wellfunctioning democratic society it is in society s interest to encourage those who possess information of significant public value to convey it to the public , but without a journalistsource privilege , such communication will often be chilled because sources fear retribution , embarrassment or just plain getting involved as we have seen over the past several years , particularly with the federal investigation of the leak of the identity of former cia operative valerie plame , the absence of a journalistsource privilege leads to confusion , uncertainty and injustice at the hands of unrestrained federal prosecutors , journalists have taken a serious battering there is nothing novel in the call for such a privilege at present , 49 states and the district of columbia recognize some version of it the federal government is long overdue to enact such a privilege as well this issue has often been before congress , but congress has consistently failed to act , in part because the press has stubbornly insisted that anything less than a perfect privilege is unacceptable we must move forward the press can no longer afford to let the perfect be the enemy of the good of the jurisdictions that protect a journalistsource privilege , only 13 states and the district of columbia do so absolutely , meaning that under no circumstances can the state override the journalist s right to withhold privileged information the advantage of the absolute privilege is that it provides clarity and certainty to sources , journalists , lawyers and courts the disadvantage is that in some situations , it could deprive law enforcement of critical information in 36 other states , the journalistsource privilege is qualified , meaning that the government can require a journalist to reveal confidential information if the government can prove that it has exhausted alternative ways of obtaining the information and that the information is necessary to serve a compelling state interest so how would a qualified privilege work at the federal level \? the issue most often arises over matters of national security suppose , for example , a journalist reports that she has been informed by a reliable source that an unidentified major building in new york city will be blown up by terrorists the following day it would seem irresponsible , indeed insane , to allow the reporter to refuse to disclose the identity of the source certainly , the government has a compelling interest in forcing the reporter to reveal the name of the source so it can attempt to track him down and possibly prevent the attack the trouble is that even in this situation , the matter is not free from doubt without the protection of an absolute privilege , the source might not have been willing to disclose the information to the reporter in the first place public officials are certainly better off knowing that a threat exists , even if they do not know the identity of the source , than knowing nothing at all thus , breaching the privilege in even this seemingly compelling situation might in the longrun prove counterproductive to protecting national security nonetheless , such situations are more hypothetical than real , and they should not determine the shape of the privilege we enact if the press has to compromise by endorsing a law that would enable the government to pierce the privilege in order to address an imminent and grave threat to national security , it should do so there is little gain in sacrificing the privilege altogether because of a struggle over an abstract principle that would govern situations that have never happened in american history and are unlikely to happen in the future politics is , as they say , the art of compromise a serious journalistsource privilege is imperative to the national interest it should be high on the list of congress s priorities for 2007 and it should be held hostage neither to hypothetical nightmare scenarios nor to the press s stubborn , if principled , insistence on more than it really needs
greenburgh , ny , oct 10 in his first nine years as a knick , lived every role , from franchise icon to payroll albatross when he walked away two years ago , he played the part of the proud old warrior , bowing to the realities of middle age and the chronic pain in his knees it is not clear what role , if any , awaits houston as he rejoins the , only that it will be unlike anything he experienced in his prime houston signed a contract wednesday afternoon and will attend his first practice friday at 36 , he will be the oldest player on a roster crowded with young prospects and guaranteed contracts he has less than three weeks to convince management that he can still play and that it is worth waiving or trading someone to make room for him the locker room could use houston s leadership and wisdom the franchise , battered by a sexualharassment case , could use his pristine image and his ties to better times none of that will apparently factor into houston s bid to make the team no , we can use the people on the floor , coach isiah thomas said we got enough guys that have been through some tough times in this league we do n't necessarily need a lockerroom monitor we need a guy that can play the hard reality of houston s feelgood comeback attempt is that the knicks probably have no room for him they are carrying 15 guaranteed contracts , the league maximum they have four players jamal crawford , mardy collins , fred jones and nate robinson to rotate at shooting guard , and several others who can play there if the knicks could open a roster spot , it would probably go to the rookie demetris nichols , a sharpshooter who is 13 years younger than houston the knicks seemed to extend the invitation to houston out of a sense of obligation it s all respect , thomas said last week he was a great knick , and he wants to come back and give it a shot so it s out of respect so houston returns to the knicks as a long shot and a curiosity , a new identity that will be accompanied by a new uniform number , 7 houston s old no 20 is now worn by jared jeffries , and the nba does not allow players to change numbers after training camp has begun when houston retired two octobers ago , he said he had exhausted everything that i had to overcome chronic knee problems the left knee has chronic arthritis , a condition that was apparently caused by a rushed comeback from microfracture surgery on his right knee houston never really left the knicks' orbit , however he attended some games , occasionally stopped by practice and maintained his friendships with a number of players and , most notably , with james l dolan , the madison square garden chairman in retirement , houston earned 42 million , the final payout from the sixyear , 100 million contract he signed in 2001 under league rules , houston could not return until that deal expired this summer he s elated at just having an opportunity to go out and compete again and potentially make a contribution to a young club , said bill strickland , houston s longtime agent houston is expected to speak to reporters thursday before the knicks' preseason game against maccabi tel aviv at the garden strickland said that houston drew interest from a number of teams , including some finals contenders the knicks cannot even guarantee a playoff appearance strickland said that houston merely wanted the chance to leave the game on his terms after the birth of his fourth child last week , houston also wanted to stay close to his home in greenwich , conn in a prepared statement , he said , new york is where i am supposed to be i have seen the garden in some of its best moments , and i truly believe that this team is on the verge of experiencing that again , houston said rebounds isiah thomas will face knicks fans en masse thursday for the first time since a jury found him liable for sexual harassment last week thomas said he had received support from fans so far and believed he would get the benefit of the doubt at madison square garden but if not , then i 'll earn it , he said i 've been fighting for my life all my life i'm not a guy that walks away or shies away whatever comes my way , i 'll deal with it and i 'll stand tall but i'm not expecting a bad reaction tomorrow at all
baghdad , march 5 the book market along mutanabi street was a throwback to the baghdad of old , the days of students browsing for texts , turbaned clerics hunting down religious tomes and cafe intellectuals debating politics over backgammon somehow it survived the war , until monday , when a powerful suicide car bomb hit the market , slicing through the heart of the capital s intellectual scene it killed at least 20 people and wounded more than 65 in the hours after the noontime explosion , books and stationery , some tied in charred bundles , littered the block plumes of black smoke billowed above ornate buildings dating to the ottoman empire the storied shahbandar cafe , where elderly writers puffed away the afternoon on water pipes , lay in ruins firefighters unleashed powerful sprays of water , only to have flames reignite because the paper had been transformed into kindling this part of baghdad dates back centuries , to the era when the abbasid caliphate ruled over the islamic world on monday , victims lacerated by shrapnel were carried over shards of glass to waiting ambulances there are no americans or iraqi politicians here there are only iraqi intellectuals who represent themselves and their homeland , plus stationery and book dealers , said abdul baqi faidhullah , 61 , a poet who frequently visits the street those who did this are like savage machines intent on harvesting souls and killing all bright minds the bombing was the latest of a halfdozen major blasts aimed at civilians in the capital in the three weeks since the iraqi government and american military announced the start of a new baghdad security drive the number of gunshot killings attributed to sectarian death squads appears to have dropped as militia leaders have ordered their followers to lie low but deadly bombings have continued with ferocity american officials have said they are still struggling to tamp down the bombings and intend to bring thousands of additional troops into baghdad in the next two months many of the major bombings have taken place in central baghdad , where iraqi army and police checkpoints have proliferated since feb 14 , the start of the security drive , or in neighborhoods patrolled by americans a bombing on feb 25 at a campus of mustansiriya university , near mutanabi street in central baghdad , killed at least 40 people , many of them students of business or economics on feb 18 , just two days after prime minister nuri kamal almaliki called the opening stage of the security drive a dazzling success , two bombs ripped through a market in the new baghdad neighborhood , where american soldiers had been on patrol just minutes earlier , killing at least 60 people none of those bombings have had the symbolic resonance of the one on mutanabi street , the embodiment of baghdad s venerable intellectual history avid readers could find novels by the egyptian writer naguib mahfouz and newsweek magazines from the 1960s merchants often spread their wares out on the sidewalk , down the block from a building used for administration by ottomanera officials and , after world war i , british colonial officers religious texts , particularly on shiite ideology , began to appear after the toppling of saddam hussein , who had banned them from markets across baghdad the conversations at the shahbandar cafe blossomed into free expressions of political opinion the cafe became popular with foreign reporters seeking comments from iraqi intellectuals on the changes roiling iraqi society but commerce along mutanabi street began to decline last summer after the iraqi government imposed a citywide curfew every friday for security reasons , making it tough to get to mutanabi on its traditional market day an iraqi colonel on the scene on monday said the suicide car bomb , which was loaded with gas cylinders , had left a crater more than nine feet deep in the middle of the street at least 20 cars were set ablaze those terrorists do not represent islam , said wissam arif , 45 , an engineer and eager browser of the book market they are fighting science they hate the light of science and scientists have n't they killed hundreds of prophets and intellectuals \?

dallas , april 16 \( ap \) getting goals from the checking line is the kind of thing nhl teams need in pursuit of the stanley cup and the can say they are getting that the problem is , the guys they pay to score are not mike modano , jere lehtinen , philippe boucher , mike ribeiro and niklas hagman dallas s top five goalscorers in the regular season have yet to beat vancouver goalie roberto luongo that is a big reason the stars are trailing vancouver , 21 , going into game 4 of their firstround series tuesday night some of those people , a timely goal by them would certainly help the cause , stars coach dave tippett said monday even though our team is built around scoring by committee , we need those top players to contribute each of dallas s three goals the past two games has come from players who earn their ice time with grit vancouver has not scored much either the teams have combined for seven goals by seven different players the difference is that the ' scorers have included usual suspects like daniel sedin , markus naslund and taylor pyatt pyatt s goal was the winner in overtime of game 3 on sunday night vancouver s offense was dragging for the first 30plus minutes of that game , so coach alain vigneault changed his top line , pairing naslund with the sedin twins he also hooked up jan bulis and jannik hansen that combination produced the tying goal in the third period , when the canucks fired off 15 shots to only 4 by dallas it s always great to play with the twins , naslund said they 're smart players and they make it easy for you i thought the other line combinations played really well and we created a lot of chances , too , so it was a good shakeup dallas s lack of scoring chances bothers tippett as much as the lack of goals , figuring one will lead to the other modano logged the most ice time of any forward yet managed only a single shot the stars' captain , brenden morrow , played just under 20 minutes and did not register a shot we 're getting pucks at the net , but a lot of them are just hopefor plays thrown out there , morrow said we 've got to have a purpose for it and get it into the area , get effort in there to get rebounds we have n't done that enough modano sounded worn out from trying and failing the scoring chances are slim and none out there , said modano , who then mentioned the solid front presented by luongo and defenseman willie mitchell you try to make the most of it when you do get it you 've got to work through their checkers , then you 've got to go through mitchell and then you 've still got luongo we 've got our hands full tippett was tightlipped about possibly shaking up his lines we 'll see , he said the games are so tight , you do n't want to just throw everything out of the window we just have to have faith in the people we have there and keep pushing ahead the stars have also lost five straight home playoff games , a skid that spans three postseasons the last one gave back the homeice advantage they had gained by winning game 2 we do n't have that killer instinct right now , morrow said we 've got to find it within ourselves coaches ca n't talk it into you you 've got to find it dallas goaltender marty turco is halfway to a third straight playoff series loss but he is low on the list of people to blame in this series turco shut out the canucks through three overtimes in the opener , notched his first career playoff shutout in game 2 and was twothirds of the way to another in game 3 until the attack in front of him fizzled and he was beaten once in the third period and again in overtime you 're not going to shut a team out four times and win that way , said morrow , who added of turco he s giving us chances to win , and we 're not getting it done for him that s on our shoulders some of us have to step up and find a way to get that winner
there were times in george steinbrenner s ownership of the yankees when he would not allow his general manager to attend the annual meetings of major league general managers other teams , steinbrenner was convinced , wanted to steal the ideas that made the yankees so successful , and he was n't going to let that happen if the general manager was n't there , the thieves would have nothing to steal about 16 months ago , the yankees' brain trust met in tampa , fla steinbrenner and the team executives steve swindal , randy levine , lonn trost and brian cashman discussed the organization and its structure it was an appropriate time for that discussion because cashman s contract as general manager was expiring cashman , whose eightyear tenure was already longer than that of any of his predecessors in the steinbrenner regime , was n't happy with the organizational structure , and neither were some of the others at the meeting steinbrenner had allowed a twoheaded monster to grow and infect the operation , with the tampa faction often exerting greater influence on organizational decisions than the yankee stadium crew the general manager s opinion was often undermined by the tampa troops the view that prevailed at the meeting , though , was that the yankees had to be more like other teams , with one person , the general manager , making decisions imagine that the general manager would be responsible for the operation of the team what a novel concept that is exactly what cashman wanted give me the authority , he told the others , and i 'll accept the responsibility cashman would make the final decisions , subject only to steinbrenner s approval on major expenditures with steinbrenner , accountability has always fallen on the general manager , but it has n't always been deserved now it will fall squarely on cashman more than ever , as he goes forward , in the second year of his threeyear contract , cashman will be responsible for whatever may go wrong i 'll take the results good or bad , cashman said , rather than look back and regret not doing it the way i wanted if the yankees' run of division titles ends at nine this year , cashman will most likely answer for it steinbrenner probably wo n't fire him , but a second season without a division title could be fatal he knows that , and he is prepared to accept the consequences , as long as he has the authority to do the job the way he thinks it should be done cashman has already made two decisions on which the yankees' season could turn they open spring training this week manager joe torre will meet with reporters today the first workout is thursday without randy johnson , one of their best pitchers , and gary sheffield , one of their best hitters cashman had specific reasons for trading each player , but he had a common reason as well if you go back to last year , i said i'm interested in reducing payroll , cashman said last week i wanted to get more flexible and younger , yet maintain a championship team on a regular basis last year we reduced payroll for the first time in i do n't know how many years from 1995 , when the payroll was 40 million , through 2005 , when it was 200 million , the yankees' payroll rose every year for 10 years last year it dropped to 195 million this year it will be lower still it s lower , cashman said , and we 're younger youth is something that never impressed steinbrenner the only value young players had for him was as trade fodder but when he was suspended in the early 1990s , his designated general manager , gene michael , began changing the culture bernie williams , mariano rivera , andy pettitte , derek jeter and jorge posada remained in the organization , developed and formed the nucleus of the championship teams of the last decade now cashman will try to develop the next championship nucleus we want to contend but also put ourselves in better position to contend for years to come , he said you have to do it very carefully it s a balancing act hopefully , it s no more than taking a small step back and taking two giant steps forward i 've lost significant players in these transactions but i go in with my eyes wide open understanding that but i believe in what i'm doing cashman was alluding to the moves he made this offseason , trading sheffield , johnson and jaret wright for young players and holding on to his own young players walt jocketty , the st louis general manager , said in talking with brian cashman over the winter , i found that he s in that situation where he does n't want to give up quality young players that s what everybody looks for younger players in his three trades , cashman acquired eight players , only one of whom has extensive major league experience none of us are interested in giving away any of our good young players , cashman said to lump the yankees with everyone else is unusual for a yankees executive but another development at the meeting in october 2005 may be even more startling the yankees' brain trust decided that having all highly paid superstars and no young players was not the way to win we do n't need a 200 million payroll to win , they told themselves they came to that conclusion even though the team s revenue had taken off money is not an issue with the yankees , but they do n't have to spend it just because they have it and when they do spend it , spend it wisely if you get the idea that someone besides steinbrenner was exerting influence , you 're right
could not bear to watch the end of the ' game against the cincinnati reds last night with the 298th victory of his career hanging in the balance , glavine found a bench in the bowels of shea stadium and began to listen when more than 51 , 000 fans erupted after shawn green doubled with two outs in the eighth inning , glavine suspected something good had happened when the next batter , lastings milledge , snapped a 11 tie with a runscoring single , the cheers grew louder , leaving glavine with little doubt i did n't see it , glavine said of the eighthinning rally that put him in position for the victory i just went by their reaction , and i knew it was good milledge s hit up the middle secured the mets' 21 victory it also put glavine two victories from no 300 and kept a few more hairs on his head from turning gray after the game , glavine stood in front of his locker and cracked a joke , although a small part of him may have been serious i would n't lie to you , he said if i did n't come out with a win tonight , it would have had some psychological repercussions glavine pitched well in his previous outing , against the houston astros before the allstar game break but the mets won , 53 , in 17 innings and he got a nodecision , a familiar result for him this season after solid outings the cumulative effect of such bad luck led glavine to a tunnel in the eighth inning glavine \( 86 \) pitched his best game of the season , allowing one run and two hits in eight innings and striking out five batters he walked none but the mets were once again listless on offense for much of the night , and they did not lead until the eighth inning after the mets made two quick outs against the lefthanded reliever mike stanton , green began the eighthinning rally by going the opposite way for a double to left field milledge then smacked the first pitch he saw milledge was called up after the allstar game break to inject energy into the lineup the mets also needed help in left field after injuries to moises alou , endy ch vez and carlos g mez milledge is making the most of his opportunity after a foot injury kept him out for much of the past few months of the mets' nine runs in the first three games of this series , he has scored two of them and driven in three it s always good to help the team out , milledge said and as i said the first day i came in here , i'm not trying to carry the team because it s not my position right now manager willie randolph acknowledged that the mets could be playing better these days last night , they left 11 runners on base and seemed to grow impatient at the plate as the game unfolded they have scored four runs or fewer in 8 of 11 games this month paul lo duca snapped a 0for17 slump with a leadoff single in the second inning against the ' starter , matt belisle he also led off the fourth with an infield single but the mets failed to move him over both times they had six hits , all singles , through the first four innings five of those runners were left on base and the sixth jos reyes was caught trying to steal second base but glavine made sure the reds \( 3754 \) never pulled away it was ralph kiner night at shea , and the mets honored the former player and longtime broadcaster with a lengthy tribute that toyed with glavine s pregame routine he quickly found his grove , retiring 19 of the first 20 batters he faced the hitter that eluded glavine was brandon phillips , who led off the second inning with a home run , crushing a fastball over the wall in rightcenter field to give the reds a 10 lead phillips had six runs batted in during friday s 84 loss but glavine put down the next 16 batters on crisp , wellplaced pitches he did not make another mistake until ken griffey jr singled with one out in the seventh inning it was great to even get him a win , randolph said of glavine , who retired the side in order in the first , third , fourth , fifth , sixth and eighth innings it s a team game , but it would have been tough for him not to get some type of favorable results he was outstanding the mets tied the score in the sixth wright led off with a single and scored on green s twoout single ten of the mets' 11 hits were singles billy wagner pitched a perfect ninth to record his 19th save at that point , glavine could finally exhale i have n't had too many of those kinds of wins , glavine said so it was nice inside pitch the mets will designate dave williams for assignment to make room for oliver p rez , who will be called up to start today s series finale williams is out of options , meaning the mets will risk running him through waivers mike pelfrey , a starter who said yesterday he had been moved to the bullpen , will probably be sent down to make room for jorge sosa , who will start tomorrow s series opener at san diego
boston , oct 5 several players wore red pullover tops as they gathered for batting practice at fenway park on wednesday manny ram rez did a lot of talking and a lot of hugging , david ortiz did a lot of laughing and mike lowell did a lot of listening but there was one player in a red pullover who was more animated than any of the red sox he shouted , he waved his hands and he pushed ram rez a few times this player acted like a ringleader and looked as if he fit in as well as anyone once upon a brief time , he did the player was orlando cabrera , who wore a red pullover with a logo on it cabrera is the shortstop for the angels only because the red sox did not want him after he helped them end an 86yearold hex and win the 2004 world series title now cabrera is back at fenway and is trying to help end boston s season the red sox won the first game of the american league division series and were trying to take a 20 lead in the bestoffive series when they faced the angels on friday night the angels revamped their lineup against daisuke matsuzaka by switching vladimir guerrero from designated hitter to right field , moving chone figgins from right to center and using kendry morales as the designated hitter kelvim escobar started for the angels general manager theo epstein has made some savvy decisions in building the red sox into a team that has made the playoffs in four of the last five seasons but when epstein reviews the numerous moves that he has made , the decision not to resign cabrera is one that he likely regrets epstein and his staff seemed to outthink themselves in shunning the shortstop in front of them the red sox obtained cabrera from the montreal expos on july 31 , 2004 , as part of a fourteam trade that sent nomar garciaparra to the chicago cubs cabrera , a gold glove winner , helped stabilize a shaky defensive club and also batted 294 with 6 homers and 31 runs batted in he hit 288 with 11 rbi in 14 playoff games three years later , cabrera is apparently still uncertain why the red sox did not bring him back he declined an interview request thursday when the boston globe recently asked cabrera about boston s failure to resign him , he dodged the question and said , i 'll probably say something i should n't as successful as the red sox have been , they have searched for the next cabrera since letting the real cabrera go i never was upset , cabrera said of course , in that moment , after what we did , i wanted to stay and i wanted them to keep me , but there was no offer actually , cabrera does not have to say much since he left , the red sox have had a different shortstop each season , and none has been as complete a player as cabrera this season , cabrera batted 301 , scored 101 runs and led al shortstops with a 983 fielding percentage six weeks after the red sox won it all , they signed dgar renter a to a fouryear , 40 million contract the talented but shy renter a never flourished in boston he was lost at the plate and in the field , batting 276 and committing a careerhigh 30 errors when the season ended , the red sox dealt renter a and 11 million to the atlanta braves so , for one shaky season , the red sox paid renter a 19 million that investment would have been more than half of what it probably would have taken to get cabrera , who signed a fouryear , 32 million deal with the angels the red sox focused on defense and used lex gonz lez as their shortstop in 2006 , but they failed to reach the playoffs , so gonz lez , who hit 255 , was one and done julio lugo agreed to a fouryear , 36 million deal before this season and became the new shortstop , but he disappointed boston with a 237 average lugo was hitting 197 at the allstar game break he got off to a really slow start , manager terry francona said and , in boston , you 're not allowed to do that and it bothered him for a while nothing seemed to bother cabrera during his time in boston he was happy with the red sox and he has said he is happy with the angels but cabrera will be a lot happier if he and the angels can send his old team home
president chen shuibian of taiwan on thursday denounced a peace overture from president hu jintao of china that has received a cautious welcome here from both candidates for the presidential election next march it is very clear now that if we were to sign such a peace treaty under the framework of the 'one china' principle , then i think this would mean , for the 23 million people of taiwan , a treaty of surrender , mr chen said in a 90minute interview at the presidential palace here on monday , mr hu suggested during his speech at the opening of the chinese communist party congress in beijing that the mainland and taiwan conclude a peace agreement ending the formal state of hostility that has endured since chiang kaishek s nationalists lost china s civil war in 1949 and retreated to taiwan but the offer carried a longstanding mainland chinese condition rejected by most taiwanese politicians that negotiations can proceed only under the principle that there is one china , with taiwan and the mainland representing indivisible components of a single nation ruled from beijing that condition makes it unlikely that mr hu s somewhat vague proposal , which included eventual reunification of taiwan with the mainland , could serve as a basis for negotiations but mr hu s tone contrasted sharply with the mainland s more confrontational position during previous election campaigns in taiwan in 1996 , china fired missiles into waters off taiwan to intimidate voters the effort failed , however , by undermining the position of politicians seeking reconciliation mr hu s remarks were the latest sign of a more sophisticated chinese policy of trying to reach past mr chen s hostility to appear nonthreatening to taiwan s voters but chinese officials remain vitriolic about mr chen himself , irritated by his persistent advocacy of greater independence for taiwan through more than seven years in office mr chen has inched closer and closer to a formal declaration of independence without actually changing the island s constitution , flag or legal name , the republic of china taiwan is an independent , sovereign country taiwan is not part of china , nor is taiwan a local government of the people s republic of china , mr chen said during the interview , reiterating a formulation that he has been using lately to the irritation of beijing officials in an interview last month , wu jianmin , a top chinese diplomat for two decades and the president of the china foreign affairs university in beijing , which is affiliated with the foreign ministry , said of mr chen , his problem is he loves to make trouble he added , people do n't like tension , and he likes tension , and whenever he can he does what he can to increase tensions it was mr chen who chose to schedule an interview during the communist party congress in beijing , a politically delicate time when the chinese government tries to avoid domestic and international disputes mr chen made clear on thursday that he had an equal dislike of mr hu hu is a formidable rival , sharp yet merciless , mr chen said he is like a smiling tiger , hiding a dagger in a smile , with honey in his mouth but a sword at his stomach ma yingjeou , the presidential candidate of the opposition nationalist party , or kuomintang , and the frontrunner in polls , was more receptive to mr hu s offer of peace talks in a telephone interview later on thursday he said , in general , it is in conformity with our party s platform mr ma , said his party maintained its position that there is one china , but that taiwan and the mainland had different interpretations of what this meant he also said that talks with the mainland should be about a peace agreement , not taiwan s future , which should be decided only by people in taiwan the mainland side should remove the almost 1 , 000 missiles aimed at taiwan , and they should do it before we start negotiations , he added mr chen s democratic progressive party has been deeply divided lately between those favoring legal steps toward formal independence from the mainland and moderates favoring closer economic ties to the mainland frank hsieh , the party s candidate , who has not granted any interviews here to the foreign news media during his campaign , told local reporters on tuesday that he could accept a peace agreement with the mainland provided that the people of taiwan held the initiative in making decisions and provided that any agreement gave taiwan a dignified relationship with the mainland he provided no specifics he does n't want to burn any bridges to future possibilities of dialogue , said hsiao bikhim , the foreign affairs director of mr hsieh s campaign and a prominent democratic progressive party lawmaker who shares his moderate stance toward beijing mr chen s continuing criticisms of beijing have made mr hsieh appear more moderate that has prompted questions here of whether mr chen and mr hsieh , who have worked together for two decades , are secretly coordinating a policy of seeming to take divergent policies toward the mainland to ensure mr hsieh s election none of us opposes the idea of signing a peace treaty , but everybody has different preconditions and different conditions of accepting this proposal , mr chen said hu has his version and ma has his conditions hsieh has his conditions and i have my own insistence so you can say that all of us like the idea of signing a peace treaty , but it does n't mean that we welcome this peace treaty without any conditions so in that regard , frank hsieh and i are in total agreement photo president chen shuibian of taiwan denounced a peace overture from china s leader \( photograph by chaoyang chan for the new york times \)

la paz , to understand s growing influence here , consider that more than two dozen ambassadors are in this capital city , including those of bolivia s leading trading partners like brazil , the united states and argentina yet none enjoy the direct conduit that the venezuelan ambassador , julio montes , has established with president evo morales mr montes often accompanies mr morales on domestic and international trips on executive jets provided by venezuela s national oil company , say officials who have seen them traveling together on many days mr montes , who arrived in la paz a year ago , can be found at the presidential palace huddled in meetings with mr morales or the president s top aides since mr morales became president little more than a year ago , venezuela has quickly come to rival the united states as bolivia s main patron it has provided assistance for the army , cattle ranches , soybean cultivation , microfinance projects , urban sanitation companies and the oil industry perhaps most important to washington , despite its opposition , venezuelan financial assistance has helped bolivia push ahead with plans to increase exports of its industrial production of coca , the main ingredient in cocaine the coca financing plan has helped venezuela accomplish one of its foreign policy goals limiting the regional influence of the united states , which for years has provided bolivia with millions of dollars in aid in an effort to curb coca production the united states recently cut its drug enforcement aid to bolivia by about 25 percent , to 338 million , after mr morales acknowledged that the size of the country s cocagrowing areas were about double official estimates a senior american official here , speaking anonymously out of concern that bolivia s already fragile relations with the united states could erode further , said it was difficult to know the exact amount of venezuelan aid because many of the agreements between venezuela and bolivia were not made public citing mr morales s efforts to assert greater government control over the energy industry and to rush a military agreement with venezuela through the bolivian congress , the american official said , it is clear that venezuela has strongly influenced policy in bolivia analysts who have reviewed the various venezuelan assistance projects say the total may surpass the 120 million in antidrug and humanitarian assistance from the united states , which made bolivia one of the largest recipients in the world of aid from washington per capita a report in the venezuelan newspaper el nacional over the weekend of feb 1718 said president hugo ch vez had approved a 100 million assistance fund for bolivia , though it was not clear whether that included assistance for military or petroleum projects what we are doing in bolivia is the same that cuba has done in venezuela , mr montes told el nacional , referring to the thousands of cuban doctors and social workers who had been sent to venezuela the difference is that the greatest resource of the cubans is their human capital we have the possibility to help our bolivian brothers with economic resources not all are pleased with venezuela s new role we 've become a client state of venezuela , in what is a new form of imperialism , said scar ortiz , an opposition senator with the podemos party who has publicly criticized bolivia s relationship with venezuela mr ortiz and other opposition legislators have been particularly critical of venezuelan ambitions that they believe may conflict with bolivia s interests for instance , even as venezuela advises ypfb , bolivia s national energy company , in its efforts to assert greater control over ventures with foreign energy companies , venezuela has moved forward with its own plans to build a pipeline that would export gas to brazil , currently the main customer for bolivian gas political supporters of mr morales argue that the alliance with venezuela has allowed bolivia to avoid some of the potentially detrimental effects of united states trade and drug policies in latin america our comrades in venezuela are rescuing our way of life , said jer nimo meneces mollo , director of coca industrialization for bolivia s government , which is receiving 250 , 000 in financing from venezuela to build two cocaprocessing plants that will produce coca tea for exclusive export to the venezuelan market no one but hugo ch vez is brave enough to do this others point to a prospective trade agreement between colombia and the united states that could ease the entry of american soybean exports to colombia and potentially deprive bolivian farmers of one of their key markets in a boon to mr morales s government , venezuela answered the threat by announcing that it would purchase a large portion of bolivia s soybean crop venezuela also says it plans to import 300 tons of bolivian beef to meet demand in its domestic market , along with as much as 7 , 500 tons of beans and poultry though much of venezuela s aid is related to agriculture , like the donation of more than 300 tractors produced by a joint venezuelaniranian venture , its military assistance has attracted the most scrutiny opposition legislators are trying to overturn a military agreement reached last year that could provide bolivia with as much as 47 million in assistance intended , among other things , to strengthen the government s presence in the eastern lowlands , where separatist sentiment runs strong the international institute for strategic studies , a british research group , said in a recent report that venezuela , which is undertaking a rapid armaments buildup , could be providing bolivia with weapons and financing for new military bases officials from both countries minimized the report , saying any military assistance was intended to assist mr morales by lending him helicopters and flight crews to travel throughout bolivia citing military officials , the bolivian newspaper la raz n reported on feb 19 that venezuela was giving bolivia two superpuma helicopters in a goodwill gesture bolivia is a tremendously poor country , said gustavo torrico , a leading supporter of mr morales in congress any help we can get is positive not least , the venezuelan aid has given bolivia a source of assistance outside the international monetary fund , whose policies are widely criticized in much of latin america as not having helped the poor it has also given mr morales the breathing space to carry out popular social welfare programs the direct relationship with ch vez has n't been problematic for evo morales so far , said jim shultz , executive director of the democracy center , a nonprofit institute in the bolivian city of cochabamba the imf is a banker without clients in parts of latin america
the sun was not yet up yesterday , and members of senator s campaign team were confronted with the kind of attack that most infuriates them one questioning the character of mrs clinton and her husband to make matters worse , it came from , the hollywood executive who was once a big supporter of the clintons but has since turned on them and is now backing senator for the democratic presidential nomination what followed was a remarkably caustic exchange between the clinton and obama campaigns that highlighted the sensitivity in the clinton camp to mr obama s rapid rise as a rival and his positioning as a fresh face unburdened by the baggage borne by mrs clinton , the junior senator from new york the clinton camp seemed also to be sending a warning to mudslinging critics that they would be dealt with fiercely it began with a column in the new york times by maureen dowd , in which mr geffen said the clintons lie with such ease , it s troubling and that the clinton political operation is going to be very unpleasant and unattractive and effective mr geffen called mr clinton a reckless guy who had not changed in the last six years , and suggested that mrs clinton was too scripted in a statement it fired off at 9 46 am , the clinton campaign called on mr obama to sever his ties to mr geffen and return the portion of the 13 million that mr geffen helped raise on tuesday at a reception in beverly hills while senator obama was denouncing slashandburn politics yesterday , his campaign s finance chair was viciously and personally attacking senator clinton and her husband , howard wolfson , the clinton campaign communications director , said in a statement bill burton , a spokesman for mr obama , responded with a statement less than an hour and a half later , saying it was ironic that the clintons had no problem with david geffen when he was raising them 18 million and sleeping at their invitation in the lincoln bedroom the punch and counterpunch went on all day , transfixing the political world and overshadowing a gathering of all the democratic candidates except mr obama , the junior illinois senator , at a unionsponsored forum in nevada at which mrs clinton faced criticism from some opponents about her iraq stance the democrats were not the only ones dealing with intramural warfare on the republican side , vice president dick cheney struck back at criticism leveled against him and former defense secretary donald h rumsfeld by senator john mccain of arizona , underscoring the often tense relationship between the white house and mr mccain the presidential campaign has been a relatively polite affair in its early stages , and the day marked an abrupt change of tone that exposed the intensity of the bad feeling bubbling just below the surface in both parties none of the players showed much inclination to back off in an interview with abc news in which mr cheney was asked about mr mccain s criticism of mr rumsfeld , the vice president responded by bringing up other mccain comments critical of mr cheney s role in managing the war in iraq , and said mr mccain had subsequently said he was sorry john said some nasty things about me the other day , mr cheney added , and then the next time he saw me , ran over to me and apologized maybe he 'll apologize to rumsfeld in response , mr mccain seemed to go out of his way to reemphasize his assertion that mr rumsfeld would be remembered as one of the worst defense secretaries in history , and to criticize the bush administration more generally when he appeared at a news conference in los angeles to discuss initiatives to deal with  when asked about the administration s environmental record , mr mccain said , i would assess this administration s record on global warming as terrible asked by a reporter about his comments about mr rumsfeld , mr mccain said , the criticism of the conduct of the war i have voiced for more than three years when i saw that this train wreck was taking place some minutes later , after the news conference had ended , mr mccain , unbidden , said to the reporter , sir , i stand by my comments about secretary rumsfeld , by the way similarly , mr geffen affirmed his view of the clintons , saying he had been quoted accurately and that mr wolfson was wrong in calling him the finance chairman of the obama campaign \( he said he had no formal role in the campaign \) mrs clinton , asked wednesday afternoon if mr obama should denounce the geffen remarks , declined to join in the handtohand combat , but expressed general disapproval with the remarks while also defending her husband , which drew huge cheers from the audience of union members she was addressing i want to run a very positive campaign , and i sure do n't want democrats or the supporters of democrats to be engaging in the politics of personal destruction , she said at the forum of democratic presidential candidates in carson city , nev i think we should stay focused on what we 're going to do for america and , you know , i believe bill clinton was a good president , and i'm very proud of the record of his two terms when pressed , she said she would leave it up to the obama campaign to make its decision on mr geffen , then noted that she was excited to be in nevada with the other candidates who came , a comment that only drew attention to mr obama s choice to skip the event the geffen remarks bubbled up throughout the forum one candidate , gov bill richardson of new mexico , said mr obama should denounce mr geffen s remarks if we 're going to win , we have to be positive , mr richardson said i think these namecallings are not good as he arrived in iowa late yesterday afternoon , mr obama was met with questions from reporters about the clash it s not clear to me why i would be apologizing for someone else s remarks , mr obama said my sense is that mr geffen may have differences with the clintons , but that does n't really have anything to do with our campaign when asked whether he was proud of mr geffen s support , the senator declared he hosted an event for me yesterday absolutely obama advisers described the geffen remarks as an insignificant blip and said they saw no political danger in letting them stand while some supporters of mrs clinton said they were worried that the campaign had lost its cool over mr geffen , several clinton advisers insisted that they were not overreacting one adviser , who is not part of mrs clinton s daytoday inner circle but speaks to her regularly about politics and fundraising , said mr geffen s comments might not shock political insiders in washington or new york who are used to hearing bad things about the clintons but such criticism , especially from a former clinton supporter like mr geffen , could surprise and concern average voters in iowa , new hampshire and in other politically important states where they are starting to form impressions of mrs clinton as a presidential candidate other advisers said the clinton camp was simply frustrated that mr obama had received glowing media coverage , and was eager to call out his campaign for hypocrisy by contrasting the geffen remarks with mr obama s pledge to be positive obama has gotten under the campaign s skin for weeks now especially his free ride in the media and hillary s people were just waiting for their first chance to attack his image as mr positive , said one clinton adviser who is not part of the daytoday political operation
los angeles , dec 3 tim floyd served as a technical adviser on glory road , the 2006 movie based on the story of texas western university and its colorblind men s basketball coach , don haskins that team traveled the stillsegregated road to the 1966 ncaa tournament championship , using an allblack starting five to beat an allwhite kentucky team in the title game the hollywood experience is relevant now because floyd and the southern california team he coaches are creating their own feelgood story , a little cin ma v rit with a different plotline but the same goal it stars o j mayo , the freshman with the otherworldly talent and a clouded past , a 6foot5 guard and the former no 1 high school prospect in the country who chose usc because he wanted to help create a legacy , to be a pioneer mayo needs to do it fast , because he will most likely be gone to the nba after one year the supporting cast includes the freshman forward davon jefferson , the sophomore guards daniel hackett and dwight lewis and the sophomore forward taj gibson in a town where ucla has traditionally ruled college basketball the way usc has dominated football , there is change afoot the trojans \( 62 \) , who play no 2 memphis \( 70 \) on tuesday in the jimmy v classic at madison square garden , are bitpart players no more the 4point loss sunday to kansas , which is now ranked no 3 , has only served to motivate usc this is a young team that has a lot of talent and a learning curve , floyd said before the loss to kansas , perhaps to adjust some unrealistic fan expectations as young as we are , with no seniors , three juniors , five sophomores and seven freshmen , that can be a problem it just depends on how the young guys adjust but our goal is to get to the ncaa tournament and try to improve on what we accomplished last year that would mean improving on the 25win season that was ended by north carolina in the round of 16 of the ncaa tournament before the almost shocking arrival of mayo on the scene late last year , floyd may not have set his sights quite that high he lost his top three scorers and nearly 44 points a game with the departures of nick young , gabe pruitt and lodrick stewart to professional basketball making up for lost scoring have been mayo \( 210 points \) , jefferson \( 144 \) and hackett \( 113 \) but to simply view mayo s scoring is to marvel at the entrance to the louvre without taking in the da vinci and michelangelo pieces inside consider his very presence at usc his score of 29 on the act , which put him in the 95th percentile among high school seniors , would have gained him admission to most universities , but it was his 282 points a game as a senior at huntington \( wva \) high school that had coaches lusting after him floyd was among them , but he figured there was no chance mayo would be interested , so he never sent him a recruiting letter mayo s overture to usc was orchestrated by the los angeles event promoter rodney guillory , who walked into floyd s office in november 2005 to tell him he had essentially just won the lottery because mayo wanted to be a trojan i 've wanted to come here since the 11th grade , mayo said i just really enjoy the way coach floyd handles his players and the way he coaches he s a great player s coach he s a winner and a tremendous competitor , and it just kind of matches up with the way i like to play he s great floyd knew none of that he knew that guillory had run afoul of the ncaa in 2000 for providing airplane tickets to two players , who were suspended for violating ncaa regulations so floyd had investigators for the usc athletic department look to see if there were irregularities in guillory s relationship with mayo none were found , floyd said mayo himself has had some minor scrapes with authorities and with the law he once ran into a basketball referee at a high school game , but was exonerated of charges of wrongdoing after videos clearly showed the referee took a dive he was cleared of marijuana charges last year when another man with whom he was riding in a car admitted the drugs were his , not mayo s this is the level of scrutiny top athletes undergo before they step foot on a field or a floor at a division i program in mayo s case , the hardwood stage is where the truth and nothing but is gleaned last week , with less than seven minutes left in the trojans' victory over oklahoma , the sooners had cut their deficit to 6 mayo had been held to 6 points by tony crocker crocker had the ball and was about to shoot a 3pointer when mayo blurred into the frame , leaped and partly blocked crocker s shot mayo scored two baskets in the next 50 seconds to increase usc s lead to 10 oklahoma was in free fall now , and mayo s 3pointer with 5 minutes 43 seconds left , a shot so pure it barely moved the net , made it 5643 mayo also scored the next two baskets , both times paralyzing crocker with a quick move and blazing first step eleven straight

i m off to see bruce springsteen play tonight in hartford , the first stop on his new tour my tickets are way up in the nosebleed seats , but what the hey i feel lucky to have them there s been a lot of firstrate writing about springsteen , but one of the best pieces is hard to find richard ford s essay , the boss observed , which appeared in the december 1985 issue of esquire if this piece is anthologized , i don t know the book and i couldn t find it on the web thank god for microfilm here are a few selections from what ford had to say springsteen s phrases tinted as they are with loss and time s little escapes have become potent business to me , since they are full of emotion and canniness i didn t guess could adhere to the bits of life he sings about not my life , after all but sealed in my jeep , with the world batting past , i listen and , for a time , trade my own fleeting moment for the intimate little word pictures that constitute his songs moments , and that springsteen , like a good shortstory writer , fashions into tiny anthems and if it s true i m not completely transported , i m at least moved to think that this is rock n roll of a somewhat higher order than i ve known up to now  a problem meets the man who writes about rock n roll , and bruce springsteen in particular quoting lyrics to recommend a wider reference hardly ever does more than prove how removed from poetry the words really are \( which is an injustice \) and , at the song s expense , remind us how much the music really matters it s like explaining the color blue to a man with no eyes more is needed and with springsteen , whose music is hard to generalize about anyway , double everything you really have to hear it almost any of his signature heavyhitters can suggest what s smart and intriguing about the songs , and maybe none as cagily as hungry heart , another of his anthems that captained a piece of generational imagination and sent chills up the spines of jillions hungry heart is , at its core , a bleak and irresolute vignette about a married guy , with kids , in baltimore , who takes a drive and keeps on driving first a bar then a woman then a bar again and finally nowhere worth telling springsteen sets these little cheeveresque woes to some friendly , rambunctious carny music music tinted with tumult and longing something you d hear if you hung around a bandwagon at a circus , or maybe around asbury park \( a piano , and a saxophone sounding like a tuba \) the bridge between these two hardtoreconciles his music and his lyrics is springsteen s chesty delivery , as he marches down through the words in a wideeyed , forthright way , hardly heeding the understory , and ending up with the sentiment that , after all , everybody just needs a home and a place to rest it s a complex business , you need to believe  it is a uniquely american celebrity , rewarding excellence that s unquestionably native , prizing an apparently natural phenomenon that turns out to be wonderful , as if a kid could sign up for metal shop and in a few semesters produce a henry moore we like our excellence even better with history , confident that what we re seeing and liking so much is a product of years work performed in obscurity , of duespaying in springsteen s case , this lets us believe he s earned us though there s an answering generosity in his music that offers everyone a sweet insider s feel , an assurance that no matter when we first took notice , we were in on things from the ground floor ford s essay ends this way he s doing his best , using himself up with the thing he knows how to do , for the delight and even the edification of us all and no cynicism s lurking there not a bit we should all be so lucky this is a books blog , not a music blog but when it comes to springsteen , these two subjects , for me , intermingle a little it s not that the guy has influenced a lot of writers , and vice versa that s old news it s that springsteen was a small but decisive influence on me and others , i d guess as a reader , when i was in my early teens i grew up in a house where there were not a lot of books but i read every springsteen interview i could get my hands on , and listened to a ton of bootlegs , and he was always pushing the books he loved ron kovic s born on the 4th of july , joe klein s biography of woody guthrie , steinbeck s novels i went looking for these books , and they led to others , many of them far off the regular high school syllabus personally , i don t tend to talk much about my springsteen habit , especially around under40 music geeks , who pick on me about it but if you ve waded this far into a post like this one , you re asking for it here s a favorite clip a mashup of darlington county and honky tonk woman plucked from the bottomless well of delights that is youtube
over the last decade , former president has raised more than 500 million for his foundation , allowing him to build a glassandsteel presidential library in little rock , ark , and burnish his image as an impresario of global philanthropy the foundation has closely guarded the identities of its donors including one who gave 313 million last year now , the secrecy surrounding the william j clinton foundation has become a campaign issue as senator seeks the democratic presidential nomination with her husband as a prime source of strategy and star power some of her rivals argue that donors could use presidential foundations to circumvent campaign finance laws intended to limit political influence mr clinton himself echoed those concerns this fall when he pledged to make public future donors if mrs clinton was elected president while disclosure is not legally required , failure to do so , mr clinton said , would raise all these questions about whether people would try to win favor with her by giving money to me even so , past donors should remain private , he insisted , unless there is some conflict of which i am aware , and there is not but an examination of the foundation demonstrates how its fundraising has at times fostered the potential for conflict the new york times has compiled the first comprehensive list of 97 donors who gave or pledged a total of 69 million for the clinton presidential library in the final years of the clinton administration the examination found that while some 1 million contributors were longtime clinton friends , others were seeking policy changes from the administration two pledged 1 million each while they or their companies were under investigation by the justice department other donations came from supporters who had been ensnared in campaign finance scandals surrounding mr clinton s 1996 reelection campaign in raising record sums for her campaign , mrs clinton has tapped many of the foundation s donors at least two dozen have become hillraisers , each bundling 100 , 000 or more for her presidential bid the early library donors , combined with their families and political action committees , have contributed at least 784 , 000 to mrs clinton s senate and presidential coffers the foundation and mrs clinton s political campaigns have been intertwined in other ways terry mcauliffe , who led the foundation s fundraising and sits on its board , is now mrs clinton s campaign chairman and chief fundraiser cheryl mills plays a similar dual role , sitting on the foundation board and serving as the general counsel to mrs clinton s campaign and jay carson recently traded a communications position at the foundation for a job as her campaign s press secretary as the scope of the foundation expanded from the clinton library into issues like treating aids in the developing world and addressing global poverty and , and mrs clinton moved closer to announcing her candidacy , the pace of giving quickened last year , contributions reached 135 million , a 70 percent increase over the previous year twothirds came from just 11 donors the 313 million donation , which was previously undisclosed , came from the radcliffe foundation run by frank giustra , a canadian who has made millions financing mining deals around the world mr giustra has become a member of mr clinton s inner circle , joining him on global trips and lending him the use of his private md87 jet for weeks , clinton foundation officials had suggested that the 313 million contribution listed on its tax return did not come from a single donor they then said it came from a single source , but declined to identify it wednesday afternoon , a representative of mr giustra contacted the times and acknowledged the radcliffe contribution this year , mr giustra announced separate plans to give the clinton foundation 100 million , plus half of his future earnings from natural resource business ventures , for a joint project to spur economic growth in poor latin american mining communities taken together , the contributions make mr giustra one of the foundation s largest benefactors , if not the single largest the times s findings are based on tax documents filed by the clinton foundation and by groups that contributed to it , interviews with donors and people with direct knowledge of the foundation s activities , as well as federal government records and an analysis of campaign finance data in a statement , the foundation said , donors did not seek , nor did president clinton give , favors from the federal government , adding that most of the contributions came after mr clinton left office president clinton is grateful for the support the foundation has received from more than 100 , 000 donors , which helped provide aids medication for 750 , 000 people , fight climate change , combat childhood obesity and build heath systems around the world , the statement said in a separate written response from mrs clinton s campaign , a spokesman , phil singer , said , senator clinton is not involved in the fundraising or operations of the clinton foundation mr singer noted that president clinton s promise to disclose future donors should his wife become president went beyond what the law required to limit the influence of any single donor , federal election law prohibits foreign donations to presidential campaigns and limits americans to 2 , 300 per election but presidential foundations are free to accept unlimited and anonymous contributions , even from foreigners and foreign governments indeed , the saudi royal family , the king of morocco , a foundation linked to the united arab emirates , and the governments of kuwait and qatar have made contributions of unknown amounts to the clinton foundation the vast scale of these secret fundraising operations presents enormous opportunities for abuse , said representative henry a waxman , democrat of california , who introduced a bill to force disclosure of presidential foundation donors the bill passed the house , 39034 , in march but stalled in the senate in june 1999 , as the clinton administration wound down , mrs clinton told friends gathered in the white house solarium that wealthy donors had offered to establish a foundation for her but she was set on running for the senate in new york that same month , mr clinton and his chief fundraiser met for dinner with 40 executives at la grenouille , a french restaurant in manhattan the president had a vision for a charitable foundation that would tackle problems domestic and foreign , several former aides who helped establish the foundation said but first , mr clinton had to raise money for his presidential library , which would ultimately cost 165 million he found a ready pool of library donors in people and companies with matters before the government , many of them loyal democratic contributors on october 6 , 1999 , the charitable arm of the anheuserbusch companies gave 200 , 000 , the first of five payments over five years totaling 1 million , according to records filed by the company s foundation less than a month earlier , the company , the country s leading beer maker , had scored a major victory when the clinton administration s federal trade commission dropped a bid to regulate beer , wine and liquor advertising that critics said was aimed at underage drinkers francine i katz , a company spokeswoman , said the donation was unrelated to any government action and that its foundation had contributed more than 360 million to a wide array of organizations , including the bush , truman and johnson presidential libraries william a brandt jr , a bankruptcy lawyer in chicago and prolific democratic fundraiser , pledged 1 million in may 1999 at the time , the justice department was investigating mr brandt s testimony to congress about a 10 , 000 per couple fundraiser he had held for the president s 1996 reelection campaign at issue was whether he had lied when he denied promoting it as an explicit opportunity to lobby a top bankruptcy official at the event in august 1999 , the justice department determined that prosecution is not warranted mr brandt , who is now a hillraiser , did not respond to several phone and email messages bernard l schwartz , another major democratic contributor who was then chief executive of loral space and communications , gave 250 , 000 and pledged 750 , 000 more in 2000 at the time , investigators were trying to determine if loral had improperly provided satellite technology to china under the bush administration , loral agreed to pay a civil fine of 14 million to settle the case mr schwartz , who is now also a hillraiser , said that his donations were unconnected to loral s troubles and added that he had contributed to other presidential libraries toward the end of the clinton administration , dr richard machado gonzalez and his lawyer , miguel d lausell , both major democratic donors in the 1996 presidential election , were pushing the president to increase reimbursements to hospitals in puerto rico , like the one owned by dr machado mr lausell pledged 1 million to the library in 1999 , eight months before mr clinton proposed increasing medicare payments to puerto rico for the second time in his administration dr machado gave the foundation 100 , 000 about six months later in the interim , the president appointed mr lausell to the board of the overseas private investment corporation , which helps american companies with foreign projects jeffrey farrow , who coordinated issues involving puerto rico for the president , said the administration felt medicare unfairly penalized puerto rico by paying a lower rate there than in the 50 states although congress rejected the proposed increase , mr farrow said they did n't have to contribute the way they did in order to get our attention both men are supporters of mrs clinton , and mr lausell serves as a senior adviser on latino affairs dr machado did not return calls seeking comment , and efforts to reach mr lausell through the campaign were not successful a fledgling telecommunications company , nextwave wireless , was battling the federal communications commission when library fundraisers tapped its chief executive and a major investor nextwave had promised to pay 474 billion for cellphone licenses , but when it declared bankruptcy before completing its payments , the fcc threatened to put the licenses up for public auction , which would have ruined nextwave over three consecutive days in december 1999 , with a decision imminent , the library logged a 100 , 000 pledge from nextwave s chief executive , allen salmasi , and a 100 , 000 contribution plus a 1 million pledge from bay harbour management , a major investor in nextwave the agency ultimately repossessed nextwave s licenses , prompting a court battle that the company won bay harbour s coowner , douglas teitelbaum , who declined to comment , never fulfilled his promise to contribute the additional 1 million mr salmasi did not respond to an email message or to calls to a company spokesman mr clinton also found support for his library among some people who figured in the democratic fundraising controversies dating to the 1996 elections that involved white house sleepovers , coffees for big donors and money funneled from the chinese government among them was farhad azima , an iranianborn aviation executive whose involvement in the irancontra scandal one of his companies flew military equipment to iran in the 1980s prompted the democratic national committee to return a 143 , 000 donation in 1997 the party later accepted the money mr azima pledged 1 million to the library another 1 million pledge came from eric and patricia hotung mr hotung is a hong kong businessman who in 1997 was granted a meeting with mr clinton s national security adviser after mr hotung s wife , patricia , an american , offered 100 , 000 to the democrats nine of the original library donors received presidential appointments to organizations like the president s committee on the arts and humanities and the united states holocaust memorial council in his final days in office , mr clinton appointed two of the donors , the businessmen mark s weiner and vinod gupta , to the board of the john f kennedy center for the performing arts at a democratic debate in september , when mrs clinton was asked whether the foundation would disclose its donors , she indicated that the decision was not hers well , you 'll have to ask them , she replied , referring to the former president and his staff but mrs clinton s effort to distance herself understates the extent to which the foundation was a joint enterprise from the start shortly after the clintons left the white house , close advisers convened meetings at the couple s washington home to map out mr clinton s future as a philanthropist mrs clinton played an important role in shaping both the foundation s organization and the scope of its work , said karen a tramontano , a senior adviser in the clinton white house and the foundation s first chief of staff advisers also were acutely aware that the foundation s operations and any perception of a conflict could harm mrs clinton politically she and i would speak frequently , ms tramontano said she had a lot of ideas all the papers that went to him went to her early on , donations to the library caused perception problems the day after he left office , mr clinton was embroiled in a scandal over his 11thhour pardon of the financier marc rich , who fled the united states in 1983 to avoid tax evasion and other charges a congressional hearing later revealed that the pardon came after mr rich s former wife , denise rich , contributed 450 , 000 to mr clinton s library that spring , mrs clinton cosponsored legislation to publicly identify donors to foundations of future sitting presidents she referred to that legislation in the debate three months ago , although the bill had died in committee beyond the revelation of the rich donation , the names of some other donors emerged after the library opened in november 2004 , when a new york sun reporter found a partial contributor list displayed on a public computer there the list , with neither amounts nor dates , disclosed donations from the saudi royal family and other foreign sources after the sun story , the computer plug was pulled as the foundation has evolved into global philanthropy , it has attracted more large donors among them are tom golisano , an iconoclastic billionaire from upstate new york , who gives the foundation 3 million to 5 million a year , according to mr golisano s confidants stephen bing , a hollywood producer and a hillraiser , who contributed stock worth 10 , 028 , 614 in 2005 sir tom hunter , a scottish businessman who began donating 10 million a year in 2006 for economic development in africa and the bill melinda gates foundation , which said it had given or pledged 23 , 145 , 677 since 2005 , mostly to support aids work and an effort to reduce the costs of malaria drugs throughout , mrs clinton has offered good , specific ideas to the foundation when mr clinton asks her to attend planning sessions , said ira magaziner , a top foundation executive and longtime clinton adviser as the presidential campaign got under way , foundation officials began working to ensure that none of their enterprises would have political repercussions for mrs clinton brian byrd , who once worked for the rockefeller foundation and is now a lobbyist for arts groups , said that this year he interviewed for a job created to help review attendees to mr clinton s annual conference and make sure charitable pledges were met part of it was that hillary was running for president , and they wanted to be sure everything was on the up and up that was said to me , said mr byrd , who added that he decided he did not want and was not offered the position they wanted to get all their ducks in a row

moscow , april 3 prime minister and his cabinet remained defiant tuesday , resisting an order by s president , , to disband the parliament , while thousands gathered near the parliament building in support of the prime minister the cabinet , which is loyal to mr yanukovich , responded early tuesday to the presidential decree disbanding parliament by ordering government agencies to disregard it mr yushchenko responded tuesday with his own decree invalidating the cabinet s order the standoff led to confusion over who is controlling the daytoday operations of the government and represented a reversal in fortunes from the orange revolution just two years ago , when mr yushchenko swept to power in a wave of protests against mr yanukovich s fraudulent election victory the rivalry between the men , mr yushchenko a prowestern reformer and mr yanukovich favoring closer ties with russia , reflects a broad division in the society of ukraine , a country of 47 million people balanced between russia and the west they met for four hours on tuesday , during which mr yushchenko said he reminded the prime minister that under the constitution the president controls the country s army , according to a statement from the presidential news service viktor yushchenko , as commander in chief of ukraine s armed forces , also stressed he would allow no use of force in the country , the news service said in a statement after the meeting mr yanukovich said before the meeting that he hoped the president would reverse his order we shall do everything to persuade the president of ukraine to recall his decree , he said , in remarks carried on russian state television if he does not do it , i think in this case not only parliamentary but also presidential elections will be inevitable but mr yushchenko reaffirmed after the meeting that he would not rescind his decree an eightmonthold powersharing deal between mr yushchenko and mr yanukovich collapsed monday when mr yushchenko disbanded parliament , mr yanukovich s power base , and called new elections for may 27 , less than two months from now parliament responded by passing a resolution forming a separate central election committee , a maneuver challenging mr yushchenko s authority on tuesday , however , a district court in kiev suspended that resolution germany , which holds the rotating presidency of the european union , issued a statement on tuesday calling for ukrainian politicians to resolve their dispute in compliance with the constitution and democratic rules in washington , the state department spokesman , sean mccormack , said ukrainian leaders should take full responsibility for their supporters' actions in any street protests the turnout in kiev s squares and parks on a balmy spring day was modest several thousand supporters of mr yanukovich rallied at three sites in the city and erected roughly 100 tents on independence square , the focus of the 2004 orange revolution but the crowds were orderly and there was no evidence of a major police presence mr yushchenko s news service said tuesday that disbanding parliament was justified under ukrainian law because mr yanukovich had recruited individual deputies to join his coalition , in violation of the constitution , which says a parliamentary coalition can be formed only among parties mr yanukovich had been working to win a vetoproof , twothirds majority of 300 in parliament , known as the rada his supporters argued that the constitution specified only three circumstances when a president could disband parliament , none of which applied monday the constitutional court posted a statement on its web site saying it would decide within 15 days whether to hear an appeal by parliament that it rule on the constitutionality of mr yushchenko s decree dissolving it taras kuzio , a political science professor at george washington university and a ukraine specialist , said mr yushchenko controlled the variables that mattered in ukraine s young political system the army , the security service and popular support in the capital , kiev i do n't think there is stomach for a fight with the president , mr kuzio said of mr yanukovich and his supporters in a telephone interview from kiev the president holds more cards
thousands of iraqis , many hunted as traitors because they assisted america s war effort , are finding the bridge to safety blocked their admission to the united states as refugees is being delayed by a tortuous application process and lumbering bureaucratic reviews this latest failure was detailed in a cable sent to the state department earlier this month by america s ambassador in baghdad , ryan crocker , and first published monday in the washington post \( mr crocker did not mention the problem in his happytalk presentations on capitol hill last week \) and it is only part of a much larger refugee crisis that is already threatening to spread iraq s chaos throughout the region and one the bush administration refuses to accept as its responsibility washington has insisted that candidates for refugee status must first be vetted by the united nations , which has already identified nearly 10 , 000 iraqis as desperately in need of resettlement in the united states in february , american officials promised to process 7 , 000 refugees by sept 30 , later downgrading that goal to 2 , 000 and as with every other pledge on security and political progress in iraq , american officials have failed spectacularly to achieve even that lower target so far , only 900 refugees have made it to the united states this year even for those iraqis lucky enough to be tapped by the united nations , the process of applying for refugee status is expensive , risky and has no guarantee of success in an irony obvious to all but the bush administration , it has decided that it is too dangerous for department of homeland security officials to conduct refugee interviews inside iraq that means that iraqis who are already in grave danger must make their own way to neighboring jordan to apply for refugee status at the american embassy and the frustrations do not end there the department of homeland security has too few officials stationed in amman to conduct the required interviews , leading to further delays then the bureaucracy really kicks in as the departments of state and homeland security review the applications to ensure the claims are valid and that none of those seeking entry pose a security risk all told , mr crocker estimated that iraqis must wait 8 to 10 months from the time they are referred to american authorities before they can hope to arrive in the united states he warned that those delays are only likely to get worse to unclog choke points , mr crocker suggested that state department officers stationed in iraq be allowed to conduct refugee interviews at least for those iraqis who work for the embassy and he called for a significant speeding up of the security review process for all applicants instead of endorsing mr crocker s sensible recommendations , administration officials disputed his criticism this system needs to be fixed , and it needs to be fixed fast secretary of state condoleezza rice can start by giving a senior member of her staff responsibility for breaking the bureaucratic logjam ms rice must also press her colleagues at the department of homeland security to do the same welcoming iraqis into the united states as refugees is not costfree it draws skilled people out of a country that desperately needs their talents and makes it increasingly likely that they will never return home washington , however , has a profound moral obligation , especially to those iraqis who have risked their lives on america s behalf if america abandons them now , it will mean even more suffering and more shame for the united states from this shameful and disastrous war
ibi na , baseball and brazil \? that combination is evoked about as often as the yankees and the samba but , yes , brazil does have a national amateur team , and at its training center here , the squad has been preparing for months for the pan american games , which open july 13 in rio de janeiro the team s hope is that a strong performance in the competition , a sort of olympics of the americas , can help put baseball on the map in a country where the most popular sports are soccer , soccer and more soccer this is a rare opportunity for us and our sport , and we want to make sure we take as much advantage of it as we possibly can , said infielder ronaldo ono , 33 , the team captain it s a great responsibility playing at home , and that s what motivates us we want to win and attract brazil s attention , and we think we can we respect the other teams , but we fear none though virtually ignored in the news media here , the brazilian team has shown improvement in recent years after failing to qualify for the 1995 games , it finished eighth in 1999 and fifth in 2003 , and in other recent tournaments has presented surprisingly strong challenges to cuba , losing once by one run , and to puerto rico , losing a game in the 18th inning but winning even a bronze medal in rio is not going to be easy in the first round , brazil is in the same group as the united states , the dominican republic and nicaragua , and will also have the disadvantage of playing before hometown spectators with little knowledge of or interest in the game brazilians like rooting for their fellow countrymen , so once we get a brazilian playing in major league baseball , that will help popularize the sport , said everaldo marques , one of the broadcasters for the brazilian feed of espn s sunday night game of the week just look what happened with tennis when gustavo kuerten was doing well , or with the nba when brazilian players like anderson varej o , nen hil rio and leandro barbosa showed up marques added that some brazilians found baseball hard to understand at first glance because of things like stolen bases and the double play , while others considered it long and slow compared to soccer if brazil s team gets to the semifinals of the pan american games and is in the running for a medal , people will watch , he said , but otherwise there will be more of a focus on sports like gymnastics , swimming and volleyball baseball came here , in contrast to other latin american countries , not from the united states but from japan brazil has the largest population of japanese descent of any country outside japan , about two million people , and baseball has traditionally been played primarily , if not exclusively , in the three states where the bulk of the japanese community has settled as a result , 16 of the 20 players on the team that will compete in rio de janeiro are of japanese ancestry but even those with no japanese blood have learned the game with the names used in japanese for positions and plays , and whenever manager mitsuyoshi sato talks to the team , his players address him as sensei and bow respectfully when he finishes his remarks brazilian baseball confederation officials say one of their main goals is to make the game popular or at least known among other brazilians as a result , programs to encourage youngsters to play baseball have been organized in recent years on the hardscrabble outskirts of some major cities , and new leagues and tournaments have begun that effort has already yielded a promising player who will be competing in rio gilmar pereira is a strapping 19yearold righthanded pitcher with a 95mileanhour fastball who was recruited from a poor neighborhood eight years ago , sent to japan at 14 for three years of nurturing , and is now a phillies farmhand my dad thought at first that this was a sport with no future , but thanks to baseball , i 've received a good education and gotten to know other cultures , pereira said i do n't know where i 'd be today without baseball , because there is a lot of crime and drugs in my old neighborhood , and baseball has calmed me down and given me a focus in life to improve brazil s level of play , the confederation has also been hiring cuban coaches the imports include ernesto n ris chac n and juan y ez , pitchers who were in the rotation of the havana industriales with orlando hern ndez before he left for the united states and stardom with the yankees and the mets the cubans say they are optimistic about the brazilian squad , if not immediately , at least in the near future they describe brazilian players as showing a rare mixture of japanese discipline and dedication , and latin american passion and flair there is an awful lot of talent here , y ez , the pitching coach for the national junior team , said it just needs to be polished major league and japanese scouts appear to agree any time we have a tournament here , scouts from at least a halfdozen teams will be in the stands , which was not the case five years ago , said ol vio sawasato , vice president of the brazilian confederation the brazilian team is fortunate to train here at a modern facility , an hour s drive west of s o paulo , that is reminiscent of an american spring training complex and was built by the same japanese dairy products company that owns the tokyo yakult swallows of japan s central league though no formal agreement exists between brazil and the swallows , daniel yuichi matsumoto , a 26yearold lefthandedhitting first baseman and outfielder now playing for the swallows , was scouted and signed here no brazilian player has yet reached the major leagues but sawasato said more than 30 were playing at various levels in japan or taiwan and nearly a dozen had signed with major league teams , including two outfielders who are in the chicago white sox system but have been given permission to play in the pan american games anderson gomes dos santos and paulo roberto orlando but the brazilian team will be without its best pitcher , the 36yearold lefthander jo matumoto , who was most valuable player of the 2005 south american championship over the winter , he signed with the toronto blue jays and pitched for them in spring training before being sent down to class aa new hampshire , where he has a 344 earned run average for the players who remain here , or who return from careers abroad , playing the game is a labor of love , with no hope of making a living from competition outfielder celso takashi nakano , for example , is an ophthalmologist , while ono , the infielder , works for a business that sells bidets and orthodontic equipment we 're playing for honor , for the name on our shirt , said marcelo arai , a starting pitcher and veterinary student , pointing to brazil on the front of his jersey we 're not playing for money or fame , because the truth is that we often pay out of our own pockets to be able to play at the start of a saturday morning training session in late june , sato , 60 , tried to build up his players' morale he told them to maintain their fighting spirit and not to be impressed by the renown of the teams from the united states and other countries with long baseball traditions the important thing is what happens on the field , and to me , until the game has started , nobody has won or lost , he said so let s stay united if you can work together , we can win it all the game is decided on the field , not by reputation or the statistic sheet the starting catcher rafael motooka de oliveira , 25 , certainly has the attitude his manager is seeking after seven years in the cincinnati reds' organization , he is now a free agent along with his dream of playing well enough in rio to attract the attention of a scout who will sign him , he believes that the brazilian team can thrive and surprise i do n't know the other teams , but it s not a long season , he said it s only three games in the first round , which is like a lottery we 're going to be playing a short series in our own country , so i think we have a chance to win a medal , which is what we have to do if we want baseball to get in the media because of soccer , people here want winners all the time
phuket , , sept 17 \( ap \) the authorities on monday found the two flight data recorders from a plane that had crashed sunday on thailand s resort island of phuket , while an airline official said wind shear may have doomed the flight the death toll was put at 89 people , most of them foreigners the plane , which belonged to the budget airline onetwogo airlines , was carrying 123 passengers and 7 crew members to phuket from bangkok when it skidded off a runway while landing in driving wind and rain it caught fire and engulfed some passengers in flames others kicked out windows to escape sansern wongchaum , the deputy transportation minister , said monday that 89 people , including 53 foreigners , were killed in the crash , and that the 41 survivors were injured the crash was thailand s worst air accident in a decade kajit habnanonda , president of orientthai airlines , which owns onetwogo , said wind shear the rapid change in wind speed that can disrupt takeoffs and landings was a possible cause of the accident heavy rains could have contributed to the plane s skidding off the runway , mr kajit added an unofficial list compiled by the thai foreign ministry showed that those who died in the crash included six britons , three israelis , two americans , two french and one victim each from australia , germany , iran , ireland and sweden more than 30 of the foreigners who died had not yet been identified the plane s pilot , who was indonesian , and copilot , who was thai , were killed in the crash parts of the twisted plane lay smoking at the side of the runway on monday while officials wearing masks carried bodies wrapped in white sheets to an airport storage building transportation minister thira haocharoen said the plane s black boxes would be sent to the united states for analysis many of the passengers had been planning to spend vacations at phuket , a popular beach resort that was among the areas hit hardest by the 2004 indian ocean tsunami , which killed more than 8 , 000 people on the island the accident was likely to raise new questions about the safety of lowfare airlines in southeast asia , which have experienced rapid growth in recent years and often scramble to find qualified pilots none of thailand s budget airlines had previously suffered a major accident , but there have been several deadly crashes in indonesia many lowfare airlines use planes already used for years by other airlines according to thai and american aviation registration data , the plane that crashed in phuket was manufactured and put into use in 1983 , and began flying in thailand in march
is a buy local economy really sustainable \? that s the first question explored by the greenwash brigade , a small group of volunteer bloggers working in environmental fields who have begun posting for american public media , the publicradio purveyor best known for its marketplace program the company received some grants over the last couple of years to do what business journalists rarely get to do devote sustained attention to the idea of sustainable commerce making a living without trashing the planet this weekend , it is wrapping up a radio series called consumed , questioning the longterm viability of an economy built on buying \( and buying , and buying more a reader , a3k , smartly pointed out that all economies are built on buying \) the web team will be critiquing products , services , government initiatives and other activities that are pitched as good for the environment not surprisingly , the inaugural post , on limiting one s environmental footprint by buying locally , didn t come with a single easy answer buying locally works where it can , but it won t make regions that are already straining with growing populations and limited resources somehow more viable , said the blogger , janne k flisrand , who works for minnesota green communities , a program promoting affordable housing that minimizes environmental impacts there s no silver bullet to sustainable living , but rather a toolbox to pick and choose from , ms flisrand wrote sustainable consumerism is intentional consumerism buying local is one of those tools , one with many benefits , but it will never be the whole solution organic , fair trade and manufacturing practices \( like avoiding discharge of hazardous waste \) are also key none of those is inherent in buying local she mentioned the southwest as a place with fundamental limits that are already overtaxed they aren t out of the game , she wrote guides like local first arizona list local businesses and services , and craigslist , the parent of all reuse sites , is active practically everywhere but they ll never be selfsufficient with their current populations are there other efforts like the greenwash brigade out there \? i plan to gather a set of such resources over by my blogroll pass them along in a comment or to dotearth nytimescom
washington , jan 13 on friday morning , as the capital was enmeshed in a debate over president bush s decision to send thousands more troops to , no one was more obviously searching for an alternate plan than senator , the new york democrat and likely candidate for president mrs clinton was airborne for iraq , a visit that offered a platform to examine and perhaps alter her views on a war that she once voted to authorize but now criticizes asked in a telephone interview from kuwait whether this trip might lead her to support setting a firm deadline for the withdrawal of all american troops , which would be a change in her position , she responded those are questions that we 'll be better able to answer later obviously i 'll have more to say when i get back around the same time in washington , senator , the arizona republican and likely candidate for president , threw the white house something of a lifeline during a congressional hearing \( which mrs clinton herself was supposed to attend \) , vigorously defending mr bush s decision potentially catastrophic consequences of failure demand that we do all we can to prevail in iraq , mr mccain said as the politics of the war continue to shift , no prospective presidential candidates face more intensive scrutiny of their views or greater risk to their ambitions than mr mccain and mrs clinton long a proponent of sending more american forces into the fight , mr mccain now more than ever is linked to a war that has splintered his party and lost public support viewed with suspicion by elements of her party because she has not explicitly repudiated her october 2002 vote authorizing military action against iraq , mrs clinton , who was in baghdad on saturday , has been trying to shore up her credentials as a critic of the war without exposing herself to charges of indecisiveness or flipflopping of the sort that so damaged senator john kerry in his unsuccessful race against mr bush in 2004 more than any other single event in recent months , mr bush s call for more troops has not only illuminated the positions taken by mr mccain and mrs clinton and the differences between them , but it has also led the field of declared and prospective candidates circling them within their own parties to stake out more clearly defined positions on the war among republicans , a result has been a deep split suggesting that mr mccain will face challenges on the war from fellow republicans long before he has to worry about mrs clinton and other democrats mitt romney , the former governor of massachusetts who had until this week declined to say whether he supported more troops , issued brief remarks supporting the president rudolph w giuliani , the former new york mayor , also supported it , comparing it to what he did in fighting crime as mayor but senator sam brownback of kansas , who is positioning himself as an alternative to mr mccain among conservatives , denounced mr bush s plan , as did senator chuck hagel of nebraska , who like mr mccain is a vietnam veteran but who long ago broke with the white house over its handling of the war among democrats , opposition to mr bush s plan highlighted the political threat mrs clinton faces from the left john edwards , the former senator from north carolina who voted for the war in 2002 but who , unlike mrs clinton , later renounced his vote , sent an email message to his supporters urging them to oppose mr bush s action of illinois , who joined the senate in 2005 and thus escaped the iraq vote that has come to haunt mrs clinton , mr edwards and mr kerry , used the platform of senate hearings to lacerate the bush iraq policy and affirm his own opposition to the war their actions offered an obvious contrast with those of mrs clinton , who put out a measured statement opposing the troop increase but has stayed away from the senate vanguard opposing mr bush s latest strategy still , none of the other potential 2008 presidential candidates have seen their ambitions complicated by the events this week as much as mr mccain and mrs clinton have their responses to mr bush s actions offered insights into their views on iraq and the styles they would bring to a presidential campaign mr mccain embarked on a highprofile television tour announcing his support for mr bush s move in an interview , he said he would have preferred that the white house send in even more troops , and noted that he had pressed this position on the white house , unsuccessfully until now , for more than two years it is a position that mr mccain and his advisers and some other republicans said could end up destroying his presidential ambitions friends , advisers , enemies said this could be very damaging , mr mccain said i ca n't worry about that , and i'm not going to worry about that some republicans suggested that mr mccain s position could help him , albeit to a limited extent , among conservative republican primary voters who have been wary of his view on social issues and , as mr mccain s own remarks suggested , his stance fits neatly into his effort over the years to present himself as a politician given to candor even if it means telling voters things they do not want to hear still , by any measure , support for the war could make things extremely difficult for mr mccain in a general election if the situation in iraq does not improve and public opinion in the united states does not shift in favor of continued engagement mr mccain did not dispute the political risks entailed in the stance he had taken the consequences of failure are more important than a political career , he said it could hurt me in a primary and it could hurt me in a general election this could hurt me in history he said he was hopeful that this new iraq strategy would work but did not know how long it would take , a crucial question in trying to gauge how central an issue this will be as the campaign engages in a hint of what next year could be like , mr edwards has taken to calling the bush proposal an endorsement of the mccain doctrine , a description that mr mccain and his aides have gamely embraced i was glad to see that romney and giuliani have come around to embracing the mccain doctrine , as john edwards would say , said terry nelson , the head of mr mccain s presidential exploratory committee if mr mccain has flaunted his unpopular position , mrs clinton has clearly kept a lower altitude as she tries to deal with a barrage of conflicting pressures unlike mr mccain and mr obama , who were everywhere on television the night of mr bush s speech , mrs clinton simply issued a lateevening email statement saying that based on what mr bush had said , she did not support the increase last year , mrs clinton took a leading role in criticizing donald h rumsfeld , then the secretary of defense , over his management of the war over the past two years , she has voted in favor of resolutions calling for a phased withdrawal of troops without setting fixed deadlines even though mrs clinton has never gone as far as mr edwards and mr kerry with a renunciation of her 2002 vote , she has subtly expanded her position recently in recognition , her advisers said , of how much that vote accounted for the resistance to her among some democrats in a littlenoticed interview on the today show just before christmas , mrs clinton made a significant addition to her standard remark about the 2002 vote asked if she considered the vote a mistake , she responded obviously if we knew then what we know now , there would n't have been a vote , and i certainly would n't have voted that way the last eight words are new for her some democrats suggested that mrs clinton s trip this weekend was intended to give her an opportunity to move further away from that vote and against the president s policy i will be spending time with the iraqi leaders and sitting down and trying to get my own personal assessment of what their intentions are , what do they intend to do to take responsibility for their own security , she said in the interview if they 're not going to step up and try to bring some stability and end the violence in baghdad , i do n't care how many troops the president sends it s not going to be successful mrs clinton and mr mccain have no doubt learned a lesson from mr kerry s problems in 2004 when he appeared to switch his position on the war that inconsistency may well prove to be a bigger political sin than taking a position out of step with the electorate mrs clinton s associates have expressed concern that if she tries to switch her views on the war , reflecting what her advisers said was concern , she would appear weak as she campaigned during a time of war to become the nation s first female president
boston , aug 4 lawyers are asking a judge to increase the amount of the award given to edward greco , the son of one of four men to whom the government has been ordered to pay 1018 million for falsely convicting them of a 1965 gangland murder mr greco s father , louis greco sr , died in prison in 1995 judge nancy gertner of federal district court awarded 28 million last week to the estate of louis greco sr lawyers for edward greco said in a motion filed thursday that the 28 million would most likely be awarded to roberta werner , edward greco s mother and louis greco sr s wife at the time of his conviction the lawyers said ms werner abandoned edward and his brother , louis jr , for las vegas in the late 1960s , when the brothers were teenagers louis greco sr s will stipulated that all but 100 of his estate go to louis jr , who committed suicide in 1997 , said howard friedman , a lawyer for edward greco mr friedman said louis greco jr was to receive most of his father s estate because he had unspecified mental problems and could not care for himself or work because louis greco jr died without a will , however , the 28 million will probably be given to ms werner , his closest relative , lawyers said edward greco , 50 , louis greco jr and the other eight children of the wrongfully convicted men were each awarded 250 , 000 edward greco has lung cancer and is living in a new orleans nursing home lawyers say he should be given more of the award because his life was destroyed after his father was wrongfully convicted edward greco has testified at trial that ms werner became despondent , drank heavily and stopped taking care of her home and children shortly after her thenhusband was convicted lawyers said edward greco often wore dirty clothes and was forced to eat the remainders of other children s school lunches it all fell on eddie , said one of his lawyers , michael rachlis ms werner said at trial that she had become depressed and had thought her sons would fare better living with their aunt and uncle after ms werner left the boston area for las vegas , the aunt and uncle cared for the brothers the aunt died a few years later edward greco began using drugs soon after that and spent time in a rhode island prison on a drug conviction , his lawyers said the other families were able to still have a cohesive family unit , which included the imprisoned father eddie had none of that , mr rachlis said he lost both parents and ultimately the only other person who was forced to take care of him that s overwhelming the lawyers said that as an adult , edward greco moved to new orleans and worked for a number of years , but that he started using drugs again and did not work after the deaths of his father and brother his life has been a constant struggle , mr rachlis said it s so far removed from the lives of the other children the lawyers for edward greco said he and ms werner were in contact with each other , but ms werner and her lawyer did not return phone calls ms werner told the boston globe this week that edward greco had had a very hard life no matter what happens , i'm going to take care of my son , ms werner , who lives in boynton beach , fla , told the newspaper
london perhaps it was a coincidence that robert plant chose a russian tearoom called trojka , which means a threesome or triumvirate , to talk about his new duet album with alison krauss , raising sand or maybe it was a subliminal reminder that the album is really a threeway collaboration by an improbable alliance mr plant , who will be forever known as the lead singer of led zeppelin ms krauss , whose clear voice and deft fiddle style hail from appalachia and the producer and guitarist , the texan who is best known for concocting haunted , pensively anachronistic americana they represent three different musical spheres mr plant s worldly hard rock , ms krauss s limpid update of rural traditions and mr burnett s rangy texas twang raising sand \( rounder \) , all three say , is like nothing any of them could have made on their own but mr burnett saw a link between the singers they 're two very mystical voices , and the blend of them is mystical , he said in a telephone interview from his home and studio in los angeles they both sound like they 're singing from some other time alison sounds like she just stepped out of the black forest , and robert sounds like ozymandias , the egyptian pharaoh with mr burnett leading a malleable studio band , mr plant and ms krauss share old and recent songs , drawing on gene clark , the everly brothers , townes van zandt , allen toussaint , mel tillis and tom waits it s a collection of , mostly , sad songs tales of love betrayed floating in their own limbo together the collaborators triangulate a terra incognita somewhere between swamp and mountain , memories and eternity mr plant happily called it the most amazing collision of styles sipping a latte and wearing a washedout brown tshirt that revealed robust biceps , mr plant was far more eager to talk about raising sand than about the impending led zeppelin reunion that concert is scheduled for nov 26 at the o2 arena in london as a benefit for a educational charity supported by ahmet ertegun , the chairman of atlantic records until his death last year it s a onenight stand , mr plant said i'm taking emotional condoms then he changed the subject raising sand started as mr plant s project , the latest swerve in a long postzeppelin career that has delved into the wideopenspaces rock of mr plant s 1983 hits big log and in the mood the reimagined vintage rb of the honeydrippers and the rhythms and modalities of mali and echoes of psychedelia in his current band , strange sensation i think that robert has always done exactly what he wants , and i mean that in a beautiful way , ms krauss said by telephone from her home in nashville mr plant has been a longtime fan of ms krauss and her string band union station , which uses traditional instruments for music that s steeped in oldtimey and bluegrass styles but not bound by them when the rock and roll hall of fame and museum in cleveland asked mr plant to perform at a 2004 tribute to the bluesman lead belly , he invited ms krauss to sing with him the collaboration went so well that they began to consider recording together alison and i started talking about material , mr plant said we come from such different worlds that we only knew the top of each other s world , the cream , the stuff that comes to the surface we did n't really know too much about the infinite myriad of influences underneath and so it was an absolute coup that t bone came on the scene ms krauss , 36 , had already worked with mr burnett on albums including the multimillionselling , neoappalachian soundtrack album for o brother , where art thou \? mr plant and mr burnett , who were both born in 1948 , are connoisseurs of older american music who share a taste for the deepest blues mr plant came to realize , however , that he had long focused on africanamerican music , while he had virtually ignored the other side of the racial divide , ms krauss s stomping ground and part of mr burnett s downhome foundations i thought i was pretty knowledgeable about american music , but i 'd missed out on an entire area , mr plant said i now know that american music is a total panorama i was cutting it off and thinking it was redneck hell down there but it s not mr plant has spent decades as a lead singer , wailing across arenas as led zeppelin s goldenhaired belter and , since then , improvising at whim as the front man for his own bands for raising sand he would have to harmonize as well i was quite nervous about the idea of finding out just how much of a onetrick pony i am , he said i 've always been a lead singer that s the gig , you know especially an english one you translate usually black music , american music , in a particular fashion which is very english but melody , and the structure of melody , i can be quite loose with harmony singing is ms krauss s element it s at the core of bluegrass and the vocal blend she shares in union station her stretch for the album , she said , was riding the rhythm it was really an earopening experience , she said it s just a different thing , singing with drums you have to find a different place to sit mr plant said , i wanted her to slur more , to become more sassy she used to say to me , but , robert , i'm too white' i said no , you 're not white you 've only been given that shell but inside it you 've got everything' and she certainly does as they planned the album , the three principals traded lists of potential songs robert called up and said send fivesix songs over , and i played him a couple , mr burnett said he said , that s a nice little ditty , but alison wants to do something dark' and that was the starting point although none of the material on the album is new , mr burnett insists there s no nostalgia i think this album is looking into the skull of the present , he said it represents all of the danger and the darkness and the outsiderness and the bleakness that seemed appropriate to this time mr plant brought his own countryish goodbye song , please read the letter , and rocktinged oldies like fortune teller , which was written by the new orleans songwriter allen toussaint \( under the pseudonym naomi neville \) , and gone gone gone , a threat and kissoff by the everly brothers when she saw one group of potential songs , ms krauss recalled , she said she felt i ca n't do that she called mr burnett , who she said told her , you 've called me and said you 're afraid robert has said sort of the same thing and it s exactly what i wanted to happen the core of the band consisted of mr burnett s regular studio musicians , who know their way around all kinds of roots music despite mr plant s years of savoring american music raising sand is the first full album he has made with an american band the arrangements use silences and echoes with strategic grace another factor , mr burnett revealed , is the underlying rhythm the songs often seem to hover because the beat is understated , elastic or only implied we 've been getting completely away from the notion of beats and more into the notion of rumble or waves , mr burnett said mr plant sings with barely a hint of arena bluster his voice is aching and androgynous townes van zandt s nothin' , one of the most desolate songs ever written , has distorted guitar chords and ms krauss s biting celtic fiddle looming up suddenly out of quiet dobro picking in polly come home , gene clark s testament of utter loneliness , ms krauss sings disembodied layers of harmony that drift around him like ghosts ms krauss sings all alone on trampled rose , a parable of spurned love by tom waits and kathleen brennan and she sings lead in through the morning , through the night , a waltz about murderous jealousy written by clark hearing a woman rather than a man sing , to know that another man s holding you tight hurts me little darling gives the song a bisexual twist , although ms krauss was taken aback by the thought it s just leaving the song as it was written , she said it was n't about anything other than the integrity of the song unlike led zeppelin , mr plant , ms krauss , mr burnett and the band are likely to tour together i think the music will change a bit , mr plant said there s lots and lots and lots of opportunities to do different things within this little format a mischievous grin crossed his face god only knows how it will affect her audience and my audience they 'll go , hell , what s going on \?

bangor , me tonya henderson will have to be more careful where she lights up her marlboros bangor is banning in cars if children are present , and ms henderson , 24 , is accustomed to having a cigarette when her boyfriend s 7yearold daughter is in the back seat she is just the kind of person city council members had in mind when they passed the ordinance , which has delighted some and angered others and prompted complaints about invasion of privacy and even threats to boycott the city , s secondlargest the ordinance , which takes effect on jan 19 , allows the police to stop cars if an adult is smoking while a child under 18 is a passenger the smoker can be fined 50 i 've heard people say it s the smoke police or the gestapo , said mayor richard d greene , a packaday smoker who says he shields his two children from his cigarette fumes i think it boils down to common sense smoking is not good for you certainly if you have young children who are in the process of developing and growing , it s even worse for them you would n't say , hey , here s a bottle of mercury go bob it around' bangor is believed to be the first city to outlaw smoking in cars with children but arkansas , louisiana and puerto rico recently enacted similar bans , and at least three other states are considering them california , connecticut and maine , where proponents hope the bangor ban will be a catalyst for a state law the laws , experts say , are part of a new frontier of cigarette regulation moving beyond smoking bans in public settings like restaurants to crackdowns in private spheres like cars and , in some cases , homes at least seven states , including several with large numbers of smokers like texas , oklahoma and alaska , prohibit or sharply restrict smoking around foster children in homes , cars or both some require homes or cars to be smokefree for 12 hours before a foster child enters judges determining parental custody and visitation have , in more than a dozen states , ordered a parent not to smoke around a child an ohio court last year gave custody of a 6yearold boy to his father solely because the boy s mother and her fianc smoked tenants in apartments have won several recent efforts to get smokefree buildings or areas , or curtail secondhand smoke from neighboring apartments in august , after requests from residents in michigan , first centrum communities , which has housing complexes for the elderly in six states , made all its buildings smokefree a recent ruling in a new york case said landlords who allow tenants to be exposed to secondhand smoke could be violating obligations to make apartments habitable i think because we have so affirmatively dealt with public places being smokefree , it has simply made people think about places that are less public , said kathleen dachille , director of center for tobacco regulation at the university of maryland if a worker in a bar is entitled to protection from secondhand smoke , how can we ignore what is happening to children \? gary nolan , a spokesman for the prosmoker s group , the smoker s club , said such bans and court decisions were based on junk science at some point these busybodies have to stop , mr nolan said if we can give our rights up to personal property , the nose of the camel is in the tent and there s no telling how far we can go i'm telling you the highfat craze is next with most of the wave of smoking bans being so new , early enforcement has generally involved warnings , a tactic bangor will start with , along with a radio campaign proponents hope the mere existence of such laws causes people to curb smoking the efforts have gained steam from a 2006 surgeon general s report that strongly indicted secondhand smoke , especially for harming children while the antismoking movement is clearly supportive , many privatesphere efforts have come from individuals in connecticut , a ban on smoking in cars just introduced in the legislature was the brainchild of justin kvadas of east hartford , who was 9 and riding home from his tae kwon do class last year when the idea struck him it came to me , if you ca n't drink or talk on the cellphone while driving , how come you can still smoke \? said justin , now 10 , whose father stopped smoking when he was born his mother helped him email his state representative , henry genga , and he collected 200 petition signatures , including from classmates and east hartford s mayor it s bad if a baby gets dropped off at a day care and smells like cigarettes it s also bad for their lungs because their lungs are so small in arkansas , a seemingly unlikely place for a ban given its high smoking rate , the law passed overwhelmingly after being introduced by representative bob mathis , who said , some people did n't vote because they thought mathis was pulling a joke the law , which concerns children under 6 , levies a 25 fine that can be waived if the smoker enrolls in cessation classes if parents are smoking in the car , you know darn well they 're probably smoking in the house , and this law might be the only opportunity for that little child to have a breath of fresh air , said mr mathis , who quit smoking two years ago in bangor , a city of 33 , 000 in the heart of rural maine , the ban , proposed by a pediatric dentist and passed by a 6to3 vote , has ignited a flurry of reaction , not necessarily along predictable lines at least two council members who supported it smoke , including patricia blanchette , who strengthened the original proposal , which would have prevented police officers from stopping cars solely for the smoking violation i am tired as a taxpayer of paying for people to take their children to the emergency room because they 've had an attack , said ms blanchette , who believes her smoking caused her son s why are we taking these very , very fragile little bodies , putting them in a confined area and allowing people to blow smoke into their lungs \? another council member , susan hawes , a nonsmoker who is a medical assistant , opposed it we have so many people telling us what we can and cannot do in our own lives , ms hawes said are we going to come back and say , if you do n't get your child out there once a week to exercise ' among residents , denise savoy , a nonsmoker whose father smoked five packs a day and died of at age 78 , opposes the ban , unconvinced of the health risks doctors are trying to say all these kids have asthma , ear infections , ms savoy said you know what i had one ear infection in my life my kids spent a lot of time around my dad , and my oldest two children had lots of ear infections and tubes in their ears , but my youngest two had none of it my father was fine until about the last year and half of his life she also worries that smokers might have withdrawal symptoms while driving and cause accidents her oldest son , chris goldsmith , 22 , said , probably health would go down even more if you ban it in cars because you 're going to have a lot more people smoking in the house and , you 've got a lot of smokers in the us and this is going to keep them from coming here some nonsmokers , too , perhaps i 'll just do my business elsewhere , said steward atwood of machias , who quit smoking 10 years ago and regularly shops in bangor it s a right being taken away from people still , the ban , which was endorsed by the bangor chamber of commerce , was welcomed by many , who believe that any boycott of bangor will be minimal mary gilmartin said it would help her protect her 9yearold asthmatic grandson from friends and relatives who just light up and they do n't ask lana fields , 20 , who smokes , but not in the car with her 1yearold , called it a good law and ms henderson , who has smoked since age 7 but believes cigarettes aggravate her and , had a foot in both camps hate it , ms henderson said about the law but it s good for the kids
tokyo never tightlipped about his recurring battle with cancer , he still surprised many japanese by admitting that he was an alcoholic and checking himself into rehab over the summer family problems , he explained the inevitable strain of a quartercentury marriage , a cousin s cryptic comments , existential questions about the nature of family and life itself , all of this , he said openly , had contributed to his heavierthanusual drinking the family in question is none other than s imperial family , and the recovering patient is prince tomohito of mikasa , a first cousin of emperor akihito the family s other members are only seen , if they are seen at all , waving at some official event but this prince has never shied away from offering his personal opinions on everything from preserving the throne s unbroken male line even , he wrote mischievously two years ago , by reviving the concubine system to the private burdens of royalty it s not only the past one or two years , the prince said of the stress behind his alcoholism as long as i can remember , the imperial family s been like one big ball of stress on a recent afternoon , prince tomohito , 61 , known as the bearded prince for his goatee and mustache , appeared in good spirits at his residence in the akasaka estate , the sprawling walledoff , wooded grounds in central tokyo that is home to most of the imperial family s 23 members a beige jacket hung loosely on the prince , still well underweight because of his various illnesses he wore dark blue slippers that appeared to be the only concession to japanese custom in a westernstyle reception room dominated by a grand piano and chandeliers having studied for two years at oxford , he sometimes sprinkled his japanese with english words the prince has been in and out of the hospital since he was found to have throat cancer some 16 years ago , and last year he underwent his eighth operation for cancer in a society where people remain reluctant to disclose their illnesses , the prince said he saw no meaning in hiding his cancer and even wrote a book about it our family s dna is highly susceptible to cancer , the prince said in two generations , six of us have already been afflicted with it so i had always wondered when my turn would come still , the prince attributed his recurring cancer to stress , the same kind of stress that , he has said publicly , first led to his overdrinking in his 30s and aggravated it in the last couple of years the prince , who has two daughters with his wife , princess nobuko , cited difficulties at home things became messed up inside our home , he said , adding , when you 've been together for 26 years , well , you know problems in the extended family also affected him deeply there are all sorts of problems now inside the imperial family , he said for example , i threw myself into the whirl surrounding the crown prince s comments about personality denial the prince was referring to an extraordinarily emotional news conference given three years ago by crown prince naruhito about his wife , princess masako , the harvardeducated former diplomat who has long suffered from depression and rarely appears in public it is believed that her illness stems from the intense pressure she felt to bear a male heir to the throne pressure that was relieved last year with the birth of a son to the crown prince s younger brother and his wife there has been a move to deny masako s career and personality , the crown prince said , in comments that seemed to put an individual s happiness on par with , if not above , the imperial family itself , comments that were endlessly scrutinized for their exact meaning and intended audience prince tomohito said he wrote the crown prince a long letter asking for further explanation if he had responded , prince tomohito said , i think we could have made some progress but there was only a reply thanking me for my invaluable opinion prince tomohito was born four days after the emperor hirohito renounced his divinity on new year s day in 1946 a year later , the imperial household law of 1947 , imposed during the american occupation , abolished 11 other branches of the imperial family , thereby shrinking the pool of male heirs to the chrysanthemum throne the prince describes growing up in a simpler age , riding tokyo s yamanote line by himself to the peers school , before bodyguards were assigned to all royals compared with the other royals , the prince said with a smile , he was a delinquent youth who got into skirmishes with students at a nearby school run by north koreans we used to fight with them a lot , he said whenever they 'd spot the peers school uniforms , they 'd come at us after college the prince took up the kind of active life unknown to this imperial family he focused his considerable energies on helping the disabled he led efforts to build facilities for the disabled and even taught some of them to ski like many a postwar japanese salaryman , the prince found meaning in work i was a workaholic , he said perhaps there were nagging doubts , too in 1982 the prince , then 36 , grabbed headlines when he said he wanted to secede from the imperial family , citing his desire to devote himself to his work the prince declined to say what lay behind his 1982 wish , perhaps because the passage of a quarter of a century had quelled whatever doubts there were if you ask me what the imperial family is all about , and i think and think and think about it , the very final conclusion is that our meaning lies in our simply existing , the prince said , holding a cigarette holder in his left hand , the first of three cigarettes he would smoke in a 100minute interview the royals , he said , could fulfill their duties simply by waking up in the morning , eating breakfast , eating lunch , eating dinner , then going to sleep , repeating that 365 days a year according to japanese myth , the first emperor , jimmu , a descendant of the sun goddess amaterasu , began his reign 2 , 667 years ago , though historians trace the start of japan s imperial system to the fourth or fifth century emperors are said to be descended in an unbroken patrilineal line , with each generation passing on the male y chromosome to the next the y chromosome resides in my body , the prince said it is the same thing that resided in emperor jimmu it s extremely spiritual that is why the unbroken male line must be preserved at all cost , he said the other imperial branches , abolished during the american occupation , could be restored or adoptions permitted from within those families and concubines \? that is a joke , the prince said , in english , with a twinkle in his eyes would the bearded prince choose to return , in another life , as a royal \? after a fivesecond silence the prince said with a laugh , i 've had enough i 've really done all i wanted in 61 years i 've broken old conventions he then referred to a popular belief in japan i'm blood type b , so i like to try new things the prince then refined his answer , saying that both imperial life and the commoner s life no doubt had their advantages and disadvantages so when you think about who is happier , whether it s the imperial family or the people , the prince said , there is no answer , none
steilacoom , wash two weeks ago , president bush called for a longterm plan to increase the size of the armed forces as our leaders consider various options for carrying out mr bush s vision , one issue likely to generate fierce debate is do n't ask , do n't tell , the policy that bars openly gay service members from the military indeed , leaders in the new congress are planning to reintroduce a bill to repeal the policy next year as was the case in 1993 the last time the american people thoroughly debated the question of whether openly gay men and lesbians should serve in the military the issue will give rise to passionate feelings on both sides the debate must be conducted with sensitivity , but it must also consider the evidence that has emerged over the last 14 years when i was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , i supported the current policy because i believed that implementing a change in the rules at that time would have been too burdensome for our troops and commanders i still believe that to have been true the concern among many in the military was that given the longstanding view that homosexuality was incompatible with service , letting people who were openly gay serve would lower morale , harm recruitment and undermine unit cohesion in the early 1990s , large numbers of military personnel were opposed to letting openly gay men and lesbians serve president bill clinton , who promised to lift the ban during his campaign , was overwhelmed by the strength of the opposition , which threatened to overturn any executive action he might take the compromise that came to be known as do n't ask , do n't tell was thus a useful speed bump that allowed temperatures to cool for a period of time while the culture continued to evolve the question before us now is whether enough time has gone by to give this policy serious reconsideration much evidence suggests that it has last year i held a number of meetings with gay soldiers and marines , including some with combat experience in iraq , and an openly gay senior sailor who was serving effectively as a member of a nuclear submarine crew these conversations showed me just how much the military has changed , and that gays and lesbians can be accepted by their peers this perception is supported by a new zogby poll of more than 500 service members returning from afghanistan and iraq , three quarters of whom said they were comfortable interacting with gay people and 24 foreign nations , including israel , britain and other allies in the fight against terrorism , let gays serve openly , with none reporting morale or recruitment problems i now believe that if gay men and lesbians served openly in the united states military , they would not undermine the efficacy of the armed forces our military has been stretched thin by our deployments in the middle east , and we must welcome the service of any american who is willing and able to do the job but if america is ready for a military policy of nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation , the timing of the change should be carefully considered as the 110th congress opens for business , some of its most urgent priorities , like developing a more effective strategy in iraq , share widespread support that spans political affiliations addressing such issues could help heal the divisions that cleave our country fighting early in this congress to lift the ban on openly gay service members is not likely to add to that healing , and it risks alienating people whose support is needed to get this country on the right track by taking a measured , prudent approach to change , political and military leaders can focus on solving the nation s most pressing problems while remaining genuinely open to the eventual and inevitable lifting of the ban when that day comes , gay men and lesbians will no longer have to conceal who they are , and the military will no longer need to sacrifice those whose service it cannot afford to lose
greenburgh , ny , oct 12 reappeared on the ' practice court friday morning , a sight both jarring and seemingly natural he appeared like a man out of time in just about every respect houston is 36 , two years older than he was when he stood on the podium on the same floor and announced his retirement because of chronic knee problems there are flecks of gray in the stubble on his chin , and around his temples the knicks he left in october 2005 bear little resemblance to the knicks he joined for practice but there houston was , running the court with the same awkward gait , flicking jump shots with the same smooth stroke that made him an allstar and joking with teammates as if he had never left it felt great , houston said the first day of houston s curious comeback attempt was simple enough learn plays , meet teammates and try to keep up everything after this point will be more complicated the knicks have 15 players with guaranteed contracts , none of whom coach isiah thomas seems eager to cut or trade houston , who signed a makegood contract on wednesday , has not played a game since jan 19 , 2005 it is not clear whether he is physically capable of resuming his career even houston acknowledged that he had put thomas in a tough spot by requesting the chance to play again but there he was friday , with a new number \( 7 \) on his back and an unfailingly optimistic smile on his face i just feel like it s something that s supposed to be , houston said when he bowed out two years ago , houston said he had exhausted everything in the effort to overcome his knee problems but as he addressed reporters for the first time , i always felt like , man , i do n't know if it s really over or not' working out on his own over the past year , houston became convinced that he could still play , and that his knees could endure over the summer , he got permission from james l dolan , the madison square garden chairman , to use the knicks' facilities and medical staff a lot of it was just the belief that i could do it again , houston said the nets and other teams showed some interest but while houston awaited the birth of his fourth child and missed last week s training camp he decided that he could play only for the knicks he has what amounts to a threeweek tryout before rosters must be trimmed to 15 players if houston fails to make the cut , he said he would probably end his comeback attempt our family has already sacrificed enough for me to even get to this point , houston said my victory is being on this practice court today houston was running gingerly toward the end of practice , but he did make 2 of 3 shots , including a 3pointer , during the 10 minutes when reporters were allowed to watch his knee problems including chronic arthritis were once defined as incurable , but houston said he was now painfree i really believe that a lot of prayer and belief has gotten me to this point , he said people are going to state facts about the condition of your knee but miracles happen every day so there s some things you do n't explain , and i do n't really care thomas was careful not to judge houston s comeback attempt or predict the outcome but he was frank about the circumstances , saying that any other 36yearold with a history of knee problems never would have been invited to camp houston s stature , as the fourthleading scorer in franchise history , got him through the door he s deserving of this chance and this opportunity , and i'm giving it to him , thomas said but that clout will not be enough to win him a roster spot only what you do on the floor gives you clout , thomas said to make room for houston , the knicks would have to waive or trade a player even then , their first preference would probably be to keep demetris nichols , a secondround pick those decisions are still a few weeks away we want to be respectful to him and let him give it a shot , and give him an honest shot , thomas said of houston and if he s capable of contributing , it would be a huge plus for us rebounds eddy curry practiced without contact , shot jumpers and dunked , all without a twinge in his right shoulder i do n't feel any pain , said curry , who injured his labrum in practice last saturday i feel like it never happened curry will be reevaluated on monday and could be cleared for contact if so , he could make his preseason debut wednesday in boston
east rutherford , nj , oct 17 s most impressive moment during the ' victory monday night over the atlanta falcons was one of the following a \) his seventh catch , which allowed him to pass tiki barber for most career receptions as a giant \( 587 \) b \) his 5yard touchdown catch , which tied him with kyle rote for most touchdown receptions as a giant \( 48 \) c \) his 17yard reception to the falcons' 1yard line on which he grazed his toes inbounds with a centimeter to spare d \) none of the above the answer might be d in the second quarter toomer burst off the line of scrimmage and immediately ran into cornerback deangelo hall some receivers would have gotten flustered by the tight coverage not toomer , a black belt in kung fu he repeatedly chopped his arms like an oil rig and brushed past hall and caught a 15yard pass the giants scored on the next play en route to a 3110 victory if somebody s grabbing me , trying to jam me , i can get off pretty quick , toomer said wednesday when asked if his martialarts skills translated to football i can block out everything else and just have one train of thought toomer , a 12year veteran , began learning kung fu a year after being drafted by the giants in 1996 inspired by his father , who won several trophies in karate when toomer was a child , he earned his black belt about four years ago toomer s father was among several people who called on tuesday to congratulate him on breaking the record barber was not among the well wishers , toomer said the accolades seem to be arriving at the right time , even if toomer said he did not think much about the records against the jets the previous week , toomer did not catch a pass for only the third time since 1998 he said he was disappointed about not being a focal point of the offense , but pleased that the giants \( 42 \) won the game it s a tough thing to go through because you work all week and you want to compete in the games , toomer said it s a weird feeling you 're happy and sad at the same time last november , toomer s season ended when he partly tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee this season , toomer has been overshadowed by plaxico burress , who is tied for first in the nfl in touchdown receptions \( eight \) and sixth in receiving yards \( 507 \) toomer has caught 26 passes for 306 yards and a touchdown he finished with 89 yards monday but the 33yearold toomer s role as an elder statesman on the giants has not been eclipsed he routinely helps younger receivers like sinorice moss and anthony mix with routes and he serves as a reliable target for eli manning slowly but surely , he is collecting franchise records it was good to get him in the end zone and get him some catches , manning said that s what we expect from amani and that s what we hope to get him every week if our offense is going to be at our best , he s going to have to be involved and make plays for us coach tom coughlin noted that when toomer , burress and tight end jeremy shokey played well at the same time , as they did against the falcons , the results were harmonious burress seems to handle the vocals , with toomer playing the bass there is n't any doubt of the steady , consistent , reliable play that amani brings to our offense , coughlin said and obviously it showed up the other night in two or three very , very almost cliniclike , if you will plays that he was able to make coughlin did not refer to any specific plays if he were presented with multiple choices and asked to name toomer s top moment , he would probably pick them all
tucson , may 19 under the shade of a mesquite tree here one morning this week , waiting for work that did not come , el as ram rez weighed the hurdles of what could be the biggest overhaul in law in two decades to become full legal residents , under a compromise senate leaders announced thursday , mr ram rez and other illegal immigrants would have to pay a total of 5 , 000 in fines , more than 14 times the typical weekly earnings on the streets here , return to their home countries at least once , and wait as long as eight years during the wait , they would have limited possibilities to bring other family members well , it sounds difficult , but not impossible , said mr ram rez , 24 , a native of chiapas , mexico , who has been here a year i would like to be here legally in the future , so these things are what i might have to do another man among the group gathered outside a church here that serves as a hiring site for day laborers overheard mr ram rez and approached with disdain it s almost impossible to bring your family , he said , rattling off information he had gleaned from a spanishlanguage newspaper you have to go back first , and what are you going to do in mexico while you are there and there is no work \? i 've been here 20 years and i still work and support my family , so why would i do any of these things \? the compromise bill has offered a glimmer of hope to illegal immigrants here , 60 miles from the border , and elsewhere but they and others , through news reports , advocates and lawyers , are just now learning the fine print advocacy groups here said they would lobby lawmakers to reject the bill , saying it would place onerous restrictions on illegal workers who want to win legal status and also hurt efforts to unify immigrant families this is an unprecedented shift from family unity being the cornerstone of our immigration policy , said isabel garcia , a lawyer and a chairwoman of derechos humanos , an advocacy group here ms garcia also objected to what she called insurmountable obstacles in the bill the compromise senate bill proposes an initiative to give legal status to an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants it also portends a major shift in the priorities and values of american immigration for the future it would gradually change a system based primarily on family ties , in place since 1965 , into one that favors highskilled and highly educated workers who want to become permanent residents in the future , lowskilled workers like the men waiting for work here would largely be channeled to a vast new temporary program , where they would be allowed to work in the united states for three stints of two years each , broken up by oneyear stays in their homeland this is a different architecture , said doris meissner , a senior fellow at the migration policy institute , a nonpartisan research group in washington , and commissioner of the immigration and naturalization service from 1993 to 2000 illegal workers already here would gain a provisional legal status , known as a z visa , fairly quickly but to become permanent residents they would have to pay the big fines and get in an eightyear line behind others who have already applied legally for green cards , as permanent resident visas are known still , despite the outcry from immigrant advocates , a reading of the details of the legislation suggests important benefits for relatives of legal immigrants and naturalized american citizens who have been waiting for green cards for as long as 22 years in some cases a first step is to eliminate , within eight years , the backlog of 4 million people who have applied to come legally to the united states , allotting 440 , 000 visas a year for that purpose , according to summaries provided by the department of homeland security and the office of senator edward m kennedy , the massachusetts democrat who was a chief author of the bill we are adding to our familybased system , we are not substituting merit for family , said laura capps , a spokeswoman for mr kennedy after the backlog is cleared , a slowly increasing number of permanent visas would be approved through a merit system , based on points granted for english language proficiency \( an acute hurdle for the men waiting for work here , as none spoke english \) , level of education and job skills , among other factors siblings and adult children of legal immigrants will no longer be able to apply for visas , and visas for parents of united states citizens will be limited to 40 , 000 a year in his weekly radio address on saturday , president bush said that the measure will improve security at our borders it will give employers new tools to verify the employment status of workers and hold businesses to account for those they hire mr bush added , the legislation will clear the backlog of family members who 've applied to come to our country lawfully , and have been waiting patiently in line this legislation will end chain migration by limiting the relatives who can automatically receive green cards to spouses and minor children and this legislation will transform our immigration system so that future immigration decisions are focused on admitting immigrants who have the skills , education , and english proficiency that will help america compete in a global economy the immigration debate has long stirred politics , sometimes dividing members of the same party and forcing lawmakers to reconsider positions this bill is no different last year , as he sought reelection , senator jon kyl of arizona , a republican , was critical of giving illegal immigrants legal status but this week mr kyl stood with john mccain , arizona s senior senator and a candidate for the republican presidential nomination , as the compromise was announced , saying ideological sacrifices had to be made the proposal , though , divided the two democratic members of congress from here in southern arizona , gabrielle giffords and ra l m grijalva ms giffords called it a positive step while mr grijalva , whose father was a migrant farm worker , told the arizona daily star it was tentative and unfinished in south tucson , outside the southside presbyterian church , where immigrants mostly men have gathered for decades to find work , the immigration debate is also playing out as the men wait for jobs there are people like mr ram rez , who spent several years just over the border in sonora before finally coming to arizona for construction and other work he has not seen his family , he said , for 10 years sipping from a bottle filled with ice as the day s heat soared , mr ram rez occasionally broke away when pickup trucks and other vehicles approached , joining others begging for a day s work the biggest obstacle , mr ram rez said , would probably be paying the 5 , 000 in fines on the way to permanent legal status he does not have health insurance now , which he would be required to provide for his family if he decided to return to mexico and come back as a temporary worker i do n't know who sells that or what it costs , he said still , all in all , the important thing is saving the fines are similar to what we pay polleros , mr ram rez said , using a spanish slang term for the smugglers who guide people across the border teoforo vald s , 32 , nodded in agreement he has lived in and around tucson for 10 years and still makes occasional trips home to sonora , evading the border patrol but mr vald s has grown tired of the journey , he said , and , at least upon first look at the proposal , sees reason for optimism right now , we have nothing , no real way to legalize ourselves , he said this government is giving us steps and so we have to think how we can take them as the morning wore on , the number of potential employers driving past grew thin the workers began to disperse , though some stayed behind to use the bathroom and a shower at the church jes s antonio rodr guez , 49 , who said he was a legal resident and acts as an informal adviser to the men , summed up the dilemma people do not believe it but we really do come to work , mr rodr guez said we are not delinquents here we have to work and we want to cooperate , but everything is always so hard here
while it may not have the resonance of a 50homerun season , or the aura of a nohitter , the benchmark for a power pitcher is a 300strikeout season accomplished only 33 times since 1901 , it is a feat that does not happen by chance but with 11 of those seasons occurring between 1993 and 2002 , and none since , the question can be raised whether an era has passed without anyone noticing it had even started in 2002 , the diamondbacks teammates and each had more than 300 strikeouts , the third year in that period that two pitchers reached 300 strikeouts in the same season since then the number has not been approached , and it appears there is no one on the horizon that is likely to change that the key issue when we 're looking at 300strikeout pitchers is not so much of skill , because there are quite a few pitchers who have the skill to do it , said ron shandler , author of baseball forecaster 2007 i think it s a product of opportunities , of getting innings the success of the modern bullpen is a prime contributor to the diminishing number of innings for starting pitchers and the ensuing reduction of highstrikeout seasons the majority of 300strikeout seasons were recorded by pitchers throwing more than 275 innings in an era where even top pitchers are allowed only 34 starts and about 240 innings , a pitcher must not only throw a large number of innings , but must have a strikeout rate much higher than in previous generations from a standpoint of winning a game , it makes sense to bring a pitcher with a 25 era to replace the pitcher with a 35 or 4 era who has thrown 120 pitches , said rob neyer , a coauthor of baseball prospectus 2007 there is a lot of criticism of the way bullpens are used , and i will criticize them as well , but there are many times when even if you have a good pitcher on the mound who is doing well , statistically it makes more sense to bring in the relief pitcher the reduction of innings , along with monitored pitch counts , has led some to believe that putting the ball in play is a better strategy for a starting pitcher than trying to strike out batters two recent examples of this are jake peavy of the san diego padres and justin verlander of the detroit tigers both have the velocity and skills to be dominant strikeout pitchers , with peavy already owning one national league strikeout title , but both have been encouraged to try and get batters out in only a few pitches rather than the four to five it often takes to strike a batter out the more batters you strike out , the more pitches you have to throw , shandler said a pitcher who allows the ball to be put into play , especially those who put the ball into play on the ground , can be very successful neyer agreed to a point , but said in this current environment , maybe that s a good tradeoff , to trade a couple strikeouts for balls in play , with the side benefit that you get to stay in the game longer i do n't know if anybody has the answer i happen to know that most of the greatest pitchers in baseball history were strikeout pitchers , whether it s or or even greg maddux kerry wood was once considered to be next in a long line of great strikeout pitchers , an heir apparent to johnson , schilling and clemens he struck out 266 batters in 2003 and seemed primed to become the next pitcher with a 300strikeout season since then he has started only 36 games and is again battling injuries with strikeout rates still one of the prime indicators of future success for a pitcher , neyer does not think the failures of wood and his teammate mark prior , another young strikeout pitcher beset by injuries , will lead to changes in what teams are looking for in young talent if you ask any scouting director if he 'd like to have an 18yearold kerry wood , he 'd say , absolutely , ' neyer said but what they might ask them to do is dial it back a little bit since the reduced workload of starters is probably here to stay , the only hope for 300strikeout seasons may be for a pitcher to go on a run similar to the one mart nez went on from 1997 to 2002 the 5foot11 mart nez does not match the size of a schilling or a nolan ryan , and never threw more than 241 1 3 innings in a season , but he struck out 305 batters in 1997 and 313 in 1999 it may be a long wait for the next mart nez to be able to do what he did , with his body type , it could be argued that he s been as good as any pitcher ever at his peak , neyer said
the mother of a british girl who vanished from a portuguese holiday resort in may was formally named as a suspect in the case today , sources close to the family said , adding an extraordinary twist to a disappearance that prompted outrage in britain and an international manhunt kate mccann , mother of 4yearold madeleine , was declared a formal suspect after two days of lengthy questioning by police , the associated press reported , quoting family friends in britain in portimao , portugal , the police said they had identified a suspect but did not supply a name because of secrecy laws justine mcguinness , who directs a fund set up to campaign for the madeleine s return , said the police had told kate mccann they believed they had found traces of madeleine s blood in a car her parents rented three weeks after she disappeared there s currently a ludicrous suggestion that blood was found in a hire care that they hired 25 days after madeleine was taken , ms mcguinness told sky news during an interview in portugal that s been put to kate , and it s been suggested that she was in some way connected to the death of her daughter , which is clearly ridiculous , she added gerry mccann s sister , philomena mccann , told sky news that the police had suggested ms mccann had killed her daughter by accident they are suggesting that kate has in some way accidentally killed madeleine , then kept her body , then got rid of it , she said i have never heard anything so utterly ludicrous in my entire life the police wanted to ask 22 questions that , under portugese law , they could not pursue unless she was declared a suspect , ms mcguinness said she said that gerry mccann , the child s father , was still being treated as a witness the portuguese police today confirmed only that there were now two formal suspects in the case but declined to name them the other formal suspect is robert murat , a briton who lives with his mother near the compound from which madeleine disappeared he has maintained his innocence and has not been charged the police in portimao called in both parents for fresh questioning after they received the results of forensic evidence collected a few weeks ago from the mccann s holiday apartment and from other locations , including the rental car , according to news reports the evidence , which included specks of blood found on the apartment wall and items of clothing , was tested in a british laboratory portuguese police officials could not be reached for comment today oligario sousa , a spokesman for the police investigation , said that the investigators were very happy with the results from the forensic lab in britain because they mean they can go further with the case he did not give details of what the police had learned from those tests kate mccann is only the second person to be named a suspect in a case that has received unprecedented publicity but which has produced few concrete leads madeleine disappeared on may 3 from a holiday apartment in praia da luz , a seaside town in the algarve region of portugal her parents said they left her asleep with her twin siblings while they ate in a restaurant in the same compound about 100 yards , or 91 meters , away kate mccann was greeted by a mob of shouting and whistling onlookers as she arrived for questioning friday morning at the police station in portimao , a town about 15 kilometers , or 9 miles , from praia da luz the questioning followed an 11hour session thursday from which she emerged looking tired and drawn gerry mccann was filmed by television crews arriving at the police station this afternoon madeleine s disappearance convulsed the british public and sparked an outpouring of support from celebrities including j k rowling , the author of the books , and david beckham , the british soccer star more than 1 million , or 2 million , has been donated to the mccanns cause the mccanns , both doctors and committed catholics , launched a highprofile campaign to keep madeleine s face on posters and her name in the headlines , crisscrossing europe and meeting with pope benedict xvi at the vatican the campaign has helped fuel dozens of sightings and false alarms from spain to belgium and morocco , but none have produced concrete leads gerry mccann has chronicled their ordeal on an internet blog , discussing their morning jogs , his frequent trips to rally support and the couple s time with their two yearold twins , sean and amelie the couple has given increasingly frank interviews about their guilt at leaving their daughter unprotected a clutch of journalists has closely followed their lives in praia da luz , where they swore they would remain until madeleine s fate was discovered , filming the couple as they escorted the twins to day care and made frequent visits to the whitewashed church near the seafront the mccanns have maintained their innocence throughout the case and angrily denied local press speculation that they were implicated , saying last month that they intended to sue a portuguese weekly that claimed they had killed madeleine anyone who knows anything about the 3rd may knows that kate is completely innocent , gerry mccann wrote on his blog thursday the mccanns have held regular meetings with the police , which they said were intended to brief them on developments in the case , but gerry mccann wrote in the blog that thursday s session was only the second time kate had been questioned we will fight this all the way , and we will not stop looking for madeleine , he wrote messages of support streamed in thursday and friday to the web site ms mcguinness reiterated the mccanns' plea friday that the hunt for madeleine continue we 've got every hope that she may still be alive , ms mcguinness said i know that kate prays every day that today may be the day that she is reunited with her daughter madeleine
buyers from the nation s leading department stores will sift through the work of hundreds of designers as another fashion week begins today in new york , seeking the looks that shoppers will want to wear next spring seema anand will be looking for the ones they want right now ms anand , who will be following the catwalk shows through photographs posted instantly on the web , is a designer few would recognize , even though she has dressed more people than most of the famous designers exhibiting a few blocks from her garment district studio , under the tents in bryant park if i see something on stylecom , all i have to do is email the picture to my factory and say , i want something similar , or a silhouette made just like this , ' ms anand said the factory , in jaipur , india , can deliver stores a knockoff months before the designer version ms anand compared a gold sequined tunic she created with a nearly identical one by the designer tory burch bloomingdale s had asked her to make several hundred of the dresses for its private label aqua , she said the tory burch dress sells for 750 ms anand s is 260 ms anand s company , simonia fashions , is one of hundreds that make less expensive clothes inspired by other designers' runway looks , for trendy stores like forever 21 and retail behemoths like macy s and bloomingdale s a debate is raging in the american fashion industry over such designs copying , which has always existed in fashion , has become so pervasive in the internet era it is now the no 1 priority of the council of fashion designers of america , which is lobbying congress to extend copyright protection to clothing nine senators introduced a bill last month to support the designers an expert working with the designers' trade group estimates that knockoffs represent a minimum of 5 percent of the 181 billion american apparel market outlawing them is certainly an uphill battle , since many shoppers see nothing wrong with knockoffs , especially as prices for designer goods skyrocket critics of the designers' group even argue that copies are good for fashion because they encourage designers to continuously invent new wares to stay ahead designers say that is preinternet thinking for me , this is not simply about copying , said anna sui , one of more than 20 designers who have filed lawsuits against forever 21 , one of the country s fastestgrowing clothing chains , for selling what they claim are copies of their apparel the issue is also timing these copies are hitting the market before the original versions do the designers seek to outlaw clothing that looks very similar to their originals but is sold under someone else s label they want to extend laws that already ban counterfeit handbags and sunglasses with designer logos , which reportedly account for as much as 12 billion of sales a reliable estimate of knockoffs cannot be determined because designers and retailers disagree on which clothes are copies and which are merely inspired by a trend , a normal part of the fashion food chain ms anand agreed to offer a rare look at a side of fashion that exists parallel to seventh avenue s celebrity designers , though all but unknown to the public interviews with executives at a number of companies that specialize in designing for the private labels of department stores and other chains reveal a highly competitive network of factories , which use the latest technology to reproduce designer looks with the impunity and speed of robin hood their copies do not violate existing law this is the requirement of the market , ms anand said if a buyer tells us , this is what i need , ' we 'll make it for them this is our business her mother , shashi anand , founded their company , simonia fashions , in 1980 , five years after she moved to new york from new delhi shashi anand has won awards for her success as an asian businesswoman , including one presented in 1998 by bill and hillary clinton , whose pictures are framed on her office wall the company , with 10 employees in the showroom , has sales of 20 million , about 80 percent of which is for clothes sold under the private labels of stores like bloomingdale s and macy s , and for specialty chains like forever 21 , rampage and urban outfitters they also design their own line , blue plate most of their designs are original , or partly inspired by market trends , the women said but some look like direct copies , and some of those are made at the specific request of retailers at the factory in jaipur the company contracts with 2 , 000 workers who specialize in pattern making , design and tailoring , and are equipped with computer programs that approximate the design of a garment from a web image without the need to pull apart the seams the factory can return finished samples within 14 days sometimes the results are awful , and sometimes it looks so great you 're just shocked , ms anand said they 've done a better job than the designer the spring collections shown this week will not arrive in stores until february , typical of the decadesold industry cycle developed when fashion week was a trade event but now that the news media and the internet disseminate runway looks instantly , fashion followers are primed to seek them out earlier ms anand s factory can deliver her version of runway styles to stores four to six weeks after an order ms burch , who will show her collection on sept 11 , said she was aware that her designs had been singled out by copiers in march , she filed a lawsuit against several stores , including the strawberry chain , for selling ballerina flats with an insignia she thought was too close to hers as for the sequined dress ms anand made for bloomingdale s , similar to one of ms burch s , frank doroff , a senior executive vice president of the store , said he was unaware of the order it is our policy not to knock off existing resources , he said , noting that bloomingdale s carries the tory burch collection does it happen sometimes \? i assume it does , but that is not the way we like to do business the cut or details of a garment cannot be copyrighted under existing law , although logos and original prints can be protected anna sui s suit against forever 21 , which has 400 stores and sales estimated at more than 1 billion , claims it has infringed against her prints on 26 occasions it seems to be their business model to find things that are popular in the marketplace by other designers and copy them , said marya lenn yee , a lawyer for ms sui a spokeswoman for forever 21 , meghan bryan , had no comment on the lawsuit in working with our enormous vendor base , regularly buying items from hundreds of vendors , it is extremely difficult to be certain of the origin of each item , on each and every occasion , she said in an email message of several shoppers polled outside a forever 21 branch in herald square in manhattan recently , none said that knowing a design was copied would stop them from buying it some people do n't want to spend 300 on a pair of jeans just because of the name , said siovhan mcgearey , 16 , from london they may look nice , but why pay 300 when you can go down the street to forever 21 and get jeans that are 30 that look exactly the same \? designers counter that if the knockoffs continue unabated , their businesses will be in jeopardy ms anand maintained that her reproductions of designer styles have been changed enough that they do not violate a designer s intellectual property we do n't copy anything , she said we tweak it we get inspired before we create it she sees her work meeting the needs of the vast majority of consumers who cannot afford designer prices especially the younger girls do not have so much money , ms anand said , but they want to wear fashionable clothes they want to look fabulous , she said it s their right to look fabulous

jidda , every monday night , salama alzaid puts on his headphones , pulls his microphone close and goes to war on his radio talk show with some of the most powerful figures in this desert kingdom for two hours , from 10 pm to midnight \( prime time in saudi arabia \) , mr zaid opens the phone lines for callers to air their complaints , uncensored and unhindered then he takes on the people in high places responsible for fixing those problems i wish all those officials who are listening to remember this , mr zaid began on a recent night you are servants of the citizens , you have a duty to them it is not below you to call in and respond part showman , part rabblerouser , mr zaid , 49 , is the host of mubasher fm , a show as remarkable for what it says about saudi arabia as for the powerful backing it has gotten from the country s ruler , king abdullah the king , mr zaid says , sees the show as a way of gauging the public mood and of solving problems he would have never known existed in recent years , king abdullah has encouraged more open discussion , eased restrictions on women and put some restraints on the country s dreaded vice police , in an attempt at social , if not political , change mr zaid said an emboldened media was part of that opening the media has always been a red line in this country , he said but the king came and said this is the way to reach the people and he sent a message to me keep going no one tracks ratings in saudi arabia , so it is impossible to say precisely how popular mr zaid s show is one measure , perhaps , is the thousands of calls he screens every week for material another is the men who wait outside the studios late into the night , hoping to speak with him or hand him their complaints with the help of those callers , mr zaid has tackled some of saudi arabia s greatest taboos rampant corruption , sexual harassment and mistreatment of saudi women , extremism , growing poverty and , most of all , the lack of accountability by government officials mr zaid does not have entirely free rein he stays away from religious issues he calls for accountability , but staunchly supports the legitimacy of the royal family , and he champions law and order above all one recent night , he took on saudi schools and universities that were not hiring saudi women qualified for teaching jobs our daughters are being wronged by our universities and places of higher learning , he said i call on khalid altuwairij , the head of the royal court , to look into this problem and help us solve it he continued , i must thank the king for his specific instructions that all officials implement his decrees , because those who do not must know they will be taken to task almost every show , he fields calls from officials who previously would never have deigned to speak to the news media some call in unprompted , to preempt complaints others call after the show to defend their ministries or to get details on the callers so they can help them often , the callers appeal to the king himself , and at the end of each show their files are turned over to public outreach officials in the royal court they may get an audience with the king , or have the king issue a decree to solve their problem everyone who goes on the air , mr zaid boasts , gets some satisfaction mr zaid began an opening monologue recently by berating saudi officials for not paying enough attention to citizens' concerns , calling on them to remember their oath of duty to the people that was enough to make his producer and sound men cringe but then the governor of jidda called in to discuss development plans , and submitted to a grilling from mr zaid the environment in jidda has all kinds of problems , mr zaid began she is the betrothed but is badly treated what do you intend to do about it \? mubasher fm \( mubasher means immediate or live \) sprang largely from a dare , mr zaid said he had been the host of another radio callin program , the bottom line , but he quit early in 2006 after a manager in the information ministry took him to task for what he was saying when he was approached a month later about reviving the show , he countered with a proposal for a live callin format that would tackle corruption an impossible demand , he thought but a few days later , the radio director called back to ask him when he could start a native of burayat , a small town in northwestern saudi arabia , mr zaid had often taken trips into jordan as a child , and appreciated its openness compared with his own country as he pursued his studies in riyadh , he says , he found the heavily controlled news media stifling , and vowed someday to challenge the status quo he worked his way through the ranks in the saudi radio and television services , reading the news and doing talk shows at odd hours he also ran a popular , oprahstyle talk show for an arab satellite broadcaster , art , until 1998 mr zaid takes 10 to 20 calls a night , most requests for debt relief or financial help , which the palace typically grants but a growing number have been moving or tragic cases on one recent evening , a woman named qamar abdel jaffar called to recount how her son had been killed by a saudi policeman her son was a bystander when a riot erupted and the police were pelted with rocks , she said a policeman opened fire , first into the air and then into the crowd , she said , killing her son but the authorities , insisting that the bullet had ricocheted off the pavement , refused to hand over the body until she gave up her demand for an investigation all i want to know is who killed my son , she said , her voice cracking as mr zaid sought to soothe her but they offered me the body and said , god be with you' we will not allow this , mr zaid bellowed , leaning into his microphone , as he motioned to his producer to try to get an official on the line no one is above the law not a private , not a sergeant , not a colonel not in this country , not in my country ! mr zaid said her file was reviewed by king abdullah , who has called for a full investigation on another night , a man called seeking help for his son , an imam in medina who had been caught training young men to shoot weapons in the desert my son abdullah , my angel , the most important thing in my life , got into big trouble , and all i ask is for the king s mercy on him , the man wailed but mr zaid , a staunch defender of law and order , would have none of it put yourself in the place of the authorities , he counseled you have someone teaching young men being organized , then i begin to teach them in the use of weapons \? it s just suspect ! if nothing else , he said , the call underscored the changes taking place in saudi arabia who could have ever imagined a day when a man would be willing to publicize that his son was in jail for terrorism and ask for him to be freed \? mr zaid said , almost dumbfounded that was simply unheard of before but people are now prepared to stand up
just two weeks into the college football season , and the drumbeat for the potential of another seasonending fiasco with the bowl championship series has started already with that annual nervousness , as the bcs coordinator mike slive likes to call it , showing up before the halfway point of september , we at the quad figured it would be the perfect time to review stewart mandel s engaging new book , bowls , polls and tattered souls mandel is sports illustrated s and sicom s resident college football guru as he explains , a large portion of his job involves attempting to explain to irrational college football fan bases across the country just how illogical the current system of college football is it s important to understand the one underlying truth about college football that digs to the heart of the sport s prevailing sense of chaos , mandel writes in the introduction and that is no one is in charge i m serious from there , mandel takes you through the hotbutton topics in and around the sport , from analyzing why the polls are flawed to the seemingly annual mess of the bcs to why exactly the world is so obsessed with notre dame the funniest chapter may be the one entitled everybody cheats , just not my school , where mandel talks about how prevalent cheating is among top programs around the country , despite the fact that none of them really gets punished somehow , of course , fans ardently believe that every program aside from the one they love is breaking the rules what mandel does best is walk a delicate line , as the book is sarcastic without being cynical and critical without sounding jaded the book offers an intricate tour through the ills of the college football world \( and there are many \) , but still manages to take on a breezy , airy tone it s a lot like a college football 101 seminar taught in a dive bar in norman as opposed to a dreary lecture hall \( to get a good feel for the book , check out this excerpt , which explains what exactly a voter in the ap poll goes through and how certain anomalies such as south florida not being ranked after winning at auburn happen \) and the best worst part of this book is that it will become more and more relevant as the season seasons wear on , and the chaos so inherent to college football unfolds yet again

kabul , afghanistan america and its allies are in danger of repeating the mistakes of iraq in afghanistan hillary clinton , barack obama and even some republicans are insisting on withdrawing from iraq and sending more troops and resources to southern afghanistan the bush administration s gloomy national intelligence estimate last week on the fight against al qaeda will only lead others to make such calls but they should think again the intervention in afghanistan has gone far better than that in iraq largely because the americanled coalition has limited its ambitions and kept a light footprint , leaving the afghans to run their own affairs much has been made lately of setbacks and the resilience of the taliban but given its history , afghanistan is doing relatively well international terrorist training camps have been eliminated \( or at least pushed across the border to pakistan \) national wealth has nearly doubled in the last five years kabul s population has expanded from less than a million in 2001 to almost four million today it seems ground is broken on another huge blueglass commercial building every week the wage for an unskilled laborer in kabul is now 4 a day , four times that in neighboring pakistan and uzbekistan millions of afghan refugees have returned home at a time when iraqis are fleeing iraq the central regions of afghanistan are safe enough for foreigners to travel alone unharmed there are , however , serious problems in the south and east of the country taliban forces raid villages and military posts before retreating to safety across the pakistan border in helmand province , the government is associated with kidnapping , murder and theft thirtyfive highway policemen were arrested this month , accused of robbing vehicles this province alone produces 50 percent of europe s heroin afghans in such areas are justifiably angry nato has tried to solve the problems of the south with more troops this has only added to the problem for example , britain decided in 2005 to bring good government , security , rule of law and economic growth to helmand province at the time , there were few taliban attacks in the area the british deployed some 4 , 000 soldiers last year and more civilian advisers to replace a few hundred international troops who had been in the province since the fall of the taliban the british effort failed a year and a half later , with 7 , 000 british troops in helmand , the provincial government is more corrupt , the streets less safe for citizens , the poppy crop larger and the legal economy and infrastructure more eroded worst of all , the foreign presence has provoked a wide taliban insurgency dutch troops in uruzgan province and the canadians in kandahar have had similar experiences nato s failures in the south should serve as warnings to those who would intensify western efforts here the results were inevitable for fundamental structural reasons many afghan officials are simply not committed to statebuilding in southern afghanistan , and many are connected to the drug trade narcotics makes up more than half of afghanistan s gross domestic product and there is no sufficiently appealing alternative crop for farmers most important , none of the factors that led to success in history s classic counterinsurgency campaigns are present in the fight against the taliban in british malaya in the 1950s , for example , success depended on direct imperial control of the government , a powerful and cooperative local administration , large numbers of troops , active support from much of the population , a detailed understanding of local culture and politics , control of the borders and strong political support at home in afghanistan , by contrast , the americanled coalition is not the government and has to operate in tandem with an afghan civil service , military and police force that are at best ineffective and at worst actively undermine coalition operations the dominant pashtun tribes in the south and east are suspicious of foreign troops and are reluctant to side with them against the taliban , who are from their own ethnic group coalitionbacked governments have been unable to prevent the insurgents from taking sanctuary and receiving armaments and money from across the porous borders with pakistan and iran american and european voters will not send the hundreds of thousands of troops the counterinsurgency textbooks recommend , and have no wish to support decades of fighting worst of all , an increased foreign troop presence will help the taliban , who are unable to deliver government services and often live parasitically off the people , and whose best selling point is that they are fighting for afghanistan and islam against a foreign occupation if we commit more troops we will find it very difficult to withdraw them later without losing credibility our best hope in afghanistan is to continue to manage the country through a light civil and military presence southern afghanistan will remain unstable for some time to come although we cannot change this , we can contain the situation we can prevent qaeda units from using the area as a base from which to attack the united states , and we can prevent the taliban from again mobilizing conventional forces or capturing major northern cities like kabul and mazarisharif this will not require large numbers of troops if the taliban tried to raise another conventional army , it would be an easy target for coalition forces and air power the most efficient and sustainable way to protect american soil from a terrorist attack is not to deploy tens of thousands of troops to occupy rural areas of afghanistan , but to invest in intelligence to identify the few radicals who want to attack western targets , and use special forces operations to eliminate them we can do much more to show people the benefit of cooperating with the coalition projects in hostile areas , where the local population is not working with us and where a minority wants to attack us , are not a constructive use of our limited resources our best hope is rather to focus on the many secure and welcoming parts of afghanistan s center and north efforts to jumpstart local economies led by members of those communities are more effective , more relevant and more sustainable than those dictated by outsiders we have a great opportunity in the north , center and west of afghanistan to lead development projects for which afghans will still be grateful 50 years from now this does not mean that we should withdraw and partition the country , or that the pashtun south is doomed but only the afghans have the power to end the insurgency and create a stable and democratic south it will not be easy residents have not yet mobilized effectively against the taliban other afghan ethnic groups still see the insurgency as a pashtun problem and would rather not be involved twentyfive years of war has left a power vacuum politicians concerned with afghanistan continue to underestimate the power and autonomy of provincial groups and the appeal of tribe and religion stabilizing southern afghanistan will require uncomfortable compromises it will certainly take 20 years for afghanistan to develop an economy to match even bangladesh , or a civil service or military to match that of pakistan in the meantime , the pashtun areas may remain as wild and unstable as the tribal areas of pakistan but afghanistan on the whole can become more stable , more humane and more prosperous than it is today americanled military occupations and counterinsurgency campaigns are unsustainable and counterproductive , not just in iraq or afghanistan but in all nationalist muslim countries but this is not a call for disengagement we need a new strategy that can be applied not only in iraq but also in pakistan and wherever else these threats emerge it should not rely on large amounts of troops and money but on intelligence , pragmatic politics , savvy use of our development assistance and on special forces operations rather than throwing more troops at afghanistan and turning it into a second iraq , we should use it as a model for a lighter , smarter approach
philadelphia lorenzo compton did not have a promising start his parents kicked him out at 17 for refusing to obey , he dropped out of the 12th grade when he got a girl pregnant , he served almost two years for drug dealing and he carries a bullet in his thigh at 43 , mr compton is again a force in the frankford section of northeast philadelphia but this time as a oneman block patrol , as a mentor to countless young men , and as keeper of the keys to the fancy new football field that helps bring a ragged neighborhood together he rises at 5 am to drive a school bus , his paying job after work , he makes sure his three younger sons do their homework and then , most every weeknight and weekend , mr compton makes the short drive from his house to gambrel field to inspect the turf before practice begins mr lorenzo , as he is called with respect , has been deputized to watch over the 2 million field , an emerald oasis of astroturf with night lighting and an electronic scoreboard it is home to the frankford chargers football teams , which occupy the evenings , weekends and dreams of 400 local boys ages 5 to 14 , mainly lowincome black and hispanic children from singleparent households , including many from the rough public housing project next door on a recent evening , mr compton unlocked the gate a little before the flood of boys in red uniforms and helmets arrived like an overprotective parent , he slowly walked up and down the field to pick out sunflower seeds or pebbles , cursing when he saw a splash of gatorade , which he said can hasten decay of the turf mr compton seemed to know everyone and be known by all the children refer to him , with awe , as the field general , because he brooks no nonsense clear out of there ! he yelled to children encroaching on the turf out of turn do n't eat near the grass ! he can be loud and gruff , but as one old friend of his put it , sometimes you need someone loud , and as one young player put it , he makes me feel like a professional another side showed , too , when after a heartbreaking loss in regional playoffs , he walked with a teenager , hand over his shoulder , and said , son , you got no business crying , not after that game you played today during practice , nobody even took notice of the sirens blaring on nearby streets , the nervous beam of a police helicopter s searchlight murders in philadelphia jumped last year by 8 percent , to 406 , giving it the highest percapita homicide rate of the nation s largest cities , and a shortage of male role models is often cited as a contributor to crime and drug use but on this field , more than 40 volunteer coaches are there every night during the season , putting nine teams , sorted by age and weight , through their paces the teams have been frequent champions in the pop warner and other youth leagues , and are frankford s claim to fame throughout the city the players must keep a c average or better to play a burly man whose shaved head and neat eartoear beard make him look even rounder than he is , mr compton and his wife , dorina , an administrative assistant with the city , have put potted flowers and seasonal decorations in front of their own house , a sharp contrast with the boardedup buildings on either side the corner by their house , with a small food market , used to be a drug bazaar but for the last 15 years it has been quiet , with none of the loitering hustlers visible a few blocks away i go right up to them and say , i do n't want to see you around my house , mr compton said rick ribera , 20 , who stopped by the store , said that a lot of the old guys here do n't get that respect , but with him it s , yes , sir' mr compton says he gets respect because they know i'm cut from the same cloth the chargers teams were started 40 years ago by bill gambrel , 71 , a building contractor whom mr compton considers a second father when mr compton got out of prison in his early 20s , mr gambrel gave him a job and an apartment mr gambrel still shows up every evening to watch the games for years , the chargers played on scraggly , bumpy ground the new field was paid for with city money and donations from more than a dozen organizations mr compton was one of many who volunteered to help with construction mr gambrel put him in charge of the field matthew herbert , 21 , who played on the chargers and now coaches , called the field our little sanctuary , where street disputes are left behind , and called mr compton frankford s uncle because he has taken so many young men under his wing mr compton , mr herbert said , helped him stay out of trouble when he was younger once when mr compton caught him cutting school , he said , he grabbed me , gave me a little body shot to the ribs , talked to me and took me to school i never cut school again i was too scared , said mr herbert , who now works as a bus driver still , football does not save everyone from drugs and violence mr compton himself was a player who went astray once in prison , though , mr compton said , he changed his ways i realized this is n't for me , sitting in a small room and working for three cents a day one particularly gratifying thing , mr compton said , is that otherwise absent fathers show up at ball games that s enough to make a kid play extra hard , he said that s enough to turn to their dad with a smile , like , dad , look what i did' perhaps the father will realize , mr compton said , that man , his mom is doing all this , i'm not a part of this
senator john mccain arrived in iowa on saturday to begin testing one of the biggest questions so far of the presidential campaign can he win as an allout supporter of the war in iraq \? almost from the moment he took the stage at his first event here since forming his presidential exploratory committee , mr mccain made clear that he was not backing down when it came to the war , and that in political terms , he might see an advantage in presenting himself to the first republican voters in the nominating process as an unapologetic advocate for the war in iraq he attacked senate democrats for what he called a political stunt in trying to join the house in passing a nonbinding resolution opposing president bush s plan to send more troops to baghdad he warned of catastrophic consequences if the united states abandoned its effort in iraq he belittled the white house for falsely raising hopes by asserting early american successes in the war and he spent nearly 60 minutes fielding questions and challenges from an audience of republicans , many of them clearly with mr mccain on the issue but others anguished over the war i know how tough it is for the american people , i know how frustrated americans are , i understand your frustration , mr mccain said i understand your frustration but i also want to tell you that i believe if we fail , the consequences of failure are catastrophic to be here , mr mccain skipped the debate in the senate he called the rare saturday session in the capitol insulting to the public and our soldiers but the war was as omnipresent in the des moines hotel ballroom as it was in washington it brought to life what has become a central strategic gamble for the mccain campaign that his support of the war in iraq would help him among the select groups of iowa republicans who will caucus here next january it is a position that gives him an opportunity to reassure republican activists here who have not forgotten or forgiven his frequent criticisms of the administration in the earlier years of mr bush s presidency , according to state party officials even if it s not popular in the general election , everybody in the republican primary process is supporting the surge , said mark mckinnon , one of mr mccain s senior advisers in many ways , mr mccain finds himself in the opposite situation of senator hillary rodham clinton of new york he has embraced a position that may lift him through the primaries , but that could complicate his prospects against an antiwar democrat in the general election , his own advisers said mr mccain s aides could barely contain their frustration , as mr mccain sailed off on this maiden voyage of his campaign , at the extent to which perhaps the most important factor in determining the 2008 race was beyond of their control one aide , who was granted anonymity in order to offer a rather gloomy appraisal of republican hopes for holding the white house in 2008 , said that if the situation iraq deteriorated or even stayed the same , it would be a major liability for the republican who won the presidential nomination republicans are in a tough spot there s nobody running for president who controls the destiny of what happens there , the aide said i do think as republicans we have to get to a difference place on iraq or we are in trouble as a party mr mccain s first stop saturday suggested just how torn americans are about this war , regardless of party a questioner who introduced himself as a veteran of combat in iraq and afghanistan drew an ovation that lasted nearly 60 seconds but moments later , mr mccain faced skeptical questioning from marty baddeloo , a business coach who lives in west des moines and who said he had a son who served in iraq , about how much money and how many lives would be needed for mr mccain to accomplish his mission i 'd like to know what it s going to cost to be successful in iraq , mr baddeloo said assuming you are elected president , if your plans are implemented , what is it going to cost in terms of time and dollars for us to be successful in iraq \? mr mccain , holding a wireless microphone and wearing a loosefitting brown leather jacket , answered with a subdued tone i 'd like to be able to give you an answer , sir , he said and you reflect the frustration that many americans feel while the war in iraq looms as a political liability for the major republican contenders mitt romney , the former governor of massachusetts , and rudolph w giuliani , the former mayor of new york , have also expressed support for mr bush s war policy none have been as closely identified with the war effort as mr mccain and mr mccain showed no signs of walking away from a war that , his advisers said , he arguably owns as much as mr bush does i do n't know what the other options are , mr mccain said when one questioner asked what would happen if this escalation of 21 , 500 troops fewer than mr mccain had advocated failed to work because if we fail here i'm going to give you very straight talk here it s not going to maintain the support of the american people i can give you lots of options , but i'm hardpressed to find one that will get the support of the american people and he was disdainful of senate democrats , mocking them for pushing through a procedural vote in the senate on a saturday i'm more than willing to discuss iraq and my views , but i think it s insulting to the public and our soldiers to pretend we are discharging our responsibilities in any meaningful way mr mccain said again at a news conference on saturday morning that political factors played no role in his views i 've said all along i cannot be concerned or will not be concerned if it helps me or hurts me with anyone , he said its an issue that transcends any political ambitions i might have still , that is something that mr mccain s advisers thinking about both the primary battle and a general election fight have given much thought to mr mccain s advisers said they thought that he could be insulated to some extent by a failure of american policy in iraq because of the fact that he has long been critical of the way the war was handled he called for an increase in troop strength there long before mr bush acted the fact of the matter is mccain has been saying this for three years and maintained from day 1 that we do n't have enough troops there , said dave roederer , the iowa chairman of mr mccain s campaign and mr mccain was openly scornful of the white house for raising expectations among the american public by making statements that conveyed that the effort in iraq was far more successful than it actually was we raised people s expectations mission accomplished , a few deadenders , last throes , he said all those comments that made americans believe we were on the verge of getting this thing done when in reality on the ground , as you saw , it was a long , hard struggle that we should have told people that it is mr mccain s aides said they saw one upside for mr mccain now that his position on the war could help him through the months ahead in the republican primary , this is going to be good for senator mccain , said russ schriefer , mr mccain s media adviser it makes him more of a republican to those who might have been uneasy about him not being enough of a team player it shows him as very much a team player on this issue photos a mccain fan at a questionandanswer session in des moines senator john mccain of arizona greeting supporters yesterday during a campaign trip through iowa \( photographs by todd heisler the new york times \)
raleigh , nc april 13 facing a hailstorm of criticism for pressing sexual assault charges against three men he now agrees were wrongly accused , the durham county district attorney was before a hearing on friday where his lawyers argued for dismissal of the most serious ethics charge against him the charge accuses the prosecutor , , of failing to properly disclose dna reports to defense lawyers in the lacrosse rape case a hearing panel ruled that all the ethics charges , including one that mr nifong had made inflammatory public comments , would be heard at a fourday trial in june mr nifong could face penalties up to disbarment his appearance here came two days after the north carolina attorney general , roy a cooper , dismissed sexual offense and kidnapping charges against three former duke lacrosse players , blaming a false accuser and a rogue prosecutor for a miscarriage of justice mr cooper s office had spent three months reinvestigating the case after mr nifong recused himself to fight the ethics charges mr nifong apologized on thursday in a statement , saying , to the extent that i made judgments that ultimately proved to be incorrect , i apologize to the three students that were wrongly accused on friday , he said , my statement yesterday was in plain language lips pursed , surrounded by reporters and cameras before and after the onehour preliminary hearing , he declined to comment further his lawyer , david b freedman , said i do n't know how much more you can apologize when you say i apologize to the three players who were wrongly accused' we would hope people would understand that apology by mr nifong it takes a lot to admit he was wrong the apology was rejected by defense lawyers one of them , brad bannon , attended the hearing , taking careful notes , and said afterward that the former duke students and their families wanted mr nifong to have what he denied them a fair hearing the hearing considered mr nifong s motion to dismiss the ethics charges that he had hid exculpatory dna evidence lawyers for the north carolina state bar , which is pursuing the ethics case against mr nifong , said he had misled judges and lawyers and failed to properly disclose reports showing at least four samples of unidentified male dna on the accuser or her clothes , none of it from lacrosse players mr nifong s lawyers argued that he turned over 1 , 844 pages of dna reports in october , well before a trial was scheduled they said that met the requirements of the law katherine jean , prosecuting the ethics case for the bar , said mr nifong learned of the dna results six months earlier , in april a week before he issued indictments against two of the men ms jean said it was scary to consider what would have happened if the men had had to plea bargain in the case , as commonly occurs , without the evidence f lane williamson , a charlotte lawyer who is chairman of the threemember hearing panel , sided with the bar , though he cautioned that this was a preliminary issue without any evidence being heard if you were trying to hide that , you would do exactly that , mr williamson said you would dump the information rather than simply say , yeah , there were four other guys with dna there' a few more details emerged late thursday about the weakness of the case against the three men attorney general cooper has promised a detailed report next week he told the cbs program 60 minutes that the accuser had acted irrationally and appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol when she spoke with his staff , according to a cbs news release in a segment to be shown on sunday , mr cooper said the woman gave a new and unlikely version of the attack further , he said , the woman gave irrational answers when she was shown timestamped photographs from the party that contradicted parts of her story it was usually that the picture was doctored or that just ca n't be true , ' or duke university paid someone off , ' mr cooper said for the program mr cooper said the woman still wanted to press charges but the news and observer of raleigh reported on friday that the woman s cousin has talked with her and she s just glad it s over with
they hardly qualify as rookies indeed the mere concept is probably alien to this year s crop of veteran international players who have turned up in major league soccer while major league baseball has grappled for years with the notion of a veteran player from , say japan , coming to the united states and being considered a rookie , in the strictest sense , the major domos at mls hq in new york have come up with an answer the newcomer of the year award and while it might seem to be a nobrainer that the current top scorer , brazilian luciano emilio of dc united , would be a shooin for the award , consider that several other players are playing important roles that may be more significant here s a subjective listing of some of the candidates juan pablo ngel the new york red bulls striker from colombia leads the team with 12 goals and 4 assists since joining the club in may from aston villa of the english premier league ngel exudes class on the field , with every deft touch of the ball he has made nearly every one of his teammates better his simple approach is usually the correct approach he is fluent in english juan toja the fc dallas midfielder , another colombian , scored the winning goal in the mls allstars victory over glasgow celtic he currently has 6 goals and is easy to pick out on the field because of his wild hair that reminds some of carlos valderrama he is a tireless worker who covers the entire field maykel galindo the chivas usa striker defected from cuba during the 2005 concacaf gold cup he has been the goalscoring spark chivas has been searching for and leads the team with 12 goals and 5 assists galindo combines power and speed with some amazing athletic ability luciano emilio the dc united striker from brazil is the league s leading scorer with 18 goals \( he has 1 assist \) after a recent flurry of goals emilio started the season strong , slacked off midseason , but has come on lately he scored two goals in april , none in may and five in june although he is a lethal scorer , emilio has squandered some excellent changes guillermo barros schelotto the columbus crew midfielder from argentina was not signed as a designated player but certainly qualifies as the best nondesignated acquisition by any mls team he has 4 goals and 9 assists and almost singlehandedly lifted the crew into playoff contention an incredibly accurate passer who has the ability to dissect any opposing defense cuauht moc blanco the chicago striker from mexico has singlehandedly energized a moribund fire squad since he arrived after the copa am rica he has 2 goals and 4 assists in only 7 games part of a puzzle that come together with a new coach , juan carlos osorio and costa rican striker paulo wanchope has brought incredible passion to the game each time he steps on the field pablo ricchetti the fc dallas midfielder from argentina has lent needed stability to the club s midfield after past turnover he generally plays deep in the midfield dallas has a 1042 record with him in the lineup and a 242 record without him carlos marinelli the kansas city midfielder from argentina has 1 goals and 5 assists and has stepped into the playmaking role vacated several years ago by preki wonderful control , deft passing and it is no coincidence that eddie johnson has discovered his scoring touch bulletin it is the guys supplying the ball who make the difference for every scorer fred the dc united midfielder from brazil has 6 goals and 5 assists and seems to have finally settled into after some shaky performances early in the season those are the best , now here are some of the rest conor casey \( colorado \) , denilson \( fc dallas \) , fabian espindola \( real salt lake \) , guyroland kpene \( dc united \) , javier morales \( real salt lake \) , claudio reyna \( red bulls \) , wanchope \( chicago \) and abel xavier \( los angeles \) conspicuous by his absence david beckham , who will probably miss the rest of the regular season with a knee injury
baghdad , dec 31 for sunni arabs here , the ugly reality of the new seemed to crystallize in a twominute segment of saddam hussein s hanging , filmed surreptitiously on a cellphone the video featured excited taunting of mr hussein by hooded shiite guards passed around from cellphone to cellphone on sunday , the images had echoes of the videos sunni militants take of beheadings yes , he was a dictator , but he was killed by a death squad , said a sunni arab woman in western baghdad who was too afraid to give her name what s the difference between him and them \? there was , of course , a difference mr hussein was a brutal dictator , while the shiite organizers of the execution are members of the popularly elected iraqi government that the united states helped put in place as an attempt to implant a democracy it was supposed to be a formal and solemn proceeding carried out by a dispassionate state but the grainy recording of the execution s cruel theater summed up what has become increasingly clear on the streets of the capital that the shiiteled government that assumed power in the american effort here is running the state under an undisguised sectarian banner the hanging was hasty laws governing its timing were bypassed , and the guards charged with keeping order in the chamber instead disrupted it , shouting shiite militia slogans it was a degrading end for a vicious leader , and an ominous beginning for the new iraq the bush administration has already scaled back its hopes for a democracy here but as the iraqi government has become ever more set on protecting its shiite constituency , often at the expense of the sunni minority , the goal of stopping the sectarian war seems to be slipping out of reach we speak about the crimes of saddam hussein , but now here we are behaving in the same way , said alaa makki , a prominent sunni politician we fear that nothing has been changed on the contrary , we feel it is going in a worse direction after the invasion , sunni arabs , bitter at losing their place , refused to take part in iraq s first elections , allowing shiites and kurds to sweep to power americans here spent the following months persuading the shiites to let the sunnis back in the idea , at the time , was that involving sunnis in politics would drain the insurgency of its violence instead , the violence got worse , and in february , the longabused shiites struck back , using the force of the state ministries and agencies that they now control now , american officials are pressing iraqi leaders , both sunni and shiite , to reconcile and have made it a central demand for continued support of the iraqi government but the prospects for mutual agreement seem ever more distant i ca n't think of any good reason for any levelminded person to be interested in reconciliation , one secular sunni politician said that unwillingness , shared by most of the shiite political elite , is a serious challenge to any new american strategy proposal that president bush may announce soon indeed , the sunni political class is getting smaller many of the sunni politicians once ubiquitous during the broad discussions of the iraqi constitution two years ago are now gone virtually none of the members of the association of muslim scholars , a hardline sunni arab religious group , are left in iraq most of them have gone to jordan and syria out of more than 50 members of the baghdad council that runs the city , only one is sunni the reason is that shiites , who had been driven from their homes and relentlessly slaughtered by sunni suicide bombers , are now pushing back the taunting during mr hussein s execution capped months of advances by shiite militias , which have forced sunnis farther back into western baghdad but as the shiites gain the upper hand , they also seem to be abandoning any hint of compromise the video , sunnis said , was a startling symbol of that in the images , the guards taunt mr hussein they damn him they cheer their shiite heroes so persistently that one observer makes a remark about how the effort to rein in militias does not seem to be going well immediately after they let him drop , in the midst of repeating a prayer , the voices rise in urgency and begin talking excitedly then several others chime in , telling those present to step back from the body and to wait three minutes before touching it the video was particularly disturbing for sunni arabs , who accuse the government of willfully allowing militias to remain in the ranks of its security forces it left the impression that the government cared more for revenge than for justice , sunnis said either it s terrible incompetence or it s an act of revenge a vendetta , said adnan pachachi , a respected sunni whose political career began long before mr hussein took power that was the impression people had one of the problems was the timing the execution was rescheduled a number of times , as iraqi officials raced through a checklist of requirements put forth by the americans two legal conditions that it not be held on a holiday and that the iraqi president and his two deputies be given 30 days to sign off on the sentence first were ignored the fact was not lost on sunni political leaders , including mr makki , who said the execution was a step backward for the country this is a political mistake , he said we lost a lot with this to make matters worse , it fell just as the first day of the id aladha holiday dawned for sunnis a day before the shiites' observance was to begin shiite politicians did not apologize and some even reveled in the timing that did a major disservice to reconciliation , many argued why could n't they have waited for a few more days \? mr pachachi said it was a deliberate insult to so many people it helped saddam s friends yusra abdul aziz , a sunni teacher in mansour , had a blunter analysis they changed him from a criminal into a martyr in a strange twist , sunni insurgents did not seem to care sunni jihadist web sites had virtually no messages about mr hussein s death , aside from two rereleased statements , old debates by militant sheiks over whether he should be considered a martyr the feeling is that they do n't care about him , said rita katz , who runs the site institute , a group that tracks militant islamist web sites for the more hardline sunni arabs , the execution simply confirmed their view that joining the shiite government could never work sheik hakam abdullah alshahiri from the obeid tribe in kirkuk is an example iraq is occupied now by the us and iran and a puppet government for both sides , he said with the execution of saddam the arab identity of iraq and its unity have ended that has left moderate sunnis those who still seek reconciliation to ponder the danger of a shiite hegemony that seems too scarred from past abuses to govern lightly governing a country should not be done by reflexes , mr makki said it should be wisdom first a panoramic view not behaving from one side , he added , like what we saw here
nairobi , kenya , feb 20 fierce mortar attacks killed at least 15 civilians in on tuesday , and for a country that had seemed on the verge of ending 16 years of chaotic violence this is the new status quo nearly every day , government forces and insurgents shell each other across mogadishu s already dilapidated neighborhoods , scattering bodies and any remaining traces of hope gun prices are soaring and more clans are joining the underground , while an outbreak of cholera sweeps the countryside to tell you the truth , i'm pretty worried , said mohammed ali mahdi , a top clan elder when the government came to mogadishu , i felt we were going the right way unfortunately , that s not the case anymore and soon it s going to be too late it is hard to believe , but somalia is actually becoming a more violent and chaotic place that is not how it was supposed to be nearly two months ago , an internationallysupported transitional government ousted the islamist forces and steamed into mogadishu , the capital , with great expectations but confidence in the government never very high is rapidly bleeding away somalia seems to be just shy of total collapse again because the ethiopian troops who provided the muscle to throw out the islamists are withdrawing , yet none of the peacekeepers promised from other african countries have arrived hundreds of families are streaming out of mogadishu , hoisting mattresses on their backs and following pitted roads to villages where there is no electricity , medicine or even the faintest hint of government , but at least no warfare at least , not yet we ca n't stand the shelling anymore , said hassan mohammed , a father of four , who was headed to a village in the south there was a burst of optimism beginning dec 28 , when government troops , with ethiopian firepower behind them , marched into mogadishu and planted the hope that the anarchy was ending cheering crowds poured into ruined streets aid experts in nairobi circulated ambitious reconstruction plans ethiopian and american officials , who had worked together to overthrow the islamists , breathed a mutual sigh of relief but what has happened in the past few weeks has killed that mood a deadly insurgency has started , beginning with a few clans connected to the islamists and now expanding to several more many government troops refuse to get involved we 're not going out there , said dahir hassan , a police captain , from the confines of his police station if we get hurt , who s going to take care of us \? all analysts agree that the violence will continue and probably intensify unless the government reconciles with clan leaders , who control , as much as anyone controls , what happens in somalia but so far , there s been very little of that instead of reaching out to truly influential figures , analysts say the government has picked ministers not because they have any substantial support among their clans but because they will do the government s bidding the result is an increasingly isolated , authoritarian and unpopular government in which the transitional president , abdullahi yusuf ahmed , is accused of behaving more like a clan warlord which he was than a national leader where this government is heading is so far from where the international community wants it to go , said ali iman sharmarke , one of the owners of the hornafrik radio station in mogadishu a common complaint is that the transitional government transitional being the operative word is not working itself out of a job as promised donor nations agreed to pay the salaries of somali officials with the understanding that those men and handful of women would shepherd the country to democratic elections in 2009 but there has been almost no progress toward setting up an election commission , let alone taking a census many somalis say they would be more inclined to support , or at least tolerate , the transitional government if they thought it was indeed transitional to be fair , ruling somalia , which has not had a functioning central government since 1991 , is no easy task thirteen previous governments have been formed and 13 previous governments have failed abdirahman dinari , the government s chief spokesman , said the criticism about the government s selection of ministers was just an excuse these people would n't be happy with anyone in power , he said , conceding that the government , on its own , did not have the skills to pull the country together we need help but mr dinari said help had been slow to arrive , partly because international organizations were spending millions of dollars on a staff based in kenya , which is deemed a much safer place to work , instead of investing those resources in somalia but many say that argument rings hollow security in somalia does not depend on foreign troops or foreign aid at least , it never has in the early 1990s , the united states and the united nations poured hundreds of millions of dollars into stabilizing somalia and they failed notoriously , leaving the country as capriciously violent and hopeless as ever then along came the islamists , who during their sixmonth reign last year pacified the hornet s nest of mogadishu by persuading clans to voluntarily disarm their militias and persuading somalis , most of whom are sunni muslims , to buy into their islamistheanswer solution one western diplomat laughed when asked if a modest force of peacekeepers the african union is proposing around 8 , 000 could deliver the level of stability that the islamists had delivered on their own no way , he said , speaking anonymously under diplomatic rules and the government s urgency for peacekeepers shows you just how badly they 've done with reconciliation
there are few things more fleeting than being one of brett favre s favorite receivers favre , the packers' quarterback , is known for his fickle nature , and one of the current beneficiaries of his attention is donald lee , the team s fifthyear tight end that relationship should continue sunday against the rams , who are ranked 15th in pass defense lee has been favre s favorite receiver underneath coverage and near the end zone he has four receiving touchdowns in his past five games he had one of his best games of the season last week against the raiders , with four catches for 71 yards and a touchdown lee has already had career highs in every major category with three games remaining in the regular season having regularly served as a scapegoat for the giants during his time with the team , placekicker jay feely has been something of a bright spot for the winless dolphins this season feely has converted 17 of his 19 fieldgoal attempts , including a seasonlong 53yarder against the jets he has also made all 22 extra points but in keeping with the theory that everyone has to fail for a team to lose every game in a season , his miss against the giants in week 8 was the difference between a loss and a tie in regulation feely could have an opportunity to make a big difference in sunday s game the ravens have allowed 32 field goals , the most in the league the raiders have announced that josh mccown will start at quarterback sunday , and that the rookie jamarcus russell will receive some playing time none of that should matter against a colts secondary that has truly sparkled this season the colts , ranked no 1 in the nfl against the pass and no 2 in overall defense , have quietly been a dominant team , intercepting 19 passes while allowing 13 touchdown passes they are second in the league behind the patriots with 16 more takeaways than turnovers the raiders , behind quarterbacks daunte culpepper , mccown and russell , have turned the ball over 29 times and will probably add to that number today
their images are permanently etched in photographs after the fall of the world trade center towers , mayor and firefighters cloaked in the same gray dust for months afterward , they stood together at funerals mr giuliani , in his eulogy , always asked for a round of applause to celebrate the dead firefighter s life it would be easy to assume , then , that mr giuliani can count on the support of the 11 , 000 men and women of the new york city fire department as he runs for president but that would not be entirely true interviews with more than 50 firefighters and department officers show a mix of admiration and disdain for the former mayor many firefighters praise his years in office , citing his success in reducing crime and his leadership after the terrorist attacks others harbor a resentment for what they describe as his poor treatment of the department before and after sept 11 some still speak bitterly about a contract that left firefighters without a raise for two years some also say mr giuliani has exaggerated the role he played after the terrorist attacks , casting himself as a hero for political gain the harshest sentiments stem from mr giuliani s decision nearly two months after 9 11 to reduce the number of firefighters who were allowed to search for colleagues in the rubble a move that he partially reversed but that still infuriates many firefighters as his candidacy proceeds , mr giuliani s work on and after sept 11 , his greatest strength in the eyes of many voters , will be scrutinized the firefighters' interviews indicate that in new york , at least , a critical evaluation has begun i think they assume that we all love him , said robert keys , 48 , a battalion chief and 25year department veteran , referring to people outside new york he wound up with this america s mayor' image those of us who had to deal with him before and after 9 11 do n't share that same sentiment daniel mccarthy , a 54yearold firefighter , said mr giuliani should be judged on more than just his relationship with firefighters maybe he was n't great for the fire department , mr mccarthy said but he was great for the city on the campaign trail , mr giuliani frequently invokes the sept 11 heroism of my firefighters , as he often calls them , as emblematic of american patriotism and resolve but some firefighters have begun organizing efforts to dispel the notion that they are in his corner the international association of fire fighters , an umbrella union based in washington , spoke out against mr giuliani in march the group is also preparing a short dvd outlining its grievances that it plans to send to fire departments across the country meanwhile , a small group of sept 11 family members and firefighters has been protesting outside many of mr giuliani s campaign appearances one of those protesters , deputy chief jim riches , who lost his firefighter son that day , said mr giuliani did nothing on sept 11 to warrant hero status he s making a million dollars a month with his speeches , said chief riches , 55 it s blood money officials with another union , the uniformed fire officers association , said they planned to work against mr giuliani s campaign i do n't think the person in nebraska has any idea yet how we feel , said john j mcdonnell , a battalion chief and president of the association he probably assumes that we think he s great historically , the new york city firefighters unions have backed presidential candidates from both parties the international association of fire fighters and the uniformed fire officers association have endorsed democratic candidates for president in recent elections , but the union for rankandfile firefighters , the uniformed firefighters association , endorsed president bush in 2004 and both the fire officers and the firefighters unions endorsed mr giuliani for reelection in 1997 there is one group supporting mr giuliani called firefighters 4 rudy but the retired fire captain and talkradio host who runs it , matt bruce , 59 , lives in florida and worked in oswego in central new york , not in new york city mr giuliani s supporters credit the former mayor with bringing new york back to something approaching normalcy after the attacks they also applaud his attendance at the funerals , which continued after his term ended in january 2002 even after he left , he 'd go to funerals , said chief michael mcgrath , who added that mr giuliani had a right to trumpet his role after the sept 11 attacks he never ran anything but the city , a city that was attacked , he said what do you think he s going to talk about \? some firefighters said that while they believed that mr giuliani shortchanged the fire department in failing to give raises to firefighters in 1995 and '96 , what he did for the city as a whole was more important lt thomas farragher , 52 , with ladder 175 in east new york , said , there s more to this country than the fire department i have kids i'm more worried about that than getting a couple dollars more other favorable opinions of mr giuliani are based on simple encounters one firefighter recalled that the former mayor handed him a bottle of water at the scene of a fire i 'll never forget that , he said another firefighter , john orlando , 36 , said he regularly saw mr giuliani at fires he was always showing up , he said i turn around , and there s the mayor among those firefighters who criticized mr giuliani , almost every one of them said they were still angry about the mayor s decision several weeks after the attacks to reduce the number of firefighters allowed to search for remains at ground zero , where 343 firefighters died until mr giuliani intervened , the fire department was in control of the site , searching first for survivors , then for bodies mayor giuliani , heeding the advice of safety experts , would allow no more than 25 firefighters on the site that was far fewer than in the weeks immediately following the attacks loose girders and construction equipment that was constantly on the move posed a danger to the firefighters , the giuliani administration said and thousands of firefighters who had worked at the site had already been treated for chronic chest pain and coughing all of us standing here have friends that continue to remain there , mr giuliani said at the time and we would love to recover them but none of us standing here can possibly justify seeing a human being die in this effort if it is n't handled with great discipline and great responsibility the reduced contingent continued to search for bodies but firefighters felt , in their words , that he had shut down the pile emotions simmered , and on nov 2 , a group of firefighters scuffled with police officers who were blocking access to the site after that incident , the policy was relaxed to allow fire company members to escort the remains of their colleagues from ground zero but the anger lingered i think that was the beginning of a jobwide sense that the guy might not be the greatest guy in the world , said lt simon ressner , 47 he treated firemen like they were common criminals , chief keys said he did not get good advice there was no one there who would dare tell him no people forget about the details chief riches agreed we were finding bodies the week before that , he said the bodies did n't disintegrate he just wanted to scoop them up , dump them in a truck and get out of there meanwhile , chief riches added , i'm down there on my hands and knees , looking for my son and other firemen firefighters who support mr giuliani expressed discomfort discussing ground zero and the interruption in the recovery of bodies even though some said they disagreed with their colleagues who found mr giuliani s actions to be unforgivable , they were hesitant to say so i ca n't knock them for that , said firefighter mccarthy , who lost several friends god , it s their loved ones under there another firefighter , kenneth haskell , 37 , lost two brothers , both fellow firefighters , on sept 11 , but he supported mr giuliani s decision to scale back the firefighters' presence at ground zero the site became a very dangerous area , firefighter haskell said , recalling the day a cable snapped and dropped from a crane there was a point where the city needed to move forward he also praised the city s decision to continue paying the salaries of the dead firefighters , at overtime rates , long after sept 11 beyond ground zero , many firefighters cited lingering frustration over the double zeros the contract in which the first two years , 1995 and 1996 , brought no raises if he would have given us a halfpercent raise with a retroactive check for 3275 , we would have loved him for it , said lt thomas mcgoff , 54 some firefighters said that once their opinions of mr giuliani had soured , they found his frequent appearances at 9 11 funerals hard to take john walsh , 48 , a firefighter for 21 years , said he had supported mr giuliani early in his tenure he s been riding our coattails since 9 11 like he did something , firefighter walsh said he did nothing he showed up to funerals so what \? he s a selfpromoter i told my wife , anything that ever happens , i do n't want him at my funeral' but lieutenant farragher said he believed that mr giuliani was being sincere when he appeared at a firefighter s funeral on his last day in office that just struck me , he said he was n't looking for press
east rutherford , nj , march 20 even though are in the hunt for a playoff spot partly because of the futility of other teams they are missing a foundation upon which they can build some postseason swagger they have little to boast about , like lengthy winning streaks or victories against toptier competition the nets lost to the , 9490 , on tuesday night at continental arena , missing yet another opportunity to defeat a formidable opponent the nets \( 3137 \) are 32 in their last five games , but none of those victories have come against a highcaliber team the nuggets \( 3431 \) won their fifth game in a row , led by forward carmelo anthony , who overcame foul trouble to score 30 points what may be most frustrating for the nets is that while their defense seems to be gaining traction , their shooting has been their undoing tuesday night s game resembled the nets' contest last thursday against the miami heat , which the nets lost when too many of their shots rimmed out the nets held the nuggets to more than 11 points below their season average , and denver won a game for the first time this season without scoring at least 100 points it s a little frustrating because we 've been doing the right thing , said nets forward bostjan nachbar , who scored only 4 points and missed all four of his 3point attempts it s not like we 're lacking effort or making the wrong plays or the wrong decisions the nets' three stars each missed a crucial 3pointer late in the game after , who led the nets with 29 points , dunked to cut the nets' deficit to 9088 , richard jefferson \( 18 points and 5 rebounds \) and jason kidd \( 5 points , 7 rebounds and 5 assists \) missed open 3point shots on consecutive possessions shortly after kidd s miss , anthony bullied his way to the basket for a layup and a foul his free throw gave the nuggets a 9388 lead with 1 minute 38 seconds remaining the nets' biggest miss came with just under 10 seconds remaining , when carter was off target on a wideopen 3point attempt that would have tied the score at 9393 the nuggets' allen iverson , who scored 20 points , then made one of two free throws for denver s final point the nets made only 3 of 19 3pointers for the game maybe i needed a hand in my face , carter said i do n't know i think what bothered me more is i actually took my time and shot a good shot i did n't rush it everything was like i was in the gym by myself that s the ones i take to heart the nuggets , and anthony , asserted themselves in the third quarter with a 234 run that turned a 6point deficit into a 13point lead during their run , the nuggets held the nets to only one field goal over a span of nearly eight minutes the nets missed eight shots in a row and turned the ball over four times as they watched anthony return from an abbreviated first half to lead his team the nuggets shot 15 free throws in the third quarter and 32 for the game in the third quarter , we put ourselves in a big deficit in that we put them on the freethrow line and our inability to score , nets coach lawrence frank said defensively , we did a good enough job just on the offensive end , we fell a little bit short in that third quarter anthony , who entered the game in second place in the nba scoring race , with 298 points a game , went to the bench for the final 7 47 of the first half after picking up his third foul he had scored the nuggets' first 8 points of the game , and he had 10 points in the first half in just under 10 minutes of play anthony said he told his coaches at halftime that he owed them a half i tried to come back and be a little bit aggressive , he said i think in the second half we got into the open court and played some defense and pulled it out in the end rebounds kenyon martin , the former nets power forward who now plays for the nuggets , visited his former teammates in their locker room before tuesday s game and reminisced about old times me , j , r j , twin and kerry were standing there , and i was like , yeah , the whole starting five right here , ' martin said it brings back memories he was referring to the lineup of himself , jason kidd , richard jefferson , jason collins and kerry kittles , part of the team that made consecutive nba finals appearances in 2002 and 2003
san diego , july 17 thought he had eluded the tag he flung his arms in the air he glared at the umpire he stomped around first base it was only the third inning , and television replays showed that he was indeed out , but hern ndez had proven his point he is not a man to be trifled with , and beware all those who cross his path when he is enraged at the plate , he singled , stole a base and scored a run on the mound , he limited the to two hits in seven scoreless innings the received a few other welcome contributions in their 70 victory tuesday night at petco park , but none had the style points of hern ndez he had that certain look in his eye where you knew he was going to buckle down , paul lo duca said behind him , the mets played their most complete game in weeks on orders from their new hitting coach , howard johnson , some selected mets , including the struggling carlos beltr n , jos valentin and lo duca , took extra batting practice about four and a half hours before the game the results , they said , were purely coincidental , but indicative of the team s overall approach beltr n went 2 for 4 , scored a run and drove one in valentin also scored a run and drove one in and lo duca knocked in the allimportant first run off padres ace jake peavy with a fourthinning single and another one in the ninth they worked deep counts , delivered clutch hits and grinded out eight walks it sounds so simplistic , but people do n't think that it s glamorous to walk , randolph said i think it s very glamorous i think it s very sexy , actually johnson s predecessor , rick down , shied away from holding extra batting practice this season , but it is standard practice for many teams on the road , particularly for players who do not often start but beltr n plays every day and except for a few hot streaks , he has not hit particularly well after batting a teambest 356 in april , beltr n entered tuesday s game batting 213 \( 52 for 244 \) since may 1 according to stats llc , only four regular starters boston s julio lugo , atlanta s andruw jones , san diego s marcus giles and minnesota s nick punto have lower averages during that time his average , which increased a few points to 258 , was in danger of being surpassed soon by delgado s \( 248 \) , which seems unfathomable in a year in which he ranked among the leading votegetters for the allstar game , starting in center field for the national league , the essence of this season is that beltr n has been slumping for the past two and a half months he has to be in charge of his atbats , johnson said he has to not be so reactive and more proactive in being aggressive in the strike zone and understanding what he wants to do when he gets in the box in his first atbat off peavy , who entered the night with the secondlowest earned run average \( 219 \) among national league starters , beltr n ripped a grounder that smacked first base and skipped over adrian gonzalez s head and into right field for a double he was stranded there when brian giles made a sensational catch on david wright s deep fly to right , but he was at the center of their fourth and fifthinning rallies beltr n led off the fourth with a walk and scored on lo duca s twoout single the last time i had a twoout rbi single was 2005 , it seems like , lo duca said beltr n shared the spotlight in the fifth with hern ndez , who poked a leadoff single to center and , on a 32 count to jos reyes , bolted for second hern ndez stole second base last thursday against cincinnati and manager willie randolph acted like he had seen it many times before once may have been an anomaly twice is a trend hern ndez caught peavy off guard and , despite not getting that good jump , stole second rather easily , making him the first pitcher in franchise history to steal two bases in one season since tom seaver in 1967 if you do n't pay attention to him , it is almost insulting to him , randolph said with one out , valentin ripped a single to center , sending hern ndez huffing and puffing home from second , and beltr n followed by going with an outside pitch and lining a double inside the thirdbase bag valentin scored , extending the mets' lead to 30 i feel good , beltr n said i just feel good before the game , televisions in the padres' clubhouse showed a loop of hern ndez s last start , but only a few pitchers were around to see it perhaps they could have forewarned peavy about hern ndez s newfound penchant for stealing and the starting lineup about his formula for success hern ndez threw only two changeups , lo duca estimated , and relied heavily on his curveball only gonzalez \( two doubles \) could solve hern ndez , who allowed two walks one intentional while striking out four over his final three innings , hern ndez allowed only one base runner , on a fifthinning walk by peavy , and needed nine pitches to retire the padres in order in the sixth and only six in the seventh he did not come out to pitch the eighth with a 30 lead , a single , a run and a stolen base to his credit , there was not much left for hern ndez to accomplish i did everything in my hands to win the ballgame , hern ndez said inside pitch the mets recalled chip ambres from class aaa new orleans to replace damion easley , who was placed on the bereavement list to be with his ailing father easley can be activated no earlier than friday and no later than july 25 ambres , a 27yearold outfielder who played 53 games for kansas city in 2005 , was batting 272 with 16 homers and 49 runs batted in for new orleans moises alou played another game for the mets' rookie league team in port st lucie , fla alou again served as the designated hitter , going 0 for 2 and was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded

augusta , ga , needing an eagle 3 to climb into contention in the , had crushed a driver off the tee of the doglegleft , 510yard 13th hole , and now he knew that his iron shot would land far behind the flagstick perched near the front of the green and whether his listeners were in the gallery or watching on television , he was heard to yell god , bite ! god must have been listening yesterday instead of his ball staying on the ridge that runs through the green , it slowly slid down and down and down the slope until it stopped about 5 feet from the cup when his putt disappeared for the eagle 3 that he had needed , woods had moved to three over par for the tournament , two strokes behind zach johnson with five holes remaining but after that , god apparently turned off his earpiece woods did not make so much as another birdie , and johnson , shooting a threeunderpar 69 , won by two strokes over woods and two south africans , retief goosen and rory sabbatini water , wind and missed birdie putts on the 14th and 16th holes ended woods s opportunity to win his fifth masters and third consecutive major title after having dominated last year s british open at royal liverpool and the pga championship at medinah outside chicago on the 530yard 15th hole , his iron out of the rough bounced backward off the slope into the pond in front of the green , but he saved par with a 10foot putt on the 440yard 17th , his approach plopped into the bunker in front of the green what the hell just happened \? he barked , turning toward his caddie , steve williams dead downwind to tie johnson at one over , woods had needed to birdie the last two holes but after blasting out of the bunker , he made a parsaving 10foot putt needing an eagle 2 on the 465yard final hole to force a playoff with johnson , his approach stopped about 25 feet from the hole but over the four rounds , he had made only one birdie on the last two holes \( during friday s third round \) while scratching out four bogeys i threw this tournament away on two days when i had two good rounds and i went bogeybogey at the end , he said later , referring to his 55 finish both thursday and saturday four bogeys in the last two holes basically cost me the tournament woods s game was simply not as razor sharp as usual , not nearly as sharp as it was in his four masters triumphs and nowhere as sharp as it was at royal liverpool at last year s british open , when he controlled the flight of his ball as well as he ever had , often using a fairway wood or a long iron off the tee he had not been sharp going into the masters , beginning with a thirdround knockout by australia s nick o'hern in the accenture match play championship , when he missed a winning 4foot putt on the first extra hole and lost on the next hole , and continuing with a tie for 22nd at the arnold palmer invitational at bay hill , where he closed with a 76  even though woods won the ca championship two weeks ago , he was so insecure with a threestroke lead that he hit an iron off the tee on doral s treacherous 18th hole and played safely for a winning bogey at the masters , he never broke par he opened with a oneover 73 , then shot 747272 for 291 , three over par he never appeared to be comfortable with his swing or with his putter after he pushed a tee shot into the trees on the 11th hole yesterday , his followthrough with a 4iron slammed into a pine , bending the shaft he snapped it in two woods had talked how the secret to scoring here was to avoid double bogeys or threeputt greens he never had a double bogey , but he had 15 bogeys , including six on friday  on a warmer and less windy day yesterday , after saturday s frosty gusts had dropped the wind chill to a record low of 42 for the masters , scores were lower johnson , goosen and sabbatini each shot 69 the pin locations were a little bit softer , woods said they were probably two or three steps from where they usually are , so they gave us a break , which was nice gave us a chance to go out there and score for woods , they were rare scores none in the 60s in winning his 12 majors , he shot all four rounds in the 60s in two , three rounds in the 60s in five and two rounds in the 60s in five but with 12 victories in his first 41 majors as a pro , woods remains well ahead of jack nicklaus s pace in winning a record 18 majors nicklaus won his 12th in his 48th major , the 1974 pga championship but without another green jacket , woods lost any chance for a grand slam this year and his two bogeybogey finishes that cost him this masters were a reminder that the game does n't let you win all the time even if you 're tiger woods

two consecutive life terms since their convictions , the five have been on a legal roller coaster in august 2005 , a threejudge federal appellate panel in atlanta threw out the verdicts , saying the defendants could not receive a fair jury trial in miami because of anticastro bias among the exiles two months later , a majority of the 11th circuit reinstated the convictions but agreed to hear an appeal on the sufficiency of the evidence , among other issues meanwhile , the five heroes have become the biggest propaganda tool that the oneparty , communist government of cuba has come up with since che guevara their names and faces appear on walls and signs all over cuba , with the word volver n , meaning they will return cuban officials never fail to mention them as heroes in official speeches and ceremonies one reason for their popularity is the government s simplified version of their ordeal brave men who tried to ferret out rightwing terrorists determined to hurt cuba while sheltered in the united states that approach carries the message that washington is hypocritical in its war on terror , jailing the five for the equivalent of trying to find osama bin laden in his presumed haven of pakistan that argument has become even more persuasive to cubans since may , when luis posada carriles was released from jail in the united states the cuban government has long accused mr posada carriles , now 79 , of plotting to assassinate mr castro and says he masterminded the 1976 bombing of a cuban airliner , which killed 73 people , and a string of bombings of havana hotels and nightclubs in 1997 efforts to extradite him to venezuela , where he is also wanted in the jetliner bombing , have failed i am convinced they are real heroes , said an accountant who , like many cubans , preferred to remain anonymous to avoid possible harassment from the police any person who is against terrorism has to be for them and the government of the united states is very unjust to have them locked up while posada carriles is free even 13yearolds here follow the government s argument they are like brothers to us , said lizbet martin , a schoolgirl they should n't be jailed in a recent interview with the bbc , mr hern ndez acknowledged he was gathering information about what he described as paramilitary groups determined to topple the cuban government he maintained that the cuban government informed the federal bureau of investigation about the groups they are people who 've got training camps there in paramilitary organizations and they go to cuba and commit sabotage , bombs and all kinds of aggressions , he told the bbc and they had impunity , so at a certain point cuba decided to send some people to gather information on those groups and send it back to cuba to prevent those actions but mr hern ndez denies vehemently that he helped the cuban air force shoot down the two exile planes they needed to blame somebody , and they chose me , he said alicia valle , a spokeswoman for the united states attorney s office in miami , declined to comment on the case according to court documents , the united states government agreed that the five had spied on anticastro groups like brothers to the rescue and movimiento democratico but the united states government maintained that they were welltrained spies , not amateurs , involved in a range of espionage , and that none of them informed the government of their presence , as federal law requires , court documents show the case of the cuban five has spawned some strange commentary highranking officials in the cuban government , which regularly jails people without public trial for speaking out against communism , talk at length and in detail about the lack of evidence in the case , and they rail about the lack of due process in american courts in a recent interview , ricardo alarc n , the president of cuba s national assembly , said the men s sentences were excessive in comparison with other spy convictions and insisted they were not seeking information about the united states government he noted that in july a former fbi analyst , leandro aragoncillo , had received only 10 years for passing top secret documents to the philippine government the families , too , have become celebrities , if to a lesser degree they are asked to appear at all sorts of state affairs in one week in july , family members attended a graduation of cuban doctors and the annual national rebellion day celebration speakers at each event tipped their hats to the families , calling the jailed men heroes but after the hoopla , back at home , some said , they must face the task of raising children without fathers and living without husbands it has turned my life upside down , said olga salanueva , the wife of ren gonz lez , who was a pilot at an airport where one of the exile groups kept airplanes no one is prepared to live so separated from her husband and to see a person so humane , so noble , suffer again and again she added we do n't have much confidence in the justice system of north america we know it is very difficult , because it has become a political matter ms salanueva said that the united states had repeatedly denied her a visa to visit her husband on the grounds that she was deported in 2000 and under current rules can never apply for a visa again adriana p rez , the wife of gerardo gonz lez , has also been turned down every year for a visa to visit him state department officials declined to comment on the women s visa applications elizabeth palmeiro , the wife of mr laba ino , said she feels pained every time she looks at their two daughters , now 15 and 10 , and realizes how much of their lives he has missed one girl was an infant and the other was 5 when he was imprisoned i feel a mixture of pain , of sadness , of fury , and pride , she said
foreign policy isn t my specialty , but before the iraq war began i wrote a column cautiously endorsing it on the basis of what i knew at that time there was no pressure on me to say anything on the subject , and i could easily have waited to see how the war turned out before offering an opinion but that seemed cowardly given the importance of the issue , i felt that all opinion leaders had a responsibility to state their views beforehand and not pretend to have always been on the side that history eventually endorses i was strongly influenced by reports of weapons of mass destruction that later turned out to be false although i was in no position to evaluate the validity of these reports , there were many experts who deemed them credible furthermore , saddam hussein s actions in denying united nations inspectors access to potential locations for wmd s strongly supported the existence of such weapons i finally concluded that if your mortal enemy is pointing a gun at you , you are not obliged to check to make sure that the gun is loaded before defending yourself it was on this basis that i thought the war just barely passed the threshold of legitimacy this doesn t mean i would have gone to war if the decision had been mine , only that i was willing to give president bush the benefit of a doubt by august 2003 , i warned that the iraq invasion was looking more like a war for empire than selfdefense i finally denounced the war in an april 2004 column and expressed dismay that the administration s justification for it had shifted from wmd s which had been a reasonable , if incorrect , basis for war to liberating the iraqi people if bush had from the beginning justified the war only on grounds of liberation , there would have been no war because there would have been close to zero support for it this still leaves the question of what to do now that we are in iraq just because the war was wrong in the first place doesn t necessarily justify an immediate pullout there is danger this could make a bad situation worse , might embolden our enemies and invite new attacks that is why i have hesitated calling for disengagement but i have come to the conclusion that the situation could not be any worse and that the american presence in iraq is causing as much conflict as it is preventing therefore , i think we should disengage as rapidly as possible adding additional troops , as bush plans to do , simply means throwing good money after bad perhaps if bush still had any credibility , i would be willing to give him the benefit of a doubt , as i did four years ago but since then , we have learned how incredibly poor the prewar intelligence was , how bush essentially bullied intelligence analysts into giving him the reports he wanted , and how he undertook the war with insufficient forces and without giving any thought to postwar planning or an exit strategy at this point , it is obvious even to bush that the status quo is untenable , and he has put the last of his chips on the table to try to salvage something he can call a victory but there still is no realistic plan for achieving it or even a definition of victory in the context of iraq consequently , i don t see how this troop surge can possibly succeed all it will do is put off the inevitable pullout by another year or more , which means that hundreds more of our fighting men and women will die in vain i think bush should have the courage to do what ronald reagan did in lebanon reagan sent american troops into that country as part of a multinational peacekeeping force in 1982 but after the situation continued to deteriorate and , in october of 1983 , 241 marines were killed when a truck loaded with explosives blew up outside their barracks , reagan pulled out at the peak of the cold war , this was a very hard thing for reagan to do he knew it would show weakness and undermine his position in dealing with the soviet union but he realized , as bush does not , that you cannot undo a mistake by continuing to make it all you can do is stop making the mistake , cut your losses and move on about a year ago , i was on chris matthews s television show , and he asked whether i thought reagan would have gone into iraq not having thought about it ahead of time , i gave a poor answer i said that i believed he would have if he thought iraq had wmd s i now realize that my answer was wrong i don t think reagan would have invaded iraq i think he would have been far more careful than bush was to make sure the intelligence was right the debate among reagan s advisers would have been much more open , with those opposed to invasion getting a fairer hearing also , he would have been much more careful to make sure that we had in place a realistic plan for victory , sufficient forces to do the job , a detailed postwar blueprint , and a clear exit strategy , none of which we have had in iraq more important , i think reagan would have gone much further than bush did to exhaust all means of dealing with hussein before even considering going to war reagan would have been far more aggressive about using diplomacy backed up by sanctions and air power rather than put american troops in harm s way , reagan would have opted for a surgical strike against hussein , such as the one he attempted against muammar elqaddafi of libya in 1986 as he did in nicaragua and afghanistan , reagan would have aided those iraqis opposed to hussein and allowed them to do the fighting on the ground i don t think there is any chance that reagan would have supported a fullscale military invasion it s too late to undo the damage caused by this illconceived war but at least we can stop doing more damage to iraq and ourselves i hope congress finds a way to force bush to face reality and end the iraq operation as quickly as possible
koudjiwai , the small plane flew in low over a scorched , peppercorn scrubland , following a broad , muddy river that was all elbows on its run to the southeast the first hint of humanity came with the appearance of an immense grid for seismic testing , laboriously traced through the brush finally , a lonely , hulking steel drilling platform popped into view chad is as geographically isolated as places come in africa it is also among the continent s poorest and least stable countries , the scene of recurrent civil wars and foreign invasions since it gained independence from france in 1960 none of that has put off the chinese , though in january , they bought the rights to a vast exploration zone that surrounds this rural village , making the baked wilderness here , without roads , electricity or telephones , the latest frontier for their thirsty oil industry and increasingly global ambitions the same is happening in one african country after another in large oilexporting countries like angola and nigeria , china is building or fixing railroads , and landing giant exploration contracts in congo and guinea in mineralrich countries that had been all but abandoned by foreign investors because of unrest and corruption , chinese companies are reviving output of cobalt and bauxite china has even become the new mover and shaker in agricultural countries like ivory coast , once the crown jewel in france s postcolonial african empire , where chinese companies are building a new capital , in yamoussoukro , paid for by chinese loans surging chinese interest in this continent has helped bring about what many africans believe is the most important moment since the end of the cold war , when democracy was spreading in africa and western nations spoke of a peace dividend that might ease african poverty that blush of interest in africa quickly faded , though , as did several of the new democracies , and africans and westerners have regarded each other warily ever since westerners complain about chronic corruption and ineffective government , while africans lament broken promises on aid and a hostile international economic system the chinese have stepped into this picture , coming to struggling countries like chad with deep pockets , fewer demands on how african governments should behave and an avowed faith in everyone s ability to prosper as beijing s ambassador to this country , wang yingwu , said at his residence in ndjamena , chad s capital , where the electricity repeatedly failed , we are exempting chadian goods from import duties when the interviewer noted that chad produced almost nothing besides oil , mr wang was undaunted , saying , if they do n't produce things today , they will tomorrow to help make that happen , china plans to build the country s first oil refinery , lay new roads , provide irrigation and erect a mobile telephone network , for starters with such intensive efforts across the continent , china s trade with africa topped 55 billion in 2006 , up from less than 10 million in the 1980s to achieve this growth , it has bypassed multinational institutions like the and the international monetary fund and flouted many of their lending criteria , including minimum standards of transparency , open bidding for contracts , environmental impact studies and assessments of overall debt and fiscal policies in some ways , the new chinese model of doing business in africa is a throwback to an earlier era of western involvement that is now widely seen as disastrous in that era , borrowing countries typically had to work with companies from the lending nation , limiting competition and giving priority to business over development today , china takes things even further , signing longterm deals for rights to natural resources that allow countries otherwise unworthy of credit to repay their debt in oil or mineral output in what manner has africa progressed , in what sector \? said the chadian president , idriss d by , referring to decades of close ties to the west whatever the good will of africa s old friends and the old partners in its development , it has not progressed at all still , major doubts hang heavily in the air will china s hunger for raw materials enable this continent to take off \? or will beijing s willingness to spend whatever it needs in africa , without regard to fiscal prudence , democracy , honest business practices and human rights , produce a replay of booms past , enriching local elites but leaving the continent poorer , its environment despoiled and its natural resources depleted \? there are few better places than chad to watch for signs of how china s african gambit will pay off chad ranks just four places from the bottom on the united nations scale of human development , yet it is emerging as a critical piece in china s economic push in a broad swath of subsaharan africa , beginning with sudan and extending in virtually every direction despite advanced prospecting by french and other western firms dating back to the 1970s , chad s oil had never been tapped the nation was simply too unstable and the price of oil too low to justify investing much here the oil that had been found was of low quality , and there was no practical way to get it out that changed in 2000 , when the world bank agreed to help finance a 42 billion , 665mile pipeline connecting chad to cameroon on the condition that oil revenues be used to fight poverty chad s revenues quickly outstripped expectations , but have not gone into quelling its immense poverty mismanagement and fraud have beset the world bank plan from the start beyond that , chadian rebels with bases in sudan have been trying to depose mr d by , so he pressed the world bank to relax its rules on how to spend the country s oil money a compromise was reached , and he went on a military spending spree , buying guns , aircraft and armored vehicles for his troops , along with a fleet of armored humvees that stop traffic as they zoom about ndjamena s dusty , potholed streets seeking an even freer hand with the country s oil bonanza , mr d by s government also hinted that it could find other partners willing to invest in chad , especially with the price of oil so high then , in 2006 , chad ended a relationship with taiwan and recognized mainland china , and the floodgates opened china bought the rights to several oil exploration zones in the country from a canadian company and has gone from bit player to center stage in chad s affairs , confident that it can wring smart profits from the most inhospitable conditions the canadians and the americans are only interested in really big finds , said a veteran western oil production engineer who works under contract here for the china national petroleum company , the cnpc anything else they think is not worth their time the chinese have a different approach they are happy with the smaller finds , just lots of them they seem to have a different time frame , too , the engineer added they plan to be here for a while indeed , the chinese dream in this region consists of making finds here and there , using the world bank financed pipeline to transport the oil and eventually building new pipelines to connect with a chinesebuilt grid in sudan this vision requires not only finding more oil , but establishing peace between chad and sudan darfur , the chaotic western sudanese region where at least 200 , 000 people have died and 25 million been displaced in a governmentbacked counterinsurgency campaign , lies next to china s exploration zones human rights groups maintain that chinese weapons have played a major role in the carnage in darfur beijing s recent diplomatic activity in the region may be explained by these chinese oil interests as much as by american pressure on china to help stop the killing in darfur it used to be that when we had problems with our neighbor sending mercenaries to invade us that none of our complaints before the united nations would pass , because china blocked them , said president d by since breaking relations with taiwan and opening the door to chinese investment , he added , we have been able to raise our concerns without taboo one topic that neither side was willing to say much about was the world bank s foundering efforts to ensure that petroleum revenues were well spent here i know the current pipeline is part of a project involving the world bank and esso , said dou lirong , the general manager of cnpc international in chad , calling the authority over revenues a very complicated matter i do n't know too much about it , mr dou continued , but i 've read a little bit on the web in fact , the very idea of the world bank project is anathema to china s deeply held noninterference policy , which has for decades governed china s foreign policy and development underlying both is a kind of golden rule china considers other countries meddling in its affairs unacceptable , and it assumes its friends feel the same way cao zhongming , deputy director of the department of african affairs , in the chinese foreign ministry said china wo n't interfere with chad s internal affairs as a policy , that does n't change if cnpc , world bank and chad reach an agreement , it s between them but , he added , if chad does not accept the world bank arrangement , neither cnpc or the chinese government would impose it the chinese government , he said , wo n't enforce something that chad thinks interferes with their internal affairs to china s new african allies , this notion is a breath of fresh air after years of hewing to the latest fads in international development doled out by the world bank , the international monetary fund , western donors and the united nations , african governments have grown weary of the strings attached to foreign aid th r se mekombe , vice chairwoman of the committee that monitors chad s oil money to make sure it is used properly , expressed surprise about the chinese executive s uncertainty about how oil revenues would be handled brandishing a copy of the law , she said all of the country s oil earnings fell under the control of the world bank arrangement the chinese need to understand that they cannot arrive in a country and just impose their way of thinking , ms mekombe said chinese officials almost invariably describe their relationship with african countries as a winwin based on mutual respect , aimed at joint prosperity and free of the overtones of exploitation and paternalism that critics worldwide say have governed much of the west s postcolonial relationship with africa china plans to build a petroleum refinery and a cement factory in chad , both desperately needed in a landlocked country forced to import basic goods indeed , lowering gas and cement prices , which are among the highest in africa , could do more to reduce poverty than the efforts of the world bank and other donors combined , mr dou suggested we can make a contribution to chad , he said asked for an example of what winwin relationships look like , mr dou offered what might seem an unlikely choice sudan in its capital , khartoum , he said , signs of china s impact are everywhere if you go to sudan , you see paved roads , he said in the past , the cars in sudan had no turn signals , they point directions by hand now there are many good cars asked whether the oil money was really benefiting the sudanese people , not just their rulers , mr dou replied it is difficult for me to say i am an engineer to some critics , the answer is clear china s nostringsattached approach is problematic , particularly if its effect , if not its intent , is to undermine others' efforts to change situations on the ground , said kenneth roth , executive director of human rights watch often what is happening , he added , is underwriting of repression even with binding arrangements governing the use of oil revenues , chad s people have largely missed out in the mayok bbi region , where much of china s feverish oil exploration is happening , the city of bongor hardly looks like the capital of the booming oil region it is set to become along its treefringed main avenue , the briskest business is preparing the city s signature dish a chicken so scrawny it can be grilled whole in a few minutes at the lone hospital , a moldering colonialera structure , a handful of workers tended to dozens of patients suffering from the classic ailments of poverty hunger , diarrhea , malaria , tuberculosis , , pneumonia civil servants were on strike , seeking to force the government , which according to world bank estimates will collect 12 billion in oil money this year , to increase their meager salaries pauline maratangou , a 53yearold midwife , did show up to work , and it was a good thing half a dozen pregnant women with bellies fit to burst patiently awaited her services vasy , vasy , vasy ! she cooed , urging an 18yearold mother to push the maternity ward had only a padded bench for deliveries and no stirrups the floors and walls were caked with dirt the orderlies were on strike ms maratangou worked with quick , efficient motions , pouring iodine over the crown of the baby s head as it emerged , trying to keep mother and child free of infection at last a little boy popped out , his head slightly misshapen , like a peanut shell ah , he s a handsome boy , she said , holding him aloft , feet first , waiting for his first bellowing cries there was only time to snip his umbilical cord , weigh him five and a half pounds , not too bad for this part of the world and swaddle him in rags before the next mother , also 18 , was ready to hop on the table still slick with afterbirth slime the grim conditions help explain why chad has among the highest maternal and infant mortality rates in the world one of every five children will die before age 5 we hear that our country has oil , but we see no evidence of it here , said ms maratangou , the midwife officials in bongor say money from chinese investments could fix schools and hospitals , or provide jobs and new roads under chadian law , 5 percent of the oil revenue is supposed to go back to the community where the oil was drilled we have very high hopes , said khalifa malloum , the secretary general of bongor s regional government if the west does not want to invest in us , let the chinese come we welcome them they do n't tell us what to do and they bring development they are good partners but limassou saleh , a community organizer in bongor , said he was deeply skeptical chad is maybe the most corrupt country in the world , mr saleh said we have a long history of human rights violations , of lack of transparency , of exploitation china has a reputation for corruption they are one of the worst human rights abusers they have no record of transparency what would we want with a country like that \? only to make our own problems worse
wimbledon , england with all the family williams trials and tribulations , along with venus s smashing triumph over maria sharapova and andy roddick s smooth advancement to the quarterfinals under the watchful eye of jimmy connors , another american tennis icon was heard from yesterday on the fourth of july it was the seventime champion , the yankee king of the grass courts speaking out from his retirement throne in los angeles more expert analysis from on the current state of wimbledon affairs made its way here via news agencies and the internet , days after he first complained about it in an interview with the times of london in summary , sampras does n't think much of the grasscourt tennis currently being played he does n't sound terribly convinced that he soon to turn 36 , five years after he walked away from tennis after winning his 14th grand slam title at the united states open could n't still get to the net against these guys , put away vintage pistol pete volleys these guys would include the fourtime defending champion , roger federer , whom sampras recalled sparring with in los angeles this year and , as he said tuesday during a conference call to promote world team tennis , holding serve pretty handily the sad problem , as sampras sees it , is that players have surrendered to the slower conditions , the stronger rackets , the fear of risk he has been watching federer hang on the baseline , toy with lesser players who wo n't dare push him the way boris becker and stefan edberg and goran ivanisevic and patrick rafter used to chip , charge and challenge sampras across the 1990s if there is anything roger does n't like to see , it is someone coming in and serving and volleying , someone putting pressure on him , sampras said i think my game matched up reasonably well against his we would love to hear federer s version and his opinion on their exhibitions scheduled for later this year sampras , with at least one foot grounded in reality , said he would be ecstatic if he could push him to a few tie breakers in due time , perhaps we do expect a federer sighting today for his quarterfinal match against juan carlos ferrero had sampras accepted the wild card that the all england club reportedly made available to him this year , he might have had all the time with federer he wanted , given federer s astonishing five days off to as roddick joked yesterday busy himself by taking the doubledecker bus red thing tour roddick was in a playful mood after erasing a 50 deficit in a thirdset tie breaker and finishing off paulhenri mathieu , 62 , 75 , 76 \( 6 \) but his demeanor noticeably chilled when sampras s comments were raised you got the feeling more from the tone than the words that roddick not only had read them but had also heard it all before to the point of wanting to say enough i agree that s the best way for him to win , yeah , he said but is it the best way for a lot of guys to win \? no you know , obviously you ca n't sit here and question pete s opinions on how to play grasscourt tennis but i do n't know if you can generalize it by saying that s the best way for everybody to play  the rumor mill has had sampras contemplating a return , if only to play wimbledon , where he was last seen losing in the second round to george bastl , the world s 145thranked player that was one year after sampras was beaten in the fourth round in five sets by a young and largely unknown swiss player in a short ponytail and white headband makes you wonder how sampras could possibly last that long with federer now lately , he has been beating up on a variety of retirees on the seniors tour and preparing for some team tennis , too could he be speaking out to convince himself that he really could fashion a proper wimbledon ending in an era when almost nobody plays the way he would \? when he was in boston playing the seniors tournament , he told us no , no , no , no , no , bud collins said when i began my investigative reporting by standing up from my desk and walking seven steps to the row behind mine in the media center , to seek the required counsel for tennis journalists it is collins s opinion that sampras will not try to rewrite the storybook ending he wrote when he beat his generational rival , andre agassi , at the 2002 open , his last tour match , and that his comments are just the kind of critiques not necessarily off target or unfair that champions from bygone eras tend to make it s all part of the fun and fabric of sports , and no one has ever stitched together so many tennis generations as a boston globe scribe and network analyst like collins , who , you may have heard by now , is being retired by nbc after this wimbledon  for 35 years , collins has worn the \( loud \) pants in that television tennis family , become the sport s voice of america , the welcoming franchise player for countless people like me , dropping in from time to time the decision not to have a place for a man who knows everything about a sport and who has devoted a lifetime to promoting it so eloquently reeks of the most profound corporate stupidity , and demands this last bit of commentary as i did some online research yesterday on sampras , i came across a wikipedia posting with highlights of his career the first paragraph reported that none other than collins had named sampras one of the top five men s players in history , which was good enough reason to come to the conclusion that sampras has every right to brag on his grasscourt era and nothing to prove by trying to play in this one he may want to know that collins , history s arbiter , has spoken
clarkston , ga , jan 20 early last summer the mayor of this small town east of atlanta issued a decree no more soccer in the town park there will be nothing but baseball down there as long as i am mayor , lee swaney , a retired owner of a heating and airconditioning business , told the local paper those fields were n't made for soccer in clarkston , soccer means something different than in most places as many as half the residents are refugees from wartorn countries around the world placed by resettlement agencies in a once mostly white town , they receive 90 days of assistance from the government and then are left to fend for themselves soccer is their game but to many longtime residents , soccer is a sign of unwanted change , as unfamiliar and threatening as the hijabs worn by the muslim women in town it s not football it s not baseball the fields were n't made for it mayor swaney even has a name for the sort of folks who play the game the soccer people caught in the middle is a boys soccer program called the fugees short for refugees , though most opponents guess the name refers to the hiphop band the fugees are indeed all refugees , from the most troubled corners afghanistan , bosnia , burundi , congo , gambia , iraq , kosovo , liberia , somalia and sudan some have endured unimaginable hardship to get here squalor in refugee camps , separation from siblings and parents one saw his father killed in their home the fugees , 9 to 17 years old , play on three teams divided by age their story is about children with miserable pasts trying to make good with strangers in a very different and sometimes hostile place but as a season with the youngest of the three teams revealed , it is also a story about the challenges facing resettled refugees in this country more than 900 , 000 have been admitted to the united states since 1993 , and their presence seems to bring out the best in some people and the worst in others the fugees' coach exemplifies the best a woman volunteering in a league where all the other coaches are men , some of them paid former professionals from europe , she spends as much time helping her players' families make new lives here as coaching soccer at the other extreme are some town residents , opposing players and even the parents of those players , at their worst hurling racial epithets and making it clear they resent the mostly african team in a region where passions run high on the subject of illegal , many are unaware or unconcerned that , as refugees , the fugees are here legally there are no gray areas with the fugees , said the coach , luma mufleh they trigger people s reactions on class , on race they speak with accents and do n't seem american a lot of people get shaken up by that the mayor s soccer ban has everything to do with why , on a scorching august afternoon , ms mufleh or coach luma , as she is known in the refugee community is holding tryouts for her under13 team on a rutted , sandscarred field behind an elementary school the boys at the tryouts wear none of the shiny apparel or expensive cleats common in american youth soccer one plays in anklehigh hiking boots , some in baggy jeans , another in his socks on the barren lot , every footfall and pivot produces a puff of chalky dust that hangs in the air like fog across town , the lush field in milam park sits empty ms mufleh blows her whistle listen up , she tells the panting and dusty boys i do n't care how well you play i care how hard you work every monday and wednesday , i'm going to have you from 5 to 8 the first half will be for homework and tutoring ms mufleh has arranged volunteers for that the second half will be for soccer , and for running lots of running if you miss a practice , you miss the next game , she tells the boys if you miss two games , you 're off the team the final roster will be posted on the bulletin board at the public library by 10 friday morning , she says do n't bother to call and one more thing she holds up a stack of paper , contracts she expects her players to sign if you ca n't live with this , she says , i do n't want you on this team hands black , brown , white reach for the paper as the boys read , eyes widen i will have good behavior on and off the field i will not smoke i will not do drugs i will not drink alcohol i will not get anyone pregnant i will not use bad language my hair will be shorter than coach s i will be on time i will listen to coach i will try hard i will ask for help i want to be part of the fugees ! until the refugees began arriving , the mayor likes to say , clarkston was just a sleepy little town by the railroad tracks since then , this town of 7 , 100 has become one of the most diverse communities in america clarkston high school now has students from more than 50 countries the local mosque draws more than 800 to friday prayers there is a hindu temple , and there are congregations of vietnamese , sudanese and liberian christians at the shopping center , american stores have been displaced by vietnamese , ethiopian and eritrean restaurants and a halal butcher the only hamburger joint in town , city burger , is run by an iraqi the transformation began in the late 1980s , when resettlement agencies , private groups that contract with the federal government , decided clarkston was perfect for refugees to begin new lives the town had an abundance of inexpensive apartments , vacated by middleclass whites who left for more affluent suburbs it had public transportation the town was the easternmost stop on the atlanta rail system and it was within commuting distance of downtown atlanta s booming economy , offering new arrivals at least the prospect of employment at first the refugees most from southeast asia arrived so slowly that residents barely noticed but as word got out about clarkston s suitability , more agencies began placing refugees here from 1996 to 2001 , more than 19 , 000 refugees from around the world resettled in georgia , many in clarkston and surrounding dekalb county , to the dismay of many longtime residents many of those residents simply left others stayed but remained resentful , keeping score of the ways they thought the refugees were altering their lives there were events that reinforced fears that clarkston was becoming unsafe a mentally ill sudanese boy beheaded his 5yearold cousin in their clarkston apartment a fire in a crowded apartment in town claimed the lives of four liberian refugee children at a town meeting in 2003 meant to foster understanding between the refugees and residents , the first question , submitted on an index card , was , what can we do to keep the refugees from coming to clarkston \? luma mufleh , 31 , says she was born to coach she grew up in amman , jordan , in a westernized family , and attended the american community school , for american and european expatriates and a few welltodo jordanians there , muslim girls were free to play sports as boys did , and women were permitted to coach her mentor was an american volleyball coach who demanded extreme loyalty and commitment ms mufleh picked up on a paradox though she claimed to dislike her coach , she wanted to play well for her for the majority of the time she coached me , i hated her , ms mufleh said but she had our respect until then , i 'd always played for me i 'd never played for a coach ms mufleh attended college in the united states , in part because she felt women here had more opportunities she went to smith college , and after graduation moved to atlanta she soon found her first coaching job , as head of a 12andunder girls soccer team through the local ymca on the field , ms mufleh emulated her volleyball coach , an approach that did not always sit well with american parents when she ordered her players to practice barefoot , to get a better feel for the soccer ball , a player s mother objected on the grounds that her daughter could injure her toes this is how i run my practice , ms mufleh told her if she s not going to do it , she s not going to play ms mufleh s first team lost every game but over time her methods paid off her players returned they got better in her third season , her team was undefeated when ms mufleh learned about the growing refugee community in clarkston , she floated the idea of starting a soccer program the ymca offered to back her with uniforms and equipment so in the summer of 2004 , ms mufleh made fliers announcing tryouts in arabic , english , french and vietnamese and distributed them around apartment complexes where the refugees lived for a coach hoping to build a soccer program in clarkston , the biggest challenge was not finding talented players there were plenty of those , boys who had learned the game in refugee camps in africa and in parking lots around town the difficulty was finding players who would show up many of the players come from singleparent families , with mothers or fathers who work hours that do not sync with sports schedules few refugee families own cars players would have to be selfsufficient on a june afternoon , 23 boys showed up for the tryouts from the beginning , the players were wary a local church offered a free basketball program for refugee children largely as a cover for missionary work others simply doubted that a woman could coach soccer she s a girl she does n't know what she s talking about , ms mufleh overheard a sudanese boy say at an early practice she ordered him to stand in the goal as the team watched , she blasted a shot directly at the boy , who dove out of the way anybody else \? she asked jeremiah ziaty , one of those early players , is a typical member of the fugees in 1997 , in the midst of liberia s 14 years of civil war , rebels led by charles taylor showed up one night at the ziatys' house in monrovia jeremiah s father was a lowlevel worker in a government payroll office the rebels thought he had money when they learned he did not , they killed him in the family s living room beatrice ziaty , jeremiah s mother , grabbed her sons and fled out the back door the ziatys trekked through the bush for a week until they reached a refugee camp in the ivory coast there , they lived in a mud hut and scavenged for food after five years in the camp , ms ziaty learned her family had been accepted for resettlement in clarkston , a town she had never heard of the united states committee for refugees and immigrants in washington estimates that there are now more than 12 million refugees worldwide and more than 20 million people displaced within their own nations' borders in 2005 , only 80 , 800 were accepted by other nations for resettlement , according to the united nations the ziatys' resettlement followed a familiar script the family was lent 3 , 016 for oneway airline tickets to the united states , which they repaid in three years after a twoday journey from abidjan , they were greeted in atlanta by a case worker from the international rescue committee , a resettlement organization she took them to an apartment in clarkston where the cupboard had been stocked with canned goods the case worker helped ms ziaty find a job , as a maid at the ritzcarlton hotel in the affluent buckhead section of atlanta , one that required an hour commute by bus while walking home from the bus stop after her first day , ms ziaty was mugged and her purse stolen terrified of her new surroundings , ms ziaty told her son jeremiah never to leave the house like any 8yearold , jeremiah bristled he especially wanted to play soccer through friends in the neighborhood , he heard about tryouts for the fugees when he tell me , mom , i go play soccer , ' i tell him he s too small , do n't go out of the house , ms ziaty recalled then he would start crying ms ziaty relaxed her rule when she met ms mufleh , who promised to take care of her son that was three years ago at age 11 , jeremiah is a leader of the 13andunder fugees , shifting among sweeper , center midfielder and center forward other members of the fugees also have harrowing stories qendrim bushi s muslim family fled kosovo when serbian soldiers torched his father s grocery store and threatened to kill them eldin subasic s uncle was shot in bosnia and so on the fugees , ms mufleh believed , shared something intense they knew trauma they knew the fear and loneliness of the newcomer this was their bond in order to get a group to work together , to be effective together , you have to find what is common , she said the refugee experience is pretty powerful ms mufleh made a point never to ask her players about their pasts on the soccer field , she felt , refugees should leave that behind occasionally , though , a boy would reveal a horrific memory one reported that he had been a child soldier when she expressed frustration that a liberian player tuned out during practice , another liberian told her she did n't understand the boy had been forced by soldiers to shoot his best friend it was learning to not react , ms mufleh said i just wanted to listen how do you respond when a kid says , i saw my dad shot in front of me' \? i did n't know as a jordanian in the deep south , ms mufleh identified in some ways with the refugees a legal resident awaiting a green card , she often felt an outsider herself , and knew what it was like to be far from home she also found she was needed her fluent arabic and conversational french came in handy for players' mothers who needed to translate a neverending flow of government paperwork teachers learned to call her when her players' parents could not be located families began to invite her to dinner , platters of rice and bowls of leafy african stews the ziatys cut back on the peppers when coach luma came over they learned she could n't handle them upon hearing of the low wages the refugee women were earning , ms mufleh thought she could do better she started a house and office cleaning company called fresh start , to employ refugee women the starting salary is 10 an hour , nearly double the minimum wage and more than the women were earning as maids in downtown hotels she guarantees a 50cent raise every year , and now employs six refugee women ms mufleh said that when she started the soccer program , she was hopelessly na ve about how it would change her life i thought i would coach twice a week and on weekends like coaching other kids , she said it s 40 or 60 hours a week coaching , finding jobs , taking people to the hospital you start off on your own , and you suddenly have a family of 120 on a friday morning in august , the boys come one by one to look for their names on the roster at the public library many go away disappointed , but six do not the new players are mohammed mohammed , 12 , a brighteyed iraqi kurd whose family fled saddam hussein for turkey five years ago and who speaks only a few words of english idwar and robin dikori , two rocketfast sudanese brothers , 12 and 10 , who lost their mother , sister and two younger brothers in a car crash after arriving in clarkston shahir anwar , 13 , an afghan whose parents fled the taliban and whose father suffered a debilitating stroke soon after arriving in this country santino jerke , a shy 11yearold sudanese who has just arrived after three years as a refugee in cairo mafoday jawneh , a heavyset boy of 12 whose family fell out of favor after a coup in gambia , and who has a sensitive side his older brother ribs him for tearing up during the oprah winfrey show ms mufleh is uncertain of her team s prospects she will have to teach the new players the basics of organized soccer there are no throwins or corner kicks in the street game they have been playing in her occasional moments of selfdoubt , ms mufleh asks herself can i really get these boys to play together \? can i really get them to win \? the fugees' first practice this season is on a sultry august afternoon , with thunderclouds looming in the distance after 90 minutes of studying , the team runs for half an hour and groans through situps , pushups and leg lifts but the fugees have no soccer goals the ymca , which sponsors the team , did not place the order , despite a 2 , 000 grant for the purpose ms mufleh quietly seethes that a team of wealthy children would probably not have to wait for soccer goals she likens practice to playing basketball without a hoop the team s first games portend a long season the fugees tie their first game , 44 in their next game , they surrender a lead and lose , 31 the team is n't passing well players are n't holding their positions on a sweltering afternoon in early september , the fugees prepare to take the field against the triumph , a team from nearby tucker even before the game , there is a glaring difference between the fugees and their competition the triumph have brought perhaps 40 parents , siblings and friends , who spread out with folding chairs and picnic blankets and are loaded down with enough energy bars and brightly colored sports drinks for an nba team though this is technically a home game , no one is on the fugees' side during the course of the season , only one fugees parent will make a game the fugees lead , 20 , at halftime in the second half , they put on a show firing headers , bicycle kicks and a gorgeous arcing shot from 30 yards out even the parents of the triumph gasp and clap in appreciation at the final whistle , the fugees have won , 51 not bad , ms mufleh tells her team but next week will be a much better game , ok \? ms mufleh has a list of complaints about the fugees' practice field little grass , no goals neighborhood children regularly wander through the scrimmages , disrupting play but after a gang shooting in an apartment complex behind the field in late september , she concludes that the field is not safe she cancels practice for two days fed up , she storms into mayor swaney s office , demanding use of the empty field in milam park when lee swaney first ran for city council in clarkston more than 15 years ago , he did so as an unabashed representative of old clarkston clarkston before the refugees it was certainly the more politically viable stance because few of the refugees have been in the country long enough to become citizens and vote , political power resides with longtime residents the 2005 election that gave mr swaney a second fouryear term as mayor of this town of 7 , 100 was determined by just 390 voters as mayor , mr swaney has frequently found himself caught between these voters and the thousands of newcomers but he has also taken potentially unpopular steps on behalf of the refugees in 2006 he forced the resignation of the town s longtime police chief , in part because of complaints from refugees that clarkston police officers were harassing them mr swaney gave the new chief a mandate to purge the police department of rogue officers within three months , the chief , a black man of trinidadian descent named tony j scipio , fired or accepted the resignations of onethird of the force soccer is another matter mr swaney does not relish his reputation as the mayor who banned soccer but he must please constituents who complain that refugees are overrunning the town s parks and community center people like emanuel ransom , a black man who moved to clarkston in the late 1960s a lot of our clarkston residents are being left out totally , mr ransom says nobody wants to help , he says of the refugees it s just , give me , give me , give me' mr swaney encourages ms mufleh to make her case at the next city council meeting so in early october she addresses a packed room at city hall , explaining the team s origins and purpose and promising to pick up trash in the park after practice mr swaney takes the floor he admits concerns about grown soccer people who might tear up the field but these are kids , he says , and kids are our future he announces his support of a sixmonth trial for the fugees' use of the field in milam park the proposal passes unanimously at least for six months , the fugees can play on grass early on the morning of oct 14 , jeremiah ziaty is nowhere to be seen the fugees have a 9 am game an hour from clarkston , against the bluesprings liberty fire , one of the top teams ms mufleh had told her players to meet at the library by 7 ms mufleh usually leaves players behind if they are n't on time but she knows jeremiah s mother is now working nights at a packaging factory she gets home at 3 am and wo n't be up to wake jeremiah so the coach orders the bus driver to the ziatys' apartment jeremiah is sound asleep awakened , he grabs his uniform and fumbles toward the bus from the outset of the game , the fugees , and especially jeremiah , seem groggy they fall behind , 10 but in the second half , they tie the score , fall behind , and tie it again , 22 jeremiah is now playing fearsome defense with minutes to go , the fugees score they win , 32 we played as a team , says qendrim bushi , the boy from kosovo we did n't yell at each other last game , when they scored , all of us were yelling at each other and coach made us do a lot of stuff at practice that s why we win only because of coach as the fugees leave the field , a man on the bluesprings sideline yells to them , i 'd have paid money to watch that game ! the fugees have a knack for inspiring such strong reactions , both positive and negative after one game ms mufleh thought for a moment she was being chased by a rival parent we 've heard about your team , the man said when he caught up with her we want to know what we can do to help the rival team donated cleats , balls and jerseys then there was the game in rural clarkesville last season at which rival players and even some parents shouted a racial epithet at some of the african players on the fugees after being ejected from a game against the fugees in november , a rival player made an obscene gesture to nearly every player on the fugees before heading to his bench and opponents sometimes mocked the fugees when they spoke to each other in swahili , or when ms mufleh shouted instructions in arabic there were even incidents involving referees two linesmen were reprimanded by a head referee during a pregame lineup in october for snickering when the name mohammed mohammed was called ms mufleh tells her players to try their best to ignore these slights when the other side loses its cool , she tells them , it is a sign of weakness ms mufleh is just as fatalistic about bad calls in her entire coaching career , she tells her players , she has never seen a call reversed because of arguing the fugees are perhaps better equipped to accept this advice than most their lives , after all , have been defined by bad calls on the field , they seem to have a higher threshold for anger than the american players , who often respond to borderline calls as if they are catastrophic injustices bad calls , ms mufleh teaches her players , are part of the game you have to accept them , and move on on oct 21 , ms mufleh is forced to put this theory to the test the fugees are on their way to athens , an hour s drive , for their biggest game , against the undefeated united gold valiants a win will put them in contention for the top spot in their division ms mufleh sets out in her yellow volkswagen beetle , the back seat crammed with balls and cleats her team follows in a white ymca bus just outside monroe , ms mufleh looks to her left and sees a georgia state patrol car parallel to her she looks at her speedometer she is n't speeding the brake light , she thinks ms mufleh noticed it early in the week , but between practices , work and evenings shuttling among her players' apartments , she neglected to get it fixed the trooper turns on his flashing lights ms mufleh eases to the side and looks at her watch if this does n't take too long , the team will make the field in time to warm up it is n't so simple because of a clerical error , a ticket ms mufleh paid a year before appears unpaid her license is suspended the trooper orders her from her car in full view of her team , he arrests her in the bus , the fugees become unglued santino jerke , in the country only a few months , begins to weep , violating the unwritten team rule that fugees do n't cry several of the fugees have had family members snatched by uniformed men , just like this they have been in the united states too little time to understand court dates or bail ms mufleh tells the team s manager and bus driver , tracy ediger , to take the team to athens they know what to do they can play without her coachless , though , the fugees are lost athens scores within minutes and scores again and again the final score is 50 after the game , ms ediger drives the team back to monroe she puts together the 800 bail for ms mufleh and signs some papers in a few moments , the coach appears later , ms mufleh says she thought at that moment about all the times she had told the fugees to shake off bad calls , to get back in the game , to take responsibility she walks straight to the bus and her players this was my fault , and i had no excuse for not being there , she tells them i should have been there and i was n't , and the way it happened probably messed you guys up ms mufleh asks about the score it was a really hard team , coach , says idwar dikori , the sudanese speedster were they better than you \? no ! the fugees shout in unison come on , guys were they \? no , coach , robin dikori says if you were there , we were going to beat them back in clarkston that night , ms mufleh takes some sweet rolls to the family of grace balegamire , a congolese player grace s 9yearold brother has heard about the arrest , but does n't believe it if you were in jail , the boy says , you would n't be here ms mufleh explains that she gave the people at the jail some money and promised to come back later , so they let her out how much money \? he asks enough for 500 ice creams if you pay 500 ice creams you can come out of jail \? he asks ms mufleh grasps the boy s confusion the boys' father is a political prisoner , in jail in kinshasa , under circumstances that have drawn condemnation from amnesty international and the red cross the government there has issued no word on when , or if , he will be released at the ziatys' home , the arrest has a similarly jarring effect jeremiah locks himself in his room and cries himself to sleep it s late october , and with just two weeks left in the season , a minor miracle occurs in the arrival of two 10footlong cardboard boxes portable soccer goals for the fugees the administrator at the ymca finally put in the order ms mufleh and ms ediger assemble the goals in milam park the goals and the new field offer ms mufleh new opportunities to coach on grass , players can slidetackle during scrimmages , a danger on the old , gravelly field a lined field makes it easier to practice throwins and corner kicks and goals well , they provide a chance for the fugees to practice shooting a disturbing trend has emerged in recent games the fugees move the ball down the field at will , but their shots are wild they tie two games despite dominating play perhaps the fugees are missing shots for the reason other teams miss shots because scoring in soccer , under the best conditions , is deceptively difficult but ms mufleh also wonders if the absence of goals for most of a season does n't have something to do with it even so , the fugees end the regular season on a misty saturday with a 21 victory , to finish third in their division with a record of 523 , behind undefeated athens and the dacula danger , a team the fugees tied the season finale will be a tournament called the tornado cup to a player , the fugees think they can win what makes us work as a team is we all want to win bad we want to be the best team around , qendrim says it s like they 're all from my own country , he adds of his teammates they 're my brothers the tornado cup comes down to a game between the fugees and the concorde fire , perhaps atlanta s most elite and expensive soccer academy the fugees need to win to advance to the finals standing on the sideline in a sweatshirt with soccer mom on the back , nancy daffner , team mother for the fire , describes her son s teammates as overachievers one is a cellist who has played with the atlanta symphony her son wakes up an hour early every day to do a morning radio broadcast at his school the fire are mostly from the welltodo atlanta suburb of alpharetta they have played together under the same coach for five years they practice twice a week under lights , and have sessions for speed and agility training over the years , the parents have grown close during practice , ms daffner says , she and the other mothers often meet for margaritas while the fathers watch their sons play the team has pool parties and players spend weekends at one another s lake houses in the summer , most of the players attend soccer camp at clemson university ms daffner estimates that the cost of playing for the fire exceeds 5 , 000 a year per player , which includes fees , travel to tournaments and , of course , gear each player has an adidas soccer bag embroidered with his jersey number there is one other expenditure the parents of the fire collectively finance the play of jorge pinzon , a colombian immigrant and the son of a single working mother he is n't from alpharetta , but from east gwinnett county , a largely latino area outside atlanta fire parents go to great lengths to get jorge to games , arranging to meet him at gas stations around his home , landmarks they can find in his outoftheway neighborhood jorge is the best player on the team ms mufleh gathers the fugees before warmups play to the whistle , she tells them if the ref makes a bad call , you keep playing ok \? you focus on the game and how you 're going to win it because if you do n't , we 're going to lose your last game of the season , and you 're going home early just before the opening whistle , some of the fugees see a strange sight on the sideline a teacher from the school of josiah saydee , a liberian forward , has come to see him play some older refugee children from the complexes in clarkston have managed rides to the game , an hour from home several volunteers from resettlement agencies show up for the first time all year , the fugees have fans the fugees come out shooting and missing frequently they lead , 10 , at the half in the second half , it s as if a force field protects the fire s goal after a halfdozen misses , the fugees score again midway through the second half , to lead by 21 then , with just minutes to go , jorge pinzon of the fire gets free about 25 yards from the fugees' goal he squares his shoulders and leans into a shot that arcs beautifully over the players' heads eldin subasic , the fugees' bosnian goalie , leaps the ball brushes his hands and deflects just under the bar , tying the game the final whistle blows moments later the fugees' season is over you had them , ms mufleh tells her team after the game you had them at 2 to 1 , and you would n't finish it the fugees are crushed we lost , i mean , we tied our game , says mafoday jawneh , the sensitive newcomer to the team it was so his voice trails off i do n't know what it was the holidays are a festive time in clarkston santa claus arrives by helicopter at city hall the mayor is there to greet him , as are some of the fugees they have other concerns besides christmas the fugees have held two carwashes in town , to raise 1 , 000 to go to a tournament in savannah in late january they have come up 130 short , and ms mufleh tells them that unless they raise the money , they are not going when one player suggests asking their parents , ms mufleh says that any player who asks a parent for tournament money will be kicked off the team she tells them , you need to ask yourselves what you need to do for your team you need to ask yourself what you need to do for your team , jeremiah ziaty says he is at home in his kitchen , talking with prince tarlue , a teammate from liberia , making a case for a team project some of the boys are to meet at eldin subasic s apartment they can knock on doors in town and offer to rake leaves to raise the money to get to savannah no need telling coach , unless they raise enough cash prince says he is in grace is in , too some older boys in the refugee community offer to help out as well late on a sunday morning , they set out that afternoon , ms mufleh s cellphone rings it s eldin , who asks if she will pick up grace and take him home they have been raking leaves all day , he says , and grace does not want to walk home in the dark oh , eldin adds , he wants to give her the money what money \? she asks you said we needed 130 , he tells her so we got 130 ms mufleh and ms ediger , the team manager , spend the holiday vacation visiting the players' families on dec 26 , ms mufleh receives a fax on town of clarkston letterhead effectively immediately , the fax informs her , the fugees soccer team is no longer welcome to play at milam park the city is handing the field to a youth sports coordinator who plans to run a youth baseball and football program questioned by this reporter , mayor swaney says he has forgotten that in october the city council gave the fugees six months a few days later , he tells ms mufleh the team can stay through march in early january , ms mufleh logs on to google earth , and scans satellite images of clarkston there are green patches on the campuses of georgia perimeter college , and at the atlanta area school for the deaf , around the corner from city hall she hopes to find the fugees a permanent home
the national basketball association , in concert with its players union , passed a rule two years ago that required players to be 19 and at least one full year removed from high school in order to be eligible for the nba draft this season , the age requirement has done precisely what it was supposed to do allow the nba to become older , and force procaliber high school stars to spend a season in college before moving to the nba the rule has also had a significant impact on the college game two freshmen greg oden of ohio state and kevin durant of texas have been perhaps the best players in the nation this season having admirably fulfilled their tour of educational duty , oden and durant will probably be playing in the nba this time next year this arrangement apparently rubs many people the wrong way especially in college circles , the age requirement has a growing legion of critics i used to be one of them no more  billy donovan , the coach at florida , said that the rule made the superstar high school player feel as if he was being punished by going to college for a lot of these kids , it s hard when you 're being told that the only reason you 're going to college is because of this rule , and that if this rule was n't in place , you 'd be a pro , donovan said during a recent interview then all of a sudden they get to college and do n't perform like they thought they would , their stock drops that can be emotionally devastating now what happens \? everybody wants to point fingers it s the kid s fault , it s the coach s fault no one is saying , maybe this guy got some things exposed that he needs to work on' at another level , critics of the intercollegiate athletic system argue that the age requirement has facilitated a mercenary mentality you rent me , i rent you between athletes and universities in the competitive world of toplevel division i college athletics , these arguments ebb and flow , depending on who has which recruit at ohio state , for example , one year can be better than none at all thad matta , the ohio state coach , said he did n't think twice about recruiting greg oden one year \? two \? who cares \? i'm blessed to have the opportunity , matta said of coaching oden these guys do n't come around very often i can only imagine what john wooden felt like when kareem abduljabbar was a freshman and he knew he had him for three more years so , honestly , i cherish every day i'm enjoying every moment i appreciate the spirit of the nba s agelimit requirement the rule will make college basketball stronger , and this season is only the beginning next season , you will see an influx of nearly nbaready freshman guards some of the incoming crop will lead their teams to conference championships , only to leave after a season granted , this sort of instability , which was relaxed when the handful of procaliber high school players could go to the pros , is exacerbated by the age requirement , which all but forces players to college jeremy foley , the florida athletic director , has seen his share of oneandout players , and he has seen programs benefit but he does n't like it i do n't think oneyear guys are great for your program , he said it s hard to build a program with people coming in and out of your program every single year and we 've had them but , romantic as this may sound , i do feel there is something to be said for the college experience florida s al horford , who returned for his junior year after the gators won the national title last year , said that he saw the age limit question as a qualityoflife issue i feel that the college experience , there s nothing equal to it , he said you can say all you want , but it s not the same thing as the nba a lot of the guys who i talk to , they say that this was the best time of their lives , playing college basketball i tell them to enjoy it if they 're only going to be here for a year , that s fine just enjoy it , because you may never have it back  in any event , let s stop with all the talk about colleges leasing players and players renting colleges staying is overrated for those who can go you stay when you have to stay sports is a haywire business that defies traditional analysis most of us at 19 or 20 did not have skills that a corporation would invest millions to employ the odens and durants of the world do bill gates entered harvard in 1973 and left in 1975 as a junior to devote his energies to a company he had just started he got what he needed and left tiger woods left stanford in 1996 , after two years in college , to turn pro he got what he needed the better college baseball players routinely leave after three years to begin their major league careers the better college tennis players often leave school to go on tour we focus far too much negative attention on young athletes do n't hate the player , as they say hate the game

the image of a woman rising on point , simultaneously authoritative and fragile , exalted and vulnerable , is central to ballet as balanchine wrote in a 1965 essay in life , the ballet is a woman but of course balanchine was talking about what happens once the curtain goes up what about little matters like choreography and artistic directorship \? historical accounts vary , but according to robert gottlieb , an author and former board member of the , balanchine wanted a man , not a muse , as his successor as mr gottlieb recounts in george balanchine the ballet maker , he and the choreographer were standing in the wings one night watching peter martins and suzanne farrell dance when balanchine said , it has to be peter , adding , he knows what a ballerina needs twentyfour years after balanchine s death mr martins remains at city ballet s helm , while his former partner runs a troupe at the kennedy center city ballet is one of the world s most prestigious companies the suzanne farrell ballet works just 12 weeks a year ms farrell , whose annual threeweek intensive program for students is entering its second week , said she was working toward a fulltime company and would like to choreograph for it as balanchine s last , and perhaps greatest , muse , ms farrell occupied a singular place on the stage were she to create a major company , moving from muse to artistic agent , she would be just as singular none of america s most prominent ballet companies are run by women according to a study by dance usa s director of research and information , john munger , in 2002 86 percent of the country s 43 ballet companies with budgets of 2 million or more were run by men , while 5 percent were led by a malefemale directorship the landscape has since grown starker for example pacific northwest ballet s founding artistic directors , kent stowell and francia russell , were replaced by peter boal , the former city ballet principal , in 2005 and there are precious few female choreographers working on larger stages , particularly when one excludes moderndance makers like twyla tharp who have attained crossover success ballet may be a woman starring , teaching , directing smaller companies , even serving in vital support positions at big companies but a man is making the major artistic decisions in part this imbalance reflects larger inequities between the sexes in the united states it wo n't surprise many women to hear female artistic directors say that boards hold them and their male peers to different standards , especially when it comes to company finances , or that difficult choices must sometimes be made between motherhood and career but as women have flourished as artistic leaders in modern dance \( albeit with some struggles \) , ballet has lagged behind ballet is obviously an art form that is reflective of the time in which it was created , and certainly at the time our big classics were created , women had a very different role in society , said rachel moore , a former corps member at american ballet theater and now its executive director there are forces that have been in the ballet world that probably exacerbate what already exists in our society ms moore was one of several people to suggest that ballerinas' very roles from cookiecutter corps parts to malesupported partnering influence offstage power relations as dorothy gunther pugh , founder of ballet memphis , put it , is it fabulous , or is it not , that women get picked up and supported and lifted all the time in classical ballet \? ms pugh said placing ballerinas on a pedestal can be a way to remove them from the stuff of daily life because they ca n't handle it let s leave that to the men to do the heavy lifting and the hard work in other words , it s the men who are really setting the course of action for emily coates , artistic director of the world performance project at yale university and a former city ballet dancer , the real problem is ballet s lack of selfreflection , which means that norms are passed from generation to generation unchallenged she cited a number of men who have risen to artistic director recently you think what is the 20yearold soloist going to think \? what will she be looking at \? ' she 'll be seeing the men advance and the women retire , often into teaching positions and there s another generation that will not know that it can aspire , even , to rise into that several elite female leaders , like monica mason , who directs the royal ballet in britain , and the star ballerina nina ananiashvili , who runs the state ballet of georgia , called it more natural for men to lead men are more assertive and more competitive , ms mason said , adding , it s more natural to them , and women very often view themselves in an assisting situation ms mason , like ms ananiashvili \( handpicked by georgia s president \) , said she never saw herself in a leadership role , even though the royal was founded by a woman ms coates , who left city ballet in 1998 to explore modern dance , could not recall a single female ballet colleague with choreographic aspirations , which is sort of the first step to assuming greater power in the studio , the next step above that being artistic directing , pushing the field forward contrast this with her male counterparts in addition to mr boal , benjamin millepied has a blossoming choreographic career , and damian woetzel , another principal , is the artistic director of the vail international dance festival the company of christopher wheeldon , a former city ballet soloist turned star choreographer , makes its debut in vail on wednesday stanton welch , houston ballet s artistic director , ruefully described personally inviting female dancers to join a choreographic workshop last year only one participated it really surprised me , he said , because i thought , oh , we 're going to be different' mr boal and mr martins expressed similar dismay since the first new york choreographic institute , where mr martins serves as artistic director , was held in 2000 , 12 of the 51 participating choreographers have been women , according to company data that s a lower percentage than the numbers of girls who have taken part in choreography workshops at the school of american ballet , affiliated with city ballet \( 38 out of 89 students \) but at the institute , mr martins said , he was often unimpressed by the quality of submissions and sometimes accepted women despite reservations , to encouraging them the director of the annual national choreographers initiative in irvine , calif , molly lynch , said that she received two or three times as many applications from men and that quantity , not quality , was the issue this year the lone woman is melissa barak , who was encouraged to create throughout her time at city ballet , which she joined in 1998 , and its school \( she returned to her native los angeles in the winter to join the new los angeles ballet , which is run by colleen neary and thordal christensen \) ms barak is dismissive of obstacles , claiming that the opportunities exist a lot of girls , especially in ballet , are very shy , very sheltered in a way i think it has to do with that personality type the little coddled ballerina that mommy probably did n't let do a lot of things yet data and anecdotal evidence suggest that girls are willing to try choreography while still students why should ballerinas , who face such incredible competition as performers , be different \? the answer lies partly in the scarcity of men in ballet , which stems from another stubborn cultural prejudice , that dance , especially ballet , is not a suitably masculine endeavor because so much of ballet s repertory depends on a balanced number of men and women , boys are encouraged from an early age the extra weight given to women s choreographic submissions corresponds to the attention male dancers get at auditions and beyond you go to all the schools there are hundreds of girls , there are 10 boys , said amy seiwert , a choreographer who dances with the smuin ballet as female dancers grow older and join companies at 18 or 19 years old , she said , they 're told they are a dime a dozen you get this mindset pounded into you to be very meager , she said over and over again the guys are much more empowered meanwhile men s workloads are typically lighter \( there are no male swans \) and their careers less competitive , allowing more time and energy to devote to experimenting with choreography , an extracurricular activity that boards value highly when weighing candidates for artistic director men also have a perceived cachet as fundraisers , an ever more important aspect of the job in the united states and one tied to the maledominated business world such embedded pathways function like glass escalators , speeding men s ascension in femaledominated professions , said christine l williams , professor of sociology at the university of texas at austin and author of still a man s world men who do women s work women in these professions often turn to men as somehow giving more legitimacy to their calling , she said consequently you have this bizarre thing , really the opposite of when women enter predominantly male jobs and face glass ceilings danielle martinelli , a choreographer and former dancer , agreed we are all , men and women , contributing to the system when i walk into that rehearsal space , and i am talking about the men' and the girls , ' that s such a perfect example of how deeply ingrained it is here i am , a female choreographer , very aware and confident of my abilities , but i'm still carrying on this legacy of difference in treatment
manchester , nh , june 5 the republican presidential candidates waged verbal combat tonight in the congressional battle over a proposed overhaul , with senator john mccain , an author of a pending compromise plan , defending the controversial proposals in debate and demanding that his competitors offer a better idea mr mccain found himself at odds with mayor rudolph w giuliani and former massachusetts gov mitt romney , who each criticized the senate plan as woefully lacking in tough border security and immigration enforcement measures , including the ability to verify immigration status and the type of visas that would be made available it s a typical washington mess , mr giuliani said , in an exchange that marked his first heated faceoff with his past political ally , mr mccain everybody compromises , four or five compromises , and the compromises leave you with the following conclusion the litmus test you should have for legislation is , is it going to make things better \? mr romney , who has been accused by mr mccain of pandering to voters with his criticism of the immigration proposal , passed up an invitation by the moderator of the debate , wolf blitzer of cnn , to hit back well , he s my friend , said mr romney , downplaying his recent feuding with mr mccain over immigration he campaigned for me two times yet mr romney then pivoted to criticize the plan s z visas as a flaw that would allow many illegal immigrants to stay in the united states for the rest of their lives under the zvisa provision , if immigrants paid fines and passed background checks , they could obtain a visa that would be valid for four years and could be repeatedly renewed but mr romney was not completely correct in saying that illegal immigrants would be put ahead of all people who have been waiting to come to this country legally if they wanted permanentresidence visas , or green cards , they would have to wait in line behind people who have already applied mr mccain forcefully defended the plan , and pointedly took on mr giuliani rudy , you just described our legislation , so i 'd be glad to have further conversations with you because it does account for people who are here illegally , it does have an employment verification system , and it weeds out those who should n't be here , and it gives others a chance to remain in this country mr giuliani injected a moment of humor into the debate when he was asked about the writings of a catholic bishop who was critical of mr giuliani s support of rights as mr giuliani began to defend himself , there were several crackles of lightning outside the debate hall prompting other candidates to take a few steps away from mr giuliani , as if a bolt were about to strike him for someone who went to parochial schools all of his life , he said to laughter , this is a very frightening thing that is happening right now iraq and the war on terrorism also figured heavily into the debate , with the three leading republicans turning their fire on the leading democratic candidates at different points mr giuliani mocked former senator john edwards for saying that the war on terrorism amounted to a bumper sticker slogan of the bush administration this war is a real war , mr giuliani said mr mccain , meanwhile , challenged senator hillary rodham clinton s rhetoric as a potential commander in chief over her statement , in the democratic debate sunday night , that the iraq war was the responsibility of the bush administration when senator clinton says this is mr bush s war , that this is president bush s war when president clinton was in power , i did n't say that bosnia , our intervention there was president clinton s war , he said when we intervened in kosovo , i did n't say it was president clinton s war a spokesman for mrs clinton , howard wolfson , issued a statement noting that mr mccain supported the ongoing troop buildup in iraq , while mrs clinton would end the war as president the republican candidates were also asked if they would support pardoning i lewis libby jr and while none of the top candidates said , outright , they would take such a course if president , they also voiced dismay at his sentence mr giuliani was the most outspoken , saying the sentence was way out of line citing his experience both as a prosecutor and recommending pardon while working in the justice department under president reagan , he said he would seriously consider it , especially in light of the harsh sentence when mr blitzer , tried to cut him off , he stopped him , saying , a man s life is at stake he said that it was incomprehensible made all the more disturbing because there was no underlying crime , and he had a real problem with the sentence mr romney , following mr giuliani , also criticized the sentence and left the door open for a pardon mr mccain , who answered first , said that since the case was still being appealed he did not think it proper to comment on , a matter that divides many republican voters , mr giuliani said that americans had to accept the view of scientists that global warming is a real phenomenon and one caused by human activity he said it was frustrating and really dangerous to see money going to our enemies in the form of payments for foreign oil he called for a moonshotlike project to find energy alternatives , a view endorsed by mr romney , who himself went on to criticize major oil companies for not using profits on energy efforts that would lessen american dependence on foreign oil mr mccain echoed that view , saying that oil profits should be reinvested and that nuclear , power , in particular , was an area worth greater exploration on the issue of the do n't ask do n't tell policy for gays in the military , which the leading democratic candidates favor overturning , mr giuliani said he opposed such a change because it would be disruptive during the time of war mr romney , who was critical of that policy in 1994 when he was running for senate in massachusetts , said he was wrong and that he supported the policy now mr mccain , meanwhile , said it would be a terrific mistake to reopen the issue because the military was performing well none of the other candidates signaled they would overturn the policy , either several candidates were also asked about ways they , in office , would put george w bush to work as a former president former gov tommy thompson of wisconsin quipped , i certainly would not send him to the united nations , which stirred some slightly awkward laughter from the audience he then said he would send mr bush out on a lecture series talking to the youth of america to talk about honesty and integrity senator sam brownback of kansas said he would ask mr bush for ideas , and said he might use him on the sore of humanitarian projects that his father , george hw bush , has undertaken all nine republicans signaled that they supported making english the official language of the nation , though mr mccain injected a slight caveat by noting that american indians , in his state of arizona , are allowed to use their languages in some official capacities some of the candidates acknowledged and joked about another republican contender , former senator fred thompson of tennessee , who is preparing to enter the race mr thompson , who appeals to some republicans for his relatively clear and longheld conservative positions on social issues and other priorities , did not attend the debate but planned to comment on it last night in an appearance on fox news mr thompson from wisconsin riffed a couple of times on their shared names , and said , anybody with the thompson name should get involved if they want to get involved but he added that no one had a stronger record of issuing vetoes and cutting taxes than he did it s this thompson , tommy thompson , that s the conservative
blacksburg , va a few months ago , when i returned from a trip to sierra leone , a country i lived in for years and one still reeling from the effects of a brutal civil war , i was filled with relief to be returning to a crimefree place like blacksburg as usual , i was welcomed by the blue ridge mountains , and by the friends i 've grown to love during my 22 years on the faculty at virginia tech it s a quiet place the town is full of turkeys statues of our mascot , the hokie bird , painted in garish colors as if being a hokie were not a sports metaphor but a way of life there s a 5foottall turkey just outside the bank one near the police station another in the parking lot of a cleaner world , where i take my clothes we have a sense of humor in blacksburg it s part of our charm blacksburg is a misnomer , of course it s the whitest town i 've ever lived in and although i'm not white , i 've grown used to the fact that we can , for the most part , live in relative harmony black and white , town and gown , young and old together it s a place that lulls you into believing you can predict what will happen next apart from the gusty , frigid weather , the campus was enjoying another typical spring classes were winding down graduation was fast closing in then , this month , we had two bomb threats on the campus still , people took it in stride when classes in torgersen hall were canceled , the faculty grumbled and the students rejoiced a 5 , 000 reward was offered if we could find the culprit back then , in the era before the slaughter , this seemed significant monday morning , i was preparing for class at home my husband , larry , a computer engineer in the chemistry department , was at work on campus i 'd woken up with a sense of dread i put it down to the visions i was having of the massacres in sierra leone , where i 'd left behind people i cared about nervously , i kept flicking the tv on and off for news in spite of my agitation , when i saw a map of virginia on cnn with the name blacksburg highlighted , i did n't initially associate it with my blacksburg the statistics that ran along the bottom of the cnn ticker were , at first , merciful one death my friends and i called each other and said reassuring , clich d things we knew how to handle this we 'd had a similar scare at the beginning of the academic year when an escaped prisoner had been on the loose , armed there were two fatalities in that event a police officer and a security guard twice what they were reporting today once again , we 'd need to pull together as a community and grieve , but it seemed manageable when a local tv news reporter first uttered the phrase more than 20 , i knew she had made an obscene error this was blacksburg , not freetown when the cnn ticker turned brutal , and the numbers tore across the bottom of the screen like bullets , faculty and staff called one another in disbelief oh my god ! we said , struggling to find words that would guide us back to a recognizable place my husband returned a few minutes later as if proximity were too risky an option , we spoke on separate phones to family and friends in nearby culpeper and distant london whenever our paths crossed , we 'd begin sentences that went nowhere all over blacksburg , all over virginia , there were others like us , wandering around absentmindedly trying to find what was lost hours have passed , and now we know that there was as a friend of mine put it when she called saying she was safe a massacre in that classroom but blacksburg is n't a place of massacres blacksburg is my home in southwest virginia it s boring that s why i like it we are virginia tech , the fighting gobblers , the ones who wear the funny turkey hats and plant tasteless turkey sculptures all over town we are not the stuff of massacres as i write this i am being flooded with email from friends asking if i'm ok how do you answer them \? what can you say when so many so many of our young were slaughtered \? i hit reply try to type the phrase i am fine , but it seems ridiculous to type that i substitute safe for fine another lie , for none of us is safe as long as there are angry young men who yearn to blast a hole in the world i think of the parents hurtling down to blacksburg on interstate 81 , praying for miracles my son is safe in atlanta their grief will dwarf mine how do we begin to comprehend absolute loss \? a friend , another woman of color , says , everybody s gonna need everybody and when another friend , a white man not prone to sentiment , tells me , we 'll need to act like a family , i want to believe them both those of us who have borne witness to suffering in the past will need to help those who cannot believe that healing is possible two students called me today they were recently accepted into our graduate creative writing program i have never met them this has n't changed my mind about coming , the first , a young woman , assures me i still plan to come and join you guys , the other , a man , says in a confident , strong voice i tell them we will welcome them we will and when the parents our bereft sisters and brothers come to mourn their lost children , we will find a way to speak to one another over the din of despair a bomb exploded today in a classroom on a campus in a community i love it was n't an empty threat after all

in this week s obituaries for , perhaps no character in the great filmmaker s work was mentioned more frequently than god god had a leading offscreen role in several of bergman s most memorable movies , and supporting or minor roles in many others god was a protagonist but hardly a hero the most unforgettable image of the deity was as a terrifying spider that a mentally disturbed young woman believes is about to violate her the heroine of another bergman film suddenly , almost obstinately , becomes mute , but that in fact is god s major trait in bergman films generally god is mute , and this silence signals nonexistence at best , malevolence at worst it is an interesting question why so many people serious about religion , believers in particular , feel such a loss at the death of bergman his view of religion was anything but benign he recalled his ultimate loss of faith with great relief his personal life was not a model nor did his films respect proprieties one explanation was captured in a phrase appearing in some obituaries and echoed in most he took on the big questions about the human condition god , faith , desire , doubt , despair , death and , above all , love and its fragility he did this with a vocabulary of images and language that were often explicitly religious and , when not , were still resonant with implied religious references there is an interesting contrast here with , the other major filmmaker who died monday of all the other great italian directors , probably none were so unremittingly secular as antonioni his world is severely postreligious , a circumstance that made reflective believers intensely interested in his work , too for antonioni , however , the passage from religion was simply a fact for bergman it was a struggle the godless world portrayed by both directors was bleak , to put it mildly along with much of modern culture , they judged sensual life and human love to be the alternative and successor to religion as the repository of human hopes for fulfillment but in their films those hopes regularly prove fleeting , illusory or betrayed by human \( usually male \) weakness so were believers , and again christians foremost , drawn to these directors as powerful witnesses to what happened when god was declared dead \? no doubt some religious defenders wanted to employ these bleak visions in a smug apologetic for faith , a greater temptation perhaps in the case of antonioni , a postchristian italian , than of bergman , an exchristian swede but for the most part , religious admirers of these directors treated them and their films not as object lessons for nonbelievers about the consequences of nonbelief but rather as revelations for believers about the true challenges of faith there is a straightforward little book , for example , called god , death , art and love the philosophical vision of ingmar bergman \( paulist press , 1989 \) , written by the rev robert e lauder and including a touching prologue by liv ullmann , one of bergman s leading actresses , who lived with him , had a daughter with him and remained a close friend for years the book is a close reading of the bergman oeuvre by a roman catholic priest who teaches philosophy at st john s university in queens father lauder s book makes clear the intellectual grounds for his own philosophical and christian convictions but in no way does it try to evade the trajectory in the director s films from a concern with god to a humanism focused exclusively on human love and on art as the only stays against death the book was written not for believers or nonbelievers or , for that matter , cin astes , but simply for anyone interested in the big questions , as dramatized by the extraordinary talent that father lauder considers the unrivaled spokesmanartist for the third quarter of the twentieth century it was the unflinching seriousness of bergman s struggle with these questions regardless of the answers he reached that made him so important for the religiously inclined this is especially so because his probing , unlike antonioni s , recognized the continuing power of the christian and biblical heritage and the deep resonance of its words and images why ca n't i kill god within me \? the medieval knighthero asks death in a crucial exchange in the 1957 movie the seventh seal why does he live on in this painful and humiliating way even though i curse him and want to tear him out of my heart \? why in spite of everything is he a baffling reality that i ca n't shake off \? do you hear me \? yes , i hear you , replies death , who is disguised as a confessor and suggests the obvious explanation for god s silence perhaps no one is there when the knight protests , no one can live in the face of death , knowing that all is nothingness , death counters that most people never reflect about either death or the futility of life it is a full halfcentury since this stark scene appeared on the screen , on the far side of the cultural revolution initiated by the 1960s , when bergman was himself easing aside \( though never completely \) his obsession with god and death films exploring the big questions continue to be made in the muchchanged cultural climate but not so relentlessly by a single filmmaker , with a singular vision and a sensibility steeped in a religious tradition searching for exceptions , one thinks of krzysztof kieslowski , who made the decalogue , 10 wrenching television films based idiosyncratically on the ten commandments , and whose three colors trilogy earned several academy award nominations kieslowski died at age 54 in 1996 explorations of the big questions , at least in films from either side of the atlantic , are now more apt to be singleshot efforts or to come guarded with irony or distanced as screwball comedies , thrillers or other genre forms the religious legacies with which emerging artists grapple are now diverse , in contrast to bergman s almost archetypal childhood battle with an authoritarian pastorfather and his stern , repressive christianity but while the culture s store of religious vocabulary , symbol and experience is much widened , what is held in common is much reduced it is right to see bergman s death , and antonioni s , too , as marking the end of an era it would be wrong if a justifiable gratitude for its achievement or lament at its passing dulled the desire for a continuing conversation between faith and film
s name was n't mentioned on the view wednesday morning but a few moments after introduced to a live television audience as the show s new moderator , replacing ms o 'donnell , ms goldberg left no doubt that a new era was dawning with ms walters sitting close at her side during a postshow interview backstage , ms goldberg pledged to avoid stoking the drawnout feuds whether with the likes of donald trump , or elisabeth hasselbeck , a fellow panelist that fueled ms o 'donnell s oncamera persona like cans of gasoline and while she expects that she and her new colleagues will sometimes disagree about whom to support for president next year or the wisdom of the iraq war , which ms goldberg has vehemently opposed she offered assurance that those arguments would never become personal , and that there was no place for grudges we can have those discussions , and do it in a way people can talk , ms goldberg said , still clad in the untucked peach dress shirt and customized conversestyle sneakers she 'd worn on that day s show sometimes you get excited , but you move on you move it forward you go on to the next thing you do n't harbor any ill will if you do , you deal with it afterward this is how roll , she added i do n't think it s necessary to fight with people over long periods of time life is way short it s scary how little time there is for ms walters , a coowner \( with abc \) and coexecutive producer of the view as well as a panelist , the arrival of ms goldberg , 52 , is intended to restore some calm and civility to the show while still keeping it provocative ms o 'donnell s ninemonth run was a period in which ratings spiked upward \( and buzz crackled \) but one in which her sledgehammerinhand approach ultimately and obviously began to beat down her fellow cohosts this was particularly true for ms walters \( who was drawn , uncharacteristically , into ms o 'donnell s tiff with mr trump \) and ms hasselbeck , who increasingly defended the views of the right in response to the leftleaning ms o 'donnell , and who was at times driven by ms o 'donnell to the brink of tears on camera ms walters and abc still have n't replaced star jones , another volatile and unpredictable cohost , who was effectively fired in spring 2006 sherri shepherd and kathy griffin , both comedians and comic actresses , are each believed to be still in the running ms walters said yesterday that no decision had been made and that none was expected until the fall a little over two months after ms o 'donnell left the show for good over the memorial day weekend , earlier than she 'd planned virtually the only evidence that remained yesterday of her presence in the show s upper west side studio were the bottles of apple and eve juice and pretzels that were handed out to the studio audience yesterday it was a gesture of good will ms o 'donnell had pioneered rosie was wonderful in her way , ms walters said yesterday , emphasizing that they 're still in contact i'm glad we had this year with her but ms walters added chemistry in this program is very important everybody , the three of us meaning herself , ms hasselbeck , and joy behar , the other panelist are thrilled , and the staff is thrilled you could feel it when whoopi came out there s a warmth cindi berger , a publicist who represents both ms walters and ms o 'donnell , said that ms o 'donnell was shuttered in rehearsals yesterday with an afterschool theater group she founded and was not giving interviews but ms berger quoted ms o 'donnell as saying whoopi s fantastic in every way , and perfect for the job ms goldberg brings an unmatched versatility to her new assignment her career has ranged from comedy clubs to the broadway stage to the host s lectern on the academy awards telecast , and from dozens of films to the center square on a revived hollywood squares to her own talk show in the early 1990s over the 10 seasons of the view ms goldberg has made 24 appearances some of them on just a few hours' notice , if a guest had canceled , and , perhaps tellingly , on the first show in late may after ms o 'donnell made her final exit the show s producers had always regarded her as a goto guest , one who could hold her own by arguing seriously and effectively in the hot topics segment at the top of the show , as well as provide comic relief when needed both ms walters and bill geddie , her coexecutive producer , said that ms goldberg had been in the mix as a potential moderator from the moment ms o 'donnell left ms goldberg , who would not discuss her salary , seemed to have needed little persuading she said she had agreed to appear on the show for at least a year , and would be on five shows a week \( ms walters tends to do fewer \) she also said she would continue her syndicated morning radio show , based at wktufm in new york she described her routine beginning the tuesday after labor day , when she starts on the view as follows rise at 3 am , feed my cat , wash my face , brush my tooth , on the radio by 5 , broadcast till 8 something , then come here on yesterday s show , after ms goldberg bounded to the stage in the final few minutes through the studio audience , ms walters asked her , apparently to her surprise , to dust off an old bit from one of her stage shows marlene dietrich singing take me out to the ballgame ms goldberg obliged afterward ms walters told ms goldberg that she would periodically call on her in the coming months to do a segment called spotlight on whoopi in it ms goldberg will be asked to do several minutes in the guise of one of her many stage personae , whether bette davis \( a favorite bit of ms walters \) or fictional characters like raisin , an old man i may ask for the druggie , ms walters said then , apparently recalling that the character , fontaine , was a street addict , ms walters corrected herself i do n't know whether we 'll do the druggie
atlanta , feb 7 \( ap \) fulton county prosecutors intend to seek murder charges against three atlanta police officers involved in the shooting death of a 92yearold woman , the lawyer for one of the officers said wednesday the fulton county district attorney , paul howard , sent a letter that said he would ask a grand jury to deliver a murder indictment against the officers , gregg junnier , j r smith and arthur tesler , said rand csehy , mr junnier s lawyer the woman , kathryn johnston , died and three officers were wounded on nov 21 when the police used a noknock warrant to respond to a report of drugs in ms johnston s home the police say that ms johnston fired a handgun and that officers returned fire an autopsy found that she had been shot five or six times narcotics officers said an informer had claimed there was cocaine in the home , but none was found
i lewis libby jr , once one of the most powerful men in government , was escorted by federal marshals out a side door in a federal courtroom here thursday for processing after a judge issued a final ruling that he would have to begin serving his 30month prison sentence shortly , even before his appeals were exhausted mr libby , the former chief of staff to vice president dick cheney , was temporarily released after surrendering his passport and completing forms he will have to report to a federal prison sometime in the next several weeks to begin serving his sentence after his conviction in march on four felony counts for lying in a cia leak investigation that became part of an intense debate over the war in iraq in effect , the ruling means that the only thing standing between mr libby and prison is a pardon from president bush , which mr libby and his supporters are avidly seeking but mr bush has so far shown no inclination to intervene in answer to a question about a pardon , tony snow , the presidential spokesman , said thursday what the president has said is let the legal process work itself out we 're just not engaging in that right now judge reggie b walton , who presided over the trial , sentenced mr libby last week to the 30 months in prison and a 250 , 000 fine on thursday , judge walton affirmed his separate earlier decision that mr libby should not be allowed to remain free until his appeals were exhausted the final decision led to the stark spectacle of mr libby s leaving the courtroom for the first time not through the public entrance as he had done dozens of times in the past , but escorted in the fashion of a convict out a private door by grimfaced marshals under federal procedures , the bureau of prisons is supposed to review mr libby s case and determine a location for him because federal prisoners are supposed to be placed near their homes if possible , mr libby might be sent to a minimumsecurity prison camp in maryland , virginia or new jersey judge walton said there was no reason for mr libby to remain free because none of the issues his lawyers was raising seemed likely to prevail on appeal his ruling thursday was not a surprise as he was being asked by mr libby s lawyers to reverse his earlier judgment mr libby s lawyers argued thursday that his conviction might be overturned by an appeals court on several grounds , the most notable of which was their contention that the prosecutor , patrick j fitzgerald , had been appointed in violation of the constitution that argument , made by lawrence s robbins , was that mr fitzgerald , the chief federal prosecutor in chicago , was given too much power and was not , as the constitution requires , subject to the authority of someone like the attorney general but judge walton said mr fitzgerald could have been dismissed as special prosecutor had justice department officials chosen to do so judge walton was especially acid when mr robbins noted that 12 law professors including alan dershowitz of harvard submitted a brief arguing that mr libby be kept out of prison because his grounds for appeal might be accepted by a higher court the judge said that the brief was not even as good as i would expect from a firstyear law student , and that the academics just wanted to put their names forward in a highprofile case the judge s decision puts the issue of any pardon squarely before mr bush in the next few weeks mr libby s supporters had hoped that he could remain free while his case was appealed and that mr bush might find it more palatable to issue a pardon later in his term , even just before he left office mr libby was convicted of obstructing justice and lying to a grand jury and fbi agents who were investigating the disclosure of the identity of a central intelligence agency operative , valerie wilson mr libby was not charged in connection with leaking ms wilson s name , but he was indicted and convicted for lying about his conversations with reporters about her since his conviction , the issue of a pardon has produced vehement debate democratic leaders in congress have said that any pardon would be improper and a display of favoritism the discussion among republicans has been occasionally vitriolic , demonstrating the vexing political situation the libby conviction has thrown up for mr bush republican presidential candidates have also been confronted with the issue , with former senator fred thompson of tennessee expressing the clearest support for a pardon many libby supporters have argued that mr bush s reluctance to support a former member of his foreign policy team borders on the dishonorable judge walton said in court on thursday that he wanted to put on the record that he had received seriously threatening letters , which he implied were from people attacking him for not giving leniency to mr libby if mr libby goes to prison , he will be the first senior white house official to do so since the days of watergate , when several of president richard m nixon s top aides , including h r haldeman and john d ehrlichman , served prison terms photo i lewis libby jr yesterday after a judge refused to let him remain free until his appeals were exhausted \( photo by doug mills for the new york times \)

the nyc winter jazzfest , now in its third year , carries off a small thing on a large scale a profusion of small things , actually well over a dozen separate acts in 40minute sets , spread out over all three stages of the knitting factory in essence the event conspires to produce the sensation , not common enough in new york jazz circles , of plunging into an enveloping atmosphere all it asks of its patrons is a dash of curiosity , a dose of patience and the will to trudge repeatedly up and down several flights of stairs what it asks of its artists is only slightly more complicated at its root the winter jazzfest is an industry showcase , an opportunity to perform for the sort of person who might have a future booking in mind so wednesday night s sevenhour program was timed to coincide with the annual conference of the international association for jazz education \( a separate edition of the festival , again at the knitting factory , is scheduled for jan 20 , during the conference of the association of performing arts presenters \) the audience on wednesday included a number of nonconference types the festival was open to the public and a relative bargain at 25 but an official feeling still prevailed because it was also planned in conjunction with the french quarter jazz festival , a combined initiative of the jazz education conference , the french embassy and an organization called culturesfrance , the festival had a clear francophonic streak brice rosenbloom , the festival s producer , balanced its competing agendas deftly grouping all the evening s artists under the allpurpose banner jazz alternatives , he delivered a solid banquet if some of the program felt shopworn by new york standards , there was also an occasional whiff of something unfamiliar , imported from overseas the alto saxophonist g raldine laurent delivered the evening s most straightforward jazz set , and one of its pleasant surprises backed only by a bassist and a drummer , she played economical arrangements of bebop tunes , carrying the weight of propulsion with an appealingly roomy tone her version of charles mingus s fables of faubus employed swaying funk as well as rollicking swing some of the other european artists favored more contemporary grooves lucien dubuis , a swiss multireedist , covered the extended range of his bass clarinet from a low squawk to a piercing shriek during a trio set devoted to smirking funk the pianist antoine herv , with fran ois moutin on bass and louis moutin on drums , focused on skittering oddmetered exercises another trio led by a pianist , michel reis , tempered its impressionism with mounting rhythmic suspense groove was a priority of the new yorkbased groups , too the trumpeter maurice brown spiked his rousing quintet set with equal intimations of hard bop and rb , while gutbucket aimed for a kind of brash , lightheaded punkjazz a group called iswhat \? ! delved into swaggering hiphop territory so percussion , a poststeve reich chamber ensemble , spent a few minutes tending to an airy beat sequence that was like the acoustic translation of something off a matthew herbert album for a regular new york clubgoer , the festival presented some amusing dislocations it was slightly odd to see slavic soul party , a balkan brass band that plays weekly at barb s , unleash its frenzy in a bigger room a group led by the guitarist joel harrison delivered the sort of surging fusion associated with the 55 bar and lionel loueke , a guitarist and singer , led a working trio that can be heard most often at the jazz gallery mr loueke , with his fluid fingerpicking and percussive vocalizing , cast the festival s most engrossing spell and his trio , on material like the stutterstepping benny s tune , conveyed a distinctive interplay their stirrings were all the more rewarding for providing refuge from a concurrent performance by mina agossi , a singer seemingly intent on channeling all the sultriness of eartha kitt but none of her magnetism at times there were more difficult decisions to make two of the most compelling performances happened almost simultaneously the alto saxophonist rudresh mahanthappa and the guitarist liberty ellman , each with a working group where mr mahanthappa went for blowtorch intensity , mr ellman employed a heady polyphonic cohesion the final group on the program was wonderful world , a project of the pianist guillaume de chassy , the bassist daniel yvinec and the video artist antoine carlier their set delayed by the guest singer mark murphy , who briefly could n't be located in the bowels of the club ended just shy of 2 am before that , an image by mr carlier flashed on a video screen above the stage it was a commercial airliner with transatlantic printed on its fuselage it was a convenient symbol for the evening , especially as the plane slowly sank into a bed of clouds the festival left a similarly hazy impression after so many bustling hours
nobody is surprised to learn that the justice department was lying when it claimed that recently fired federal prosecutors were dismissed for poor performance nor is anyone surprised to learn that white house political operatives were pulling the strings what is surprising is how fast the truth is emerging about what alberto gonzales , the attorney general , dismissed just five days ago as an overblown personnel matter sources told newsweek that the list of prosecutors to be fired was drawn up by mr gonzales s chief of staff , with input from the white house and allen weh , the chairman of the new mexico republican party , told mcclatchy news that he twice sought karl rove s help the first time via a liaison , the second time in person in getting david iglesias , the state s us attorney , fired for failing to indict democrats he s gone , he claims mr rove said after that story hit the wires , mr weh claimed that his conversation with mr rove took place after the decision to fire mr iglesias had already been taken even if that s true , mr rove should have told mr weh that political interference in matters of justice is out of bounds mr weh s account of what he said sounds instead like the swaggering of a twobit thug and the thuggishness seems to have gone beyond firing prosecutors who did n't deliver the goods for the gop one of the fired prosecutors was as he saw it threatened with retaliation by a senior justice department official if he discussed his dismissal in public another was rejected for a federal judgeship after administration officials , including thenwhite house counsel harriet miers , informed him that he had mishandled the 2004 governor s race in washington , won by a democrat , by failing to pursue votefraud charges as i said , none of this is surprising the bush administration has been purging , politicizing and deprofessionalizing federal agencies since the day it came to power but in the past it was able to do its business with impunity this time democrats have subpoena power , and the old slimeanddefend strategy is n't working you also have to wonder whether new signs that mr gonzales and other administration officials are willing to cooperate with congress reflect the verdict in the libby trial it probably comes as a shock to realize that even republicans can face jail time for lying under oath still , a lot of loose ends have yet to be pulled we now know exactly why mr iglesias was fired , but still have to speculate about some of the other cases in particular , that of carol lam , the us attorney for southern california ms lam had already successfully prosecuted representative randy cunningham , a republican just two days before leaving office she got a grand jury to indict brent wilkes , a defense contractor , and kyle \( dusty \) foggo , the former thirdranking official at the cia \( mr foggo was brought in just after the 2004 election , when , reports said , the administration was trying to purge the cia of liberals \) and she was investigating representative jerry lewis , republican of california , the former head of the house appropriations committee was ms lam dumped to protect corrupt republicans \? the administration says no , a denial that , in light of past experience , is worth precisely nothing but how do congressional investigators plan to get to the bottom of this story \? another big loose end involves what us attorneys who were n't fired did to please their employers as i pointed out last week , the numbers show that since the bush administration came to power , federal prosecutors have investigated far more democrats than republicans but the numbers can tell only part of the story what we really need and it will take a lot of legwork is a portrait of the actual behavior of prosecutors across the country did they launch spurious investigations of democrats , as i suggested last week may have happened in new jersey \? did they slowwalk investigations of republican scandals , like the phonejamming case in new hampshire \? in other words , the truth about that overblown personnel matter has only begun to be told the good news is that for the first time in six years , it s possible to hope that all the facts about a bush administration scandal will come out in congressional hearings or , if necessary , in the impeachment trial of alberto gonzales
josh ruxin is a columbia university expert on public health who has spent the last couple of years living in rwanda he s an unusual mix of academic expert and mudbetweenthetoes aid worker the news is once again flowing out of darfur , triggered by the killing of at least 10 african union peacekeepers last weekend the first direct assault on a peacekeeping compound in the fouryear history of the crisis and genocide unfortunately , with this broadening of violence , the rising stench of history repeating itself is in the air more than a dozen years ago , united states and other international forces were reluctant to respond to the gathering genocide in rwanda , in part because of the deaths of american troops in somalia in 1993 in 1994 , united nations forces pulled out of rwanda after 10 belgian peacekeepers were murdered \( pursuant to a plan carefully choreographed by the genocide s organizers \) today , the attacks on peacekeepers and aid workers come just as 26 , 000 united nations and african union troops prepare for deployment later this year part of the reason darfur remains abstract to americans is that no american lives are at stake there not yet , anyway in rwanda , by contrast , darfur is viewed as anything but an abstraction , given its experience with genocide and the fact that rwandan lives are on the line there there was a sigh of relief around the country to learn that none of those recently killed were among the rwandese forces that have played an important \( and obviously symbolic \) role in the efforts from the start as the disaster in darfur deepens , it may seem like a presumptuous fantasy to worry about how the region can rebuild once the killing ends at a time when the violence there is spiraling out of control \( again \) and aid workers trying to alleviate suffering are now being attacked \( again \) , peace and stability are difficult to envision , let alone achieve nevertheless , the new darfur headlines have gotten me thinking about what , if anything , can be learned from rwanda s postgenocide experience regionally and globally , rwanda gives some basis for optimism , even for darfur several weeks ago , a small group of american college students visited the community of mayange , rwanda , where i have focused much of my work since moving to rwanda at the end of the tour , the entire community gathered for what is called ubusabane a traditional community party with dancing , stories and song two men rose from the community to share their stories with the students the first man told them in gruesome terms about the loss of nearly his entire family during the 1994 genocide the second man , recently released from prison , spoke of his responsibility for the death of six of the other man s family today , they live next door to each other justice in some clean , pure , abstract sense is impossible here , but the nation and its people are struggling to move forward , under a standard of rough , pragmatic , closeenough justice for darfur , however , even that level of healing is a long way off just a few weeks ago , it was possible to imagine that the worst was over as the fighting escalates \( again \) , we see all the hallmarks of a civil war that will generate more killing , more refugees , and even greater suffering among the survivors in darfur , which seems doomed to suffer repeated surges of genocidal madness , rwandastyle testimony may never be possible yet in spite of this reality , the activist crowd the latest celebrity additions to which are former president jimmy carter and archbishop desmond tutu appears to have successfully encouraged china and the sudanese government to commit 300 million to rebuilding darfur president carter last week called using the term genocide to be unproductive , to much controversy productive or not , the term has helped pull together formidable allies throughout the world into a largely coherent campaign american jewish world service has been a serious force in the effort , as have other major aid organizations and faithbased groups they have focused on ratcheting up pressure for action on the sudanese government , the united nations and china why china \? increasingly desperate for fuel , china is licking its lips over the oil fields of sudan , but even that thirst may be mitigated by the potential for a public relations disaster imagine the 2008 beijing olympics being called as many already are doing the genocide olympics that s got china s attention as well it should given their willful blindness to , and complicity in , the horror in sudan for now , the international advocates are holding the line at the following moniker olympic dream for darfur while encouraging divestment in mutual funds with ties to chinese oil companies operating in sudan  so now that the advocates have moved to recapture the world s attention , what needs to happen \? if you ve been following jeffrey gettleman s superb and insightful reporting , you ve seen that the government of sudan s involvement in the crisis and control over the region \( and thus its power to quell the killing \) has greatly diminished in recent days factional fighting , splintering of rebel groups , and general chaos have made darfur look increasingly like 1992 somalia hope is in short supply it seems that the continuing push for a major peacekeeping contingent , chinese proactive involvement and sudanese government support for a peace agreement can only improve the situation the real question is whether these are adequate tools for sealing the crisis and setting darfur and the region in the direction of reconciliation if the world allows darfur to slide back into a living hell of death , starvation and systematic rape , i fear that the lessons of rwanda moving and troubling as they are will fall only on deaf , because dead , ears
los angeles , july 20 he had to be thinking , of all the nights of all the times in his storied career , had to be saying to himself , this had to happen now \? as he trudged off the mound in the third inning thursday , a seemingly certain 299th victory yanked from his grasp by his own ineffectiveness glavine greeted the cluster of reporters that surrounded him after the defeated the dodgers , 139 , with a big smile well , big for someone who gave up 6 runs and 10 hits and did not record an out in the third and said with a laugh , fun night , huh \? it is easy to say that glavine was merely staying in character , that he was really bugged beyond belief by the fact that , given a sixrun lead before he even threw a pitch , he could not do what he had done in all but two of his starts this season pitch at least five innings this is the same person who , after a late rally last saturday against cincinnati gave him a victory to show for his eight brilliant innings , joked after the game that if he had gotten a nodecision , there would have been some psychological repercussions tommy is human , you know , scott schoeneweis said i think we 'd all be a little worried if he did n't consider last night a missed opportunity throughout this season , which for glavine began with three victories in his first four starts before a series of nodecisions , glavine has mostly directed his frustration at how his performance has affected the team s in june , when he allowed the most runs \( 16 \) he ever had over two consecutive starts , he said that he was looking forward to winning his 300th game because , among other reasons , it meant two more victories for the team if he pitches poorly and wins , it s a whole lot easier to deal with , glavine said as glavine knows , there is a delicate balance between pursuing an individual achievement and doing his job , which is to win games for the mets he cannot be totally selfless because he is on the verge of accomplishing one of the rarest feats in baseball schoeneweis said he was a wreck every time glavine pitched because he wanted his friend and teammate to succeed i obviously want us to win every game , but i want tom to win every time he goes out there , and i do n't think there s anything wrong with that , schoeneweis said this guy s doing something that none of us may ever see happen again on thursday night , glavine gave up two runs in the first inning it would have been worse if shawn green had not thrown out jeff kent at third base glavine allowed two more runs in the second and another in the third before he was replaced by aaron sele after loading the bases with no outs it served as a reminder that glavine is not a dominating ace anymore he can , on occasion , pitch like one , and he has a few times in the past month but glavine said thursday s game reminded him of the last time he pitched at dodger stadium , on june 7 , 2006 , when he gave away leads of 40 and 51 before getting the decision in a 97 mets victory anytime your team goes out there and gives you six runs , then three innings into it gives you nine runs , and you 're struggling to win the game , that s frustrating , glavine said i appreciate those guys going out there and scoring me runs when i do n't do anything to protect that , it s frustrating it s embarrassing it s all those things i feel awful when we score that many runs that early in the game and we 're having to scrape and claw to win it glavine said he did not care where he won no 300 this is not midseptember , when only a few starts remain he has plenty of time if glavine wins his next start , scheduled for wednesday against pittsburgh at shea stadium , his first two tries for 300 would come on the road , in milwaukee and chicago i'm just focused on pitching the game at hand and getting ready for the next start , glavine said i'm not worrying about all the other stuff inside pitch general manager omar minaya said pedro mart nez threw 60 pitches in the dominican republic on thursday and was scheduled to return to florida next week to prepare for the next phase of his rehabilitation , another simulated game after his last simulated game , on july 3 , the mets said mart nez would take a planned 7to10 day break before pitching again minaya said that mart nez had not experienced any setbacks and that he still expected mart nez to rejoin the team in august minaya added that september was a possibility , too i 've said all along that anything we get from pedro this year is a bonus , minaya said it s one of those things where his body is going to say what happens next
east rutherford , nj \( ap \) michael strahan dropped thoughts of retirement and returned to the new york giants for a 15th nfl season because his desire to play football and his love of the game were rekindled he also , not incidentally , still wants a super bowl ring you know you just want to come back , a bearded strahan said tuesday after rejoining the team and practicing i felt i wanted to play football , plain and simple i wanted to enjoy it i wanted to come here and enjoy myself , play football , enjoy my teammates and the fans and just do it do it one more time strahan , who accumulated fines in excess of 500 , 000 during his holdout , left open the possibility he will play beyond the 2007 season , which begins for the giants on sunday night in dallas neither strahan nor coach tom coughlin was certain the 35yearold would play in dallas the giants have a twogame roster exemption in case he is n't ready he appears to be in good shape , coughlin said of course he has n't had any contact but we have to work our way through all of that the seventime pro bowler said he had every intention of reporting to training camp at the university at albany in late july when his desire to play suddenly waned as you train and get ready leading up into the season , sometimes you wait for that feeling to come , and for me that feeling did n't come when camp was there , strahan said in a 10minute news conference in giants stadium so instead of going there and being halfhearted into something and possibly getting hurt and not wanting to be there and leaving after initially showing up , i decided i have to do what is right for me so he took the next 39 days to ponder if he wanted to return he admitted it was n't an easy decision his father , gene , might have made it tougher by telling his son that he had accomplished everything there is to do in football strahan is the nfl s active sacks leader with 132 1 2 and the holder of the singleseason record for sacks , 22 1 2 basically , he said to me son you did enough , strahan said it s hard to go against that what swayed strahan were a couple of other things on the west coast giants fans who saw him pleaded with him to play , and giants coowner steve tisch paid a visit and told him it was not the way he should want to leave the game talks with warren sapp and marshall faulk also helped both have been on super bowl winners when strahan asked faulk how he felt about retirement , the response was interesting great ! strahan recalled him saying you have a ring , do n't you \? teammates were pleased to see strahan in the locker room again none seemed overly concerned that he missed all of training camp while they sweated through twoaday workouts most laughed at his facial hair linebacker antonio pierce dubbed him the fugitive stray looked good , said defensive end justin tuck , who played left end in his absence and continued to work with the first team tuesday a lot of guys definitely thought he was on the beach , drinking margaritas and looking at pretty women he definitely knows what it takes to play in this league although strahan has failed to finish two of the last three seasons because of injuries , tackle barry cofield was n't worried about him getting hurt again if it was n't a guy used to getting pounded by 330pound guys , he would probably be at risk , cofield said for someone like stray , who has been through so much , he 'll know how to protect himself out there strahan said he was n't worried how his teammates would receive him because he had stayed in contact with many of them throughout his holdout , which he referred to as a 'break' in his career i know i appreciate the game , he said i love the game and i love everything that comes with it and i know when i have that appreciation that i want to be out here strahan left the locker room and walked to the practice field around 11 30 am with receivers amani toomer and plaxico burress he joked with fellow defensive end osi umenyiora on the field and then stretched with a group of five players that included tight end jeremy shockey for the most part , he laughed a lot this is where i want to be and why i am back , he said
washington neither george w bush nor the national security expert who advised him through his first presidential campaign seemed captivated by the prospect of a nobel peace prize or encomiums from the chattering classes but something has happened over the last seven years the allure of a place in history has grown how else to explain the aboutface president bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice have made on key foreign policy issues from north korea to the middle east peace process \? early in his term , president bush jettisoned the crown jewels of the clinton administration s foreign policy the israelipalestinian peace process and the north korea agreed framework in each case , experts still disagree about whether he was right to do so but the fact is that bill clinton had gone the extra mile in the middle east and achieved nothing and revelations that the north koreans had been cheating on their 1994 commitment to abandon nuclear weapons made manifest the fraud underlying that breakthrough seven years into the bush presidency , however , what was old is new again the blackmailing pyongyang regime is now one with which the united states can do business nevermind that in 2002 , american and spanish warships discovered a north korean vessel carrying scud missiles to yemen or that in 2005 the treasury department designated the macaobased banco delta asia as a primary moneylaundering concern for its role in north korea s illegal weapons , counterfeiting and drug businesses now suddenly , washington eschews comment on north korean arms sales and as for banco delta asia , it s back in business and its frozen money has been returned to north korea worse , ms rice has now signed on to a new mark ii version of the agreed framework , which has considerably fewer benchmarks for the north koreans than the clinton administration deal did ostensibly a commitment by north korea to disclose and abandon all nuclear programs including a secret highly enriched uranium program the deal s vague , openended nature promises endless renegotiation as to why an administration that once insisted upon complete , verifiable and irreversible dismantlement is now ok with nebulous abandonment , the record is silent back in 2001 , the newly minted bush administration was scornful of bill clinton s efforts to build a palestinian state with a terrorist government in place mr bush refused to allow yasir arafat to darken the white house door and said he would not support the establishment of a palestinian state until its leaders engage in a sustained fight against the terrorists now hamas is in control of gaza , mahmoud abbas is the powerless president of a palestinian authority and members of his fatah forces tried to assassinate israel s prime minister nonetheless , ms rice has been to the region repeatedly and recently sought advice from not just bill clinton but , of all people , jimmy carter next week , she 'll be playing host to prime minister ehud olmert of israel and his palestinian antagonists at a cozy chat session in annapolis , md \( none seem as committed to the meeting as ms rice originally expected to last three days , it has reportedly been pared down to one \) the clearest sign of ms rice s eagerness to make deals with pyongyang and the palestinians is her willingness to overlook egregious misbehavior by her negotiating partners much like the clinton administration , which disregarded early warning of a uranium enrichment program in hopes of staging a historic presidential visit to pyongyang in 2000 , the united states is now ignoring evidence of north korean nuclear and missile proliferation to the middle east for example , in september israeli jets destroyed what israeli and american intelligence assessed to be a north koreanbuilt nuclear reactor in syria officials who have seen the intelligence tell me the structure was the result of several years of transfers between north korean nuclear suppliers and syrian buyers ms rice s most revealing comment \? an explanation that issues of proliferation do not affect the palestinianisraeli peace efforts we are making this bizarre rationalization is oddly divorced from reality how could israel possibly be indifferent to its neighbors acquiring nuclear technology from america s partner in the new agreed framework \? the statement simply invites america s adversaries to capitalize on the administration s desperation why not engage in bad behavior if the bush administration , like the clinton administration , will look the other way \? by kowtowing to the conventional wisdom of what a secretary of state should do , condoleezza rice is making her legacy dependent on the future behavior of a north korean tyrant and palestinian pretenders ultimately , that will serve neither selfish nor national interests
the ways we think we are affecting our children as parents and the actual impact we have are two different matters already i see evidence of this with my four my richest memories of their childhood and their richest memories are not the same memories they 'll say , remember that time , dad and i do n't , even though i was there , and i'm in the story from a young age , they are editing our family s life through their filters i lived this with my own father in several basic ways , he shaped me he was a newspaperman who valued education and family but the most vivid memories i have of my childhood , i know , are not the ones he would have selected those memories have pushed me to try and be a different sort of parent than he was one of the most central influences he had on me developing my voice as both a writer and parent came about in ways that he never would have guessed and that i myself did not recognize until well into my adult years as a young reporter , i was constantly in search of my writer s voice , since i 'd been told all real writers as opposed to journalists had one in the early going , this produced ludicrous results as i discovered my voice was exactly the same as whatever literary giant s i happened to be absorbed in that week \( particularly deadly for newspaper readers was my faulkner phase \) by my third newspaper and my 30th birthday , i had given up i 'd resigned myself to being a journalist without a voice and then one night after work at the miami herald , i went out to johnny raffa s lobo lounge with a terrific editor , doug balz after a few beers , doug asked where my distinctive writing voice came from i was stunned someone thought i had a voice \? this was the moment i 'd been waiting for , except i had no clue what my distinctive voice was i had to ask him he told me i had an ability to poke fun at people in my writing , to accurately portray their foibles and yet still convey my genuine affection for them and the moment he said it , i knew where it came from my writer s voice was the mechanism i 'd developed that let me live with my father and hold onto his love the voice was so central to my being while growing up , it was inaudible to me my dad was a good , loving man , but difficult and troubled on the street where we grew up , the houses were so close together every neighbor could hear the next neighbor s business we knew who the drinkers were , who the adulterers were , who was out of work dad was none of these he drank in moderation , came home to my mother and worked steadily as a newspaper copy editor seven days a week at one point , to put us through college but as the whole block had to know , dad was a vicious screamer he was floridly profane and verbally abusive , usually toward my mother , and it could go on , with rest breaks , for hours throughout high school , i did not bring home friends for fear my father would have one of his explosions it was n't until after he died , in 1980 , at the age of 65 , that i got some insight into his rage piecing it together with family members , i guessed that my father suffered from obsessivecompulsive disorder , a mental illness that can compel people to obsessively repeat rituals in some ways , this served my dad well he was the slot man at the boston herald the final person to check stories before they were printed , to pore over every piece of copy to make sure no error got into the paper today , this illness has become a part of mainstream culture my father most likely had the same disorder as the amusing private investigator on the tv show monk however , if there were funny parts when i was growing up , i do n't remember them i do remember , as a boy , catching my father repeatedly washing his hands , then seeing him struggle to turn off the bathroom light with his elbow to avoid germs it s not hard to imagine why he 'd build up rage inside , having to deal daily with a humiliating disorder that he did not understand somehow , in the course of my childhood , i found the voice to let him know he was behaving badly , to convey the message in a way that communicated my love and , at times , defused his rage my mother used to say , michael , you 're the only one who can placate your father i 'd guess that what reached him as much as my words was a child s na \? attempt to make things right he was so mercurial from cruel to remorseful and back that he forced us to feel deeply and often he could launch into a screaming fit if the kid next door accidentally kicked a ball into our yard , and if i got up the courage to challenge him he s a good kid , dad , what do you think , he did it on purpose , dad \? we do the same thing , dad he 'd stomp upstairs then , just when everyone was drained and humiliated and hoping he 'd never come down again , there were the footsteps on the stairs , and we braced for the next explosion you boys want to take a ride and get some ice cream \? he 'd say on a good day besides my writer s voice , he influenced my own parenting style , though not in the ways he would have guessed that same voice i used on my dad i use on my kids to make sure they know how much i love them even as i'm grounding them i also repeatedly remind my kids that their friends are welcome at our home and i 've always strived to avoid arguing with my wife in front of our children i 've sworn a silent oath never to do to my kids what my father did to me drawing \( drawing by jason schneider \)
call me clueless , but i never thought that riding on grass could make me a faster bike racer yet there i was in the pastoral santa ynez valley , west of santa barbara , clad in harlequin spandex , pedaling my skinnytire bike around a traffic median with 16 other cyclists as instructed , we each lowered a shoulder and reluctantly leaned into the rider next to us cycling is n't usually a contact sport , but we needed to get used to pedaling in the huddled , windcheating pelotons that enable professional riders to arrow down the road at 30 miles per hour this was a handling exercise , though none of us handled it very well do n't be a piece of wood , our coach , chris carmichael , said wood is stiff when that happens you fight and resist be a wet noodle riders start falling , and finally i , too , surrender to the turf , taking my partner with me carmichael assessed the damage we have to get more comfortable doing this , he said carmichael is a former professional racer , a former head coach of the united states olympic cycling team and the selfproclaimed swami who guided to his seven tour de france victories now 46 , he s the founder and chief executive of carmichael training systems , which offers coaching to professional and amateur cyclists , as well as triathletes , nascar drivers and extremeendurance racers athletes can follow an online training program or attend a clinic at one of several sites across the country those who require even more handholding can consult carmichael s evergrowing series of training , nutrition and selfhelp books for what i do , there are n't a lot of coaches out there , so i was a little skeptical , says dean karnazes , the renowned 44yearold ultramarathoner , who signed on with carmichael last year chris was able to apply a lot of the lessons they had learned with lance in the tour to me at the heart of carmichael s training philosophy is the quest to get working muscles more of what they need most oxygen the way to do that , he says , is to micromanage the body s aerobic systems that is , to tailor workouts to suit the abilities of individual athletes \( as i 've suspected all along , i am special ! \) carmichael , who trained for the 1986 tour de france by following an unrelenting , onlythestrongestsurvive regimen , found that he had to rethink such tactics when helping a cancerravaged armstrong attempt his comeback the result was a more personalized approach , with workouts designed to match an athlete s daytoday health , energy level and mood on monday , carmichael might order you to lift weights , spin on a bike at a low intensity and then do a series of eightsecond sprints easy enough wednesday s workout , though , could leave you whimpering softly over your handlebars the night before we began our weeklong session , carmichael greeted us in the conference room of our hotel he swaggered in , wearing a buttondown shirt and baseball cap embroidered with the carmichael training systems logo \( the logo is everywhere , probably even on carmichael s bed sheets \) he s playful but also has a distinct edge looking over everyone in the room a hardcore 22yearold amateur road racer , a triathlete with grandchildren and a range of 40ish weekend riders hailing from as far away as tokyo carmichael did little to ease us into the program the schedule , he said , was ambitious when we were n't riding , we 'd be learning about bike fit and repair or analyzing game tapes we 'd start bright and early tomorrow , with two threemile time trials from which the staff would calculate the intensity levels of our individual training programs he expected flatout efforts from all of us oh , and the forecast called for rain you 're not going to melt , carmichael said nobody here is made of sugar the next morning , i met my real boss for the week a yellow cycling monitor wired to my rear hub that measured how much energy my pedal strokes generated in watts this was a power meter , though a more accurate name would be the l'il sadist carmichael believes that power meters provide more valuable information than the heartrate monitors that many riders swear by wattage is the actual work your body is capable of producing , he 'd tell me heart rate is the byproduct of the work you 're producing it s one step removed after the time trials , carmichael studied my data during my fastest ride i generated an average of 279 watts respectable for a scrawny 41yearold occasional racer but hardly a blip for professional sprinters , who are capable of 2 , 000watt surges carmichael quickly zeroed in on what i 've long felt to be my personal weakness tolerating pain the more you can push yourself and find out where your edge is , the better , he told me thankfully , i did n't need to locate my edge right away the week was a sequence of workouts designed to help us become increasingly strong on day 2 we did a relatively lowintensity , 65mile ride to build our slowtwitch muscle fibers and thus improve endurance carmichael led the way , pumping his smoothly shaven quads , barking at us when the readings from our power meters revealed that we were pedaling at the wrong intensity the guy missed nothing and even thumbed his blackberry as he rode the next day we did a series of hard , 10minute intervals up a winding hill that bore a sign alerting us to possible tractor traffic afterward , i sat down with coach renee eastman , a fourtime masters national champion , who studied my powermeter data on her laptop she did n't like the cardiogramlike look of the graph it was too peaky i had spent too much energy going above the lactate threshold , the point at which muscles begin to fade every time you go above the lactate threshold you 're burning a match , and you 've only got so many matches , eastman said you want to have some for the end workout after workout , the power meter exposed my shortcomings i needed to pedal harder on the descents i needed to pedal faster to reduce my watts per stroke i needed to pedal more steadily to keep my efforts even like a victim of stockholm syndrome , i actually contemplated taking the thing home with me it just so happened that the monitors were available for 1 , 000 at the camp s pro shop if it was n't the power meter carping , it was carmichael look at the journalist , he s got it all wrong , he said to the group as we watched video of one of my descents keep your butt on the saddle your bike will stick more the last day of camp we climbed figueroa mountain , a 4 , 500foot peak that carmichael called tourworthy race it , he said , and like a fool , i took the dare earlier in the week carmichael told me that if i kept my power output at around 280 watts while climbing figueroa , i 'd get worked pretty good but he also said that in a race situation , all the rules change so you 're above threshold what do you do when that happens \? slow down and get dropped by your competition \? or try to stay with them \? as we started , i felt great the day before , carmichael had us do nothing but interval sprints so short under 10 seconds that our muscles never passed lactate threshold the day of relative rest , coupled with the highcadence pedaling we 'd been doing all week , kept my legs fresh about halfway up the mountain i caught tim best , a 44yearold plastic surgeon who had blown me away in the early time trials i glanced at my powermeter display and watched the numbers jump 290 , 300 for the first time all week , i disregarded the thing and decided to try to stay with best we finished the climb together the view from figueroa s summit is spectacular , or so i 've heard i was too busy panting to notice proper turning that is , taking a corner while losing little or no speed is one of the most elusive skills in road cycling here s how chris carmichael does it or downhill turn , steer as far from the inside of the curve as possible gently squeeze the brakes while you 're still moving in a straight line turning and braking simultaneously make a bike squirrelly look down the road to where you want the bike to go this will help you stay straight and move faster around the curve keeping your feet parallel to the ground , with your inside pedal positioned at 12 o'clock and the outside pedal at 6 o'clock weight the outside foot with the kind of pressure that you apply to an outside ski while turning you 'll increase the traction of those skinny tires and lean into the apex of sticking out your inside knee instead , keep it pressed against your bike frame to better center your weight through the turn
to the editor re bush vetoes bill tying iraq funds to exit schedule \( front page , may 2 \) the most responsible action we could take in the iraq war is to end it immediately there is no prescription or timetable for victory it is not clear why the nation needs a victory other than the one we have achieved already , which is to have gotten rid of a dangerous dictator we do n't often do that in any case , much less fight a war for it we need to get on with a domestic energy policy , use the money we will otherwise waste in iraq to further energy technology at home , and bring the troops home immediately congress should not pass any spending bill , should undercut the ability of the troops to remain , and bring them home to safety now that would perfectly express the will of the voters eugene gordon dover , nj , may 2 , 2007  to the editor an alternative and more accurate description of the democrats' vetoed bill is that it forces the elected iraqi government to prepare for a united states withdrawal on a timetable that we , not they , determine if , as many believe , the iraqis' maintenance of the infrastructure we built and the adequacy of iraqi troops we are trying to train and mobilize is dilatory , notice of our withdrawal timetable would not be a signal to enemy terrorists but to iraqi officials david l oshin scottsdale , ariz , may 2 , 2007  to the editor as president bush signed his second veto , you note another seven names of the dead , for a total of 3 , 344 how many more brave men and women must die before the president and his congressional allies finally realize that having no exit strategy and no firm benchmarks is the real prescription for chaos and confusion in iraq that marks the ultimate failure of the administration \?

civilian control of our military is one of the most firmly embedded traditions of our democratic system and civilian control has always meant control by politicians in washington , in most cases far from the front lines the problem with president bush s current position is that he is shirking his responsibilities as commander in chief whether president bush likes it or not , the decision of whether our country should continue the current campaign in iraq is not and should not be with the commanders in iraq that decision rests quite properly with politicians in washington jorge l baron seattle , may 2 , 2007  to the editor re the hail mary pass \( column , may 2 \) i enjoyed thomas l friedman s fantasy of a speech that president bush should give to the regional conference in egypt , an apology for his failed policies in iraq with a productive and cooperative look forward in the final analysis , though , it will always be a wish and not a reality because all the president has left is his unshakable resolve , itself locked and lost in fantasy bonnie hyken morristown , nj , may 2 , 2007  to the editor the speech that thomas l friedman would write for president bush would , sadly , fall upon deaf ears in the arab world and in much of europe , china and russia for the simple reason that the bush administration has arrogantly or ineptly bungled and bounced from one failure to another whether it be the period before the invasion or the execution of the war , international relations and global politics , or domestic disaster relief , few observers could place much confidence or trust in this administration any meaningful change in the dynamic of the middle east must begin with republican members of congress who fear not only their party s fate , but also for the security of the country on the bush watch it is time for them to come off the fence to solve the problems the president has created d c montague chattanooga , tenn , may 2 , 2007  to the editor re thomas l friedman s may 2 column if only thanks at least for letting us imagine for a moment that we have a president who can admit his mistakes , take responsibility for them , appeal to people s better instincts , and ask for the help he needs would n't that be something \?

morelia , mexico s country music stars are being killed at an alarming rate 13 in the past year and a half , three already in december in a trend that has gone hand in hand with the surge in violence between drug gangs here none of the cases have been solved all have borne the signs of mexican underworld executions , sending a chill through the ranks of other grupero musicians , who sing to a country beat about love , violence and drugs in modern mexico one of the most shocking attacks was the kidnapping of sergio g mez , the founder and lead singer of kpaz de la sierra , who was seized as he left a concert in his home state of michoac n early on the morning of dec 2 his body was found the next day dumped on a roadside outside this city , the state capital he had been beaten , tortured with a cigarette lighter , then strangled with a plastic cord , officials said he was 34 and had just been nominated for a grammy award we do n't understand why this happened , his uncle , froyl n g mez , said in an interview he never did anyone any harm the motives for the killings remain a matter of speculation , and no evidence has been found to link them to a single killer in some cases , the musicians appeared to have ties to organized crime figures , making them potential targets in reprisal attacks from rival gangs others had composed ballads known as narcocorridos , glorifying the shadow world of drug dealers and hit men , which can offend other drug dealers and hit men in still other cases , as the musicians' fame grew , they may have become embroiled with criminals unwittingly sometimes there is a direct relationship between the musician and the narcotics trafficker , said miguel olmos , a musicologist at the college of the northern border in tijuana but also there are a lot of passionate crimes that is to say , the musician establishes some sort of sentimental relationship with people who are linked to this culture of violence and of narcotics trafficking , and somehow it gets out of hand they always touch some nerve of the trafficker in the case of mr g mez , who was best known for his stirring love songs , prosecutors are investigating whether he had ties to organized crime so far , however , the investigation into his abduction has been a morass of conflicting accounts , missing witnesses and loose ends unlikely to be tied up soon investigators have yet to interview the two impresarios who were with mr g mez when he was kidnapped , nor have they interviewed the other members of his group we hope we can locate all these people , said mar a elena cornejo ch vez , the assistant attorney general of michoac n state it s very complicated for us because they all left the state the killings have been particularly brutal on thursday , jos luis aquino , 33 , a trumpet player with los conde , was found beaten to death in oaxaca state , with a plastic bag over his head and his hands and feet tied on dec 1 , zayda pe a , the ravenhaired lead singer of zayda y los culpables , was shot in a motel room in matamoros in tamaulipas state she survived the attack , but the killers followed her to the hospital and finished her off with two more bullets as she lay in bed she was 28 we are in shock , because it s a weird thing that in one week three members of the grupero wave would be killed , jos ngel medina , the leader of the group patrulla 81 , told reporters after the recent killings we are afraid because we are superexposed , and this could keep going we do n't know who s next entire groups have been targeted as well four members of los padrinos de la sierra were shot and killed in durango state on june 9 on feb 19 , assassins with machine guns attacked the members of tecno banda fugaz in the town of puruar n , michoac n , killing four and wounding one the toll in 2006 was equally grim on aug 9 , three members of explosi n norte a , a group who dedicated themselves to songs about drug traffickers , were shot and seriously wounded in their offices in tijuana , across the border from san diego nov 25 of that year brought the assassination of the singer valent n elizalde , 25 , along with his manager and driver , shortly after a show in the border town of reynosa , tamaulipas , across from mcallen , tex more than 60 rounds from an ak47 were fired into their car a month later , javier moralez g mez , a member of los implacables del norte , was shot to death in huetamo , michoac n all the victims played various genres of grupero , the mexican country music distinguished by its oompah beat and maudlin lyrics , often recounting tales of unrequited love , hard luck , famous bandits or their modern equivalent , drug lords some were known particularly for their narcocorridos one of ms pe a s hits , for instance , was tiro de gracia , a reference to gangland executions mr elizalde was also well known for his ballads about bandits and drug kingpins mr g mez , of kpaz de la sierra , however , was different his biggest hits were love songs like mi credo \( my creed \) and volver \( i will return \) his band played in the durango dance style , characterized by the prominence of brass instruments and a superfast march beat like many other grupero combos , the band members wore identical western suits and cowboy hats news of his death prompted some musicians to cancel concerts in michoac n others said the killings made them nervous about appearing in public these assassinations have been done with a lot of cruelty and this makes us tense , said jorge medina , a singer with la arrolladora banda , in a televised interview michoac n investigators say mr g mez left a stadium in morelia after his concert at about 3 30 am on dec 2 , a sunday he was in the company of a driver and two music industry executives , javier rivera and v ctor hugo s nchez they drove off in a sedan , the police said the other seven musicians in the band and two of mr g mez s brothers followed in other cars a short while later , a member of the group called the federal police and reported that mr g mez and the two businessmen had been abducted by armed men about three miles outside morelia on the highway to salamanca the federal police informed the state police , the authorities said what happened next remains unclear the state police maintain that when they arrived at the scene , federal agents told them they had interviewed the two businessmen and determined the kidnapping had been a false alarm , said ms cornejo , the deputy state attorney general a spokesman for the federal attorney s office in morelia , miguel ngel hern ndez , confirmed that account yet mr g mez was tortured to death between 4 30 am and 11 am on dec 2 in an unknown place , an autopsy found he had been beaten badly around the head and chest his thighs and genitals had been burned with a flame he died of strangulation in ciudad hidalgo , a small farming town nestled in a valley about 60 miles east of morelia , people remembered mr g mez with warmth he had grown up there , the son of a local singer who never made the big time , in a modest house in a poor neighborhood while still a teenager , he married a girl from a nearby ranch , lived in his parent s home , fathered his first child and went to work as a cabinet maker the entire family moved to chicago during the financial crisis in the mid1990s , where mr g mez worked menial jobs , fathered two more children and ran into trouble with authorities eventually he found work as a sound technician for a band , mont z de durango in 2003 , he and three musicians from that group formed kpaz de la sierra his career took off the band recorded four highly successful albums and regularly toured arenas and large concert halls in mexico he also visited ciudad hidalgo every year and gave thousands of dollars to expand the grade school where he studied as a child he never put on airs with his old friends , neighbors said he always behaved very well , said an acquaintance , who asked not to be identified for fear of drug dealers he was not one to be very snobbish his wife , felicita , told reporters he seemed relaxed in the days just before his death and never mentioned any threats i never saw him nervous or expecting something bad , she said froyl n g mez said his nephew never sang about drug dealers or used drugs himself this man did n't even smoke or drink , he said we cannot understand why it happened the whole family is demanding justice we want to know who is the author of this crime

senator has been attacking senator s health care plan , saying that while her proposal would provide universal coverage , his would leave out 15 million people i do n't think we should start by giving up on 15 million americans , mrs clinton said monday in clear lake , iowa , adding , that s why my health care plan covers everyone mr obama would require all children but not all adults to get health insurance mrs clinton would mandate that everyone obtain coverage both plans intend to lower the cost of health insurance so employers would be more willing to provide it and virtually all individuals could afford it but while mrs clinton is right that mr obama s plan would leave out millions , she is being misleading in implying that her own plan covers everyone mandates rarely achieve 100 percent compliance in addition , they are almost impossible to enforce because of those difficulties , mrs clinton s own plan would probably leave out millions mandates have not worked with auto insurance while all drivers are required to have it , 15 percent of the nation s drivers have none , according to the insurance research council mr obama s health plan could actually have a better compliance rate the 15 million who would supposedly be left out equal about 5 percent of the population a smaller portion than are going without auto insurance , said joseph antos , a health policy expert at the american enterprise institute , a nonpartisan group if obama s plan were to leave 15 million people without insurance , i think senator clinton s plan would certainly do the same , not because of a mandate but because of the fundamental problems of getting people to recognize that they should buy insurance and making them buy it , mr antos said the 15 million figure apparently originated in the new republic while experts say the article was well researched , the 15 million is an estimate no one appears to have a better figure the experience in massachusetts , which has enacted universal coverage with a mandate that everyone obtain health insurance , shows how difficult it is to force everyone to comply about 20 percent of people in that state do not have health insurance even with the mandate the average cost of a policy is 12 , 000 a year for a family and 5 , 000 for an individual it is likely to take years before costs come down enough so that lowerincome people can afford health insurance and are willing to pay for it austan goolsbee , an economics professor at the university of chicago and senior economic adviser to the obama campaign , said the clinton campaign should acknowledge that its plan would leave out at least as many as mr obama s partly because mrs clinton has not said how she would enforce her mandate she has not suggested a penalty , mr goolsbee said if there s not a major penalty for skipping out on insurance , people will skip out on it
john thorn , a sports historian , is author of total baseball the official encyclopedia of major league baseball and the hidden game of baseball , among other books so there is gambling in casablanca well , no one is exactly shocked major league baseball s extended , expensive , selfcongratulatory hand wringing turns out to be merely a hand washing yes , there was wrongdoing yes , there were culprits all around , from those who used performanceenhancing drugs to those who stood silently by some suspected miscreants were identified by name , but these were only players and trainers , not owners or a commissioner with collective guilt it would be imprudent , the mitchell report suggests , to discipline players if all parties are guilty none is , or at least none will pay a price unless bud selig , commissioner of baseball , believes the conduct is so serious that discipline is necessary to maintain the integrity of the game channeling judge landis , the commissioner donned the robe his report is a call to action , and i will act punishments will be taken on a casebycase basis enough already we are accustomed to public displays of hypocrisy from our government and our major corporations , but we like to think that baseball will be truthful , direct , real the reality of the current marionette show is that mlb did not wish to end the steroid mess by commissioning this report , it only wished to stop talking about it the report s author could as well have been margaret mitchell as george , because this era is gone with the wind steroids have given way to the undetectable human growth hormone , and when a reliable test for that substance emerges , the cheaters will be on to the next new thing prohibiting the use of a substance does not prohibit the underlying urge remember the volstead act \? and the culture of cheating in baseball is a long and largely honorable one cooperstown opened its doors wide to gaylord perry , whitey ford , john mcgraw and others whose disrespect for the rules inspired public admiration , not contempt i am reminded of the old starkist tuna commercial in which charlie the tuna , wearing a beret and stationed at an easel with paintbrush in hand , is reproved by an invisible voice , no , charlie , we don t want you to have good taste , we only want you to taste good what we ought to want from our baseball players is not that they be good , only that they give us a good show naming names while recommending virtual amnesty , mitchell has selig in a hard place by taking any disciplinary action based upon the mitchell melange of hard evidence and hearsay , the commissioner may embroil baseball \( and the sports pages \) in years of arbitration , libel actions , and general intramural warfare he ought to clue in to the hypocrisy of the fans and do as we all secretly wish him to do , no matter what we may say scrape our shoes of the matter and get back to baseball
