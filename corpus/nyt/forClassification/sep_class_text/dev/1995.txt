miami , jan 29 49ers running back ricky watters said he went around last week telling everyone that he was going to score three touchdowns against san diego in the super bowl after the game there was n't anyone around , other than watters , to verify that you can ask my mom , watters said watters scored touchdowns on a 51yard pass in the first quarter , an 8yard pass in the second quarter and a 9yard run in the third quarter it was his 51yard touchdown reception that made it 140 and set the 49ers' rout in motion and it was his 9yard touchdown run that made it 3510 and broke the chargers' backs after the game , watters , who rushed for 47 yards on 15 carries and caught 3 passes for 61 yards , could n't believe the 49ers had actually won i feel like i'm dreaming and when i wake up we 'll still have to play the game , he said even though the 49ers did n't start the game with a strong rushing attack , they were able to sell the chargers on the threat enough that san diego s linebackers bit on playaction fakes that s how watters scored his first touchdown we had a great play fake by bar none , he said , referring to the nickname for fullback william floyd that sucked the linebackers in and before they could react i had the ball the rest was godgiven ability 49ers linebacker ken norton , who had won the two previous super bowls with the dallas cowboys , said each year gets better and better i 'll tell you it s beautiful three rings in a row it s a situation i thought i would never be in when i started out in this league and the fact that i 've been able to keep fighting and be a part of championship teams is a special feeling three in a row is something i never dreamed of i mean , those early dallas years 115 , 313 i 've got it right here on my hands , he said , pointing to his gloves in which no 3 was stitched i think i 'll keep this glove deion sanders , generally a focus of attention , said the game today really did n't revolve around me i handled the guy in front of me steve young proved today that he is probably the greatest quarterback of all time but sanders had a few words of selfpromotion i told you guys from the beginning that i would go to the team that would present me with the best opportunity of winning a super bowl now i look like a genius call from clinton president clinton made the obligatory telephone call to the 49ers' locker room during the presentation of the vince lombardi trophy and said that most people in the country had been rooting for san francisco the whole season was thrilling for all of us and i have n't met a single fan anywhere in america who resents all the success you have had , the president told eddie j debartolo jr , the 49ers' owner that is a rare thing it s a real tribute to you , to the coach and to the players for the way you have won , the way you have conducted yourself we are all happy and proud of you aides said that the president caught a glimpse of the first half before attending a

sports wager in the united states the unidentified man walked into the mirage casino hotel in las vegas , nev , on saturday and bet on the money line , where there s no point spread and the 49ers were a 18 favorite it s a lot of money , but i welcomed it , said jimmy vaccaro , race and sports book director at the mirage san francisco was an 18point favorite to win , the biggest spread in super bowl history but the gambler did not need the 49ers to cover the spread previously , the biggest bet at a united states sports book was 1 million by the las vegas casino owner bob stupak on the cincinnati

miami , jan 26 there was certainly ice to be broken between gary plummer and san francisco 49ers coach george seifert in the last off season when plummer met with the 49ers as a freeagent linebacker considering a new team there was this little matter that happened more than a decade ago plummer was a small , 6foot , 200pound linebacker from ohlone junior college in freemont , calif , who had hopes of signing with the stanford cardinal , where seifert was defensive coordinator one look at plummer and seifert told him , succinctly , that he was not good enough to play at stanford not good enough to play in the pac10 conference and that was that plummer was crushed he wound up at california , as a walkon , and played nose tackle after college , he played for three seasons as a linebacker for the oakland invaders in the united states football league after the usfl folded in 1986 , he signed as a free agent with the san diego chargers and played with them for eight seasons and then last year , seifert came calling all of my life i had been told i was not big enough , not fast enough , not quick enough , not strong enough , plummer said and then this guy makes that judgment just from looking at me i hated his guts for years it was total hatred and anger and when we first met last year when i visited the 49ers he said 'you may not have been good enough to play at stanford , but you 're good enough to play for the 49ers' that was nice that helped break the ice and plummer set about breaking up offenses for san francisco he has been a solid addition to the 49ers' revitalized defense he was fifth in tackles with 55 he leads the team in postseason tackles with 18 he is 62 , 247 pounds now he is solid inside as a runstuffer , having helped turn the 49ers into the league s no 2 run defense just as his career has come full circle with seifert , the same can be said of meeting the chargers in super bowl xxix once i signed with the 49ers , it was , see you in miami in january , ' said plummer , who reached age 35 today i knew we 'd be here i was n't sure about them football had become drudgery in san diego you go 412 and 610 a lot and you are not having fun there were games that were lost and guys would be drinking on the plane on the way home and smoking and playing cards and flirting with the flight attendants it was a bad scene they have turned around that s a lot due to coach bobby ross i called coach ross twice this season i care for him he s the best coach i ever played for and now ross is designing an offensive game plan that must account for blocking plummer in the biggest game of their careers whatever that plan is , it must be one full of physical and persistent attack when the ball comes plummer s way he is nimble , and credits martial arts as helping to make him more so he is not easily moved or fooled and as he has shown throughout his football career , if you are fortunate enough to knock him down once , he is twice as dangerous the second time around just ask the 49ers' running backs , ricky watters and william floyd me and ken norton were knocking the heck out of watters in training camp , plummer recalled , laughing he 'd bounce up and gripe all day we started asking him , 'do you want a little cheese with your whine \? ' a lot of teams knew they could hit ricky hard and upset him and argue with him and get him off his game but i think this season , you 've seen ricky handle that the best in his career his focus is great now maybe we 're a part of the reason floyd , he came in here the big rookie , talking about being the best , bar none he went to block me on a play and my helmet flew off he kept driving i ripped him across the face he came back and gave me a rip i thought , this guy is a rookie and he s not backing down to a veteran here that was good we knew he 'd be all right right then few thought plummer would amount to much in football but he was determined , with a nasty football streak to boot seifert s initial snub was not plummer s first and it would not be his last but he has found life and football with the 49ers grand and now , finally , he has found the perfect football home along the way , he spiced the 49ers' defense with a rich , gettheheckoutofmyway attitude it was missing for a few days late in the season our practice field at the complex was too wet to practice on , plummer said so , we went to the stanford field to practice george walks up and says , 'this is sacred ground to you , huh \? ' i turned around and spat on the field photo 49ers' gary plummer has time to get a little tan as his team worked out this week in miami for super bowl game against san diego on sunday \( reuters \)
it is , perhaps , someday soon a week from now , two weeks , a month , it is finally that unpostponable morning after that follows an unthinkable cancellation of the season the exhilaration of those final frantic hours when , as owner or player , you stood proudly with your brethren and did what you had to do , is gone now it is done now nothing about hockey matters until september it is 5 years from now , or 10 , and every year after that you are a former player or owner , commissioner or executive director you are a doer by nature no thought sits long undirected in your mind , no feeling unchanneled , uncontrolled but every time you see the line 199495 \( no season \) you wince you scramble and cover the wince , explaining to that holdout part of you why it happened , had to happen , how it was better that way , but you can never explain well enough you see it you wince three days after , 5 or 10 years after , every year after that , was it worth it \? even remembering all the details of that time , everything that made you do what you did , but knowing the rest , too , would you still do it \? forget the effect on fans , sponsors , bottom lines and bank statements those you can argue any way you want what about on you \? how does it make you feel about you \? it is now the owners , until yesterday , had been insisting on a salary cap or payroll tax the players had refused there was no common ground , no basis for agreement everybody was doing his job gary bettman s was to get labor peace for the owners under a formula in which player salaries rise less precipitously bob goodenow s was to build a player union strong and unified enough to resist , to allow the market to take salaries where they go the problem needed only a nudge to start whose push turned to whose shove did n't matter as with most strikes and lockouts , both sides wanted a fight now , in light of yesterday s new offer by the owners , the question is do the two sides finally want to stop \? issues do n't divide , attitudes do a partly cloudy day is mostly sunny if you decide to see it that way when there is a will for war , fighting happens when there is a will for peace , it stops what can turn hockey s will for division into a will for agreement \? the fans have been remarkably patient supposedly passionate about their game and teams , they have done little picketing , issued few threats of future boycott perhaps it is because settlement \( to them \) has always seemed imminent perhaps because for so long , the alternative game has seemed almost as exciting showdown meetings , team player against team owner , expressions of solidarity , not much that had play of the day potential , but something to talk about yet the fans have been patient because they know their place players and owners can choose to play , or not play the power is in their hands , and fans know that they do not like it , but it s a power they respect and between the fans , the players and the owners , some unexpressed bargain seems to have been struck how much of a season you give me , a fan says , is your right that you give me a season , is mine not because i have any power over that , but because it is right break the bargain , break the patience a sport seems unimaginably important during the early days of a strike or lockout as days pass , it becomes clear how much greater fantasy is to any reality life does go on call the bluff , and you may get an answer you do n't want to hear what we always assumed was passion may have only been habit but the will to agreement needs a way , and the players and owners , until now , have found none it may be they have been looking in the wrong place they want to put this unrelenting squabbling behind them they 're tired , the fans are tired everyone needs to get on with it always fighting over who gets what share of the pie , they need peace to grow that pie years of it ! but what is the formula , appropriate now , flexible enough to apply to all the changes of later , that both sides can live with \? basketball thought it had one now its players do n't think so , and they play the nba season looking for something new football and baseball are looking , too it s not there ! that s the message of the length and vehemence of the baseball and hockey labor disputes history is moving in the players' direction the owners want to stop the clock for them , the future seems an impossibly difficult place next year is one thing two , three , four years from now , they can see where the players are going and they ca n't see how they can get there themselves but history is n't lived in fouryear chunks today , you manage tomorrow , you find a way and tomorrow after that there is no way that every baseball team in 1975 could survive this free agency era that has followed , and yet every team has the business of sport is changing too rapidly the formula as solution is an illusion longterm interests , from the perspective of now , are too divided if the search for formula continues through negotiation and seasons await the outcome , there will be no seasons there is n't one team that ca n't survive until next year focus on fouryear deals to put trouble behind you , and you put nothing but trouble in front of you a four , five or sixyear focus turns things ideological , hypothetical , rhetorical , makes the possible impossible yesterday s formula was power , and the owners had it now in all sports , there is a growing balance it is hard to break the other guy , bring him to your way of thinking unless it is his way of thinking , too deciding there must be either peace or war is disastrous there is nothing wrong with muddling along maybe there will come a time when more is possible if not , the parties still will have survived , the games will be played and muddling along also forces players and owners to muddle together in time , perhaps they will come to understand , trust , respect and get respect back , to work together and produce through the back door what neither side would tolerate through the front some form of cooperation it was time to fight now , it s time to play time for gary bettman s and bob goodenow s job to be defined differently so that success for each is measured in a season played , in the 1995 stanley cup being won so that neither side forces the other to carry the can of a bad deal , days and years later , having to wince even harder at that great performers in any activity have a sense of timing now , they realize , is when the game is being won and lost , now is when the big hit must be made , the goal must be scored now is when the deal must be done drawing
a federal prosecutor pointed to a blind , stooped muslim cleric in a manhattan courtroom yesterday and declared that he had led a war of terrorism against the united states that included the bombing of the world trade center , plots for other bombings and the assassination of a jewish militant the cleric , sheik omar abdel rahman , called himself the servant of god but told his followers that the muslim struggle against enemies was to be waged with the sword , the cannon , the missile , said the prosecutor , assistant united states attorney patrick fitzgerald and in mr abdel rahman s mind , mr fitzgerald said , the united states was one of islam s main enemies beginning what are expected to be two weeks of closing arguments in the eightmonthold trial of mr abdel rahman and nine other men in federal district court in manhattan , mr fitzgerald described the cleric as a man not concerned that people might be slaughtered in bombings of major buildings , but worried only that blowing up certain buildings , such as united nations headquarters , would be bad public relations , bad press for muslims mr abdel rahman , a fiery fundamentalist who came to the united states from egypt five years ago , and his nine codefendants are charged in biggest terrorism trial ever in an american court with being part of a muslim group that waged a threeyear campaign of terrorism aimed at intimidating the united states into changing middle eastern policies that it believed favored israel and the egyptian government during the trial , mr abdel rahman s lawyers have readily admitted that he advocated violent revolution in his homeland because of the egyptian government s secular outlook and strong ties to the united states but the lawyers have maintained that he never conspired to commit violence in the united states and that he is the victim of a trumpedup case the other defendants have also said that they were set up , and have argued that the prosecution has falsely linked separate crimes and charges of crimes to create an overarching conspiracy that never existed but in the first of two days of closing arguments for the prosecution , mr fitzgerald recalled details from testimony by more than 200 witnesses and more than 100 hours of conversations secretly recorded by the federal bureau of investigation and an informer to back up its case he argued that the bombing of the world trade center in february 1993 , which killed six people , and the murder of rabbi meir kahane , the jewish militant killed at a manhattan hotel in november 1990 , were part of one overall conspiracy so were plots , he said , to bomb additional targets in 1993 such as the united nations headquarters and the lincoln and holland tunnels one of mr abdel rahman s codefendants , el sayyid a nosair , is charged in this trial with being the gunman who killed the rabbi , as well as with conspiring in the bombing plots mr nosair was acquitted of murder in a 1991 state trial , but was convicted of assault and other charges and was sentenced to up to 22 years in prison using charts and other visual aids as he tried to hold the jury s attention , mr fitzgerald urged the jury not to be misled by the fact that none of the defendants were accused of helping to carry out the trade center bombing four other men were convicted of that bombing when a regular army fights a war , different people fight different battles , he said , arguing that the men now on trial were plotting to bomb the other sites
five years ago , nathan r cushman was considering moving the family dairy operation from lebanon to upstate new york , where it costs less to farm but since then he s added hundreds of acres to the farm s holdings , constructed a huge barn off route 87 , and nearly doubled the size of his herd , to more than 1 , 200 cows what made the difference was the state s farmland preservation program , mr cushman said the state department of agriculture has invested heavily in lebanon , acquiring conservation easements for nine farms and a total of 2 , 433 acres in the rural eastern connecticut town if there s was n't a program like that , we really would have been forced to go , because we would n't have been able to afford the additional land , mr cushman said dairy farms need a large amount of land to grow corn and hay for the cows so far the farmland preservation program has helped 162 farms , totaling 24 , 650 acres it remains popular with farmers , as evidenced by 130 applications to enter the 17yearold program , and new ones filed at a rate of two or three a month as the program matures , its focus has been honed rather than trying to save , say , the last farm in a suburbanized area , it is concentrating on stretches where agriculture is still thriving , and can continue rather than just preserving the token farm in an area , they 're looking at preserving clusters of farms , said walter e welz , executive director of the connecticut farm bureau that s the intelligent approach farmers cannot exist as islands joseph j dippel , director of the program , agreed farmers make their own best neighbors , as opposed to suburbs where people are more likely to complain about odors or strays he also said that preserving clusters of agriculture preserves seed , fertilizer and equipment dealers as well as a result of the department s focus , most of the farms in the program are now either in litchfield county \( 39 farms \) , the connecticut river valley \( 40 farms \) or eastern connecticut \( 67 farms \) the program , authorized by the legislature in 1978 , does not purchase farms outright instead , the state acquires the development rights to the farm so far the state has spent 76 million on the program , which works out to just under 3 , 000 per acre , a 20 percent savings over the average appraised value of the development rights the farmer still holds the land title , so the state does not have to maintain it , and the farmer continues to pay local property taxes but the land can not be sold for development building must be agriculturerelated , such as barns or storage sheds , and cannot cover more than 5 percent of the property mr cushman , who has applied to put another 386 acres into the preservation program , said that with support from the program farmers can put their money into more productive assets , like equipment , a larger herd or a better milking parlor you can lease land to keep down your capital costs , but then you never know from year to year if you 're going to have enough land to feed your herd , mr cushman explained if the owner gets an offer to sell the land for development , it could be gone before you put in your next crop david t armstrong , who put his 225acre nursery in suffield into the program , said specialty agriculture can be viable in connecticut without the program but he says there is another reason farmers sell their development rights many farmers see it as the only way to make sure what they have built up will not disappear when they are gone farmers develop a certain emotional attachment to their properties , mr armstrong said this is one way to keep it the way you like it you might think your property is beautiful the way it is , but eventually you 'll be gone and your kids might not see it that way for the same reason , many municipal officials support farmland preservation lebanon first selectwoman joyce r okonuk , a lifelong resident of that town , said when she was growing up most families had a small farm today the bulk of active farmland in town is the 2 , 433 acres in the preservation program if that land had become subdivisions or large developments the town would have lost its rural character , mrs okonuk said we 've seen that happen in other towns around us right now the community is a good blend of farming and residential properties that s what makes the town unique in her opinion , development is good , but it has to happen at a rate that the town can control the encroachment of the suburbs on rural communities like lebanon has required some adjustments by farmers and by their new neighbors , mrs okonuk said but the fact that townspeople supported construction of a regional vocationalagriculture center at its new high school is evidence that farming is still accepted there have been a few folk who 've had some difficulty adjusting , mrs okonuk said but for the most part they 're adapting , and they 're thankful that farming is surviving in town and i think it s important that you remember , when you 're eating that ear of corn or drinking that glass of milk , how it got to the market the preservation program does not require that the land remain in active agricultural use , so farmers have the option , if their operations are not profitable , of letting the land go fallow
absolut is going hollywood but , characteristically , with a twist in an innovative advertising and media partnership program , the seagram company , which markets absolut , the nation s bestselling imported vodka , is becoming the lead sponsor of a quarterly publication created by a unit of entertainment weekly magazine , which will be devoted to independent film such films , produced outside the realm of the giant corporate studios , are typically made for sums that would barely cover the dramamine bill for the cast or crew of waterworld they 've become increasingly popular with moviegoers , as boxoffice receipts for the likes of pulp fiction , the crying game and like water for chocolate attest five companies that specialize in those films , including fine line features and miramax films a cable television network dedicated to them , and the designer gianni versace are teaming with absolut as additional sponsors of independents , as the publication is being titled their commitment is for two years beginning on aug 31 , independents will be distributed free in theaters specializing in socalled art house films as well as at independentfilm festivals and to new subscribers of the cable network , the independent film channel , which is owned by the cablevision systems corporation plans call for one million copies of each issue to be given away each quarter independent film has crossed over , marian schwindeman , executive vice president for marketing and business development at entertainment weekly in new york , said yesterday and there seems to be more awareness in the ad community that independent film is reaching large numbers of consumers ms schwindeman is also executive director of entertainment weekly ventures , a unit that the magazine , owned by time warner inc , formed in january to offer advertisers socalled addedvalue marketing programs she provided a sneak preview of independents before a news conference scheduled for tonight at the walter reade theater in lincoln center the genesis of the publication was a proposal made a year or so ago by entertainment weekly at an annual media meeting held by executives of absolut and tbwa advertising , the brand s agency since 1980 the meetings , known throughout the media industry by their nickname , the media marathon , offer magazines and newspapers the opportunity to present ideas for absolut advertisements to supplement the wittily stylish campaign from tbwa , a unit of the omnicom group it happened to coincide with something we were talking about , said claude p fromm , executive vice president and media director of tbwa in new york , to get some association for absolut with film to accompany the brand s popular series of advertisements tied to art , fashion and music independents will complement a group of moviethemed ads by tbwa , he added , including absolut hollywood \( the bottle as a film star \) and absolut marilyn \( a tribute to marilyn monroe \) , as well as a project the agency is developing with the american film institute to support film preservation robert bernstein , national marketing manager for absolut at the house of seagram unit of seagram in new york , said film is a new door we 're opening up that we think is right for the brand and we look for areas for absolut to enter to match the personality of the brand , cuttingedge and ahead of the curve that s independent film the program faces two potential stumbling blocks because independents is being given away rather than sold , readers might disdain it as the publishing equivalent of a movie that goes straight to video that s a difficulty encountered by previous free movie publications like preview , which ms schwindeman supervised at premiere magazine , and moviegoer , which was produced by the 1330 corporation for the r j reynolds tobacco company that s always a consideration , mr fromm said , but we think of it like playbill , not a freebie , giveaway publication but as something of value the other problem is a conflictofinterest issue five sponsors of independents release films the publication will cover fine line , owned by turner broadcasting system miramax , part of the walt disney company fox searchlight , a unit of the news corporation gramercy pictures , and sony pictures classics , part of the sony corporation and seagram owns 80 percent of mca inc , the parent of universal pictures a partner with polygram nv in gramercy in fact , a scene from a new gramercy film , the usual suspects , appears on the cover of the first issue of independents the majority of our coverage goes to the five independent partners , ms schwindeman said , because they account for more than 90 percent of the independent film market but none of our partners have editorial approval or see anything prior to printing , she added some did n't like that ms schwindeman , mr fromm and mr bernstein declined to discuss financial aspects of independents , though they disputed a report in the hollywood reporter that the program would cost 600 , 000 half to be paid by absolut and the other half by the other sponsors photo in a partnership of media and advertising , absolut vodka is the lead sponsor of independents , a quarterly magazine about independent film the first issue features actors in fall releases like the usual suspects \( entertainment

mexico city ricarda martinez , a 60yearold mexican peasant living in a tumbledown shack on the edge of mexico city , says she s never heard of wall street and does n't know anything about dollarlinked peso bonds , george soros or merrill lynch s emerging markets fund peeling cactus from her garden , she insists that none of those strangesounding names could possibly explain what she does know , which is that she ca n't afford to buy meat anymore , and that mexico is now different now we are poor mrs martinez is right mexico today is different , but it is because mexico has been hit with a financial neutron bomb , launched by the very forces mrs martinez has never heard of as with any neutron bomb , all the buildings have been left standing but the people have been financially devastated overnight , the mexican economy has shrunk from a size large to a size small , without ever stopping at medium if i were a political scientist , i would be down here now taking notes , because there is something very old about mexico s crisis , but also something very new what is old is the fact that mexico , like many other countries , got hooked on cash from foreign investors to finance its development , because it had a low savings rate at home mexico promised those investors high interest and a fixedrate peso but to keep that promise it had to curb spending at home and when it could n't , the peso was devalued without warning what is new are three things the massive amount of private foreign cash that mexico had grown dependent upon , the speed at which global investors could withdraw those funds when they suddenly decided they did n't like mexican policies , and the interdependence of mexico and other global economies , which meant that when mexico s currency crumbled many global investors bailed out of all emerging markets , dragging down everything from the thai baht to the argentine peso that is why the mexican meltdown of 1995 is the first postmodern economic crisis ricarda martinez meets merrill lynch what interests me most , though , is the political implications of a world in which nations increasingly feel inferior to markets mexican officials today speak like defeated generals give us a truce , said finance minister guillermo ortiz , addressing the global markets you have pounded us to death stop selling us short asked what it is like to be caught in the maw of the global markets , mr ortiz gestures to the three computer screens next to his desk that track the peso i have days when i feel absolutely powerless sometimes i have to go work in the other room so that i can concentrate away from the screens a stunned official of mexico s central bank asked me about the global markets why were they so mad \? why the vengeance \? because , i told him , hell hath no fury like a bond trader with a cell phone who just saw his investment devalued enrique del val blanco , an official of mexico s human services ministry , sounded like a man living through invasion of the body snatchers he told me everyone feels their life is determined by someone outside , and everyone wants to know who is this person \? who is this force \? we thought that we were on the path to the first world and suddenly something went wrong one minute the world bank and imf were saying mexico was the best example now we are the worst example what did we do \? we are losing control if we do n't find another type of development , we are finished we surrender across town at the los pinos presidential palace , president ernesto zedillo is sitting at a table in his office tchaikovsky s 1812 overture is playing in the background i wonder to myself whether the music is meant to fortify him for another duel with the bond market unlike mrs martinez , mr zedillo has met merrill lynch once too often the speed at which international markets have evolved over the last 25 years has been much faster than the capacity of governments and international organizations to cope , said mr zedillo the boom was built very quickly , and nobody was looking at it certainly we were not we have to start thinking about a global arrangement that would prevent the sort of things we are now enduring

those days are over ten years ago , at staterun clinics , actresses and cleaning ladies alike could get face lifts , eye lifts and nose jobs for less than 100 now , such operations cost 10 times as much , and the russian clientele for cosmetic surgery is mainly made up of the new rich wives , girlfriends and sometimes gangstersturnedbusinessmen who fashion their own witness protection programs by radically altering their looks some of the top surgeons who toiled in soviet plastic surgery assembly lines for factoryworker wages are building thriving private practices a few of the best are finding that clients from italy , germany , britain and even the united states are showing up at their doors , requesting liposuction , eye lifts and breast implants , which are increasingly costly and controversial in the west to clients from the west , such operations are inexpensive , and they are unencumbered by consent forms or ethical questions surgeons in the west work in a very rigid frame , said igor a volf , one of russia s bestknown and prolific plastic surgeons they are afraid of being sued by their patients they fear complications , they fear leaving bruises he added proudly , i do the big , bold operations western doctors are afraid to do a growing number of european customers are not afraid to trust him he is a genius , a god , said a wealthy 65yearold finnish patient , who went to dr volf recently to have her face , eyes and neck done and who spoke on condition of anonymity i look 30 years younger i have traveled all over the world , and i can afford to have this done anywhere but dr volf is the best , said the finnish patient , who owns a beauty salon in helsinki russian women should put his face in an icon and pray to him some russian women can afford the best cosmetic surgery in the west , but they prefer the east fashionconscious raisa gorbachev , for example , had a face lift performed not long ago by vladimir a vissarionov , a highly respected plastic surgeon who is based in yekaterinburg , but who also works out of the prestigious kremlin hospital in moscow i am very happy about the positive evaluation , dr vissarionov said with a laugh when told that the wife of the last soviet leader looked years younger but this is a personal matter that should not be discussed the finnish patient said a friend in amsterdam told her about dr volf her total expenses , including three procedures , medication , a 12day stay in the clinic , food and transportation from helsinki , was about 2 , 500 it s embarrassingly cheap , she said with a giggle in the us just the face lift alone would have cost me 12 , 000 the patient said she awoke from the surgery to discover that dr volf had treated her to a surprise he had reshaped her ear lobes i had such ugly lobes before , but i never even thought of having them done , she said he noticed and just decided to do it she said that dr volf s brand of impulsive creativity was what distinguished russian surgeons from those in the west american doctors would never take the risk of not asking , and they would always charge extra medical malpractice suits are extremely rare in russia most doctors do not bother with liability insurance and though letterstotheeditor pages of newspapers are filled with horror stories , mostly from women recounting botched jobs or dire complications , dissatisfied patients have little recourse mr volf , who has done more than 16 , 000 face lifts in the past 20 years , charges about 500 a procedure most of it goes to the clinic where he works , a former state institution that is now owned by a private company that has done little to update the bleak sovietera furnishings no diplomas clutter the walls of dr volf s office , which is shabby , with nylon flowered curtains in the window and linoleum floors though showing signs of wear , his operating room has uptodate equipment he said he can buy all the plasma and medical supplies he needs , including silicone breast implants , from europe but the walls are peeling , nurses use vinegar as a disinfectant and disposable rubber gloves are carefully washed and reused the bathrooms were horrible , the finnish client confided but i would put up with far worse to be this beautiful dr volf , 47 , a cheerful , stocky man with a black beard and a warm , engaging manner , draws clients from all over europe , as word of his expertise travels during the interview , a tall elegant woman from verona , italy , wearing dark glasses and a silk scarf over her head , awaited a consultation in the bleak outer office i had four ladies from verona last month , dr volf said with a laugh and none of them was a juliet not all of his clients are women i 've had socalled businessmen who came to me because they want to become legitimate , he said they do n't want their former jailmates to recognize them dr volf , who is studying to pass an italian equivalency exam , has a lucrative offer to work in a private clinic in sardinia he also plans to open his own small , private clinic in moscow next year i do about 200 face lifts a year , and about as many breast augmentations , he said with a grin all women want to be beautiful i work like a horse photo more westerners are seeking plastic surgery in russia , where the operations are inexpensive and unencumbered by consent forms i do the

washington , aug 4 in their most detailed explanation of the whitewater affair , the clintons have insisted in sworn statements that they were passive investors who had no idea that their partner in the real estate venture was paying a disproportionate share of its losses the white house today made public written replies by president clinton and hillary rodham clinton to dozens of detailed questions from federal investigators examining the collapse of madison guaranty , the arkansas savings and loan owned by james mcdougal , the couple s partner in the whitewater investment the release of the documents came three days before the start of house banking committee hearings that will examine what political and financial favors mr mcdougal did for the clintons and what , if anything , they did for him in return in recent weeks , the white house has given reporters potentially embarrassing documents before the republicancontrolled committees in the house and senate could do so themselves separately today , the resolution trust corporation , the federal agency that deals with failed savings and loans , released a report by its inspector general that was critical of the little rock law firm where mrs clinton had been a partner it said the rose law firm had repeatedly failed to disclose possible and actual conflicts of interest to the federal regulators that hired it , an accusation that the firm denies the firm s work for madison was a primary focus of the report when the whitewater investment was foundering in the mid1980 s , mr clinton was governor of arkansas and mr mcdougal was a banker and real estate developer with a myriad of issues before state regulators a federal investigation has found that mr mcdougal paid 158 , 000 of whitewater s nearly 200 , 000 in losses the sworn statements submitted by the clintons in may are liberally sprinkled with the phrases i do not know and i do not recall the couple acknowledged that whitewater began as a 5050 investment in which the clintons and mr mcdougal and his wife , susan , were equally liable for its debts the clintons said they relied on mr mcdougal to ask them when additional money was needed from the clintons' account , the investment appears to have been handled casually the couple never visited the property before buying it the whitewater corporation was set up with only sketchy documentation of who owned its shares loans and a retainer mr clinton denied that he pressured a small business administration lending company to make an illegal 300 , 000 loan , as one witness in the whitewater inquiry has asserted and he said he knew little about an april 1985 fundraising event staged by mr mcdougal that raised money to pay off some of his campaign debts mr clinton acknowledged that he might have discussed madison s plight with the state s chief regulator for savings and loans , but said that he did not recall such a conversation investigators asked the clintons about a 5 , 000 personal loan mr clinton took out from an arkansas bank in 1979 the whitewater company provided the money that repaid the loan , whose purpose has never been clear mr clinton said in his written statement that he could not remember why he had borrowed the money mr mcdougal wrote to mr clinton in 1982 that you are correct in your belief that the sum of money borrowed was part of your investment in whitewater none of the various investigations of the investment have ever been able to substantiate that claim on one important issue the question of how madison guaranty came to pay the rose law firm a 2 , 000 monthly retainer the first lady s recollection appears to be at odds with previous statements by other participants mr mcdougal has said in interviews that madison , which already had several other lawyers , retained the rose firm after mr clinton asked him to do so as mr mcdougal told the story , mr clinton jogged over to madison s offices on a hot summer day in 1984 and complained about the couple s lack of money the governor relaxed in a leather chair and the two men traded ribald stories , mr mcdougal recalled in a 1992 interview when asked in 1992 whether mr clinton had ever discussed with mr mcdougal that madison retain the rose firm , the clinton campaign issued a written statement saying that he had not according to people familiar with the separate inquiry by the independent special counsel kenneth w starr , federal agents have interviewed a witness who claims to have overheard the conversation , and who supports mr mcdougal s version of events mrs clinton tells quite a different story asked by rtc investigators to explain which lawyer at the rose firm brought in madison as a client , mrs clinton answered that a firstyear lawyer who had just passed the bar exam had been contacted by one of madison s executives mrs clinton wrote that the firm was reluctant to take on mr mcdougal as a client because he had not paid bills for previous legal work at the firm but the junior lawyer , richard massey , said in a 1992 interview that he did not know how or why the firm was put on retainer by madison he repeated that explanation in his 1994 meeting with federal investigators , according to the record of the interview another former partner in the rose firm , webster l hubbell , testified before the senate whitewater committee last month that both mrs clinton and mr massey had recruited madison as a client
washington , nov 6 in a widening of the latest scandal at the united states naval academy , two dozen midshipmen were implicated today in the sale or use of drugs , including lsd and marijuana , academy officials said five suspected of peddling drugs to their classmates face possible courtsmartial , while as many as 19 others could be dismissed for using drugs , according to a statement issued by the academy in annapolis , md for an institution struggling to repair its reputation after scandals over sexual harassment and cheating on exams , the disclosure that 24 of its 4 , 000 students are suspected of using or selling contraband is a body blow for the institution and adm charles r larson , the fourstar admiral who was summoned in 1994 to clean up the academy even more disheartening , one senior official said , is that the majority of the midshipmen implicated are juniors and seniors , students who ought to know the rules better than anyone my initial reaction is disappointment , said benjamin montoya , a retired navy rear admiral and academy graduate who is a member of the institution s governing board it s disappointing when any young person is under investigation for these kind of allegations , but it s dismaying because of the quality of people we recruit and admit to the academy admiral montoya said the investigation would be a top priority at the meeting in annapolis next monday of the board of visitors , the governing body two midshipmen were caught with lsd last month , prompting an unprecedented order that all 4 , 000 midshipmen be tested for drugs academy officials have tried to play down the incident since then , and even today an academy spokesman sought to focus on the little positive news at hand we are obviously disappointed that this situation could occur here , said the spokesman , capt tom jurkowsky however , upon suspecting use of illicit drugs by some midshipmen , we worked closely with the naval criminal investigative service and took swift action by undergoing a full urinalysis under the navy s zerotolerance policy , midshipmen found to have taken illegal drugs face nearly certain expulsion only two midshipmen have been expelled in the last two and a half years for drugrelated incidents , one of them a new arrival who failed a drug test on his first day at the academy , captain jurkowsky said we are dealing with young people , and young people make mistakes , captain jurkowsky said but people here , unlike at other institutions , know what the consequences are going into this they know what the naval academy s policy is at the air force academy in colorado springs , four cadets have been dismissed for drugrelated incidents since 1991 and at the united states military academy at west point , ny , seven cadets have been dismissed for using or selling drugs since 1992 the apprehension of the two midshipmen on oct 15 set off a twotracked investigation on that day and the next , all 4 , 000 midshipmen were tested for illicit drugs marijuana , cocaine , lsd , amphetamines and heroin by urinalysis at the same time , about two dozen agents from the naval criminal investigative service began interviewing scores of midshipmen the academy said today that none of the students tested positive in the drug screening , which was performed by a navy laboratory near chicago instead , the evidence for administrative and potential criminal proceedings was gathered through the interrogations , navy officials said some ratted on each other , fearing the results of the drug test , one navy official said now they 're probably sorry they did navy officials said lsd passes through a person s system in 12 to 48 hours , while traces of marijuana remain longer the officials said the effectiveness of the urine testing depended on what kind of drug was used , how much was used and how recently it was taken captain jurkowsky said that within four weeks military lawyers would begin a process similar to a civilian grand jury inquiry to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to press criminal charges against the five midshipmen suspected of selling drugs within about two weeks , the spokesman said , a separate group of academy officials will evaluate the evidence gathered by navy investigators to determine whether to recommend administrative punishment for the 19 other midshipmen the commandant of the academy , capt randy bogle , and the superintendent , admiral larson , would have to sign off on any punishment , including dismissal the drug scandal is the latest misfortune for the academy , which has trained many of the nation s top navy and marine corps officers for 150 years the academy s reputation suffered in 1989 when at least eight male midshipmen handcuffed a female midshipman to a urinal three years later , 71 students were found to have cheated on an electrical engineering test , and 24 of them were expelled
eola , tex the united states department of agriculture is distributing millions of dollars to texas cotton farmers hit by a crop disaster that two of the department s scientists say was brought on by a boll weevil eradication program financed in part by federal money many farmers in the affected areas are outraged over the devastation , and they are circulating a petition to end the program other farmers have filed a suit aimed at abolishing the foundation that sponsors the program but federal and state agriculture officials dispute the scientists' assertion , made in a report on sept 18 , and have ordered a new study to determine what they say is the real cause the eradication program covered only about a tenth of the cotton crop in texas , the nation s biggest producer with 57 million acres under cultivation each year , but agriculture officials hope to expand the plan throughout the state the blight , an infestation of the beet armyworm , will cost cotton farmers in the rio grande valley , in the southernmost part of the state , and in the san angelo region in westcentral texas , more than 200 million this year , state agriculture officials estimate a total of about 500 , 000 acres of cotton were planted in the two areas , the only ones where the new eradication program was in effect , and an estimated 90 percent of the crop was lost in the rio grande valley and more than half in the san angelo region the two government scientists , entomologists at the agriculture department s agricultural research service in weslaco , tex , attributed most of the problem to the texas boll weevil eradication foundation , a program created by the texas legislature in 1993 to rid the state of the weevil with the pesticide malathion the program received 39 million in equipment , personnel and cash this year from the federal department of agriculture that was about a quarter of the foundation s financing , with the remainder coming from an assessment on farmers previously , the boll weevil , along with other pests , destroyed only about 5 percent of the texas cotton crop annually before the eradication program was put into effect in the two areas , farmers there were spending an average of about 30 an acre on pesticide to control the boll weevil while the weevil populations were practically eliminated in the rio grande valley and the san angelo region , the beet armyworm was not suppressed the two scientists who conducted the study , k r summy and j r raulston , concluded that the heavy use of pesticide , including the application of malathion for boll weevil eradication , was the primary causal factor for the beet armyworm outbreak in the rio grande valley the two , who are now completing a survey of the san angelo cotton area , say their data suggest that malathion is the most likely culprit for the blight in that region as well mr summy and mr raulston said the malathion caused a disruption of the beneficial insect complex that normally suppresses the beet armyworm or as earnest gesch , who stands to lose 100 , 000 on 480 acres of cotton he planted near here , put it , the malathion applications killed all the beneficial insects if you 've got plenty of beneficials , then the armyworms are n't going to take over , he said karl stauber , an agriculture department under secretary who oversees the agency that employs the two scientists , quickly refuted their report he said the scientists had good anecdotal evidence to support their conclusions , but there s no scientific evidence to support it i'm embarrassed when my scientists make claims that are not based on good science , he added mr stauber said the department had allocated 120 , 000 for a new study to determine the cause of the cotton disaster he said it would be conducted by scientists at the research service s weslaco office but that mr summy and mr raulston would not be involved the boll weevil foundation s executive director , frank myers , also disputed the scientists' report he said low rainfall and a mild winter contributed to the beet armyworm problem we have a lot of reasons for why it did happen , he said there s just no answers scientific opinions do little to console mr gesch , who said that before the malathion applications , he had had the potential for a bumper crop the rains came exactly right this year , he said instead of the crop he had expected , mr gesch said he would have to close out his individual retirement account to pay off his crop loans with help from the agriculture department , several states have eradicated the boll weevil , including north carolina , south carolina , arizona and georgia the boll weevil eradication program came to georgia in the fall of 1987 , said gary herzog , an entomologist at the university of georgia coastal plain experiment station when the program started here , we estimated we were spending 40 per acre on boll weevil control now we are spending none and yields have increased dramatically mr herzog said that farmers often had serious pest problems in the two to four years it took to eradicate the boll weevil in 1988 , he said , we experienced the same scenario you now have in texas maurice lukefahr , a research scientist at rio farms , a nonprofit agricultural research institution near mcallen , tex , said the entomologists' report was accurate anyway you look at it , he said , this was a manmade disaster mr gesch and other cotton farmers are receiving financial assistance from the agriculture department under secretary stauber said 573 million in crop insurance claims had already been allocated to farmers in the areas these payments are on catastrophic crop insurance , which farmers purchase from the government for 50 a crop , regardless of the number of acres they plant secretary of agriculture dan glickman has paved the way for further federal money for the cotton farmers by designating five counties as disaster areas farmers in the counties are now eligible for lowinterest loans through the department on their next cotton crop , which could replace loans by commercial banks farmers along the rio grande say the insurance and disaster funds will not cover their losses they are circulating a petition aimed at ending the eradication program in their region the program was begun in the two regions after farmers with a majority of the cotton acreage voted in favor of it federal and state agriculture officials hope the program will be adopted by all cottongrowing regions in the state but on sept 14 , 10 cotton farmers in northwest texas filed a lawsuit seeking to eliminate the boll weevil foundation , contending that the agency s taxation powers violate the texas constitution next year , the foundation has plans to add another 11 million acres of cotton to the boll weevil eradication effort , and the agriculture department s contribution to the foundation is expected to rise to 5 million under secretary stauber said that he continued to believe in the program it s still fundamentally the right direction to head in , he said photo some cotton farmers in texas agree with two governmentscientists who say that a program to eradicate boll weevils has led to a cropdestroying infestation of beet armyworms earnest gesch checked for armyworms on his land near eola , tex he said he would lose 100 , 000

in the 40 years since marcel marceau first appeared on an american stage , the trademark gestures of the great french mime have lost none of their precision and graceful ethereality the fluttering , seemingly disembodied hands conjure up restless flocks of birds the gaunt , whitepainted face with its hollow eyes and cavernous mouth twists itself into a funnysad parody of the spectrum of human emotion the body stretches out like a longnecked goose attached to an accordion , then shrinks into itself , as joyous expectation collapses into fearful loneliness these impressions and transformations can be seen through sunday at the kaye playhouse at hunter college where mr marceau is giving his first manhattan show in 12 years mr marceau is now 72 , and his smooth , limber performance is a testament to the rejuvenating physical discipline of mime for this engagement , mr marceau has brought along a troupe of nine young performers , la nouvelle compagnie de mimodrame , who join him in the second part of the evening for a wordless adaptation of nikolai gogol s story the overcoat the piece , which mr marceau created in 1951 , suggests an edvard munch painting softened into a series of more gently expressionistic storybook panels during the first half of the show , mr marceau offers more than a halfdozen solo impressions , most of them familiar in the populous public garden , he becomes a statue that steps down from its pedestal , women gossiping on park benches , frisky bikeriding children and an imperious dog that tows its master around on a leash the trial compacts the rituals and characters in a murder trial into a fastforwarded parody of judicial body language and emotive testifying its suggestion that all trials are essentially competitive exercises in theatrical rhetoric seems especially relevant in the age of o j simpson several bits involve mr marceau s signature character , bip , a dreamy esthete who finds his fantasies rudely interrupted by the everyday world in the great artist sketch he is a street violinist whose soaring cadenzas are drowned by a marching band , then copied by another street musician on the mandolin eventually bip gives up , trades in his violin for a cymbal and joins the band for the overcoat the show s most eloquent piece , mr marceau has pared down his sometimes fussy gestural vocabulary to something more primal as akakia akakievitch , gogol s waifish office clerk who works himself to the bone for 10 years to purchase the fur coat of his dreams , only to have it stolen , mr marceau becomes a figure of abject pathos in the piece s most striking moments , the dream of a luxurious overcoat becomes a nightmare of desire in which the character is surrounded by giant fur coats that come alive everyone with whom akakia comes in contact , from his coworkers to the thieves , has a sinister , shadowy aspect his colleagues move in mechanized concert even when celebrating they appear grim and forbidding underscored with wistful europeanstyle carnival music and sound effects of howling wind , the overcoat presents the lone individual as a victim of forces that seem to conspire to crush his spirit and insure a life of wretched shivering solitude , without hope if the overcoat is the closest mr marceau comes to evoking despair , the piece s handsome physical design and its estheticized body language lend it a softening poignancy in venturing so close to the edge , the piece reminds you of elements , like violent rage , passionate sexuality and kinetic athleticism , that are almost completely absent in mr marceau s work instead of celebrating the body , he uses it to peer through the physical world at a shadow play of dreams and emotions that are as fleeting as they are recognizable photo carlos agudeloplata and marcel marceau in the overcoat \( sara krulwich the new york times \)

another you by ann beattie 323 pages alfred a knopf 24 when we first meet marshall and sonja lockard , the husband and wife at the center of ann beattie s arresting new novel another you , they simply feel like older versions of the characters in her earliest fiction aimless , passive folks , afflicted with a freefloating sense of alienation and seemingly doomed to live in a continuous present , exiled from the past and future and cut off from each another sonja has wandered into the real estate business more by chance than inclination and has similarly stumbled into an affair with tony , her charming cad of a boss marshall seems destined to spend the rest of his life teaching english at a small , undistinguished college in new hampshire he has no friends , few ambitions and a lousy sense of self recently , he has retreated into a kind of emotional hibernation he appears more distracted , more detached than ever before years ago , ms beattie would have let things go at that she would have served up some engagingly sadfunnyironic descriptions of marshall and sonja s life and captured their alienation with some bright collections of non sequiturs meant to pass for conversation , all without probing their thoughts or motivations or situating their behavior in some larger moral or historical context with her last few volumes of fiction , however , ms beattie has made a concerted effort to connect the dots of her characters' experiences , to explore consequences and causes it is a method that has resulted in deeper , more emotionally robust fiction , a method that culminates in another you , a novel whose very structure pivots on dark familial secrets in marshall s past although ms beattie s short stories have grown increasingly structured in recent years densely patterned with repeated images and motifs she still does not seem entirely comfortable with the longdistance form of the novel another you relies upon a device reminiscent of the anonymous journal excerpts used in her last novel , picturing will in this case , the device of inserting mysterious letters into the main narrative to hint at the hidden roots of marshall s pain not only draws attention away from the drama of the central story but also underscores ms beattie s willful determination to withhold crucial information from the reader in an effort to create suspense in the end , none of these clumsy narrative pyrotechnics turn out to be the least bit necessary , so vivid are ms beattie s portraits of the lockards indeed , it is these people s stumbling efforts to understand themselves and to cope with the sudden breakdown of their placid lives that commands our attention and that eventually overcomes our irritation with the novel s schematic structure the moment that changes the lockards' lives , the moment that will bizarrely snowball into something large and frightening , seems innocuous enough at the time while driving home in a snowstorm , marshall sees one of his students hitchhiking and pulls over to give her a ride cheryl lanier proceeds to tell marshall an upsetting story about her roommate , livan baker how livan was sexually abused by one of marshall s colleagues , an english professor by the name of jack mccallum cheryl also flirts brazenly with marshall , and he finds himself responding when he stops at a local bar to have a drink with her , he tells his wife a lie that will have serious repercussions marshall s attraction to cheryl , combined with equal amounts of passivity and good will , draws him willynilly into a messy involvement with mccallum , one of those characters who , like rinaldo cantabile in humboldt s gift or alvin pepler in zuckerman unbound , act as a narrative catalyst , as an agent provocateur mccallum will unceremoniously attach himself to marshall and try to convince marshall that he is a victim , not a menace he will go from being marshall s adversary to being his doppelganger , his secret sharer , his nemesis and brother the immediate consequences of their relationship are unexpectedly gruesome marshall inadvertently precipitates a violent argument between mccallum and his wife , who stabs him with a knife in marshall s living room the event lands marshall in a police station for questioning and sends shock waves through his own floundering marriage eventually he will set off on a long soulsearching road trip \( with mccallum , of all people ! \) to visit his brother gordon in key west while marshall s bizarre journey may sound highly contrived in summary , ms beattie makes its oddity seem less like a novelist s attempt to strongarm the fates of her characters than a reflection of marshall s disjointed state of mind and the strangely discontinuous times we live in as usual , her eye for the telling detail records the physical landscape with the accuracy of a video camera she notices those oldfashioned , oldlady handbags that women hold the way children hold buckets of wet sand at the beach the blue earmuffs that hang around sonja s neck like walkman headphones and the halfrusted , sunfaded car that looked like the sort of paint job rich people wanted on their walls now she proves equally adept at delineating the shifting weather of her characters' emotions she describes marshall feeling momentarily pleased like a child taken to look inside a department store window at christmas , seeing a train whizzing around a track , mounds of cotton sprinkled with glitter approximating fallen snow , small lights warming the interiors of each small cottage and she describes marshall as a young boy listening to his ailing mother talk about her impending death and trying to compress himself into a smaller child , flatten himself into one of his paper dolls so he would not be so noticeable in fact , ms beattie demonstrates in another you that she has learned to use her prodigious descriptive skills to conjure up not only the palpable world of things her characters inhabit , but also their inner world of feelings in doing so , she has enriched and broadened her fictional universe and produced a novel that , however flawed , radiates an authentic emotional power if her earlier novels and stories were quickly snapped polaroids , another you is a carefully painted portrait , rich in detail , sympathy and chiaroscuro photo ann beattie \( rollie mckenna alfred a knopf \)
london , nov 25 as a nigerianborn chef working in britain , richard olufeko has encountered plenty of workplace discrimination , including being demoted and then dismissed two years ago from a london restaurant in what a government equalopportunity board later ruled was an act of blatant racism but when it comes to redressing discrimination , mr olufeko is wary of americanstyle affirmative action plans , where jobs can be seen to go to people because of their race or sex although he has some reservations , he broadly supports britain s system , which outlaws employment discrimination generally , but bars the use of quotas or any preference programs to help end bias in hiring and promotion it s important to have a certain number of black people in a workplace to provide representation and encouragement , mr olufeko said but we have to be careful here when you try to force people to do something , it often backfires affirmative action is not yet as hotly debated in europe as it is in the united states but as their populations become more racially and ethnically diverse , and as women demand greater economic opportunities , many european countries are being forced to deal more directly with employment discrimination and while they are still grappling with how to address the issue , there is a growing consensus among governments , employers , unions and groups representing minorities and women that the american model of aggressive affirmative action creates more problems than it solves the european approach , which has generally involved governments' financing training programs , encouraging employers to step up recruitment and taking legal action in discrimination cases , has yielded some successes the successes have come mostly in increasing the proportion of women hired by national and local governments but progress in changing employment patterns in corporate europe has been much slower , and little effort has been directed at increasing minority opportunities in either the public or private sector the mentality is such that if you want to make progress toward equality you have to adopt means that are acceptable to people , said catherine comtetsimpson , a lawyer with the international labor organization in geneva if you engage in discrimination to find remedies to discrimination , it would not be accepted in the us it was accepted , and perhaps it went too far people who study employment discrimination say that women in europe are badly underrepresented outside of traditional female jobs like those of cashier , nurse and teacher , and that the underrepresentation is particularly acute in the upper ranks of big corporations women in europe are also paid substantially less on the average than men for the same work the international labor organization said the disparity ranges from 20 percent to 50 percent depending on job category and country in france the average differential is 30 percent , the group said about 85 percent of the 53 , 000 employees of marks spencer , the british retailer , are women , but none of the company s top 17 executives and only two of its 32 divisional directors are women the company said the proportion of women in its senior executive ranks is increasing in britain , men and women from racial and ethnic minorities are twice as likely as white people to be unemployed , although officials said job discrimination is just one reason for the disparity in london , where members of minority groups constitute roughly 20 percent of the population , the metropolitan police force is 973 percent white , although the department said applications from nonwhites are increasing as it steps up recruitment efforts even where europe does have programs that give preference to women and minorities , they are coming under intense legal scrutiny in october the european court of justice , which applies the legal directives adopted by the european union to cases in the member nations , struck down a program in the german city of bremen that required municipal agencies to give preference to women over men in job categories where women were underrepresented , assuming the women had at least equal qualifications the court held that the program violated a 1976 european union directive that requires equal treatment for men and women in employment , even though the directive provided for exceptions in cases where a measure was intended to remove existing inequalities in its ruling , the court said , rules which guarantee women absolute and unconditional priority for appointment or promotion go beyond promoting equal opportunities and overstep the limits of the exception lawyers and government officials said it was still unclear how broad a precedent the ruling set but people who study employment discrimination in europe said the ruling fits into what has become the predominant approach to the issue european labor experts said there are many differences between discrimination problems in europe and those in the united states for one thing , affirmative action programs in the united states were developed largely in response to longstanding patterns of discrimination against a large black population in european nations other than britain , the issue has so far been framed primarily in terms of sex , in part because minority populations are relatively small
senate republicans shook off a democratic stall and sent a final version of a balancedbudget constitutional amendment out of the judiciary committee and toward a final vote on the floor next month house republicans were less fortunate they spent the day mending frayed relations between rival republican camps that back two versions of the proposed amendment with distinctly different approaches to the question of future tax increases the two sides seemed at an uneasy peace by day s end , but only after house leaders had warned that their fight imperiled prospects for any kind of budgetbalancing amendment this year one camp , of house conservatives including speaker newt gingrich , favors an amendment that would require future tax increases to be approved by threefifths of each house a second camp , of republican moderates as well as many democrats , balks at that , favoring a less demanding provision that was included in the version approved by the senate judiciary committee today a requirement that tax increases be approved only by a majority of all 435 house members and by a majority of all 100 senators that is less than threefifths , but more than the current requirement a majority of members who choose to vote in sheer numbers , the gap between the proposals is small but in terms of political principle , it has proved cavernous , with some in each camp openly suggesting that they cannot support the other side s amendment i'm not prepared today in any way to announce that i would consider a weaker amendment , representative joe l barton , a texas republican who is the chief sponsor of the threefifths measure , said at a rally of his supporters today that led the house majority leader , representative dick armey of texas , to tell republicans at a private meeting today that unless they hung together , each of their amendments would hang separately , several republicans said the 230 republicans need 290 votes , or twothirds of the house , to approve any kind of amendment any serious split in their ranks would probably mean that an amendment would fall short of that number , even with democratic help michael wines
transportation officials seem to be having second thoughts about eliminating express bus service in brooklyn , queens and manhattan , an idea that drew a storm of protest this spring the final vote to do away with the 11 bus routes , used by 2 , 500 people a day , was taken off today s metropolitan transportation authority board agenda at the request of e virgil conway , the authority s new chairman calls to mr conway for comment were not returned the move means that the cuts could not take effect until jan 1 at the earliest , rather than on sept 1 , as scheduled , said tito davila , an mta spokesman transit officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , said they were caught off guard by the shift , and were unsure whether it signaled a postponement or a reversal by the mta it s a huge victory for our community , said councilman sal f albanese , a brooklyn democrat whose constituents are heavily dependent on the express buses i think ultimately these lines will stay the cancellation of express buses was part of 113 million in budget cuts proposed in february by the transit authority , an arm of the mta , and adopted in general form by the mta board the cuts , prompted by the loss of city and state money , included the first broad reductions in subway and bus service in two decades , including fewer trains on about half the subway lines and the closing of the dean street station on the franklin avenue shuttle in brooklyn doing away with the express buses would save 78 million a year at a series of public hearings , the proposed service cuts were bitterly protested , none more loudly than the express bus elimination residents of the most affected neighborhoods , in southern brooklyn and eastern queens , turned out by the hundreds and organized letterwriting and phonecalling campaigns to restore the service nine of the lines connect brooklyn and queens to manhattan , while two run from upper to lower manhattan gene russianoff , staff attorney for the straphangers campaign , a transit advocacy group , noted that the transit authority argued when it proposed the cuts that it had marked for elimination those services that were most heavily subsidized by that measure , the authority s numbers show , express buses rank as most subsidized , with passengers paying about 30 percent of the cost of operating the service , compared with nearly half for local buses from our point of view , how can you restore the express buses when you 're cutting these other services \? mr russianoff asked , noting that express buses receive proportionately more money than other forms of public transportation we want to be sure that the transit authority is sticking to its own standards

albany , tuesday , march 7 the state senate voted overwhelmingly last night to return the death penalty to new york state 18 years after the state s last capital punishment law was declared unconstitutional at 2 30 this morning , the assembly was still locked in a sometimes fiery debate that had begun late monday afternoon , as opponents exhaustively critiqued the racial , moral , political and constitutional ramifications of the 60page bill but it was all but ordained that the democraticcontrolled assembly would follow the lead of the republicancontrolled senate , which passed the bill by a 38to19 vote monday evening after holding its own four and a half hour floor debate gov george e pataki , a republican who made capital punishment a pillar of his campaign last year , scheduled a news conference for this morning to sign the bill the law , which would make new york the 38th state with a death penalty , will take effect sept 1 though the legislature has passed death penalty bills every year since 1977 only to have them vetoed each time by democratic governors the debate on this bill was particularly poignant for lawmakers on both sides whose votes for the first time in years had suddenly become more than purely symbolic senator dale m volker , a depew republican and former police officer who has been the bill s leading senate champion since 1977 , called it a historic day that would send a message to criminals that the state had got tough on crime with his voice rising and his fists chopping the air , mr volker called the death penalty a powerful deterrent to crime there are people who are dead today who would be alive if we had had a death penalty , he said but opponents of capital punishment used words like depressing , sad and tragic to describe the day and its long hours of debate that all knew would lead to passage of a bill fated to become law this chamber has a long and honorable history , said martin luster , a democrat from ithaca , who read from a long list of defendants whose murder convictions were later overturned what we are about to do here tonight is to taint that history with fraud a fraud upon the people of this state it is a fraud to tell the people that they will be safer as a result of this legislation the bill would establish about 10 crimes punishable by death via lethal injection , the largest category being intentional murders committed during the commission of another violent crime , like rape , robbery or kidnapping also covered are serial killings , contract killings , murders of judges , murders involving torture and murders of police officers and prison guards who are on duty experts on capital punishment and legislative officials estimated that 15 to 20 percent of the 2 , 400 murders in the state each year could be classified as capital crimes under the bill the bill would exempt pregnant women , the mentally incompetent and the mentally retarded from execution but the mentally retarded could be executed if they committed murder while in prison the bill would create a statewide office of lawyers expert in handling death penalty cases who would train , help select and oversee courtappointed defense lawyers for the poor it would also establish a fund to help pay for the huge costs likely to be incurred by prosecutors to guard against racial bias , the bill would allow defense lawyers to interview prospective jurors privately about race issues and it would require the court of appeals , the state s highest court , to collect data on whether death sentences are being meted out in a discriminatory manner even before the debate , the capitol was abuzz with preparations and protests nearly a dozen camera crews from television stations around the state crammed into the upper galleries of both houses a small group of death penalty opponents chanted loudly outside the assembly chambers , stop legal lynching and about 150 school children and their teachers from communities of hutterian brethren in the hudson valley sang gospel songs in a stairwell to protest the vote while the debate itself was punctuated by moments of heated oratory , it often seemed somber , muted or legalistic , as if opponents felt the heaviness of their final defeat while proponents could muster little joy in their longawaited victory there s a strange dullness to it , assemblyman richard l brodsky , a westchester democrat who opposes the death penalty , said of the debate it has none of the phony passion of votes when it did n't matter i think thoughtful people on both sides are painfully troubled by what we are about to do though the outcome of the vote was a virtual certainty , there was ample political maneuvering throughout the day as both parties sought to gain maximum political mileage from the event in the morning , the senate majority leader , joseph a bruno , a brunswick republican , announced that he had removed three democrats as sponsors of the senate bill in retaliation for the assembly speaker s decision to not allow republicans to be sponsors on the assembly bill the speaker , sheldon silver , a manhattan democrat , said he had kept assembly republicans off the bill because they had opposed a democratic version of it last week later , mr bruno relented and allowed the three democrats to be sponsors but he accused mr silver , as he has repeatedly in recent weeks , of delaying and attempting to soften the legislation at the behest of black and hispanic lawmakers charts highlights applying capital punishment capital crimes

calcutta , india when hindu believers flocked to temples across india and as far away as the united states in september to witness the miracle of religious idols that appeared to be drinking milk , it came as a clarion call to another group of indians who have assigned themselves the quixotic mission of debunking all gurus , swamis , yogis and others claiming mystical powers since 1949 , members of the indian science and rationalists' association have been busy exposing fraudulent godmen who whisk gold watches out of thin air , levitate , give off electric charges , and even claim to have conducted erudite discourses with tigers in the wild the guru busters , as they have taken to calling themselves in recent years , include activists raised as hindus , muslims and christians and as members of other religious groups most are now atheists and use their attacks on india s more egregious mystics as the spearhead of a broader assault on all religions in the process , none are spared , not even mother teresa , the roman catholic nun who won the nobel peace prize for her relief work in the slums that have made calcutta a byword for urban misery mother teresa has a clean image , and there is no doubt that she has helped the poor , said debasis bhattachariya , a 28yearold law clerk who has been a leading protagonist in the rationalists' campaigns but in the end , we believe that mother teresa is not at all any better than all the other godmen and godwomen , because she helps to place a more kindly mask on the overall exploitation in our society similar arguments have been used against holy men and women in india for generations , in this century most vociferously by the country s marxist parties but none of the efforts have made more than minor inroads into indian mysticism although the rationalists say they have 86 , 000 members in 300 branches across india , nearly as many indians can be seen at dawn each day dipping themselves along the banks of the muddy , garbagestrewn hooghly river , a branch of the ganges that flows through the heart of calcutta , in the belief that washing in the water cleanses the spirit the dippers include businessmen who are working to cut new deals for the foreign investment that many hope will help regenerate this degraded city , as well as lawyers , doctors and destitute mothers with their scrawny children who live in cardboard shelters under the arches of a nearby overpass mixed in with them , and tossing marigold petals on the water , are sinewy mud wrestlers from a nearby temple , who greet the rising sun with ancient rituals and bouts that fetch a few rupee notes from the day s contingent of tourists lesser men might be discouraged by this evidence that india , perhaps more than any other nation , remains resistant to the appeal of rationalism but prabhir ghosh , the rationalists' president , believes in tilting his lance at every form of what he calls religious trickery see what a fraud it is ! mr ghosh exclaimed one recent evening as a large crowd pressed around him in the dimly lit concourse of calcutta s howrah railway station in one hand , he held a statue of ganesh , the hindu god with an elephant s head and a rat for an attendant in the other , he held a spoonful of milk to ganesh s mouth as the milk rose toward the idol s mouth , mr ghosh positively shimmered with triumph see what it is that the gurus and swamis are up to ! he said mr ghosh s purpose was to demonstrate the scientific principle that the rationalists , and many scientists in india and elsewhere , say explains the phenomenon of milkdrinking idols after the reports about that phenomenon began , millions of indians stayed away from work on sept 21 and on the days that followed to line up at temples to watch mr ghosh set out to show that any liquid , including milk , can be made to rise from a spoon through the porous ceramics used for the idols through capillary attraction at the railway station , mr ghosh and his assistants attracted friendly laughter , suggesting that milkdrinking idols strained the credulity of many hindus it may have helped that indian newspapers had begun to suggest that the milk miracle was a stunt organized by a new delhibased guru , chandraswamy , whose ties to the prime minister , p v narasimha rao , have been frontpage news following accusations that he has wide influence over the government as well contacts with indian criminal gangs mr rao s contacts with swamis have brought him embarrassment more than once in 1993 , he seemed moved during a visit to his native state of andhra pradesh when a wellknown guru , sai baba , appeared to produce a gold watch out of thin air but indian newspapers had considerable fun at mr rao s expense when film of the event that had been taped by an indian state television team was played back in slow motion and revealed the mr baba had employed sleightofhand techniques commonly used by magicians matters have not always been so easy for the rationalists last year , mr ghosh and several companions ended up with cuts , bruises and fractures and a calcutta hotel with broken tables , chairs and lamps after a fracas at the annual meeting in calcutta of india s main astrological society mr ghosh s gambit on that occasion was to challenge the astrologers to forecast , on a slip of paper to be placed in a sealed envelope , the date of death of prime minister rao , ravi shankar , the sitarist , and other prominent indians
fort benning , ga , feb 25 second lieut spencer d dodge , president of the west point class of 1994 , was chestdeep in a muddy backwater of the yellow river in the florida panhandle last month , lost in a fog , freezing to death he and 101 fellow students in the army s ranger training class 395 were in the last days of their nineweek course they had starved in the desert and frozen in the mountains most of the men had lost 30 or 40 pounds they were exhausted on feb 15 , companies a , b and c set out on the yellow river in three groups , paddling black rubber rafts for four hours to a checkpoint b and c arrived first their eight instructors , all sergeants , ordered them into the cold water to string a rope guideline to a hummock of cypress and sweet gum a half mile away the rainswollen river was six feet high and rising as lieutenant dodge , carrying a 60pound rucksack and a rifle , waded into the swamp the sergeants said to push on he began to shiver uncontrollably as the heat of his body flowed into the water his mind lost its focus the cold stopped his heart a full moon rose , followed by a thick fog that shrouded a night of confusion and fear on the yellow river , with flares and helicopters and angry walkietalkie noise when dawn came up on feb 16 , four men were dead lieutenant dodge , capt milton palmer , second lieut curt g sansoucie and sgt norman tillman all had volunteered to undergo one of the military s toughest training courses , an ordeal that army leaders proudly consider to be the moral equivalent of war the ranger course , the army says , is designed to induce fatigue and hunger , mental and emotional stress , to take men to the breaking point it is not supposed to break them based on the statements of soldiers who were there , it appears that the instructors , whether by confusion or dereliction , left their men in the cold water for too long , and , in doing so , let them die of hypothermia , the physical and mental collapse that begins when the body s temperature drops below 95 degrees the water temperature that night was as low as 52 degrees , only 2 degrees above the allowable minimum under some conditions , death by hypothermia can occur within an hour when people are immersed in water that cold some ranger trainees had been in the cold water for six hours twice the recommended limit , army officials said by the time the exercise was called off , close to midnight on feb 15 the instructors could have altered or stopped the exercise at any point they did not the ranger trainees have a buddy system , in which one man is supposed to look out for another it broke down in the fog and cold over the past six years , pentagon statistics show , seven soldiers have died in training for every one killed by the enemy in combat people die in the army at the rate of one every four days but the deaths of the four men in the yellow river , the worst accident since the rangers' training brigade was formed in 1951 , has raised two questions does the army have proper training standards \? if so , did the ranger instructors meet them \? preserving pride , saving lives the rangers' river training has been suspended , pending official inquiries by fort benning s commanders and the army s inspector general , criminal investigation division and safety center they are unlikely to be concluded before may , army officials said the investigations are likely to result in more stringent procedures to prevent future deaths the loss of the four soldiers , defense secretary william j perry said , argues that we should have even more substantial safeguards against this kind of accident you can be sure , mr perry said , that one of the principal purposes of our investigation is to determine whether the safeguards and whether the procedures we use will need to be changed to minimize the chance of something like this happening again despite the deaths , the rangers are sure to fight to keep their harsh training they take pride in the course , which makes them , according to their creed , a more elite soldier a former ranger commander , gen wayne downing , the leader of the pentagon s special operations command , spoke for many rangers when he told the senate armed services committee last week that intense training to develop and maintain the capability to fight wars is imperative but by the same token , general downing said , good units do n't kill their people in combat or in training grueling training takes heavy toll three hundred and thirtyfour ranger candidates arrived in december at fort benning , a huge army base entered through victory drive , a seedy strip of pawnbrokers , topless bars , tattoo parlors , fastfood restaurants and usedcar lots four candidates described their training and the night of feb 15 on the condition that they would not be identified , because of the army s criminal investigation , in which they are witnesses in the first week of intensive physical tests for the trainees , class 395 , 161 candidates were cut from the course others dropped out after a 15mile quick march preceded by a parachute jump more quit after the worm pit , a miserable crawl through mud and freezing water after 15 minutes in the cold slop , one soldier began to suffer from hypothermia he became incoherent told to touch his nose , he pointed to his chest he did not make the cut
washington , april 13 they say they are the lost patrols of america s war in vietnam more than 50 vietnamese commandos who worked in secret behind enemy lines for the central intelligence agency and the united states military the commandos and more than 400 of their fellow spies were captured and imprisoned in the 1960 s , government records show they survived for decades in forcedlabor camps now they want to leave vietnam , where they are reviled as traitors , and come to the united states the united states immigration and naturalization service does not believe their stories and has rejected their applications , and a spokesman refused to discuss the case but recently declassified 25yearold pentagon reports strongly support their claims so does the man who was the defense intelligence agency s top analyst on prisoners of war in vietnam now the united states ambassador in thailand has taken up the lost commandos' cause in a cable sent from bangkok last month and distributed widely throughout the nation s intelligence agencies , the ambassador , david f lambertson , said the former defense intelligence agency analyst , sedgwick tourison , had presented specific and detailed information showing that the vietnamese commandos were us contract employees and that , prior to their capture , they were paid with appropriated us government funds mr lambertson , who was a foreign service officer in vietnam from 1965 to 1968 , said the immigration and naturalization service should reconsider its rejection of the pleas for refugee status the united states embassy in bangkok has long handled vietnamese immigration and refugee issues we believe they qualify , based on their associations with us policies and programs and serving long incarcerations , said the cable from the ambassador it said the vietnamese commandos were captured while engaging in usdirected missions to collect intelligence , conduct military and psychological operations , or to render assistance to downed american air crews a spokesman for the immigration service said tonight that he was unable to answer any questions as the 20th anniversary of the fall of saigon approaches , old wounds are being reopened for many vietnamese none will be more painful than the lost commandos' story , said mr tourison he was chief of analysis of the defense intelligence agency s special office for powmia affairs in the 1980 s and a principal author of the final report of the senate select committee on prisoners of war missing in action in 1993 there is no doubt in my mind that these agents are who they claim to be , that they undertook the missions they say they did and that we , the united states government , have known their fates since the mid1960 s , mr tourison said in an interview his book on the commandos , secret army , secret war , is to be published in august by naval institute press the former investigative counsel for the senate committee on prisoners of war , john mattes , who is preparing to file a suit in federal court seeking the captured commandos' back pay , said while it is a tragedy that we left these pow s behind , it s a national scandal that we would seek to deny their existence and to rewrite history to eliminate them mr mattes was referring both to the actions of the immigration service and to a longsecret , recently declassified pentagon history of the commandos the macsog report , short for military assistance command studies and observations group he and mr tourison said information about the commandos in the 1970 report was deliberately withheld from the pentagon papers , the official government history of the vietnam war this was the secret , said a senior official of the clinton administration who served in vietnam in the 1960 s this was our pathetic and utterly unsuccessful effort to undermine the north vietnamese the macsog report describes the commandos' experience as a oneway street with no hope of return the commandos were a mix of south vietnamese army officers and civilians many originally came from north vietnam and knew the terrain and the dialects the money came from the united states navy s covert operations budget and was laundered by the cia through offshore transactions members of congress did n't ask and the navy did n't tell what the funds were used for , said mr tourison , who has reviewed the macsog report and interviewed retired cia officers who served in vietnam mcgeorge bundy , national security adviser to presidents kennedy and johnson , recalled the operations in an interview as a covert infiltration of specially trained vietnamese it did n't work , he said nearly all of the commandos were killed , captured or lost the program was a disaster , said mr mattes , who has read the macsog report by '69 we had lost them all the majority were captured alive , and we knew it they were tried as war criminals and radio hanoi broadcast their sentences , up to 30 years we went to their families and said , 'they 're dead' we wrote them off we did nothing to seek their return or release we kept the operation secret the commandos slipped into north vietnam by night on junks , sampans and speedboats , were parachuted in by the south vietnamese air force , or were dropped by the cia from air america planes into laos to walk into the war zone and there they disappeared the macsog report lists 52 longterm agent inserts of teams as large as 17 commandos between 1961 and 1967 and it lists their fates captured soon after landing hanoi radio announced capture team destroyed last radio contact 2 dec '66 team believed under north vietnam control team reported in laos again and ready for pickup could not locate captured soon after landing captured soon after landing doubled , played , terminated that last phrase suggests that the united states discovered that a commando team was secretly working for north vietnam , used the team to feed false information to the enemy and then killed its members in his memoir , hazardous duty \( summit books \) , a retired army major general , john k singlaub , says the united states army delivered boobytrapped gift packages to the suspect teams , including time bombs or demolition charges set to explode when a carton of cigarettes was opened the commando operations began as a cia effort no later than 1961 the pentagon took them over in january 1964 under an ambitious covert program called oplan 34a the highestranking white house , state department , cia and pentagon officials knew of the missions in his new book , in retrospect the tragedy and lessons of vietnam \( times books \) , former defense secretary robert s mcnamara writes that the 34a commando missions were essentially worthless , because most of the south vietnamese agents sent into north vietnam were either captured or killed but he adds an intriguing mystery he says he met with president johnson mr bundy the director of central intelligence , john mccone , and others after the maddox , an american destroyer , was attacked by the north vietnamese in the gulf of tonkin on aug 2 , 1964 an incident that led to the dramatic intensification of the war all present were aware that a 34a commando raid had been carried out on two islands in the gulf of tonkin two days earlier the attack on the maddox was so irrational , he writes , that some believed the 34a operations had played a role in triggering north vietnam s actions and thus in transforming a small , outoftheway conflict into a fullbore war
the case against three manhattan high school students charged with harassing a teacher with an antisemitic note was dismissed yesterday by a criminal court judge on one condition that they attend an antibias course and perform community service for jewish organizations after the dismissal , the teacher , stacy mitgang said she was generally satisfied with the decision , although she added that she still felt that the students , with whom she had been close , had not truly apologized last march , mrs mitgang , a teacher at norman thomas high school at 34th street and park avenue for 10 years , found an anonymous note under her door on which were written , hitler , you bitch and a swastika yesterday , ronald kuby , the lawyer for one defendant , michael collazo , told judge robert stolz of criminal court in manhattan that the note , rather than being motivated by prejudice , was an act of ignorance ignorance is an especially dangerous thing , judge stolz told mr collazo , 18 , and two female defendants , persida diaz , 17 , and stacy cedeno , 17 each of you demonstrated an extraordinary level of ignorance ms diaz and ms cedeno have graduated and are scheduled to go to college mr collazo , who has another semester to complete before applying to baruch college , said in a court hallway that he and the others had apologized to mrs mitgang , but she had not accepted the apology yesterday , he said he was willing to say again that he was sorry i apologize to her and to the jewish community , he said what i did was an act of ignorance , and i really did n't know what i was doing , and it was really a bad joke and was n't intended to hurt feelings , and if she hears me now , i'm really sorry the judge adjourned the case of a fourth defendant , 17yearold gerald acevado , until sept 6 because his lawyer was absent from court an assistant district attorney , todd greeley , told the court that since none of the youths had a criminal record , the antibias course was more appropriate than jail the course being offered by the antidefamation league consists of 30 hours of instruction over 10 weeks during which juvenile offenders charged with nonviolent bias crimes get counseling and sensitivity training , said anita sher , director of the jewish civil rights organization s new york office afterward , they will be required to perform up to 15 hours of community service mrs mitgang said in a phone interview that the course was a wonderful idea , and , she added , i hope they can learn something but she was displeased that the aggravated harassment charge was to be expunged from their records i was very hurt , mrs mitgang said the fact of what they did may be wiped off their record in six months , but in six months it s not going to be wiped from me people should know about somebody who committed a bias crime , because if you did it once , you can do it again

monrovia , liberia nearly every street of this city bears the marks of the fiveyearold conflict in liberia medical clinics have been stripped of their roofs government ministries , dark and looted shells , are crowded homes to squatters in the countryside , instead of merely being the theater of constant smallscale skirmishes between poorly armed peasants , one village after another has been leveled and inhabitants slaughtered by the heavy firepower of tribally based militias that mark their territory with the skulls of their victims if regions can be likened to neighborhoods , few would dispute that liberia has been the eyesore of west africa while many countries in the region have made unparalleled strides toward democracy and economic reform in the last few years , the blight of liberia s crisis has also spread there are ever more crossborder incidents in the ivory coast , a western diplomat said here you 've got a major refugee crisis in guinea , and as far away as mali now we are seeing a wave of armed robberies using liberian weapons of all the countries in the region , however , none has been more affected than liberia s western neighbor , sierra leone shortly after the liberian rebel leader charles taylor invaded his country from the ivory coast in 1989 , he helped spawn a copycat movement next door now , after an increasingly intense yearlong drive that has resembled a scorchedearth campaign , sierra leone s rebels , led by a shadowy former army photographer named foday sankoh , are camped on the doorstep of the capital , freetown , and stand far closer to their goal of power than does mr taylor in both cases , experts on this region readily identify the factors behind the political decay first , in liberia , as in sierra leone , years of misrule and economic hardship created a desperate yearning for change next , neighbors began to take advantage of each country s weakness , exploiting resources in exchange for cash and arms had our neighbors not permitted their borders to be used for the arms trade , we would never have had this problem , said david kpormankpor , chairman of the council of state , liberia s governing body additionally , analysts say , the failure of the west to respond adequately has encouraged others to meddle diplomats say libya and its leader , col muammar elqaddafi , have been the most active and puzzling troublemakers in the 1980 s , qaddafi began looking for interesting characters in the region , helped them get set up and has maintained contact with them , a western diplomat said this provided him with a way to take a slap at the americans , a slap at the french and a slap at the british , without really leaving fingerprints recently , diplomats say , colonel qaddafi has received visits from mr taylor and burkina faso s president , blaise compaore for years , diplomats have complained that mr compaore has funneled arms and logistical support to mr taylor , and , many now suspect , to mr sankoh of sierra leone these leaders share military tactics or pasts , and a vague leftist or nationalist oratory some of the fighters in mr sankoh s group , the revolutionary united front , are known to have received training in libya , and diplomats say mr sankoh maintains contact with colonel qaddafi what we are seeing is a libyan move to extend its influence throughout west africa by reaching out to young , ambitious leaders who have been frozen out by the west or otherwise frustrated , a european analyst said

to the editor i was surprised to read the protests of frank kermode s review of marjorie garber s recent book , vice versa both ms garber and james kincaid give the impression that all mr kermode said was disdainful in fact , he praised some parts of the book while he criticized others one of mr kermode s main concerns in his review is with the language and style of critical writing i think the professors need to recognize the problem that is always posed by terminology and jargon in academic writing , regardless of the subject for them to fail to do so is to fail not only as writers but as teachers i have taught a course in gay and lesbian literature at columbia university for several years now , and i must say that both my students and i frequently find that literary criticism in this area is so riddled with jargon and new terms that none of us can understand it mr kermode is addressing a problem that pertains not only to ms garber s book , but to a whole , relatively new , field of study obviously i'm among those who are happy about the changes in academic life that have made the publication of a book like ms garber s significant i for one will read it , in part because of frank kermode s review rather than in spite of it warren johnson new york
let the tony politics begin there s no tony in off broadway s immediate future late last year , the possibility was raised when officials of the two organizations that administer the tonys , the american theater wing and the league of american theaters and producers , invited off broadway producers to submit a proposal under which they might become eligible for one award it s harder than it sounds for one thing , the winners are not voted on by a small panel there are about 670 tony voters , and the rules require that they all be invited two tickets are customary , so that s 1 , 340 free tickets 60 , 000 worth for vita and virginia , for example enough to scuttle any small show for another , some broadway producers on the tony administration committee are violently against letting a bunch of 100 , 000 off broadway grunions race against one of their 2 million walruses it s not , they argue , the same level of theater they have won , without firing a shot the tony administration committee , which makes the rules , met yesterday for the first time in months , and those who had n't heard before learned that the league of off broadway theaters had already said , thanks , but no thanks more than 40 off broadway producers met on jan 6 and voted all but unanimously to reject any offer of a tony free seats were an issue , said participants in that jan 6 meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity so was a feeling that it would not be healthy to get too close to broadway s awards for fear of catching broadway s union contracts and the notion of a single tony for best off broadway work was seen as vaguely patronizing shut out of the running for best play , best actor , best score , etc , off broadway would be accepting secondclass citizenship many of our members work in both venues but feel the tonys are quint essentially broadway , said the president of the league of off broadway theaters , barry grove , who favored pursuing the tony but accepted the consensus we have our own awards , the lucille lortels , and we 're working to make them more prominent ben sprecher , an off broadway producer , said a deal is in the works to enhance the lucys' importance by broadcasting the ceremony on the television station ny1 but there will be none of those audiencepleasing excerpts from the shows , at least not this year several other requests came before the tony committee yesterday the most innovative or brazen were bids by garth drabinsky , the producer of show boat , for three rule changes the tonys began in 1947 , 20 years after show boat had its premiere , so it has never been nominated for highprofile awards like best musical , best book or best score mr drabinsky wanted oscar hammerstein 2d to be eligible for a tony for best original book the show at the gershwin is put together from 12 different stage and film scripts , several of which hammerstein worked on mr drabinsky also asked that the hammersteinkern score be honored with a special tony and he wanted lonette mckee , whose renditions of ca n't help lovin' dat man and bill bring down the house , considered for best actress , even though she was nominated for the same role in a 1983 production of show boat and the rules say you ca n't compete twice yesterday s results \? no to the idea that this is a new book \( the producers of damn yankees were turned down last year on a similar request after their director , jack o'brien , revised their book \) no to miss mckee and discussion of any special tonys was put off until the last nomination committee meeting on may 4 next request the producers of the extravagant christmas carol at the paramount had asked that their show be eligible for the tonys , even though the paramount is not on the list of broadway theaters and the show had only a sixweek engagement since it was seen by 300 , 000 people , used broadway talent and is , at the moment , the only competitor for sunset boulevard in the best new musical category , it might have seemed a little miserly to say no after all , there are supposed to be at least four nominees right now , the only other candidates are smokey joe s cafe , opening march 2 , and a long shot to even make the may 3 cutoff date schlemiel the first last year , the tony committee made city center a tonyeligible theater , but it has n't put on a tonyeligible show since then then there was a late entry radio city music hall sent the committee a letter asking that it , too , be considered a tonyeligible venue the producers of a christmas carol groaned their show is the new competition for radio city s christmas spectacular , and they believe rockefeller center is trying to sabotage them since radio city has no history of broadway musicals , it seems unlikely to qualify , but it muddies the waters for christmas carol a spokeswoman for radio city was asked four times , slowly and clearly , if that was radio city s strategy she refused to say yes or no , and simply repeated the fact that the theater had applied yesterday , the administration committee tabled both requests and formed a subcommittee to look into exactly what constitutes a broadway theater right now the rules say only that it must have 500 seats and be deemed otherwise qualified by the committee theoretically , shea stadium could apply and try inviting the tony voters to a rolling stones concert our rules are very broad and open to interpretation , said keith sherman , a member of the committee we did n't want to be forced into a quick decision it is n't over , not by a long shot as you get closer to tony time , the hysteria develops , said another member it s 'i want a lefthanded tony for this , ' 'consider me for a special tony for that' they go nuts keep an eye on the blimp one learns to spot products being semisubtly plugged in movies those cocacola cans dawdling a bit long in front of the lens , those reese s pieces et snuffled up now , get ready to see it in musicals it was margery singer , a marketing consultant working on how to succeed in business without really trying , which is opening on broadway in march , who had the inspiration there s this number , 'coffee break , ' in the show , and it was one of the obvious connections , she said we approached the a p , which makes eight o'clock bean coffee , and they got very excited they 're going to hold sweepstakes for free tickets in the aisles of 300 stores they 're doing hundreds of radio spots , newspaper ads and posters , and putting the show s logo on their labels they included us on their billboard in times square that s 300 , 000 worth of media we could not have afforded and then , ms singer continued , during the show , a blimp goes by like the goodyear blimp , but for eight o'clock coffee ms singer previously joined guys and dolls with aqueduct race track and show boat with delta queen tours for joint promotions , but this is the first time the product gets mentioned on the stage , she said we would never have done it if it jeopardized the artistic content , she said there was always a blimp in the show it s a very natural way of integrating the product photo a times square billboard with a new aroma and the coffee is mentioned in the musical \( chang lee for the new york times \)
always a reckoning and other poems by jimmy carter illustrated by sarah elizabeth chuldenko 130 pages times books 18 at first glance , the vocations of poet and politician might seem completely antithetical poetry , after all , requires subtlety , introspection and fidelity to language , qualities not exactly valued by most politicians oddly enough , in the case of former president jimmy carter , the very qualities that helped cripple him as a politician are also the qualities that make him a mediocre poet as president , mr carter was frequently criticized for lacking a real vision he was widely described as a technician , an engineer , an ineffectual manager lacking imagination , passion and focus as one associate put it , he knew all the words and none of the music the same might well be said of the poems in always a reckoning wellmeaning , dutifully wrought poems that plod earnestly from point a to point b without ever making a leap into emotional hyperspace , poems that lack not only a distinctive authorial voice , but also anything resembling a psychological or historical subtext many of the poems in this volume address a specific , selfcontained subject , be it a nursing stint by mr carter s mother in india \( miss lillian sees leprosy for the first time \) , a strike by field hands witnessed during mr carter s youth \( the day no one came to the peanut picker \) or a glimpse of canada geese from the white house roof \( a reflection of beauty in washington \) the subject is then recounted in blandly straightforward terms that sentimentally spell out what the speaker is feeling and by implication , how the reader is supposed to react one poem ends the geese passed overhead , and then without a word we went down to a peaceful sleep , marveling at what we 'd seen and heard another goes i faced her treatment every week with dread and loathing of the chore , not the child as time passed , i was less afraid , and managed not to turn my face away on the rare occasion when mr carter does try for a more literary effect , the results are clumsy , even unintentionally subversive of the narrator s meaning in a love song to his wife \( rosalynn \) , mr carter writes she 'd smile , and birds would feel that they no longer had to sing , or it may be i failed to hear their song when mr carter first ran for president in 1976 , he sold himself less as a leader with sweeping plans for the country than as a caring man , who represented a homespun alternative after the imperial presidency of lyndon b johnson and the watergateplagued administration of richard m nixon he introduced himself to voters with the line i'm jimmy carter , and i'm running for president i will never lie to you in a much discussed 1979 essay , james fallows , a former speechwriter for mr carter , wrote where lyndon johnson boasted of schools built and children fed , where edward kennedy holds out the promise of the energies he might mobilize and the ideas he might enact , jimmy carter tells us that he is good man like marshal petain after the fall of france , he has offered his person to the nation this is not an inconsiderable gift his performance in office shows us why it s not enough a similarly personal approach has informed many of mr carter s recent diplomatic efforts , and it also lies at the heart of his verse in fact , when it comes to poetry , mr carter s own life is his favorite subject in addition to rosalynn carter , there are portraits in always a reckoning of mr carter s mother , his father , his friends and neighbors in georgia there are poems about peanut farming , possum hunting and trout fishing , poems about political campaigns in georgia and presidential trips abroad as in mr carter s campaign biography \( why not the best \? \) and memoirs \( keeping faith \) , an image of smalltown piety , thrift , hard work and morality is stressed what s odd about these poems is that they give the reader plenty of information about mr carter s daytoday experiences , while revealing little about his inner , imaginative life the sentiments expressed tend to be generic ones , expressed in strangely abstract terms sadness over a parent s illness , nostalgia for childhood adventures , sympathy for the suffering of the poor , hope for a rosier future the poem plains , for instance , does nothing to evoke the actual emotional or physical geography of mr carter s hometown rather , it devolves into a vague plea for racial harmony and shared dreams though the town is small , we cherish it as haven , home , and friend , and wo n't let strife or mischance bring to all our dreams our modest , tempered dreams an end indeed mr carter does a good job of summing up the state of his verse in one of this volume s more astute poems now when i seek efficient words to say what i believe is true or have a dream i want to share the vagueness is still there photo jimmy carter \( jim estrin the new york times \)
the first time chris lokker had to approach a college professor to say that she was learningdisabled , she was a nervous wreck i went up to my psych professor after class , shaking , and said i had to tell him something , said ms lokker , a student at ocean county community college in tom s river , n j then i started to cry since then , with help from the school s office of disability services , ms lokker has become far more comfortable talking about the help she needs i get distracted easily when i'm taking a test , so if i hear someone sneeze , that s it for me , she said i have to take tests in my professor s office , where it s quieter and i need individual help on algebra the 20yearold sophomore , who has been diagnosed with dysgraphic and dyscalculic disorders problems with processing both writing and numbers says that now i 'll tell anybody about my learning disabilities if they think i'm weird , that s their problem just a few weeks ago , when her classmates were getting ready to start a test , ms lokker felt all eyes on her as she stood up and walked out , so she paused at the door , turned around and announced for anyone who wonders what i'm doing , i'm learningdisabled , and i need to take the test in prof paulus' office on campuses across the nation from community colleges to the most prestigious ivy league and graduate schools students with learning disabilities are emerging in record numbers , their growing visibility forcing educators to bend reexamine their attitudes and bend some of their usual rules dozens of colleges have hired special staffs to help students like ms lokker learn how to ask for whatever they need to succeed in higher education for unlike schoolchildren with disabilities , who are automatically entitled to a wide range of specialeducation services , college students get only what they ask for while there is no exact count of how many college students have diagnosed disabilities or how many applicants identify themselves as learningdisabled the general numbers are rising fast according to the american council on education s 1991 study of disabilities among the nation s 16 million fulltime college freshmen , 22 percent identified themselves as learningdisabled , compared with 12 percent three years earlier learning disabilities made up about a quarter of all disabilities reported , and in the next such survey , most experts say , the figure is likely to rise still further another measure is the number of students who ask to take the scholastic aptitude test in a nonstandard way , the vast majority of them seeking extra time to finish the exam last year , 27 , 000 students requested such accommodations , compared with 16 , 000 in 1989 the rise in the number of requests for accommodations on the exams required for medical school , law school , and graduate school has been even more dramatic over the last five years most schools and testing boards require elaborate documentation , including a battery of tests showing the discrepancy between ability and achievement , before they will agree to such accommodations since the mid1980 s , dozens of schools have hired specialists to assist their learningdisabled students , setting up offices where students can receive counseling , tutoring , and advice on how to approach professors for help at some schools , such as brown university , which has studentled support groups and extensive studenttostudent tutoring , the services are free but at others , which offer more structured professional help , learningdisabled students may pay substantial extra fees at boston university , about 70 of the 350 students who use the learning disabled support program pay an extra 1 , 200 per semester to spend two hours a week with a specialist in learning disabilities and while learningdisabled students at brown and boston university attend the same classes as other students , some colleges offer entirely separate programs for learningdisabled students on many campuses , learningdisability specialists consult with the admissions office , helping evaluate applications from those who disclose their learning disabilities experts say that many learningdisabled students never disclose their difficulties , either on the application form or in class , preferring to struggle through on their own but at the same time , a new generation of activists many of them diagnosed with learning disabilities in elementary school have organized studentrun support groups they view the fight for disability rights as a natural successor to the civilrights movements of past decades accepting that you 're learningdisabled , and being able to tell people about it , is a little like coming out of the closet about being gay , said barton fendelman , a 26yearold who helped to organize support groups for learningdisabled students at earlham college in richmond , ind , and who studies fire science at john jay college of criminal justice in new york mr fendelman , whose learning disabiities were diagnosed in first grade , said he is still not entirely comfortable announcing his disabilities you 're a misunderstood minority , and you have to deal with people who have some strange ideas about what it means to be learningdisabled but there is a movement now , and it helps to know that you are not the only one
mankato , minn , july 27 off season in the national football league is a time for each club to lick its wounds , to reload , to rededicate and to prepare for the grueling 16game run to the playoffs and the super bowl for the minnesota vikings , however , it has been sheer turmoil their brutal off season began last winter after a stunning , listless 3518 playoff loss at home to the chicago bears \( a team minnesota had beaten twice in the regular season \) was quickly followed by accusations of sexual harassment against the vikings' head coach , dennis green , and the team s defensive backs coach , richard solomon there were more embarrassing incidents but none as devastating as the one last week when the vikings' star quarterback , warren moon , was arrested on a charge of assaulting his wife , felicia these are hard times for the vikings , who last sunday opened training camp as a team on the edge of the national football league s elite the vikings thought that the worst was behind them because the 1980 s were full of misery that decade included a series of drunken driving charges against several players , a management that players described as racist and one that was considered inept remember the sour 1989 trade with the dallas cowboys for running back herschel walker for all of those vik ings draft picks \? in hiring green before the 1992 season and in acquiring moon from the houston oilers before last season , the vikings hoped they were putting an end to those problems green was cast as the new sheriff in town moon , after 10 gritty oilers seasons , was considered the epitome of excellence in character and in integrity now , in some circles , there is no escaping this idea the solutions have become even bigger problems the moon ordeal was the final , stinging stab for the vikings , a mystifying occurrence for those who know him as a charitable man and an important role model on july 18 , police in missouri city , tex , were called to the moon home by either the family s housekeeper or the youngest of moon s four children , 7yearold jeffrey felicia moon told the police that after a heated argument moon struck her in the head with an open hand and choked her to the point of losing consciousness only a few months before , it had been revealed that moon had been accused of sexual assault by a vikings cheerleader , a case that was settled out of court and one that moon today insists had no basis all of this was beyond comprehension for those who have followed moon s brilliant career moon has known felicia since he was 16 they met in their hometown of los angeles , and their 14year marriage and nearly 23year association had been full of teamwork , especially in their charitable organization , the crescent moon foundation though felicia decided not to press charges against moon , three days after the incident , last friday , he was arrested , charged and released on a 1 , 000 personal recognizance bond one of the goals for myself had always been not to get arrested in my life for anything , said moon , who turns age 39 on nov 18 it was a goal for my family as well as for me after the press conference last friday where i apologized to felicia in front of our kids , in front of the world , and apologized to her family and my family and to my fans , i was told i would be arrested and to come to the police station i pulled into the garage down under the police station and the judge was already there i did n't even know the procedure it was unreal the fingerprinting taking the mug shots it is something i will never forget , something you can never prepare for but i must say that it set into quicker motion me getting help for myself i had already begun to realize that i needed help in beginning to analyze why i have such a burning need to succeed and to keep busy and to take care of others more than myself and how i had begun to take my marriage and my family for granted when they are the most important things in my life in counseling since , moon said he has come to realize at least two things in one session , a counselor asked moon what were his hobbies , what does he do to relax and unwind moon surprised himself because he could not answer he did not have any except for running tirelessly from football to his work in television to his work in real estate to his work in his charities and he found that his penchant for work might be traced to the day when his father died when moon was 7 , when his mother and five sisters told him that he was now the man of the household i guess ever since that day , i have overloaded myself , moon said i 've taken on so many others' problems and never examined my own and then my kids and my wife always expected me to be gone during the football season but with all of the other business i began to take on , i was gone during the off season , too we grew apart the strain was too much nobody knows what felicia and i have already been through we 've made it together and the love is still there i 've got a lot more work to do on myself and on us and we will do it together moon said it was the first and the only time he had hit his wife
the great horse cigar reasserted his status as racing s probable horse of the year , maybe of the decade and possibly of his time when he won the jockey club gold cup yesterday while thunder gulch , the winner of the kentucky derby and his chief challenger , ran a distant fifth it was the 11th straight victory for cigar , who succeeded holy bull as the outstanding horse of the american turf last february when holy bull broke down during the donn handicap and was retired but it was the first time he had raced against thunder gulch , the 3yearold star who ripped off a string of impressive successes in the florida derby , the kentucky derby , the belmont stakes , the travers and the kentucky cup classic so , they met on the breeders' cup preview day at belmont park , casting long shadows three weeks down the road to the breeders' cup with its promise of a return match in the 3 million classic but the dress rehearsal yesterday proved no contest cigar won it commandingly by one length over unaccounted for , and then it was almost 10 lengths back to star standard and even more to dernier empereur and thunder gulch i do n't know how you 'd get a better horse than cigar , said allen paulson , the onetime airline pilot who names his horses for navigation check points when you think there s 20 , 000plus foals born every year , it s real big i think he s a superhorse for bill mott , who trains cigar , the victory was sweet success for his dominant horse , who now enjoys the longest winning streak in recent times for d wayne lukas , who trains thunder gulch for michael tabor of monte carlo , it was a sobering moment of defeat on a day when he won the frizette for 2yearold fillies with golden attraction and the beldame with serena s song , who outraced the queen of new york s fillies , heavenly prize on a day of exceptional races aimed at the breeders' cup series , mighty forum won the kelso handicap at booming odds of 651 , turk passer won the turf classic at 171 and maria s mon won the moet champagne for 2yearold colts while unbridled s song was running fourth and hennessy , the prize pupil of the lukas barn , faded to sixth somehow , only 15 , 451 fans showed up for belmont s special day , which was staged under overcast and occasionally drizzling skies over a track that looked heavy but was rated fast but this was a day when great horses overcame the conditions , and none did it with more power than cigar he did what he has been doing all year , jerry bailey , his jockey , said he did n't handle the track particularly well , but did it all in spite of it gary stevens , who rode thunder gulch , said it was a very tiring track he just did n't have it today he was exhausted but you 've got to take your hat off to cigar , he s a real champion , and he proved how good he is today cigar took thunder gulch by the horns and forced him to run early , and we just were n't up to it but we will meet cigar again at the end of the month he was echoed by lukas , who offered no alibis , but said gary said he got hit real hard coming out of the gate , and that at no time in the race did he feel real comfortable i think we needed the race coming off the one in kentucky two weeks ago i'm not making any excuses , i think we got beat by a very nice horse there are things we have to do , and we 'll just see what happens on the 28th as expected , the race within the race developed early when star standard sprang out of the gate into the lead with thunder gulch and cigar on his heels after threequarters of a mile , star standard was still there , and so were his two pursuers after a mile , it was still star standard with cigar stalking and thunder gulch weakening and finally , as they rolled out of the turn for home , bailey asked cigar for more and , with his seemingly effortless acceleration , cigar gave it he passed star standard , who faded to third as thunder gulch fell out of the race but a late challenge arose when unaccounted for came digging out of the pack and chased cigar down the lane he closed the distance , too , but at the end could get no closer than one length scotty schulhofer , who trains unaccounted for , said he had told pat day , heavenly prize s jockey i did n't think we could beat cigar , but we had a shot bailey even had to hit his horse today cigar ran the mile and a quarter in 2 011 5 , returned 270 for a 2 bet as the favorite and went home with his 11th straight success and 450 , 000 he has won 32 million while going 9 for 9 this year , and taking in close to 35 million over all he is a 5yearold son of palace music and a grandson of seattle slew , and he has n't been beaten since mott switched him from grass to dirt running more than a year ago because he was n't doing so well on the turf every time i open my mouth , mott said , he goes out and proves he s as good as i say he is i was confident in him watching him from the box , my heart rate was n't any faster than if i were about to fall asleep i would agree , it was probably not his best race he was used more , jerry had to go to the whip , he had to reach down and ask him he stayed a little more busy on him , and still he won by a clear length what s next \? mott said a nice , moderate training schedule for the breeders' cup , probably similar to what we did between the woodward and the jockey club gold cup i wish he could talk and tell me exactly what he needs finish lines subplot nick zito , who has been chasing thunder gulch all year with his colts suave prospect and star standard , finally passed him when star standard finished second and thunder gulch ran fifth , 14 lengths behind cigar he s a much better horse when you just let him run , zito said he ran great , and i'm very pleased but when cigar was asked to run , he really rolled by everyone for good measure , zito s 2yearold colt , diligence , ran second in the moet champagne to maria s mon while hennessy joined his stablemate thunder

mexico city , aug 17 the veil of brown smog that perpetually hangs over mexico city , stinging the eyes and burning the throats of the nearly 20 million people who live here , is not caused primarily by automobile exhaust as officials have long believed , according to a study by an american scientist rather it is caused by leaks from millions of steel tanks containing bottled gas used for cooking and heating the surprising findings , to be published in the united states on friday in the journal science , contradict a decade of government environmental policy that has focused heavily on curtailing emissions from cars and factories while ignoring controls on the two million tons of liquefied petroleum gas used each year for cooking and heating in virtually every home in mexico city mexican officials will be hard pressed to ignore the conclusions because they are made by f sherwood rowland , a chemist at the university of california at irvine it was dr rowland who , with a colleague , in 1974 first warned that manmade chlorinated chemicals widely used in refrigeration were destroying the earth s protective ozone layer dr rowland was assisted in the mexican study by donald r blake , a senior research associate at the irvine campus mexico s environmental ministry is studying the findings and could make recommendations about the way bottled gas is made and sold in mexico the governmentrun oil monopoly pemex , which produces the liquefied gas , is considering changes in the composition of the gas that could make the leaks less harmful but the head of environmental programs in mexico city said he disagrees with dr rowland , arguing that while liquefied gas undoubtedly escapes into the atmosphere , further study is needed before it can be blamed for harmful ozone we continue to believe that automobiles generate 70 percent of the contaminants in the atmosphere , said the official , eduardo palazuelos rendon , environmental secretary for mexico city , whose agency has for several years encouraged companies to convert delivery trucks to use liquefied petroleum gas the conclusion that lpg is a major contaminant does not represent a defect in our programs but rather a defect in the study in his study , dr rowland analyzed about 200 air samples taken in mexico city from 1992 to 1995 , and found high levels of alkane hydrocarbons , usually only minor components of auto exhaust , but which clearly mark the presence of a fossil fuel like liquefied petroleum gas we were just looking to see what was there , dr rowland said in a telephone interview and as soon as we looked at the composition we realized it was different from most us cities because of the high levels of butane and propane , which , with more volatile butene , are major ingredients in mexico s bottled gas liquefied petroleum gas sold in the united states has a higher percentage of propane and almost none of the environmentally harmful butane and butene found in mexico previous scientific studies of mexico city s polluted air have either ignored the presence of the liquid gas or inadequately explained its impact , dr rowland said he concluded that extensive leaks from the gas containers and the incomplete burning of the gas in millions of old stoves and space heaters plays a major \( perhaps the dominant \) role in producing harmful ozone in the mexico city area ozone is dangerous when people breathe it , but in the stratosphere , far above the earth s surface , it is essential to limit the ultraviolet radiation the planet receives of course , auto exhaust and industrial emissions also contribute to mexico city s smog , identified by a united nations study in 1992 as the worst in the world to combat the worsening pollution , the government shut down a huge oil refinery several years ago and began production of unleaded gasoline in 1989 it also tried to force residents to leave their cars home one work day every week however , many people went out and bought another , often older and more polluting car to use on those days the program is not misguided , it just is not complete , dr rowland said they do need to work on automobiles , they do need to reduce hydrocarbons from any source but the efforts are incomplete if they have n't thought about what to do to control lpg doing something about the gas will not be easy thirtytwo independent companies make an estimated 200 , 000 deliveries a day , installing tanks without government supervision in homes with often neglected pipes and tubes photo a study suggests that leaks from tanks of liquefied petroleum gas , used for cooking and heating , are the prime culprit in mexico city s pollution \( phillippe diederich for the new york times \)

washington , dec 27 the federal agency that guarantees many private pension plans settled the largest classaction lawsuit ever brought against it today , agreeing to pay nearly 100 million to 40 , 000 retirees who were covered by pension plans that failed today s settlement by the agency , the pension benefit guaranty corporation , resolves cases involving 11 , 000 failed pension funds that imposed stricter rules than allowed by federal law for the number of workers qualifying for benefits the pension agency had previously made payments only to workers who met the very strict standards set by these pension funds but the agency has now agreed to make back payments with interest to workers who met the federal standard but not their employers' rules the decision delighted mary e collins , a 70yearold retiree in medford , mass , who was a plaintiff in the lawsuit and stands to receive up to 50 , 000 this is really a lifesaver , she said martin slate , the pension agency s executive director , accepted today s settlement it is our job to protect their pensions , he said in a statement but the settlement puts a further burden on the pension benefit guaranty corporation the agency already lies at the center of a political battle over the extent to which american companies should set aside money now for the eventual retirement of their workers , particularly workers in the baby boom generation the republican budget bill would have allowed companies to remove billions of dollars from pension funds that hold at least 25 percent more money than their estimated future payments to retirees president clinton vetoed the budget bill , and white house and congressional officials have not yet agreed on a new bill the pension agency had accumulated a deficit of 12 billion by the end of last year , the most recent figure available companies with definedbenefit pension plans support the agency by paying insurance premiums , but there have been growing worries in congress that the federal government might someday have to bail out the agency if the economy enters another recession and many companies go bankrupt a definedbenefit pension plan makes fixed , regular payments to retirees , using money typically contributed by their employer and managed by professionals by contrast , workers put their own money into definedcontribution pension plans like 401 \( k \) plans , although companies may make matching contributions the payout depends on how adeptly the employee manages the money over the years the pension benefit guaranty corporation insures most of the private sector definedbenefit pension plans in the united states today s settlement is subject to approval by the united states district court for the district of columbia , after which the pension agency would have 38 months to find the beneficiaries and pay them court approval in such cases is common but not assured the settlement results mainly from a change in federal law that took effect at the beginning of 1976 until then , many companies' pension plans had rules requiring many years of service before employees qualified for benefits the new law required the inclusion of employees who had worked for 10 or more years , a socalled vesting requirement that has since been reduced to five years many companies and other employers were slow to change their rules after the new law took effect , and there were a variety of regulations in effect at the time that allowed them to do so in many cases about 11 , 000 underfunded pension plans terminated from 1976 through 1981 without bringing their rules into compliance with the new law , and today s settlement covers these plans stephen r bruce , one of the lawyers who brought the cases resulting in today s settlement , said that the settlement calls for the pension agency to make about 70 million in payments to the retirees the pension agency will also spend up to 24 million to pay for commercial companies to track down the retirees , he said retirees who think they may qualify for payments can check by calling \( 800 \) 3168857 , a number maintained by the lawyers who filed the case the settlement also calls for mr bruce and the other lawyers on the case to receive various legal fees , which are still under discussion mr bruce predicted that the lawyers would ask for fees of up to 125 percent of the payments to retirees , or nearly 9 million the pension agency will pay up to 2 million of these fees and the retirees will pay the rest , he said ms collins said that her employer , the mm transportation company , a trucking business in cambridge , mass , had filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors in 1977 she was 52 years old then and had spent 33 years with the company , but did not receive a pension because the company did not award pensions to employees who left before the age of 55 , she said tonight in an interview from her home ms collins had accrued a monthly benefit of 309 , and received none of it retirees with smaller monthly benefits , or who received partial payments , could get considerably less money than ms collins , mr bruce said
a grand jury has decided not to file criminal charges against police officers involved in the fatal shooting of a brooklyn teenager in early 1994 , prosecutors said yesterday the youth , shu'aib abdullatif , who was 17 and the son of a prominent muslim cleric in the new york area , was killed after 11 officers responded to a 911 call reporting a man with a gun in the basement of a building in the east new york section of brooklyn the police said at the time that mr abdullatif had scuffled with an officer , who was shot in the leg during the incident , and that three other officers fired as the youth tried to flee but they also said no weapons or ammunition other than those used by the police were found at the site the teenager s father , imam alamin abdullatif , contended in the days after his son s death that the youth had been murdered and the authorities were involved in a coverup the imam is president of the islamic leadership council of greater new york and the head of a mosque with branches in brooklyn and wyandanch , li but in announcing the grand jury s findings , district attorney charles j hynes of brooklyn called the teenager s death an unfortunate incident that had occurred in tragic circumstances a man who identified himself as a soninlaw of imam abdullatif said last night that the family was referring all questions about the grand jury s action to their lawyer , debra galloway ms galloway could not be reached late last night , but earlier had predicted that the family would not be surprised by the action the fatal incident , which occurred on jan 11 , 1994 , less than two weeks after mayor rudolph w giuliani took office , embroiled the new city administration in a controversy over the relationship between the police department and black new yorkers the dead youth was black police officials rejected suggestions that the shooting was racially motivated they noted that the officer wounded in the leg , kevin sherman , was also black none of the three officers who the police said fired at the youth were black , ms galloway said yesterday the officers fired four shots , two of which struck the teenager law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the secrecy of grand jury proceedings , said it was not clear whether officer sherman was wounded by bullets fired by the three other officers or when his own gun went off after the incident , the police said that 11 officers had entered the building , at 499 williams avenue , and that officer sherman was the first to encounter mr abdullatif in a dark , dingy basement ms galloway said yesterday that the basement had not been dark two women who live in the building said at the time that they witnessed the shooting and that the teenager appeared to have his hands raised as he was shot but officials said that one of the women had given different versions of the incident the police said that a plastic bag containing more than 20 crack vials was found in the basement they said that in june 1993 , mr abdullatif had been convicted of drug possession and sentenced to five years' probation asked why it had taken 14 months to reach a conclusion in the case , a spokesman for mr hynes , patrick clark , said , this was a complex investigation with extremely complicated forensic , ballistic and evidentiary issues he declined to say who had testified before the grand jury and also declined to give the names of the officers who fired the shots

washington , april 6 to hear the democrats tell it wednesday night , the republicans' taxcut bill would give a windfall to the wealthy and barely a pittance to ordinary americans more than half of the money saved , the democrats argued , would go to taxpayers with incomes over 100 , 000 those with incomes over 200 , 000 would get , on average , an annual tax reduction of 11 , 266 , while taxpayers with incomes between 30 , 000 and 50 , 000 would have an average tax cut of only 569 irrelevant , said the republicans if their tax plan becomes law , people with incomes over 200 , 000 would actually pay a larger share of the nation s taxes than they do now besides , the republicans held , the democrats based their statistics on distorted treasury department data back and forth they went for more than 12 hours wednesday until shortly before midnight when the house of representatives passed the legislation , the capstone of the republicans' contract with america , by a vote of 246 to 188 twentyseven democrats joined all but 11 republicans in voting for the measure the bill would give a tax cut of 500 per child to most families with incomes above about 25 , 000 and below 200 , 000 it would also lower capital gains taxes , create a more generous retirement savings account and offer a variety of other tax breaks to individuals and businesses the senate has not even begun to consider the bill , and the outlook there is problematical the white house has suggested that president clinton may veto the legislation unless the senate makes substantial changes both parties think they have gained political advantage with their arguments but who is right , the democrats who say the rich will come off like bandits or the republicans who say this is middleclass tax relief \? the answer is that it depends on one s perspective the figures cited on both sides are accurate but the methods used to arrive at them are so different that comparisons are difficult to make democrats are right when they say upper income taxpayers would get a large share of the tax cuts but that is true in part because the affluent already pay such a large share of the taxes the democrats who assert so freely that the 12 percent of taxpayers with incomes over 100 , 000 would get half the tax cuts in the house bill rarely mention that these people already pay about half the taxes collected by the treasury and they usually fail to note that the taxpayers with incomes over 200 , 000 who , the treasury says , would get an average tax cut of over 11 , 000 already pay about 120 , 000 on average in taxes \( this category includes billionaires as well as couples earning 200 , 000 \) it would be impossible to give a family earning 50 , 000 an 11 , 000 tax cut , since such a family s federal income tax bill is probably less than 10 , 000 congressional tax analysts estimate that taxpayers with incomes between 30 , 000 and 75 , 000 would have their taxes cut by the legislation by 43 percent or 44 percent on average , while those with incomes above 200 , 000 would have an average tax cut of only 29 percent as a consequence , according to the congressional figures , the 1 percent of taxpayers in the 200 , 000plus category would end up paying 202 percent of all federal income taxes collected if the bill were to become law , compared to 198 percent now the 13 percent with incomes between 30 , 000 and 40 , 000 would pay 89 percent of the total taxes , compared to 9 percent now calculations by the treasury the ones cited by democrats arrive at different conclusions at most income levels , the treasury calculates that the average tax break in the bill is about twice as much as the congressional analysts figure and in the category of those with incomes above 200 , 000 , the treasury puts the average tax cut at 99 percent , as against the 29 percent figured by the congressional staff both calculations are made by honorable , nonpartisan professionals the reason for the disparity is that they use different methods of calculating what income is and how taxes paid should be allocated among individuals this was not done for political reasons the treasury s definitions in the clinton administration are essentially those used in the reagan and bush years , and the congressional methods employed now are more or less those used when democrats controlled congress in neither case is income defined in the conventional way the figure taxpayers put on their tax returns as adjusted gross income both sets of tax analysts use a broader definition designed to give a more precise estimate of real income they add items not tallied on tax returns such as interest from taxexempt bonds , employer contributions to health insurance and contributions to taxdeferred retirement accounts like 401 \( k \) plans the treasury goes much further it allocates corporate profits in proportion to taxpayers' typical stock holdings at different income levels and calls that income to the taxpayers it also counts as income something called imputed rental value of owneroccupied housing , a measure designed to smooth the difference between homeowners and renters the main reason the treasury figures deeper tax cuts from the bill than does the congressional staff is that the treasury has tried to figure the benefits to individuals from the corporate tax reductions the congressional analysts do not at the lower and middle points on the income scale , none of this makes much difference but at the top , where most of the effects of corporate profits and corporate taxes are felt , it could mean that some taxpayers' income is 30 percent higher than it would be if only adjusted gross income were used so someone the treasury reckons has an income of , say , 250 , 000 might have an income in conventional terms of only 175 , 000 one study showed that by the treasury calculations , americans altogether had 17 percent more income than they did under the congressional definition the treasury figures , for instance , that 26 percent of taxpayers have incomes over 200 , 000 and that 125 percent have incomes over 100 , 000 by the congressional definition , only 1 percent have incomes over 200 , 000 and 55 percent have incomes over 100 , 000 the democrats are clearly right on one point in whatever way income is calculated , the better off taxpayers are , the more likely they are to have capital gains and to contribute to retirement accounts that means they would more likely be in position to take advantage of certain tax breaks approved by the house republicans say these breaks are justified because they would lead to more saving and more investment and thus more jobs for less welltodo americans who themselves would not be entitled to the tax advantages whether the republicans are right in this regard is a matter of opinion , not fact photo democrats released a report yesterday showing the impact of the republican contract with america on

we would like to express our disappointment regarding lyme disease moves to populated areas may 14 because it is replete with incorrect information , wrong impressions and several hearsay stories the statement about the sharp rise in lyme disease cases in suffolk county in 1994 , which had been included in a press release by the state health department , is incorrect the 1 , 784 cases reported to our department in 1994 did not only include those patients who had their onset in 1994 , but also those who had the first symptoms in prior years of all cases reported in 1994 , only 809 had their onset in 1994 this figure is evidently lower than the incidence of 1 , 065 of 1993 this means that in 1994 there was a decline in incidence when newsday published the original press release on march 29 , 1995 , we sent a letter to the editor correcting the misinterpretation of these figures newsday consequently published another article entitled lyme figures were lemons on april 13 , 1995 the article refers to lyme disease experts who said that greater proportion of the cases reported since last year were increasingly from the middle and western parts of suffolk it used to be we thought of lyme disease as an east end problem but this is no longer true most cases occur in people s backyards in the central portion of long island figures showed more cases in islip than in brookhaven or any of the five east end towns all of these statements are incorrect because of the following facts the total number of lyme disease cases in the five western towns has declined , from 607 cases in 1990 to 537 in 1994 there has been no major change in the geographical distribution of lyme disease , which is still highly endemic in eastern towns while the population of the five eastern towns represents only 8 percent of the suffolk population , the east end provides between 30 and 35 percent of all lyme disease cases in the county there were 86 cases of lyme disease reported from islip in 1994 , which is lower than the 1990 incidence of 142 in 1994 the brookhaven cases were 329 , which is much higher than the islip cases physicians , whether in a hospital setting or in solo practice voluntary agencies , and concerned citizens , with all their good intentions , simply do not have access to incidence or prevalence data any statements attributed to these individuals or agencies would be nothing more than impressions and personal opinions the only agency in the country that can speak with authority on lyme disease incidence in suffolk county , whether the geographical distribution or the temporal variation , is the suffolk county department of health services all lyme disease reports are received , verified and diagnosis confirmed by the medical staff of the division of public health prior to sending these to the new york state department of health in turn , the state sends these data to the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta , ga the recent identification of virulent and often fatal viruses and bacteria , whether in this country or abroad , has already engendered a state of viralbacterial paranoia the public is sensitized to the release of information relating to outbreak situations or new infections it is incumbent on public and the private sectors and media to insure that the community is accurately informed lyme disease is endemic in suffolk county the annual incidence has been rather stable for the last few years to continue the reporting of an epidemic situation , while none exists , is panic provoking and , to say the least , is an irresponsible act mahfouz h zaki , md director of public health mary e hibberd , md commissioner of health services hauppauge

during his rocky 26 months as new york city schools chancellor , ramon c cortines clashed with mayor rudolph w giuliani primarily over two issues the school system s 8 billion budget , and security in the system s 1 , 100 schools yesterday , mr cortines' successor , dr rudy crew , made key management decisions in both areas , with the approval of the mayor he appointed a new chief operations officer who will oversee all aspects of the school system except instruction , and he removed four managers of the division of school safety and named an interim director with extensive law enforcement and school experience just hours into his first day , harry spence , the chief operations officer , made it clear that the new administration would continue running the division of school safety , even as the mayor has insisted that the police department is better qualified to provide school security the board of education has and will continue to have responsibility for school security , mr spence said at a news conference in which he announced the appointment of sydney yeldell , a school safety consultant , as the interim director of the division but mr spence pledged that the school system would work closely with the police department to make schools safer yesterday , the mayor praised dr crew for his fast action in filling top posts the board of ed is moving in the right direction , the mayor said we applaud the direction and swift action of the chancellor in bringing his team together and in a sign that the winds of cooperation may be blowing across the east river between city hall and the board of education headquarters in brooklyn , the mayor did not criticize the new chancellor for differing with him on who should control school security i think these are effective measures , the mayor said of dr crew s actions i think they show a lot more willingness to treat this as a matter of urgency than was true of the prior administration mr yeldell , who has run school safety operations in prince william county , va , cambridge , mass , and atlanta , is replacing philip tama , who was also an interim director mr tama will stay on as an assistant to mr yeldell , but four other top administrators in the division will be removed from their jobs mr spence said there would be an accelerated search for a permanent director , but that in the meantime , dr crew wanted to put someone in place who is a wellrespected consultant on school safety mr spence , a harvardeducated bostonian , helped to turn around the beleaguered boston housing authority as chief operations officer , he will be the top budget manager he is the latest appointment to dr crew s top management team on thursday , judith rizzo became the new deputy chancellor for instruction she worked with the chancellor in tacoma and boston dr crew has also appointed david begel as his director of communications mr begel , who had previously worked for dr crew , was his spokesman during his transition dr crew s top appointments are a departure from the style of mr cortines , who came to new york after serving as superintendent of the san francisco public school system , and brought with him none of his own top managers after months of criticism from the mayor , mr cortines left the position last month after battling with mr cortines over the increase in school crime , the mayor created a special commission that held hearings last month on the school security division the commission is to issue a report soon , but it is expected to support the mayor s call for a police takeover of school security mr giuliani said that another report on school security , by edward f stancik , the special commissioner of investigation for new york city schools , provided more evidence that the police should be running school security mr stancik s report , released yesterday , found that some school safety officers obtained their jobs through bribes and personal connections , bypassing hiring procedures in response , mr spence said that the three officers identified in the report would be immediately suspended without pay two supervisors who helped them get the jobs would also be suspended without pay today , we are starting a fast track to turn around and improve a division that has too long had too troubled a history , mr spence said photo harry spence , the new york city school system s new chiefoperations officer , left , yesterday announced the appointment of sydney yeldell , right , as interim director of the division of school safety \( linda rosier the new york times \) \( pg b4 \)
to the editor i wish to respond to the characterization of the spanish philosopher jose ortega y gasset that appears in john gray s review rather than blame the masses for the problems of the nationstate , ortega saw their revolt as spurred by a lack of leadership in the revolt of the masses , he explained that all of the leadership groups of his time whether leftist revolutionary or rightist reactionary offered the masses programs with all of the rights and none of the obligations this led to a society in which there was no morality because there was no submission to something , or a consciousness of service and obligation anthony m stevensarroyo brooklyn
washington , march 13 at a recent fundraising gala in dallas for his presidential campaign , senator phil gramm looked like the mostbeloved republican inside his home state of texas and out he was surrounded by the governor , senators , even charlton heston the hugs , the hearty slaps on the back , the mr president introductions were endless but all was not as it seemed though many of those on stage genuinely want mr gramm to be the next president , others were tortured senator kay bailey hutchison , for one , said it was wrenching for her to endorse her fellow texan over senator bob dole , the majority leader , who has been her mentor and up until the very , very last minute , senator robert c smith of new hampshire said , he was torn between mr gramm and mr dole one year before the presidential primaries , the political mating dances are under way republican contenders are vying to line up endorsements from highpowered party members as well as littleknown party functionaries in pivotal primary states like new hampshire who will step to the microphone and lend their names and reputations but as was the case on the stage in dallas , the minuet is rarely as simple as politicians finding their ideological soul mates and then endorsing them with most republicans staking out similar rightward positions , factors like loyalty , friendship , past alliances , past rivalries and geography not to say the pushiness of the candidate seeking support are critical in the decisionmaking it was most difficult for me between dole and gramm , mr smith said , because of the personal relationship i have with them both it was agonizing but he said it was not hard passing over former gov lamar alexander of tennessee because he was not in the senate it s easier to rule alexander out because i did n't see him every day , mr smith said as a reward for his tough , early decision , mr gramm made mr smith a cochairman of his campaign people who make endorsements are often guided as much by selfinterest as ideology advisers to gov stephen merrill of new hampshire , for example , said one reason that he has not endorsed anyone yet was that he did not want to suffer the humiliation of backing a candidate who loses the state sometimes endorsements come out of political custom it would have been highly unusual for senator hutchison not to endorse the senior senator from her own state i 've known phil for 25 years and worked with him and that is very important , ms hutchison said sometimes people endorse as a payback to a candidate who has campaigned for them in the past sometimes they endorse as a payback not for the candidate but for someone else who is close to the candidate that may explain why gov george e pataki of new york endorsed mr dole today mr pataki is a protege of senator alfonse m d'amato and mr d'amato is a protege of mr dole \( and endorsed him last week \) while the dole campaign may be guilty of overstatement in trumpeting the pataki endorsement as a major campaign announcement , endorsements are important in helping candidates convince donors and pundits that they are legitimate contenders and when politicians make endorsements they often bring with them their political support mr dole , for example , is counting on mr pataki to deliver many leading new york republicans to his camp because of the egos , and the political stakes involved , extracting endorsements is a delicate procedure one who has a bird seye view is governor merrill of new hampshire , who is a prize catch because of his popularity in the state and because of new hampshire s position as a critical early primary after all , it was gov john h sununu of new hampshire , who was credited by vice president george bush with rescuing a flagging campaign in the state in 1988 the candidates have been very respectful , mr merrill said of his decision to put off an endorsement until after the state budget can be passed in the summer they send me speeches that they 've given they call me they drop me notes , always personal notes they try to let me know what is happening in their campaign while mr merrill insisted that he was undecided , he has spent enough time with the prospective republican nominees to analyze their comeon lines on mr dole the most respectful in the oldfashioned sense of the term is bob dole he is so respectful that you almost wonder if he is n't making the sale he beats around the bush on mr alexander of tennessee the nicest , friendliest is lamar he says , 'we 've got lots of time and i want to spend time with you and after we spend enough time together i know you and i are going to come to a point where we 'll reach an understanding' it s like , 'we 're going to walk down the yellow brick road together' on mr gramm he leans forward , he looks you in the eye and says , 'you know where i am and when you 're there let s talk' he is the most direct mr gramm is so confident that he will win mr merrill over that republicans in new hampshire said mr gramm has publicly said he will get the endorsement it is not just governor merrill who gets the attention consider mark thurston , one of three commissioners in rural belknap county , nh mr alexander has played the piano for him at a dinner in manchester and has called him on the phone no high pressure mark , i just want to call you to say i was thinking about you , mr thurston recalls the former governor telling him when he was in washington the other day , mr thurston stopped by mr dole s office for a chat he was ushered right in while candidates have to be careful not to appear too pushy , gov jim edgar of illinois said that thus far they had been well behaved with him these guys are pretty good , he said they 've been in politics for years they know you 're not going to jump right away we all like to be talked to we all like to be flattered none of us suffer from lack of ego in this business the prospective endorsers also have to be careful not to offend that is why when he lists the republican candidates , gov john engler of michigan does so in alphabetical order and today , former vice president dan quayle said his praise for senator richard g lugar in an indiana newspaper last week should not have been interpreted as an endorsement i will continue to be supportive of dick lugar , mr quayle told cnn i am not going to get into the endorsement game george bush is not going to get into the endorsement game the rolling out of endorsements is just beginning but even after they have made up their minds , some people like to take their time before throwing their support to anyone so they can enjoy having all the candidates stroke them others like to wait until they feel confident of who the winner might be for the cardinal rule is never go with a loser just ask mayor rudolph w giuliani his decision to cross party lines and endorse gov mario m cuomo for reelection last year caused him lasting grief with republicans , not to say the man who was elected , mr pataki endorsements can also hurt the candidate the support of senator strom thurmond of south carolina in 1988 helped persuade mr dole to compete aggressively in the state but he was trounced there by mr bush , who used the state as a wedge to sweep the southern primaries but , putting the past behind him , mr dole last week accepted mr thurmond s support mr thurmond vowed to do all i can to make him the next republican nominee and the next president of the united states photo gov george e pataki endorsed senator bob dole yesterday

denver , april 20 the new york yankees came back to denver today for the second time in less than a month , facing fatigue , the flu , the flurries , an unbelievably taxing schedule and the throng that helped reintroduce coors field to baseball buck showalter , the yankees manager , could n't be happier , though , because this time showalter came with the varsity , major leaguers favored by many to win the american league east that made a world of difference to the manager whose first entry into the new ball park came at the end of march and featured replacement yankees playing replacement rockies after going through the replacement thing , i 'll go anywhere , a lighthearted showalter said shortly after shuttling through snow flurries and under threatening skies from denver s new airport to denver s new ball park i'm proud to represent the organization anytime , but i'm doubly proud to be here with these guys he had even more reason for jocularity about four hours later , after the yankees won an errormarred game , 73 scott kamieniecki and four relievers limited the rockies to five hits kamieniecki allowed two runs en route to his first victory of the spring showalter did n't take all his frontline players to denver jimmy key , the lefthander scheduled to pitch tomorrow afternoon in the twogame series finale , was left behind in florida , not because of injury but because of weather that had already dipped to 44 degrees by game time i'm not able to control the weather conditions on opening day , but i am able to control the weather he pitches in until then , showalter said and it was too bad a forecast so he s going to pitch in an extended spring training game tomorrow in tampa key joined fellow yankee pitchers jack mcdowell , melido perez and john wetteland none of whom were scheduled to throw today or tomorrow on the list of players excused from the quick hop to the rocky mountains the bullpen , starting with the lefthander , andy pettitte , was scheduled to go in key s place tomorrow one yankee who made the trip was don mattingly , despite a bout with the flu i 've had the chills off and on for a few days , mattingly said i had them again today , but i do n't know if it s the flu or the cold outside , he said with a smile mattingly s temperature , which had ranged from 100 to 102 the previous two days , was normal today , he reported that enabled mattingly to serve as the designated hitter , batting ninth i'm used to it down there remember , that s where i hit when i first came up , ' mattingly said showalter knows that players of mattingly s caliber are why 37 , 577 tickets were sold for the game \( although the fans showed up in lesser numbers \) the same could be said of some rockies players it s a thrill , said garvin alston , a rockies rookie pitcher who is a product of mount vernon \( ny \) high school and a cousin of del alston , a former yankee who is currently a coach with the team i 've seen don mattingly at ball parks before , but not on the same field it s exciting as the designated hitter , mattingly doubled in four atbats and scored one run by the eighth inning he was gone because the rockies brought in a lefthanded pitcher no less important , showalter has vowed to shepherd his flock of division favorites through a travelfilled last week before a regular season truncated because of the strike after two days here , the yankees must return to florida to play the mets in port st lucie saturday and the braves in fort lauderdale sunday they play the braves again monday , in atlanta then it s on to new york , where the yankees will work out tuesday , then open the season the following day against the texas rangers the wednesday afternoon game represents the yankees' first home stand after an offday , they then move on for a threegame series in kansas city such travel , showalter admitted , has made the team rethink its approach to travel and work schedules we ca n't afford to have setbacks physically , he said we just do n't have that comfort zone because of the shortened season the weather could have hurt more than it did it hurt in batting practice bad enough and it got worse , the yankees' first baseman , jim leyritz , said it was rather cold out there still , by the end of the night , the team was a little colder , had a few bumblebee like stings to the hands because of the frigid weather but that was all , for which showalter was grateful at this point , you want to get your work done , but it s almost as important to keep your people healthy , the manager said inside pitch the national league rockies let their pitchers hit instead of using a designated hitter brian boehringer pitched two scoreless innings and struck out four jeff patterson pitched two scoreless innings bernie williams , the only starter to play the whole game , collected a double , triple and drove in two runs the 34 rockies committed four errors the yankees' joe ausanio allowed a ninthinning home run to the rockies' dante bichette , the first home run hit in coors field
los angeles , june 19 an expert from the federal bureau of investigation testified today at o j simpson s trial that the person who left a trail of bloody shoe prints along the walkway in front of nicole brown simpson s home last june wore size 12 shoes , the same size worn by mr simpson the witness , william j bodziak , an authority on shoe prints and tire treads , retraced his quest to track down the model of the shoes that left the prints , which took him to two factories in eastern italy he said the make , distributed only in 1991 or 1992 , was bruno magli , a model he described as highend that is , costing roughly 160 a pair the shoes worn by the killer or killers of mrs simpson and ronald l goldman a year ago , like the assailants' presumably bloodsoaked clothes , have not been recovered nor have prosecutors thus far offered evidence that mr simpson ever owned this kind of shoe but as mr bodziak placed a pair of similar bruno magli shoes soletosole against a pair of mr simpson s reeboks , he testified that for all practical purposes they were identical in the size and the shape the person wearing one would certainly be a candidate for wearing the other , mr bodziak said hank goldberg , a deputy district attorney , asked mr bodziak whether there was any indication that more than one pair of shoes that is , more than one person was involved in the crime no , there was not , mr bodziak replied when asked if mr simpson could have worn the model of shoes that left the prints , the witness said , yes , i could include him as a candidate who could have worn those shoes conducting his first crossexamination in several weeks , the defense lawyer f lee bailey challenged mr bodziak s hypothesis that there were dozens of footprints at the crime scene because a single perpetrator walked away from the corpses , then retraced his steps , rebloodying his shoes enough to leave a second trail as he exited instead , mr bailey suggested to the witness the defense s latest theory that a pair of professional assassins , knowing that footwear can be almost as dangerous as fingerprints , tracked down and wore two pairs of the same rare italian designer shoe only 299 pairs of size 12 were ever distributed in the united states in an effort to confound the police mr bodziak dismissed that hypothesis as ridiculous , noting that anyone seeking to camouflage his identity would hardly opt for such distinctive footwear rather than something more common , like the reeboks that mr simpson said he had worn on the day of the killings it took considerable time and numerous digressions for mr bailey to reach what was perhaps his most compelling point that , as mr bodziak had testified , citing footwear market insights magazine , 9 percent of the shoes sold in the united states are size 12 , and millions of people with feet slightly smaller or larger can fit into them mr bodziak noted that such improvising would leave criminals stumbling all over the place as they fled earlier , in exacting detail , mr bodziak described his detective work to match the bloody honeycombed tread found at the crime scene at 875 south bundy with a particular make of shoe there was no such shoe print , he said , in the fbi s own extensive file , although he speculated that the shoes were expensive and made by a south american or italian manufacturer letters sent to such manufacturers produced a match with the bruno magli model , as did a letter to the national police agency in tokyo the witness a blunt man who used foreign pronunciations almost apologetically , as if worrying about sounding pretentious then described the complex procedure in which he extrapolated from tread fragments to conclude that the prints had been left by size 12 bruno magli shoes , with soles made by a subcontractor called silga superimposing plastic transparencies of prints taken from such shoes over photographs taken at the crime scene , he said that footprint after footprint confirmed his conclusion a man who has focused on footwear for 22 years , mr bodziak used both the language of cobblers \( like the lasts around which uppers and lowers are stitched \) and forensics \( like the squeegee effect , which takes place when blood nestled in a shoe s treads migrates beyond its original location \) for the prosecution , the talk of shoe prints provided a welcome breather after last week s debacle , when mr simpson tried on the gloves that prosecutors say he wore on the night of the killings two prosecutors , marcia clark and christopher a darden , said in court this morning that they would revisit that issue , presumably to prove that the gloves had shrunk or that mr simpson had been acting when he said they were too tight they have n't had enough of the gloves , your honor \? mr simpson s chief lawyer , johnnie l cochran jr , asked judge lance a ito almost gloatingly ok , we 'll be ready mr bodziak s testimony brought the prosecution closer to the end of its direct case , which could be rounded out this week with testimony from at least two witnesses about further instances in which they say mr simpson struck mrs simpson prosecutors will also offer testimony on the statistics involving dna and about hair and fibers that , they say , link mr simpson to the crime scene by day s end , a buyer from bloomingdale s , samuel poser , was poised to take the stand seeking to defuse defense arguments that two assailants may have been involved , mr bodziak said that of the shoe prints that were distinct , all were made by the same footwear , and there was nothing to suggest that the indistinct ones had been left by a second person mr bodziak said that he had examined the shoes worn by several police officers at the crime scene and that none could have accounted for the shoe prints but he testified that even with chemical enhancement , it was impossible to say that the same model of shoes had left a faint print found on the carpet of mr simpson s ford bronco , though the faint marks were consistent with the silga sole the witness said there were footprint fragments both on an envelope containing eyeglasses belonging to mrs simpson s mother , found at the crime scene , and on the black cocktail dress mrs simpson was wearing when she was killed as a panel of photographs of that dress was displayed in court , mrs simpson s youngest sister , tanya brown , began to sob they were not the most graphic photographs on display today earlier , prosecutors displayed once again photographs of mrs simpson slumped over in a fetal position , with footprints nearby and autopsy photographs , visible only to jurors , showed what mr bodziak said appeared to be toe or heel impressions on mrs simpson s back photo in testimony yesterday , william bodziak , an fbi authority on shoe prints , compared one of o j simpson s white reebok shoes with an expensive italian shoe of the kind he said left bloody tracks at the murder scene \( pool photo by lori sheler \)

miami , dec 4 during the early 1980 s at the orange bowl , a sign was affixed each sunday to a spot in the upper deck in large block letters , it proclaimed shula is god , and about the only argument it ever generated around town concerned whether the letter g should be upper or lower case those were the days when don shula , coach of the dolphins , still owned south florida he was omnipresent , if not omnipotent his face , with the trademark jutting jaw , was on billboards all over town he had an expressway named after him there were serious suggestions that he could not be defeated if he ran for governor shula always laughed such notions off first , why would he want to take a step down in stature and , second , why would he ever want something as fickle as polls to dictate his fate \? dissolve to this past sunday , the day his 66 dolphin team was to face the atlanta falcons shula awakened to a poll in the fort lauderdale sunsentinel under the heading don voyage , it was revealed that 69 percent of the 1 , 071 respondents felt he should be fired the only good news was that the poll was n't as brutal as one in the miami herald in which nearly 80 percent of the almost 10 , 000 respondents said the same thing a similar survey with similar results had run a week before in the palm beach post this is how things have turned for shula , 65 , the coach with the most victories in national football league history demanding that he be fired has no shock value anymore with new coach pat riley enjoying success with the national basketball association s miami heat , and with the upstart panthers owning the national hockey league s best record , fans have other options , and the once untouchable shula has suffered by comparison he has heard chants where once there were only cheers the questioning in the three polls had to do with hiring jimmy johnson as shula s replacement the former dallas cowboy coach , who participated in the nfl s other legendary palace coup when he took over for tom landry in 1989 , is the overwhelming choice of the callers although he insisted on fox s pregame show sunday that he is a nonstory in this situation he is , of course , very much a part of the story a south florida resident who has turned down offers from other teams , johnson has made it clear he would like to be the next coach of the dolphins but that would be dependent on shula s departing totally from the picture the dolphins staged a lastminute comeback to defeat the falcons , 2120 , on sunday , rekindling playoff hopes and muting the public outcry but the rumblings remain , like the exhaust from the plane that circled joe robbie stadium on sunday , trailing the banner with a line from a jimi hendrix song about the other jimmy move over rover , and let jimmy take over it has reached the point where the owner of the team is asked whether he will fire a coach who has won 344 games an average of more than 10 victories a year over 33 seasons and who has won 15 american football conference east titles in 25 years first of all , these surveys , all it is is a vocal minority , h wayne huizenga , the owner , said today in a telephone interview , indicating he wo n't be swayed by newspaper polls or columns calling for shula s head the way we operate all our companies , the way all of america operates , is once a year everyone gets reviewed for their performance i 've got all the confidence in the world in don we are not here secondguessing , we are not here looking back we 're only looking forward but to what \?

to the editor re punishable by death lessons for new york , your feb 2224 series on the death penalty , while comprehensive , ignores the issue of deterrence yet the deterrence argument is the one most often used to justify the death penalty and it has been refuted in recent years eighteen of the 20 states with the highest murder rates have and use the death penalty of the biggest cities with the highest murder rate , 17 are in death penalty jurisdictions texas has executed more people during the past decade than any other state but still has three cities with murder rates among the top 25 new york , with no death penalty in effect for 17 years , has none among the top 25 federal bureau of investigation reports for 1992 show that murder rates in states that have abolished the death penalty average 49 murders per 100 , 000 people , while states using the death penalty average 91 murders per 100 , 000 people over nearly two decades two neighboring states , michigan , with no death penalty , and indiana , with a death penalty , have had indistinguishable homicide rates in canada the murder rate peaked in 1975 , the year before capital punishment was abolished the murder rate declined for the next 10 years two studies of convicted murderers , one in texas conducted by a former attorney general , concluded that the death penalty was not a deterrent , as those who killed never considered it before killing a study in new york of more than 600 executions between 1907 and 1963 showed that on average there were two more homicides in the month following an execution and one more homicide in the second month these figures indicate that the death penalty may result in more killings law enforcement officers are not protected by the death penalty either , which is why most largecity police chiefs and at least the majority of district attorneys in new york city are opposed to capital punishment in 1993 texas led in deaths of law enforcement officers for the sixth straight year , even though it has the highest execution rate as well , and that year two men were executed for killing police officers california , with the largest deathrow population , ranked a close second in law enforcement deaths and took over the top spot in 1994 and florida , which ranks second in executions , had the third most law enforcement deaths in new york the number of police officers killed yearly did not increase , on average , during the years following 1977 , when the death penalty for killing a police officer was declared unconstitutional and since 1971 only one correction officer working at a new york correctional facility has been killed , even though during that time more than 200 , 000 inmates have been imprisoned , including thousands of convicted murderers , many serving life sentences it is unfortunate that gov george e pataki and many legislators , democrats and republicans alike , continue to make the deterrence argument even in the face of overwhelming evidence that capital punishment does not deter david c leven executive director , prisoners' legal services of new york new york , feb 27 , 1995
on tuesday , lots of costumes , masks , candles and cornstalks will come out to mark the centuriesold tradition of halloween and children will go trick or treating but pumpkins are the overwhelming theme of the day many families delight in buying the biggest ones they can find merchants are happy to comply and often stock pumpkins by the wagonload dull as the fact may seem to celebrators , a pumpkin is just another kind of squash in fact , processed canned pumpkin sold at supermarkets is often none other than canned squash of various varieties botanically the two plants are the same both belong to the huge cucurbita , or gourd , family the pumpkin is a large , spreading vinelike plant for this reason , few home gardeners give it space they usually prefer to leave the growing to the farmers , who have the sweep of an open field often pumpkin vines are interplanted in rows with sweet corn just to make the best use of soil but the pumpkin plant is a longseason grower and usurps huge quantities of soil nutrients and water as it grows a good trick to attain the fullest size pumpkin is to prune off all but one or two of the developing fruits from each vine so the strength of the plant is concentrated in just a few pumpkins sometimes seed is started indoors ahead of time just to be sure the crop ripens in time for halloween this year , the drought may have dwarfed pumpkins or lessened their quality in some areas , and prices may seem a bit higher than usual when the selections are brought home , the pumpkins may be carved into those wonderful , grotesque faces and lighted with candles or some youngsters prefer to paint them with watercolors many homeowners just stack a few pumpkins by the door seed catalogues list ever so many sorts of pumpkins one of the largest is called big moon , which , according to the description , can grow up to 200 pounds per pumpkin another one that is particularly popular is autumn gold hybrid , an allamerica selection that is said to be ideal for jacko'lanterns another one that is intriguing , probably just because of its name , is the variety called ghost rider , which supposedly has an especially dark rind for those who would like to try to grow their own pumpkins at home next year , there is the diminutive variety called baby bear it is said to be but six inches across and only about four inches high this one requires 105 days to grow from seed to harvest one fact is certain , however pumpkins , or any squash , for that matter , are not frosthardy , and as soon as the truly cold weather comes along , the squash vines will blacken if any pumpkins or winter squash are left in the fields , they must be rescued and stored before a hard frost these field fruits store well if they are wiped clean , cured and placed in a cool , dry place where they will not be subject to freezing if kept properly , pumpkins and squash can be stored for several months although halloween is a children s holiday of candy and masquerade parties , it is based on ancient religious beliefs centuries ago , this celebration was a celtic harvest festival , or samain it was led by druids , the intellectual celts , an order of priests and poets the festival marked the eve of the celtic new year historically , the earliest known records of the druids date to the third century bc elements of this celebration included costumes , masks , dancing and merrymaking that were believed to chase away evil spirits or ghosts when the romans arrived in britain , the celebration grew into a festival in honor of pomona , the goddess of fruit the celebration continued in this form until the middle ages by then the festivities had melded into the eve of the christian holy day called all saints' day or all hallows eve , now known as halloween then the commercial world took over , and the event grew to the enormous aspect it has achieved today drawing
buried in the tax bill now pending in congress is a provision to allow many more people to claim a deduction for using a home office the beneficiaries are people whose jobs take them places doctors , auditors , salespeople and others who work in a variety of settings but often manage their businesses from home the provision would reverse the recent irs tendency toward everstricter standards for these deductions supporters say the change makes sense in light of the growing numbers of people who are taking advantage of technology to work from home or who have , of necessity , joined the legions of downsized executives starting homebased consulting businesses the house committee on taxation estimates the cost of the measure , which would take effect with the 1996 tax year , at 1 billion over five years along with the rest of the tax bill , the provision has passed the house but the legislation will face a higher hurdle in the senate after the spring recess under the current rules , taxpayers who claim the homeoffice deduction must meet two tests first , they must use the part of their home they claim as an office regularly and exclusively for business this means it may not double as a guest room or indoor playground and , second , they must either see clients or patients at home have their offices in structures physically separate from their home , or the home office must be their principal place of business the new rule expands the meaning of the phrase , principal place of business in 1993 , the united states supreme court , ruling in favor of the irs , disallowed a homeoffice deduction claimed by an anesthesiologist who practiced at several different hospitals none of the hospitals provided him with office space , and so he kept an office at home to do bookkeeping and paperwork , read professional journals and talk to surgeons , patients and insurers the doctor , who spent two to three hours a day in his home office , said these activities were necessary for him to stay in business and to maintain his professional standing but the court ruled that he performed the essence of professional service administering anesthesia at hospitals , and thus his home office failed the second irs test the decision dismayed thousands of selfemployed people who perform the essence of their jobs on the road , but , like the doctor , use space at home for paperwork and phone calls a lot of people were legitimately working at home but could n't claim the homeoffice deduction , said grace w weinstein , a financial writer whose latest book , financial savvy for the selfemployed , was published this month it was dramatically unfair and dramatically costly the anesthesiologist in the supreme court case , for example , wanted to take a 5 , 000 deduction for his home office and a person with a 200 squarefoot home office would , on average , be able to claim a deduction of 1 , 600 , according to paul and sarah edwards in working from home \( putnam , 1994 \) in its own words , the provision clarifies the court s definition of principal place of business by explicitly including locations where administrative or management activities are done , as long as the person has no other fixed place of business we 're changing the law so it s what people thought it was before the decision , said jim clark , chief tax counsel at the house ways and means committee since an office set aside exclusively for billing is part of the cost of doing business , he said , why should n't you get the deduction \? one surprising opponent of the measure was the national association of homebased businesses , based in owings mills , md rudy lewis , president of the group , expressed concern that passage would fuzz up what he said was an important distinction between people working at home and people working from home you have telecommuters , consultants , selfemployed people , but they are not homebased businesses , he said about the latter group a lot of people will claim they are homebased businesses when they actually are n't he is worried that abuse of the deduction will once again bring down the wrath of the irs everything s getting cloudy again it will be difficult to make a distinction once the debate over the main focus of the pending bill tax cuts begins in the senate , it seems unlikely a minor provision like the home office deduction will get much attention so its fate probably hinges not on its own pros and cons but on those of the politically charged subject of reduced taxes but there is nothing tentative about the lastminute tax break that president clinton has given to homeoffice workers last week , he signed a law to restore a deduction for some health insurance costs for the selfemployed an estimated 32 million people will be able to take advantage of the measure , which allows them to deduct 25 percent of their insurance premiums on 1994 tax returns so , for everyone who waited until today to do their taxes , procrastination has paid off as for people who filed early and did not figure in the tax benefit , they may want to refile in future years , the selfemployed will be allowed to deduct 30 percent of their health insurance costs
bihac , bosnia and herzegovina , oct 17 the scene about 30 people frenetically splitting logs into firewood in preparation for a harsh winter could have been from the middle ages but for the gloomy socialistera apartment buildings into which the firewood was being hauled looking at the stacks of logs she and her neighbors were attacking , sedia nuspahic , 28 , commented we are at the basic level of existence we have shelter , some food and now we are chopping wood so we do n't die from the cold after three years , the siege by bosnian serbs is broken the 50 , 000 people of bihac , almost all muslims , are no longer being shelled , and there is the expectation that life will improve quickly but in a preview of what the rest of bosnia might expect , life is likely to remain very hard for a long time in bihac , the capital of northwestern bosnia , there is no industry and almost no commerce most public services have barely improved since the siege ended there is little electricity , no gas or mail service , scant running water only a handful of telephones can make calls outside the immediate area , and those calls , over terrible lines , are generally more frustrating than useful for twothirds of the city s residents , there are no jobs more difficult still , the city , like the country , faces problems beyond rebuilding its leaders hope to remake it , from a semiindustrial socialist economy into one that can merge with western europe compared to what lies ahead , chopping firewood looks easy for now , the cost of maintaining even a primitive existence is high mrs nuspahic s husband and father were killed in combat three family friends , also in the army , came to help her split the 500 cubic feet of logs that she , her mother and her daughter will need to stay alive this winter in their tworoom apartment during the siege , which was broken two months ago by the croatian and bosnian armies , many people were close to starvation now mrs nuspahic s family is getting food and clothing from international aid agencies it has taken so much just to survive , but we think life can start again soon , she said there are small signs that their expectations may be met police officers on foot patrol say crime has declined impressively one officer said , people are feeling so good even the crooks are behaving public schools are back in regular session the artillery shelling had made it too dangerous for students to leave their homes about half the time today high school students gathered in front of their shelldamaged school , laughing and talking about basketball to all appearances , the dangers that had kept them in underground shelters were forgotten one of the young soldiers helping mrs nuspahic said he and his friends hope to start college as soon as the war is over but according to the mayor of bihac , neither jobs , nor college , nor much else of life as it used to be lies ahead soon none of our factories can compete with the west , said the mayor , adnan alagic even if we repaired them , they would be archaic because they were designed to provide jobs under socialism , not to compete with other factories the local textile industry , which used to employ 4 , 000 workers , can only employ 400 if it is to be competitive , the mayor said the giant factory that made refrigerators should not even be reopened , he said , because its equipment is so old our technology is no good anymore , he said these workers will not have jobs , and we all have to face that he predicted that some of the foodprocessing plants , which used to employ thousands , can survive but that many will not instead of stepping ahead , he said , bihac will have to go backward he predicted that the whole region will return to basic endeavors , primitive ones like logging or quarrying , and maybe dairy and cattle production we want to be part of europe , but that means starting all over again until we can become modern , he said but even the most basic peasant farming that sustained rural families and fed the towns is in disarray the 10 villages around bihac are either destroyed or substantially abandoned the beginning of the war in bosnia and the end of socialism came very close together , complicating the recovery the people are afraid of democracy , said a local political leader , who insisted on remaining anonymous because he fears the people will not appreciate his frankness we had socialism for 50 years we are used to having food and housing and the other basics guaranteed all that is gone now among the buildings scarred by shelling are the remains of a fort built by the turks , a church built under austrian rule and a monument to heroes of the communistled partisans in the world war ii none of those forces endured , but they either manipulated or suppressed the kind of nationalist antagonisms that ultimately pulled yugoslavia apart in bihac , as it searches for a new way to run things , the problems created by diversity may be handled by simply displacing those who are different though some political leaders talk of allowing serbs who fled to return if they are not guilty of war crimes , that idea does not appear to be widely accepted mirsad veladzic , who is president of the canton , roughly the equivalent of a state governor , said do n't talk to me about the serbs i'm just thinking about muslims when i have taken care of all our problems , then i can worry about serbs the number of serbs in bihac went from about 12 , 000 to 500 during the war because they wanted to leave or were afraid to stay the leader of the only remaining serb organization said serbs should not come back we have a place here only in our dreams map of bosnia and herzegovina shows the current areas of control andthe location of bihac

moscow , monday , dec 18 russian voters registered their deep frustration with four years of faltering reforms on sunday by voting for communists and nationalists in even larger numbers than many people expected , according to early returns in the parliamentary election it had long been assumed that communists would win the most parliamentary seats , and with results streaming in from the 100 , 000 polling points across the country , that seemed certain but the ultranationalist party of vladimir v zhirinovsky again confounded predictions by performing well in early results when mr zhirinovsky s liberal democratic party received more votes than any other party in 1993 it produced a shock that reverberated across russia and into the west this time the outrage at his apparent success was muted the administration of president boris n yeltsin has become deeply unpopular even among the reform parties that initially supported him and many of those who voted today did so with the paramount purpose of rejecting the government , its our home is russia party and , above all , mr yeltsin the government has to take a good look at these results , the communist party leader , gennadi zyuganov , said sunday night on national television after the first results had shown his party winning early pluralities in essentially every region reporting , from the pacific far east across the jewish autonomous republic to the industrial heartland of western siberia they are simply not going to be able to rule the way they have in the past any government that understands its policies are not supported must make a change early results were still sketchy and inconclusive by 6 am \( 10 pm sunday , eastern time \) , when only 6 percent of the country s vote had been counted that is in part because voting ended last in the most populous , european , part of russia even so , the results did not produce happy news for the government , whose leader , prime minister viktor s chernomydin , made no public appearance or statement preliminary data from 45 of russia s 89 regions showed that communists had received 23 percent of the party preference vote , mr zhirinovsky s party 14 percent , and women of russia , another opposition group , 6 percent the two largest of the centrist or reform groups , yabloko and our house is russia the government party led by mr chernomyrdin each also won about 6 percent a party must receive at least 5 percent of the votes cast in order to enter parliament most of the areas reporting first were in the far east , siberia , and the central urals , where independence from moscow is always prized and liberals are rare but the results were still surprising even in moscow , with just 5 percent of votes counted , the communists received 14 percent , as did yabloko as expected , our home is russia did better in the capital , because the party concentrated enormous resources here , with 19 percent of the early vote clarity does not come quickly in russian elections even once the final tally is in , the composition of parliament will be hard to determine immediately only half of the 450 seats in the lower house will be filled from party lists the rest will be filled by candidates elected directly in local districts on sunday that second half often decides the balance of power in parliament , but these candidates' real political affinities may not be known before the parliament convenes for the first time in january mr zyuganov , the communist leader , said on sunday night that he would seek to form a broad coalition , and would exclude nobody who opposes the government not even the most hardened nationalists like mr zhirinovsky from his discussions the turnout appeared to be more than 63 percent , according to the central election commission , and in some parts of the country people had to stand for more than two hours , often in freezing winds , to cast their ballots with many people here poorer , as well as more alienated from and suspicious of their leaders than ever before , the results were not totally unexpected they will , however , make it harder for mr yeltsin to push forward on his somewhat sporadic journey to a free market asked if the elections could mark a step back to communist rule , mr yeltsin replied abruptly , no , and no again no situation and nobody can force me to retreat from the chosen course of reform , mr yeltsin said he may find those words harder to live by in the coming months than they have been at any time during his presidency there are many in russia who say little is at stake in these elections because the constitution grants the president wideranging power and it gives the duma , as the lower house of parliament is called , almost none it will also probably be true that the overall makeup of the lower house will not be drastically changed it is badly fractured now , with opposition members a plurality , and that is not likely to change but the ability to make tough economic choices , particularly when it comes to closing inefficient factories and increasing unemployment , will only get harder for the government with the parliament opposing it there will not be an overall majority in this parliament , said nikolai ryabov , the chairman of the central election commission nobody is going to have enough votes to control it
st petersburg , fla with 14 days until their scheduled opener at camden yards , the baltimore orioles remain in a league of their own making none of the other 27 major league clubs will play exhibition games against the orioles and the orioles wo n't play the other 27 , either the irreparable parting of the ways was caused when the orioles' owner , peter angelos , ordered his team not to play with or against nonunion workers hired to replace striking major league players being isolated and left idle as other teams cruise a tenuous course toward the regular season has not caused the orioles to be inundated with selfdoubts rather , in what has to be one of the more delicious ironies in an otherwise distasteful spring , the serenity and sense of purpose that is missing at so many other spring training sites is very much evident in camp angelos i am very proud to be a member of this organization because of the position it s taking it s a breath of fresh air , frank robinson , a hall of famer who is the orioles' assistant general manager , said during a team workout at their complex here last week even if i had never worn the uniform , replacements are wrong this game is n't shooting itself in the foot they have a gun to its head now some might say that it is easy for a robinson or a roland hemond , the club s veteran general manager , to fall solidly in line behind the man who signs the paychecks fact is , though , that opposition by hemond and robinson to strikebreakers helped angelos form his club s policy we expressed our opinions independently because we have a great love for our game and have always been attempting to provide the very best for our organization and for our fans , hemond said that s been the essence of our existence as winter turns to spring , the orioles move closer to the possibility of paying severe penalties for their strike against the game if they do not take the field april 3 , when their first regularseason game is scheduled , the orioles face forfeiture of who knows how many games , and angelos faces suspension , fines , confiscation of the franchise or all three no matter , says robinson , formerly the orioles' manager in 1988 , i was a part of 21 straight losses here , and that was tough , he said and 162 , that would be real , real tough i would hate to be a part of that but if that s what it takes not to put replacement players on the field , so be it it s a sacrifice , but i 'd rather be on the right side of history and i know we are such selfassurance and genuine acceptance of the club s stance have trickled not only up to the owner s office , but also down through the organization that much is evidenced in the attitude of phil regan , the orioles' manager hired to replace the dismissed johnny oates , regan has yet to manage a game in the majors he has managed minor leaguers , more than 100 of them , all of them orioles this spring , in intrasquad game after intrasquad game now , the orioles are tackling the college ranks , en masse , and , to regan s credit , with some good humor we 've played eckerd college , manatee college , seton hall , regan said , smiling the last one , i told them if we won , we were going to omaha for the college world series that regan can laugh about his lot is enough to set him apart from most other major league managers , many of whom are somber and reluctant about working with replacements granted , regan , unlike most of his counterparts , still does not know where he will be come april 3 and yes , regan said , he and his coaches are often frustrated because of the great unknown and the valuable time lost to the strike , time the new manager might have otherwise enjoyed with the major leaguers he barely knows regan still seems able to find a bright side where other managers cannot our players here are playing for a purpose , regan said they 're getting ready for the season , whether it s in rochester or bowie and we 've gotten a lot accomplished it s really been invaluable to these kids , just in terms of instruction and intensity it really could accelerate them a year , because of the opportunities they 've had kris gresham , a 24yearold catcher , agreed normally , if you 're in a situation like i am and you have a chance to go to the big league camp , the emphasis is going to be on chris hoiles , gresham said , referring to the orioles' starting catcher i would get my work in , but there would n't have been as much emphasis on me now , though , we 're getting a little bit of an extra look because the 40man roster guys are n't here , he said , referring to those players who are on the major league roster and , therefore , on strike they 're getting to know us such are the benefits of 40 atbats as opposed to perhaps four innings in a normal spring before reassignment to a minor league camp we 've seen players improve since the beginning of spring training , hemond said in other years , you would see that , too , but this is n't as subtle , the changes and that s been refreshing , the teaching and the players wanting to learn the orioles have defined other positives such as the island of relative peace they have provided minor leaguers who might have otherwise been tainted by the most bitter labor dispute to hit professional sports hemond assured such peace the day the players reported , telling them they need never fear being pressured to play as replacements once that meeting took place , the pressure was off , said jeff huson , 29 , an infielder formerly with the texas rangers it s very nice coming to the ball park not having to worry about being labeled anything other than a baseball player no scab , ' no 'replacement player' and that helps your attitude , and helps preparing for the season , wherever it may be it s been really a relief , said gresham the intrasquad games are new to us , because we are used to playing other teams but if you play a replacement player , you 're considered a scab yourself so the orioles are not doing that to us peter angelos is sticking to his guns he wo n't put us in jeopardy when you have a boss looking out for guys at the lower level , he s looking out for your future hemond and regan are counting for some payback for all that comfort the club is providing , if and when the labor dispute ends there s going to be a lot of tension in those other clubhouses , regan said but when our guys come back , every one of these kids is going to be able to walk up to them and say , 'hey , glad to have you back' even if the youngsters and nonroster veterans like huson know it could mean slipping back to the recesses of the mind of the orioles' brain trust once more \? yes , huson insists the way i view it , if i have the ability to get to the big leagues , i want to get to the big leagues playing with a cal ripken jr , or playing against a frank thomas or a ken griffey jr , said huson , a 10year professional i want to be able to say i played with those guys i do n't want to say i played with joe the baker even if i do n't make it back , there s something about pride if you sacrifice pride , you sacrifice everything you do n't have anything left somehow , it seems , the orioles will continue to believe in their stance , a belief that even a 162game losing streak might not be able to shake photo minor leaguers like t r lewis , running drills at the orioles' spring camp , are receiving the full attention of the major league staff \( victor junco for the new york times \)
in the case of silicone breast implants , the courts and much of the scientific world have proceeded on strikingly unparallel tracks while the courts have handed down multimilliondollar awards based on the presumption of a health hazard , leading yesterday to dow corning s declaration of bankruptcy , the heavyduty scientific studies now being completed have pointed to exactly the opposite conclusion , that there is no evidence that breast implants are harmful part of the reason for this clash of cultures is that the legal world looks at individual cases of illness , whereas scientists hold that specially designed studies of whole populations are the only sure touchstone of truth the cases that have convinced the courts concern women who complain of debilitating and mysterious maladies that they attribute to silicone leaking from their breast implants several years ago , those individual cases , typically described as anecdotes by scientists , prompted several epidemiological studies to be undertaken in an effort to search for statistically valid links between the implants and any disease the conclusions of seven large epidemiological studies have now been reported , with the surprising result that none have found any evidence of health effects from breast implants these findings have carried particular weight among scientists i do n't know a single , highquality immunologist who is convinced that there is a definable disease related to implants , said dr john sergent , a professor of medicine at vanderbilt university in nashville and a former president of the american college of rheumatology health officials in other countries have also been convinced by the epidemiological studies france allowed the implants back on the market in february and britain s medical devices agency , which never stopped the sale of the implants , concluded again in december that they were safe the beginning of the end for breast implants in the united states came in 1992 , when dr david a kessler , the head of the food and drugs administration , said his agency was calling a voluntary moratorium on their use he said the data on record were not sufficient to show that implants were safe and he was concerned by the numbers of women who had come forward with health complaints lawsuits by women claiming injury then began to snowball many were based on the theory that although silicone was an inert substance , it or its breakdown products nonetheless deranged the immune system , causing a variety of otherwise inexplicable maladies medical experts summoned by the plaintiffs cited experiments showing that silicone could harm the immune systems of mice like many such experts , dr nir kossovsky , a materials scientist at the university of california at los angeles , who runs a testing laboratory for women with implants , said this means that silicone can account for many of the symptoms reported by breast implant patients these experts have also criticized the epidemiological studies , saying that had they continued for longer or examined more women they would have found the same kind of illnesses that afflicted the plaintiffs but scientists who are convinced by the new epidemiological studies view the treatment of the issue in the courts as a regrettable misuse of scientific evidence they regard the medical experts who testified for the plaintiffs as hired guns who do not represent the consensus of opinion developing in the medical field dr shaun ruddy of the medical college of virginia , the president of the american college of rheumatology and a specialist in connective tissue diseases like those being claimed by women with implants , said that so much money was at stake that it is very easy for people to lose their objectivity he said he knew of academic doctors who started filling out forms for lawyers at 1 , 000 bucks a pop i'm tremendously bothered , said dr elizabeth connell , a professor of gynecology and obstetrics at emory university school of medicine in atlanta i'm horrified dr connell led a food and drug administration advisory panel that concluded in 1991 that implants represented a public health need and should remain on the market while studies continued in a second meeting , the group concluded in 1992 that there was still no evidence positively linking the implants to diseases and that a need for them remained , but it recommended that women receiving implants be followed in scientific studies in response to daily requests for interviews over the last week , dr kessler s office repeatedly said that he was unavailable dr bernadine healy , a former director of the national institutes of health who is now director of health and science policy at the cleveland clinic , described the implant litigation as an abomination for women , adding , it s an abomination economically she said women were the pawns and the losers in what she regarded as a trial lawyers' game i find it hideous , she said scientists who have produced evidence or spoken against the link between implants and illness say their treatment by the plaintiffs' lawyers amounted to harassment in some cases one of the most influential papers that criticized the supposed link between implants and disease appeared on june 14 , 1994 , in the new england journal of medicine it was a study by dr

new york city might be able to sell all 11 of its public hospitals , but the experience in other cities and the rapidly changing healthcare marketplace suggest that the odds would be extremely long , several medicalcare experts said yesterday the national association of public hospitals , an industry group , said none of its 100 members had ever been sold to a private corporation , though some municipal or county hospitals , like boston city hospital , have sought mergers with other nearby nonprofit hospitals other public hospitals , like the memphis municipal hospital , have reorganized as private , nonprofit corporations that allowed them to be divorced from local politics , more flexible to renegotiate union contracts and free to seek patients from outside the city but there has n't been a public hospital that s been outright sold , said tiffany skrutsky , a spokeswoman for the hospital association new york city s public hospital system is unlike that of any other american city , and the experience elsewhere may not indicate what would happen if mayor rudolph w giuliani were to decide to adopt the recommendation of a mayoral panel and tried to sell all of the city s hospitals three city hospitals were put up for sale earlier this year with their long history of treating poor patients and with about 18 million city residents on medicaid , the basic healthcare program for the poor at least some of new york s hospitals might prove attractive to nonprofit or even forprofit hospital corporations , some experts said , adding that organizations building managedcare networks could find some city hospitals attractive , at the right price there is a lot of money being spent for health care for these people , and one presumes that where there is a lot of money being spent , people are interested , said martin d arrick , a director at standard poor s who specializes in health care the creditrating agency has assessed the bonds of the city s health and hospitals corporation in the past could one strike the right price \? he said i do n't see why not there s no reason why they could n't be sold a decision to buy a city hospital would probably depend more on the strategies and goals of a potential buyer than on the physical asset that each city hospital represents , mr arrick said around the country , some managedcare organizations are devoted to serving medicaid patients and make a profit doing so it may or may not work in new york i know there is plenty of interest , mr arrick said other healthcare analysts were more pessimistic , however , about the prospects for selling many or all of the city s public hospitals they argued that the rapid shift toward managed care would inevitably lead to the closing of some of new york city s hospitals , no matter who owned them under managed care , patients must get permission from plan administrators before entering the hospital administrators also decide the amounts that their agencies will reimburse the hospitals that generally reduces hospital stays in recent years , occupancy rates have declined in nearly all of new york s public and private hospitals , in response to pressures from insurers , managedcare organizations and government down the road we will have hospitals that are forced to close , said robert d gumbs , executive director of the health systems agency , a nonprofit group that is the statedesignated health planning agency for new york city we will have hospitals , not just public but also voluntary , that we will not be able to give away , simply because occupancy rates will continue to drop as managed care continues to take hold in this market , mr gumbs said i think that makes any hospital less marketable than it was a few years ago the focus of care is moving away from hospitals , and new york s dilemma is that we have a hospitalreliant system , he said we will see fewer and fewer hospitals it s a foregone conclusion , mr gumbs said that s the issue that people have to begin to address do you allow a pure market decision to make that determination , or do you put in safeguards that assure that your most vulnerable communities have access to care \?
lyons , france , june 3 accustomed to being challenged , provoked and even shocked by the american choreographer bill t jones , dance lovers here seemed unprepared for the respectful sobriety of his latest creation , an homage to lyons s own lumiere brothers on the 100th anniversary of their invention of modern cinema not that the 80minute work , 24 frames per second , lacked sensuality as auguste and louis lumiere danced a steamy tango together , or the soundtrack boomed out rhythmic breathing that ended in a sexual climax , or a nearnaked woman wearing a white falcon s head symbolized flights of cinematic imagination it was just that this year s lumiere anniversary the brothers' first 50second movie was shot outside their family s factory here on march 19 , 1895 is a major event for lyons and , as resident choreographer at the lyons opera ballet , mr jones clearly felt that this occasion was more suited to poetic narrative than emotional agitation or political controversy true , the audience responded warmly to the piece at the lyons opera on friday , when it began a nineperformance run that ends on sunday but there was none of the cheering or footstamping that followed the world premiere of mr jones s own company s work , still here , in lyons last fall even his french admirers , it seems , now expect to be disturbed le monde s dance critic , dominique fretard , was struck by the contrast with still here , the muchdiscussed work that mr jones , who is himself hivpositive , based on his socalled survival workshops with people suffering from terminal illnesses with this piece , bill t jones offers a beautiful escape , a bit like alice in wonderland , she wrote it s a child s dream it s desire mr jones has welcomed the respite after all the brouhaha of still here , ' i wanted to go back to the studio , to dance more , to feel my own muscles again , he said in an interview he does not dance in 24 frames per second , which he created for the lyons opera ballet but , he noted , every phrase you see , other than the tango and the waltzes , are phrases i made on my body through dance , then , he tells the story of cinema , albeit impressionistically he said the initial idea of showing the passage from silent movies to talkies and from blackandwhite to color proved too complicated so instead , eager to use two particular dancers , the american eric geiger and the italian edmond russo , mr jones focused on the lumiere brothers themselves when the curtain rises , the two young men in turnofthecentury formal attire have just found a metal tube they inspect it and discover it contains a light , which picks out pieces of machinery scattered across the stage and then falls on a barechested woman representing a bird the machinery takes on the form of a projector , the bird begins to move and cinema is born from this quiet beginning , the work moves quickly to the dances and songs popular in lyons around 1895 and with strobe lights creating the staccato movements of early movies , the 23 dancers reenact two of the lumiere brothers' first films , one of workers leaving the family s factory , the other of a train arriving at la ciotat station continuity is provided by the brothers and the bird \( danced by an american , julie bacon , who recently moved here from the boston ballet \) , but mr jones s history of cinema travels from waltzes to the tango , from the screams of 1930 s horror movies to the cheerful bigband era of the 1950 s and to suggest today s xrated movies , while some dancers peer at a screen offstage , others dance to the sound of heavy breathing for the third and final section of the piece , though , mr jones wanted to spotlight the world of dance we threw out the idea of costumes trying to look 1995 and the dancers wear the clothes they dance in every day , he said over tea in the patio of a hotel in the old section of lyons if my piece is about anything , it is about my commitment to live theater , to flesh and bones and the sweating person it was , in fact , the choice he first made when he was studying film at the state university at binghamton , ny , almost 25 years ago everyone wanted to become an independent film maker , the 43yearold choreographer recalled , but i chose dance something direct , engaging , poetic my muscles understood it , my mind and heart followed when he looks at today s movies , he does not regret his decision how did we get from that innocence of the early years of cinema to almost any film today that has the most shocking acts of violence and sexuality mixed together \? he wondered aloud there was a human scale to their aspirations and i look at us now how did we get from there to here \? still , mr jones ends 24 frames per second on an optimistic note a large movie projector appears , the bird takes her place before it and then a screen leaves the lumiere brothers standing alone at the front of the stage , watching a silhouette of the dancing bird finally , her place is taken by the image of a white dove flying silently across the screen mr jones clearly enjoys working with the lyons opera ballet , which will be performing later this month in berkeley , calif , at festivities marking the 50th anniversary of the signing of the united nations charter he created love defined for the 30member company before he became its resident choreographer in january 1994 he has since created i want to cross over as well as 24 frames per second , and his initial twoyear contract has been extended through 1997 working with lyons s classically trained dancers , though , has tested him in new ways i am constantly translating very personal and cultural experiences to people who are willing , but do n't have any way of understanding , he said my vocabulary , all these wiggles and isolations that i do and always have done , they 're ours i tell them , 'i want you to release your hip , ' he went on 'no , do n't roll your hip it s not jazz we 're using a hip movement release it' he sighed at the problems of getting his message over this is a big organization you ca n't get fired i ca n't just say , do this last year , i heard they were afraid of me because i would explode in a nondirected way i do n't do that now and that s good for me yorgos loukos , the dance director at the lyons opera ballet , said the dancers have also had to adjust technically , i would say they have n't changed that much , he said , but from a human point of view they have made great progress with bill he challenges them from a moral point of view because he wants everyone to know at every stage of his life that he is a militant gay man still , as he prepared to resume work with his own dancers , the bill t jones arnie zane dance company , mr jones said he felt rewarded by the reception that lyons continues to give his works people go to the theater here with great expectations and gusto and enthusiasm , he said my own company has found great popular support here maybe it s the kind of politically based work i have been doing i'm amazed by people s openness photo bill t jones , rehearsing his 24 frames per second with the lyons opera ballet it is a sensual , respectful homage to the movies \( jeanmarie huron editing , for the new york times \)
on sunday night mike wallace of 60 minutes proved once again that , yes , vincent foster did commit suicide in fort marcy park , virginia , in july 1993 as news goes , this story is only slightly more shocking than dogbitesman among the others who have judged the foster death a suicide are two congressional committees run by republicans , the fbi , foster s own family , the fairfax county medical examiner and the first of the whitewater independent counsels , robert fiske so why did mr wallace even bother to investigate \? there is less evidence to support the supposition that foster s death was a homicide than there is to prove that nicole brown simpson was murdered by colombian drug dealers but as mr wallace explained , facts are n't the issue in the incredible foster murder case public opinion is despite all the official findings , polls show that twothirds of americans still remain unconvinced that foster killed himself and so 60 minutes dutifully deflated the more widely circulated conspiracy theories , with mr wallace even demonstrating on himself how the blood foster spilled was consistent with a selfinflicted bullet wound to the head end of story \? not quite before we try once again to lay vince foster , poor man , to rest , it s worth looking at exactly why these cockamamie scenarios about his demise have had such a long and widespread shelf life it s not because they 're plausible it s not because the american people are so credulous or mindlessly antigovernment that they see an oliver stone plot behind every official corpse , however obscure no , the real story here has to do with money , and the power of money to spread noxious propaganda throughout the body politic in this case , the money belongs to a littleknown man often described as reclusive richard mellon scaife an heir to the vast mellon fortune with a net worth estimated by forbes at 800 million , mr scaife plays a role in several family foundations that have for decades contributed huge sums to rightwing causes and think tanks he also is the owner of a small newspaper near his hometown of pittsburgh , the tribunereview , which just happens to be the only daily in the country persistently floating theories of a foster murder and coverup since it s not exactly easy to find the tribunereview on your local newsstand and since no reputable news organization , conservative ones included , takes the paper s foster reportage seriously enough to reprint it mr scaife finds other ways to spread the news for well over a year now , papers stretching from the washington post to the los angeles times have run costly fullpage ads reiterating the tribunereview s findings the ads are placed by a nonprofit california organization calling itself the western journalism center what the ads do n't say is that the western journalism center is a recipient of scaife foundation largess who else gets money from one scaife foundation or another \? as the arkansas democratgazette reported two weeks ago , the list includes the magazine the american spectator and the organization accuracy in media , both of which also keep the foster story simmering , as well as the national taxpayers union , whose chairman , james dale davidson , fans the tribunereview s foster flames in both a newsletter and a widely merchandised videotape mr wallace did an expert job of finding errors in that videotape on 60 minutes but perhaps not even the cbs of old let alone the enfeebled cbs of today could counter an extravagantly funded , multimedia disinformation campaign assaulting americans from all sides under a variety of journalistic rubrics according to the magazine christian century , the scaife fortune is filtered into outlets as various as net , the conservative tv channel , and 70 conservative college newspapers none of this is illegal , of course in america , those who hate a president have the right to spend every last penny to try to tar him with the death of a close aide but in the end the strange case of vincent foster may say less about either bill clinton or his political nemeses than it does about the power of anyone with an unlimited checkbook to roil national opinion about any issue without ever letting voters see who s pulling the strings
teshi , ghana seated in his roadside workshop , where he put the finishing touches on a coffin in the form of a bush taxi that was realistic down to the curves of the front bumper , laryea okai seemed stumped by the question of how he would choose to be buried as one of ghana s master coffin makers , the decision was not simple even if he were to pick from the colorful menagerie on hand that day , the choices ranged from gigantic crabs and lobsters , which seemed to long for the surf , to mansized pods of cocoa and ears of corn i'm not ready to make that kind of choice yet , the 33yearold mr okai said , smiling but when it is time for me to go , i think i would like to be buried as a hammer or a saw i just love my tools in the meantime , mr okai , a sinewy 20year veteran of his trade , is enjoying a phenomenal boom in designer coffins that has swept this twomile stretch of beachhugging road , where carpenters of his ga ethnic group have long hammered together exotic burial vessels it is not that more people are dying , he said , but that suddenly what had been an honor reserved for his people s chiefs has caught on with the general public the coffins are used in everything from traditional burials of african chiefs , in which local religions figure prominently , to virtually all manner of christian burials when death strikes in west africa , even the poorest have long dug out hardearned savings from their mattresses to organize feasts and hire the orchestras whose music helps see off their loved ones in style for the wealthier classes , special cloth is printed , often bearing the likeness of the deceased , to be worn by all who take part in the funeral but for many ghanaians nowadays , burial in an ordinary coffin is becoming declasse among those who can afford it , more and more people are choosing a carved and painted coffin as the ultimate status symbol for the burial of their relatives a loaf of bread might be a family s choice for a baker , a fish for fisherman , a huge hen for the mother of a large family whatever best serves as a statement about the deceased s life or livelihood most of what i do is still for chiefs , mr okai said , pointing to the dozen or so coffins , none of them the rectangular boxes commonly associated with burial , that crowded his dusty workplace some people will come in and order a mercedesbenz or a bedford lorry , and i will have to turn them down i am an artist , and i save my art for those who can most appreciate it mr okai can afford to turn his nose up by deciding on his own what is an appropriate coffin for a particular customer although he feigns to service only the noble , like other ga coffin builders in the area , he runs a handsome side business selling his wares to collectors in the united states and europe in a country where annual per capita income is about 400 , his works often fetch 2 , 000 or more down the road , paa joe , 50 , will have none of his colleague s snobbery he has been building designer coffins for 18 years , and he remembers well the days when tradition more than popular tastes governed his coffin business he says he now has trouble keeping enough apprentices on hand , because as soon as they feel they have reached basic competency , each one wants to strike on his own in what has become a lucrative business there was a time when we too only sold to chiefs and the like , mr joe said , his prosperous waist peeking out from under his tshirt nowadays we average 10 or so a month , and the only thing we do n't do is make coffins for children there again , the reason is that children do n't have a trade yet , not because of any taboo modesty prevents him from saying so himself , but mr joe , who was an apprentice under some of the trade s past masters , is considered by many of his peers to be the coffin world s ultimate craftsman among his wealthy clientele , some customers are known to buy their coffins long before death , placing them on display as decoration in a family room for all to see as he flips through his voluminous catalogue of creations with a visitor , mr joe seems proudest of the requests that have posed the most unusual technical challenges i once had to make a coffin for a very popular lorry driver , he said the man s colleagues insisted that i build a lorry complete with all the wiring a horn , the headlights , a radio and cassette player , even a light on the top i told them there was nothing i could do about the battery once it had run down in a region where poverty stunts peoples' lives and clips their dreams , mr joe likened being a coffin builder to being a sort of santa claus of the afterlife someone may have wanted to travel overseas all of their life , but never made it beyond their village , he said , pointing to a scale model of an air canada jet , seemingly ready for takeoff it makes people very happy when their relatives offer them something like this for burial it makes me happy too photo the ghanaians who construct designer coffins are workingfeverishly to keep up with demand the vogue has caught on with the public , and the object is to find a design suitable to the life the person led for example a fisherman s coffin might be a giant fish above , the coffin shop of paa joe in teshi \( robert grossman for the new york times \) map of ghana
the columbia gas system inc and its pipeline subsidiary , which is one of the major transporters of gas to the east coast , filed bankruptcy reorganization plans yesterday in an effort to break a long deadlock with major creditors key to the two reorganization plans are proposed agreements with a major creditor group john h croom , the pipeline subsidiary chairman and chief executive , said he was optimistic that the various creditor groups would vote to accept the plan , under which the parent company will distribute about 36 billion to its creditors he said that at this point none of the various committees who represent the interests of the creditors were opposed to the plan under plan filed by its pipeline subsidiary in federal bankruptcy court in wilmington , del , all the gas producers will be paid about 12 billion in claims eighteen of the largest , representing about 80 percent of the total claims , have agreed to the reorganization it was longterm contracts signed with these producers in the 1960 s and 1970 s that eventually forced the company and its pipeline subsidiary , the columbia gas transmission corporation , to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors on july 31 , 1991 the transmission company was a major seller of gas to customers and had locked itself into what became highpriced contracts to assure a supply in the late 1980 s , contrary to most projections , gas prices began to drop a series of unusually warm winters also cut the demand in addition , the federal energy regulatory commission required that pipeline capacity be made available to wholesale and industrial customers to transport gas they bought directly from producers customers , who had been captive to columbia gas , began to buy low cost gas on the spot market , further cutting demand at the same time the company was obligated to buy gas under the longterm contracts even when it did not need it caught in a vise , columbia gas and its subsidiary filed for bankrupty protection when it began to run out of cash the step allowed the company to get from under more than 4 , 800 gas purchase contracts and it began buying gas at lower market prices in 1993 , columbia s pipeline subsidiary got out of the business of selling gas and is now mainly a transporter and storer these moves helped the company to recover financially its income began to rise in 1992 and it earned 241 million in 1994 it has also built up a cash reserve of about 1 billion the parent company has continued to invest hundreds of millions to upgrade its pipeline system of 23 , 000 miles , which extends from the gulf of mexico to the northeast it is expanding capacity to deliver gas on the eastern portions its system , which serves ohio , pennsylvania , kentucky , west virginia , virginia and maryland it also brings gas to new york and new jersey while changing the way it does business to adjust to the new compeitive world columbia gas has been seeking to find a plan acceptable to its creditors mr croom said that the attempt to reorganize was very complicated because in addition to the regular creditor groups it had to deal with the state regulators and federal agencies that still oversee the gas industry the plan must still be approved by judge helen balick of the bankruptcy court in wilmington and the securities and exchange commission it would then be sent to the various creditor groups
atlanta , june 25 the mets roughed up the best pitcher on the planet , greg maddux , for two runs in the first inning and 10 hits over all , the highest number of hits the threetime cy young award winner has allowed this season but it s not what the mets did but rather what they did n't do against the atlanta braves today that has landed them in sole possession of last place in the national league east for the first time this season after scoring two runs on four hits off maddux in the first inning , the mets could n't come up with a clutch hit the rest of the game the mets left 11 runners on base , including 6 in scoring position starter pete harnisch could n't hold on to his early advantage and lost a lead for the third time in his last eight starts and second baseman jeff kent turned a onerun braves lead in the seventh into a tworun lead when he blew a potential basesloaded double play by throwing the ball into the dirt in front of the plate for an error it resulted in a raindelayed 42 victory for the braves , who won the last two games of the threegame series at fulton county stadium the mets had won the opener by 93 on friday and thought they might have turned the corner on their season of frustration instead , they head to florida for a threegame series , trailing the marlins by half a game in the standing and 17 1 2 games behind the divisionleading philadelphia phillies that last place stinks , outfielder ryan thompson said i do n't want to be the team people look forward to playing that s what lastplace teams get it s definitely not where we want to be , added first baseman rico brogna we know we 're better than last place but that s the reality of the situation we have to change that manager dallas green was drenched with the look of frustration after the mets' eighth loss in 10 games and 14th defeat in their last 19 outings we have a chance to beat the best pitcher in baseball and we do n't play the game the way it s supposed to be played , he said maddux \( 71 \) survived six innings , struck out three and walked none in a shaky but gritty effort he was in trouble in the first when thompson scored joe orsulak on a dribbler halfway down the thirdbase line that stayed in fair territory kent then drove home brogna with a sharp single to right to give the mets a 20 lead maddux , who has a leaguelow earned run average of 185 , frustrated the mets the rest of the way they left a total of seven runners on base , including five in scoring position in the fourth , fifth , sixth and seventh innings we had our chances , said third baseman bobby bonilla after the braves had recovered for a 32 lead , kent made it 42 in the seventh when he turned a potential doubleplay ball into an error the braves loaded the bases with no outs and chased harnisch \( 15 \) eric gunderson entered in relief and got the braves' hottest hitter , ryan klesko , to bounce a grounder to second kent fielded the ball cleanly but rushed his throw home wide right and short of the plate catcher todd hundley dived for the ball but could n't make the catch as chipper jones scored from third it sure was n't pretty , green said it was kent s eighth error of the season i tried to turn two before i even threw the ball , he said i just threw the ball away at 2036 , the mets have officially hit bottom , and they are only one game better than their disastrous 1993 season when they finished 59103 you really ca n't compare the two teams , bonilla said in '93 we were expected to win , but it s a little different this year because of the young players if these guys think they 're going through rough times , they should have been here in 1992 and 1993 the youth of this team allows for finding some positives in the defeats green liked the intensity his players showed throughout the series we played with more emotion and more character , he said bonilla pointed out the makeover of the mets is just beginning being in new york , you 'd like to see more good things happen , bonilla said changes need to be made , but there s a waitandsee process going on it s mindboggling because nobody really knows what s going on we 've got a lot of youngsters who have to prove themselves because decisions have to be made you have to grow , and these are the growing pains you go through inside pitch infielder bill spiers returned to new york after sunday s game to have his right shoulder examined by dr david altchek , the team physician spiers , who left saturday s game with a sore shoulder in the seventh inning , is expected to rejoin the team in florida in time for monday night s game the mets experienced their first rain delay of season when the game was halted for 1 hour 11 minutes in the top of the fourth inning rico brogna and todd hundley each had three hits photo braves second baseman rafael belliard running down jeff kent s sixthinning pop fly \( associated press \)
washington robert e rubin first heard about mexico s currency crisis when he was on christmas vacation in the british virgin islands , just weeks before his move from the national economic council in the white house to the office of secretary of the treasury his initial instinct , he tells visitors with the selfdeprecating halfsmile that has become his trademark in washington , was to let the mexicans and the market sort it out , and to return to the important business of casting for bonefish in the azure waters of the caribbean my first reaction was that financial distress in mexico was a very serious problem , he said the other day but other countries have had financial problems and the appropriate adjustments get made the phone kept ringing , though , with a series of increasingly dire warnings from the undersecretary of the treasury , lawrence h summers , and the chairman of the federal reserve , alan greenspan , about what could happen next if a currency crisis turned into something far worse the more the 56yearold former cochairman of goldman sachs company thought about it , the more he became convinced that in mexico the administration was faced with the most modern of foreign policy crises no troops , no nukes , just the potential for global financial apocalypse if mexico s imminent default on billions of dollars in bonds prompted a pullout from scores of emerging markets for which mexico was a beacon even the enemy was different beyond a recalcitrant new congress , mr rubin was wrestling several million investors participants in pension and mutual funds that have rushed into international markets who finally put forth a set of nonnegotiable demands and were threatening to suck every peso back home from mexico and leave it in economic rubble this is n't the old days where there are three rich market manipulators in a back room threatening to pull the pin , mr rubin said now , it s everyone ultimately , it was those threats that forced mr rubin and the white house chief of staff , leon panetta who were sharing a pizza at 11 30 monday night when they were joined by president clinton to decide that congress was not about to act on 40 billion in loan guarantees and that markets were not about to forgive a few slices later , the three men opted for plan b an extraordinary order to use 20 billion in treasury funds under the president s control to keep mexico from defaulting on its shortterm bonds and to restore investor confidence however , 20 billion was not enough , so mr summers was dispatched to squeeze another 178 billion out of the international monetary fund the tactic so angered many european allies that when they were asked to formally approve the loan on wednesday six abstained , opening a rare rift within the organization irritating the allies , whose finance ministers he met yesterday in toronto for the first time as treasury secretary , was the least of mr rubin s problems over the last four weeks aiding mexico was a political loser for mr clinton it was left to mr rubin to tell the president that the markets would no longer wait for democrats and republicans to make up their minds , and that the political risk of failing to act could be enormous in boom times that is , until december mexico was the kind of country that president clinton regularly hailed as an engine of growth for the new american economy exports are the source of millions of new , highwage jobs , the administration has told anyone who will listen , and demand from the big emerging markets from brazil to china to indonesia are where america s exportled economic future lies it was a positive message , brimming with hope in the last few weeks , however , before he even had a chance to move into lloyd bentsen s old office on the third floor of the treasury , mr rubin suddenly found himself explaining to congress about the twoedged realities of a financial world that at times may be a bit too global for its own good the first part of the explanation was straightforward geography still counts in foreign affairs , and political and social chaos in mexico would mean trouble on the border a half million more illegal immigrants , a threat to 700 , 000 american jobs dependent on exports to mexico more difficult was what the softspoken mr rubin , choosing his words carefully so as not to trigger the panic he was trying to avoid , called the potential catalytic impact of a collapse in the mexican market there is an unique role that mexico has played in the past five or six years as a prototype of a developing country coming into the modern world , said mr rubin , who unlike his dressedtothenines predecessor often cruises the hallways of the the treasury in shirtsleeves , the knot of his tie dangling a few inches below his neck it is the linchpin , the model and i do n't think any other country plays such a pivotal role a massive outflow of investor confidence in mexico city , he argued , could trigger the same in other economies highly dependent on foreign investment for growth and that would threaten the reforms , the democratization and the growth to which the united states has linked its own future
hopatcong , nj , sept 2 tim clancy was out fishing on lake hopatcong late the other night when his boat was almost run over by two sleek cigarette boats , one 30 feet long , the other 27 feet , he said both were cruising slowly mr clancy is convinced the operators saw him but did not care about his boat and fishing lines as far as i'm concerned , they 're both too big for a lake this size , he said it gets hairy out on the lake now , to the point of being dangerous drayton mook , 82 and a lifelong summer resident , has a different complaint increasingly in recent years , he says , cabin cruisers and outboards anchor in clusters off his handsome home in byram cove one day this summer i counted 204 of them an alltime record , mr mook said the occupants swim , sun , socialize and party but for mr mook , the clusters become an obstacle course whenever he tries to steer his antique mahogany chris craft into his boathouse as summer draws to a close on lake hopatcong , new jersey s biggest and busiest lake , an antiboat chorus is strong and steady all variety of powerboats whiz around the lake on summer weekends , and some residents contend that too many are too big and too powerful for a lake that is eight miles long and full of coves and islands they complain that the biggest ones generate two and threefoot waves that constantly pound into and eventually damage docks and seawalls , erode shorelines and make sailing and canoeing just about impossible i 've seen 32foot boats out there , marty kane , president of the lake hopatcong historical society , said you expect to see that at barnegat bay or in the hamptons , not on a small inland lake there are no regulations on size you could put the queen mary on the lake we 're not saying , 'bring it back to canoes only' but if everyone had a 16footer , there would n't be any problems at all few , if any , around the lake seriously promote the idea that boats longer than 16 feet must go but a campaign is under way to create an agency to regulate boating on the lake and to charge boat owners fees to use it clifford r lundin , the mayor of hopatcong , one of four communities on the lake , proposed the idea in midaugust at a symposium on the lake s future sponsored by the lake hopatcong yacht club the club s members complain that bigger and bigger boats have ruined their tradition of weekend sailing mr lundin seeks the creation of a strong , 12member agency of residents to take charge of managing the lake he says that 15 different state departments and agencies now have a regulatory say on the lake and that the state s oversight is fragmented , confused and indifferent we 're basically ignored by the state , mayor lundin said its emphasis is on the jersey shore all the dollars are aimed at the shore the board he proposes , the lake hopatcong watershed management district , would have the power to adopt and enforce boating regulations and to regulate the discharge of waste into the lake and the ground water in the lake s basin it would also regulate stormwater runoff , businesses and all forms of construction on the shoreline the agency would replace a weak , 22yearold advisory body , the lake hopatcong regional planning board , that has no office , telephone or fulltime paid staff the board s main accomplishment so far has been the annual harvesting of about two million pounds of weeds that would otherwise have encouraged the growth of aquatic vegetation , which erodes water quality but the weeds are still fed by other nutrients in the lake , principally phosphorous , which comes from septic tank runoff and storm water , said dr stephen souza , the director of aquatic programs for coastal environment services , a consulting firm in princeton , and the waterquality adviser for the lake planning board residents say another problem is that none of the lake hopatcong marinas have pumping stations to drain the portable toilets on cabin cruisers although there is no data on such discharge , some residents are convinced that the sewage ends up in the lake because of careless boaters dr souza says the data on the lake s health is mixed there s been some improvement in the deepest part of the main body of the lake , he said but we have seen a decline in water quality in some coves and shallower parts mayor lundin says little headway will be made against the lake s problems without the creation of the management agency but it would need approval of the three other towns on the lake and the state his proposal is modeled after the lake george park commission , a powerful agency created by new york state in 1987 to protect water quality in lake george it has broad powers that include regulating the speed , noise and sanitary facilities of boats on the lake money for the commission comes from special registration fees on powerboats above 10 horsepower and sailboats over 18 feet , along with dock fees mayor lundin said the agency he proposes could employ a similar registrationfee system on lake hopatcong some marina operators and boat owners frown on the idea of a management agency one operator who spoke on condition of anonymity said that lake hopatcong can accommodate the boats on it now the solution to the lake s problems , he said , is increasing the number of state police patrol boats to four from two and requiring that marinas have pumping stations for marine toilets the lake does n't belong to one person or people with lakefront homes , he said it belongs to all the people of new jersey marvin haas of wayne agreed as he docked his 25foot cabin cruiser , go for broke , the other afternoon last time i looked , this was a state lake , he said the lake is crowded with boats on many summer weekends , mr haas said but we 're also contributing to the local economy we pay a good amount to dock here photos a variety of powerboats whiz around lake hopatcong on summer weekends , and some residents contend that too many are too big and too powerful for a lake that is eight miles long and full of coves and islands last time i looked , this was a state lake , said marvin haas of wayne , nj , who stood beside his 25foot cabin cruiser , go for broke boat owners , he added , are also contributing to the local economy \( photographs by chris maynard for the new york times \) map shows the location of lake hapatcong

a lawyer for sheik omar abdel rahman , the muslim cleric from egypt charged with plotting bombings and assassinations in new york , sought yesterday to paint an important prosecution witness as a lying , doubledealing opportunist and childsnatcher whose testimony could not be believed the witness , abdo mohammed haggag , a former aide to mr abdel rahman , testified last week at the cleric s trial in manhattan that mr abdel rahman had told him to assassinate president hosni mubarak of egypt while mr mubarak was on a visit to the united states two years ago that testimony was particularly significant because until then in the fourmonthold trial in federal district court , the only important evidence against mr abdel rahman had come from a former egyptian military officer who infiltrated the cleric s inner circle as a paid informer for the fbi and who admitted on the witness stand that he had lied about his past yesterday , lynne f stewart , the defense lawyer , sought to convince the jury that mr haggag s account of his conversation with mr abdel rahman to which there were no witnesses and which was not recorded was not credible she got mr haggag to acknowledge telling various lies on other topics to united states authorities after he began cooperating with them and to his associates among followers of mr abdel rahman under questioning , mr haggag also acknowledged that in the 1980 s he had persuaded a friend to take his 6monthold son from new jersey to egypt while mr haggag , a 35yearold immigrant from egypt , and his americanborn wife were involved in a bitter divorce and custody battle he also admitted that he had aided another man in that man s successful effort to spirit away his own 5yearold son to egypt during a battle with his estranged wife mr haggag said that as part of the scheme , he had offered the man drugs that might be used to sedate the woman so the child could be taken from her did n't it occur to you that taking a child away from a parent was against the law \? ms stewart , the lawyer , asked the father was taking the child , mr haggag responded in arabic , his testimony translated by an interpreter in any case , he added , he did not know that such behavior was illegal under new jersey law ms stewart is expected to question mr haggag today about another scheme to which he has already admitted as part of a plea deal with the prosecution , mr haggag , a jersey city resident , has pleaded guilty to setting fire in 1991 to a denville , nj , cafe he coowned in a plot to collect insurance money under that deal , he agreed to testify for the prosecution in the trial , in which 10 other muslim men besides mr abdel rahman are the defendants the prosecution agreed to drop charges accusing mr haggag of having also been one of the conspirators the defendants are accused of plotting in 1993 to blow up such major buildings and transportation links in new york as the united nations headquarters , the lincoln and holland tunnels and the george washington bridge because of their opposition to united states policies in the middle east the conspiracy also is said to have included the plot to murder mr mubarak , whose secular government , with its strong ties to the united states , mr abdel rahman has long sought to topple the prosecution also charges that the february 1993 bombing of the world trade center in lower manhattan was part of the overall conspiracy as well , though none of the 11 men now on trial are accused of carrying that attack four other followers of mr abdel rahman have been convicted of doing so the defense contends that the charges are trumped up , to punish the defendants for their strident opposition to united states policy in the middle east and to help the egyptian government by sending mr abdel rahman to prison in america mr haggag also acknowledged yesterday that he had lied to american authorities after agreeing to cooperate with them for example , he had told them untruthfully that he had not served as a paid informer for the egyptian government in fact , he had been paid by the egyptians to provide information about the purported plot to assassinate president mubarak and about one of the men later convicted in the world trade center bombing he agreed that the information he provided about the man , mahmud abouhalima , led to his arrest in egypt after he fled there following the bombing , in which six people died mr haggag also said he was working to aid the men arrested in the bombing even while informing on mr abouhalima you turned in mahmud at the same time you were arranging defense committees , right \? ms stewart pressed yes , the witness said
washington , march 14 if american business has received a single clear message from the clinton administration during the last year , here it is join the age of economic engagement , by helping the united states win over the souls of authoritarian regimes through greater access to american capital and investment that has been the logic with china , ever since the clinton administration dramatically reversed gears a year ago and argued that investing in china would change beijing s attitude on human rights and the export of missiles it has been the logic with north korea , where american business executives are already exploring investment opportunities and it has applied in vietnam , where the administration decided to take considerable political heat from veterans groups so that american companies would not miss out on economic openings perhaps then it is understandable how conoco , the oil company subsidiary of the du pont company , missed the signals on iran , and ended up losing a huge oil exploration deal after all , president clinton appeared to be reversing course again today in using an executive order to bar the transaction the administration is still struggling to explain how it has become such a vociferous advocate of economic diplomacy in dealing with some authoritarian regimes , while preaching the need for economic containment in places like iran , iraq and cuba we draw the line in countries with policies that are beyond the pale , one senior administration official said today , ticking off iran s sponsorship of terrorism , its violation of human rights , its nuclear ambitions but the market reality is this while turning investment on and off may be the primary weapon washington has left in its foreign policy arsenal these days , it is only powerful if the rest of america s allies go along in iran s case , that rarely happens so the iranians know that if conoco is prohibited from spending 1 billion developing its offshore oilfields , someone else in this case the french companies elf aquitaine sa and total will be standing in the wings nor has the united states had much success getting others to join its halfhearted ban on iranian oil exports for years , japanese and american diplomats have professed the same goals in their attempts to change the behavior of the iranian regime yet in 1993 japan brought in 370 , 000 barrels a day , making it iran s biggest export market washington has rarely been in a position to complain publicly about all this , because its sanctions on iran have never been as tough as its oratory three successive administrations have reviewed iran policy , and last year secretary of state warren christopher said the administration s policy was one of active containment but the government has all along permitted american companies to buy , refine and sell iranian oil , as long as they do it off american shores and through subsidiaries and once refined , it is impossible to tell the source of the oil at least some of it undoubtedly flows back through american gas pumps it was through this loophole that conoco tried to leap none of the oil in the deal it signed earlier this month was to be sold directly in the united states no prohibition existed until today against the financing and service agreement conoco planned to sign as one administration official acknowledged today , the deal was legal but flagrantly in the cracks of the law the president acted , his spokesman , michael d mccurry , said , because the deal would represent a substantial new capacity for oil production by iran he continued , and that is , among other reasons , why the president felt it would dangerously add to their economic capacity to do the things that we find objectionable in the world community of course , that is exactly the argument that the administration s critics have used in attacking its policy elsewhere in the world presumably economic engagement with north korea , however limited , frees resources for that insular country to develop its missile arsenal , one of its biggest exports dealings with china inevitably enrich the people s liberation army , which holds big stakes in many of the busiest factories in shanghai and shenzen china is periodically accused of shipping its missiles to iran , another of the chinese army s main industries so why is what is right in china wrong in iran \? it s not entirely clear if mr mccurry s comments are taken to their logical conclusion , allowing american companies to buy upward of 25 percent of iran s oil production is contributing to the regime s health and longevity indeed , that is the argument put forth by senator alfonse m d'amato , the new york republican who is now the chairman of the senate banking committee he has introduced legislation to prohibit american companies or their foreign subsidiaries from doing business with iran we are subsidizing iranian terrorism by purchasing their oil , and it has to stop , senator d'amato said recently he is soon to hold hearings on the policy , hoping to embarrass the administration into taking a harder line by exposing its internal inconsistencies perhaps the real reason that the administration was able to act so strongly today is simple politics after all , what iran lacks in the united states , for understandable reasons , is any constituency in congress the administration was under tremendous pressure from the business community last year to separate human rights from the issue of trade preferences for china there is an active vietnam business lobby , led by companies that realize that the country may be the last source of welleducated , welldisciplined and very inexpensive labor in southeast asia but by and large , american companies are not clamoring for a chance to work in a country that still routinely calls the united states the great satan the result is that conoco finds itself where no business ever wants to be in washington all alone
after months of emotional public debate , political wrangling and court challenges , the giuliani administration yesterday started turning off fire alarm boxes for a 45day trial period in the pilot program , which started in east new york , brooklyn , the fire department will deactivate about 25 percent of the city s 16 , 300 fire alarm boxes and see what effect that has on false alarms and fire response time in those neighborhoods a coalition of politicians and community and religious leaders asked judge walter m schackman of state supreme court in manhattan yesterday to prohibit the program , but the judge said he would not issue a decision until early next week the opponents say that mayor rudolph w giuliani s plan to get rid of all the city s fire alarm boxes violates state environmental laws because he has not adequately assessed the impact the removal of fire alarm boxes will have on public health and safety the mayor has called the boxes dangerous , because they account for an inordinate number of false alarms , as well as obsolete the program to deactivate more than 4 , 000 fire alarm boxes is a scaleddown version of a plan this summer to shut down about 43 percent of them at the beginning of the year , opponents blocked the mayor s original plan , which was to get rid of all of the boxes immediately by taking out hundreds each day city council members balked at the earlier plans , saying there were no assurances that residents' ability to report fires would not be diminished the council narrowly approved the latest plan two weeks ago , and the mayor formally approved the plan on thursday fire officials deactivated about 200 boxes in east new york yesterday and will continue turning off boxes in brooklyn for the next two weeks the department then will head to southern queens , midtown manhattan and the central bronx none of staten island s fireboxes will be included in the pilot program the transmitters on the affected boxes will be removed but will be saved so that they can be reinstalled if necessary all that will remain of the boxes will be the pedestals signs will be posted telling citizens to call 911 in an emergency after the 45day trial period , the city council will have 60 days to decide whether to block the giuliani administration s plans to remove all fireboxes by the year 2000 during his weekly radio show yesterday , the mayor carefully explained his reasons for turning off fire alarm boxes i know this is something that people have a hard time understanding , he said the firebox is sitting there , it seems to be something that is designed for safety , why would you want to take the firebox away \? the mayor explained that new york is one of the last major cities to still use alarm boxes and that 93 percent of the fire alarms called in on the boxes turn out to be false alarms think of the danger that poses for the firefighters , he said think of the danger that poses for our citizens opponents say , however , that neighborhoods like east new york cannot afford to lose the fire alarms many residents do not have phones in their homes , do not speak english and cannot rely on public telephones , which are often in disrepair it s really ironic that they would start in a community in such dire need , said janice robertson , a community leader who lives near east new york in flatlands , which is also part of the pilot area this is not a fairy tale , she said there are people here who do n't have phones , and with the crime situation the way it is , who s going to run out into the streets to look for a telephone that works \? ruth messinger , the manhattan borough president and another vocal opponent , said she believes there has not been enough public education to prepare neighborhoods for the loss of fireboxes the fire department started handing out fliers doortodoor in east new york last week , but ms messinger said that was inadequate these are not trivial issues , she said there are a tremendous number of neighborhoods where removing fireboxes constitutes playing with fire photo leroy little , a fire department communications electrician , deactivated a fire alarm box on the corner of flatlands and fountain avenues in east new york about 4 , 000 boxes are to be shut off \( linda rosier the new york times \)
closely questioning fbi agents about their control over their chief informer , lawyers for sheik omar abdel rahman and 10 other men began presenting their case yesterday , arguing that the defendants had been framed as participants in terror bombing plots they called as their first witnesses federal bureau of investigation agents who had dealt with the informer , emad salem , a former egyptian military officer who had infiltrated mr abdel rahman s circle the defense is seeking to portray mr salem as having been so loosely supervised by the fbi agents who worked with him that he was able to plant or create evidence to incriminate the defendants and destroy or doctor evidence that could exonerate them you became aware that emad salem was taping conversations he was having with individuals the bureau was investigating \? a defense lawyer , anthony ricco , asked an fbi agent , john anticev , during the testimony in federal district court in manhattan that s correct , the agent responded and he was doing that taping wihout your authorization and consent \? mr ricco asked that s also correct , mr anticev said , referring to many recordings that mr salem surreptitiously made in the investigation besides those that mr anticev and other fbi agents had authorized him to make the agent testified that the unauthorized tapings were of conversations not only with the defendants but also with fbi agents themselves , including mr anticev something mr anticev said he learned only after the conclusion of the investigation that led to the trial yesterday s testimony about mr salem s unauthorized activity in the investigation was similar to earlier testimony in the trial from the informer himself and from a police detective who worked with the fbi but in having it repeated as the defense lawyers opened their case , they intended to reinforce one of their major themes that rather than having waged a war of urban terrorism against the united states , mr abdel rahman a militant muslim cleric from egypt and his codefendants had been the target of a questionable sting operation that used an informer who was financially and politically motivated to fabricate and manipulate evidence and mislead and inveigle the defendants thus , anything showing that mr salem had been able to do things in the investigtion without the fbi s knowledge , like recording unauthorized conversations , is being stressed to suggest to the jury that the kind of fbi monitoring that permitted this also made it possible for mr salem to manufacture the case against the defendants in general , as lynne f stewart , mr abdel rahman s lawyer , put it the cleric , the most prominent of the men on trial , and his codefendants are charged with conspiring in 1993 to blow up major new york city buildings and transportation links , including the united nations headquarters , a federal building in manhattan , the lincoln and holland tunnels and the george washington bridge the prosecution said the planned bombings were intended to intimidate the united states government into changing its policies in the middle east , which the defendants are said to have regarded as aiding israel and an egyptian government that mr abdel rahman , who arrived in this country five years ago , has long opposed and sought to overthrow the prosecution said the february 1993 bombing of the world trade center in manhattan , in which six people were killed , was also part of the conspiracy , though none of the 11 defendants are charged with carrying out that attack four other followers of the cleric were convicted in a previous trial of having done that the defense is arguing that the case is trumped up , part of an effort by the united states government to help the egyptian government by imprisoning mr abdel rahman defense lawyers say mr salem was motivated by the prospect of the more than 1 million that the fbi has agreed to pay him for his work on the case before defense lawyers questioned mr anticev and another fbi agent , carson dunbar , about their work with mr salem , a prosecutor , andrew mccarthy , argued to judge michael b mukasey that the transactions between the fbi agents and mr salem do not bear on what the jury is to decide , which is what the intentions of the defendants were his statement , while the jury was not in the courtroom , followed the argument of another defense lawyer , valerie amsterdam , who represents fares khallafalla referring to a secretly made fbi videotape showing some of the defendants in what the prosecution said were bombmaking activities in a queens garage that mr salem had rented , ms amsterdam said of the informer , the jury should know that the agents allowed this man to have components of a bomb , so we can argue to the jury that what they see on the videotape is not the whole story
paterson , nj , feb 25 a short walk from the spot where a young drug suspect was shot by a rookie police officer earlier this week lies a stretch of abandoned textile mills , one after the other , dozens of mottled brick carcasses that once nurtured this city and clothed the nation most everyone here learns in school that paterson was a workhorse of the industrial revolution there were so many thousands of looms earlier in the century that the din of machinery forever clogged the local air it was a sound thwack , thwack , thwack that meant jobs the people in paterson sometimes referred to the mills when they talked about the protests , looting and racial tensions stirred after the white housing police officer , ronald cohen , shot the unarmed black teenager , lawrence meyers , during the drug arrest on tuesday he died on friday night everybody out here is struggling , said raymond brownfield , 22 , an unemployed cook who was among the scores of young black men taunting police officers in riot gear on thursday night it s hard to survive , to make ends meet this used to be a real city of opportunity silk city ! but now there s nothing everything used to be here it s a 'used to be' city that s all with 140 , 891 people , paterson represents a certain kind of urban america too large to readily make the transition to prettified suburbia , too small to demand the money and attention given to neighbors like newark or new york city to overcome poverty , drugs and failing schools though the city has rebounded slightly from the early 1980 s , when it was called one of the poorest in america , the unemployment rate is stuck at 11 percent the rate is 137 percent for black residents , according to the 1990 census , and is certainly much higher for young black men \( national unemployment rates in december were 98 percent for blacks and 346 percent for blacks ages 16 to 19 \) the numbers are troubling to many here , but some local officials say they can also be misleading to councilman thomas c rooney jr , 67 , a former mayor who has lived his whole life in paterson , jobs and history have little to do with what happened this week what we saw in the last few days is a total contempt for law on the part of those who were making this minor riot , he said this has nothing to do with economics it is the absolute breakdown of law , and that is a major , major difference to bolster his argument , mr rooney points to the city s immigrant population , mostly from latin america and the middle east , which has transformed neighborhoods that last thrived in the days when allen ginsberg was a child here he says they are evidence that anyone can make it in paterson many of the black adults who tried to soothe the anger of mr meyers s friends and schoolmates disagree , insisting that it is impossible to separate mr meyers s death and the resulting outcry from what they say are the discrimination and hardships faced by blacks in paterson martin barnes , a former city councilman and mayoral candidate who is black , said the young black residents who demonstrated this week would feel more confident that the judicial system would properly investigate the killing if they knew that more black people were in positions of power he pointed out some statistics although the city is more than 36 percent black , fewer than 20 percent of the police officers are black , and virtually none are supervisors only in the last few years have black and hispanic residents taken control of the city council , which now has four hispanic members , three blacks and two whites the mayor is white and , mr barnes noted , even though blacks have arrived in city hall , the municipal government is so hardpressed that there is little money for socialservice programs property values have declined and taxes have risen in a cycle worsened by abandonment and arson the city s longterm debt has climbed sharply the school system has performed so poorly that the state took it over in 1991 and paterson , unlike the state s other large cities , newark and jersey city , has no big corporations to help out now we 've gotten to the point where we 've gotten some control of the political system , but we are still not doing anything because there is nothing there , mr barnes said they 've already milked it all gone , and that s when it all of a sudden got over to the blacks they gave it to us when there was nothing left to give kim freeman , 35 , a teacher s aide who is also black , said many of the parents and grandparents of the young black residents upset by the shooting of mr meyers first came to paterson from the south after world war ii most people i know , their parents came up here to work in the factories , mr freeman said paterson was a magnet , the first industrialized city in the united states now it s a jobs depression there are no jobs , no education and no housing , and that s a recipe for chaos one reason for the drop in fortunes is the steady decline in manufacturing , which has existed here since paterson was founded by alexander hamilton in the 1790 s hamilton envisioned factories generating power from the great falls , the 77foothigh waterfall on the passaic river , so he set up the society for establishing useful manufactures , hoping to break the country s dependence on english manufacturing
the national league west has a different look this season the upstart colorado rockies have transformed themselves into the class of the division the american league west , however , is projecting a fuzzy picture two teams have celebrated more days with winning records than they did all of last season , but they keep floating perilously close to the losing line and the other two teams have labored with strictly losing records i 'd like to think we will finish over 500 , but that does n't concern me as much as winning the division , woody woodward , the seattle mariners' general manager , said , expressing baseball s theory of relativity none of the al west s four teams finished even at 500 in the strikeshortened 1994 season in fact , texas had the best record and was 10 games under 500 the rangers awoke on only four mornings to find the standings crediting them with a winning record oakland had eight such days and california seven the mariners never had the pleasure but this season the mariners have been above 500 every day , and the angels have hovered there for 10 days the rangers and the athletics have yet to make it interestingly , both western divisions have just concluded a segment of their schedules where , in successive series , each team played every other one in the division based on those series , both divisions figure to provide close , possible fourteam races , if not excessively talented baseball i think all four clubs are strong in certain areas , and they have deficiencies in other areas , woodward said that s going to make it a pretty even battle all year speaking for the nl west , randy smith , the san diego general manager , said it s going be a pretty good race until the end every team has a little bit different personality the rockies have tremendous offense , the giants tremendous defense the dodgers have a potentially pretty good pitching staff plus piazza and karros , so they 're capable of scoring runs i 'd like to think we 're kind of a mixture of all those the rockies emerged from the round robin with the best record , 63 , sweeping threegames series with san diego and san francisco but being swept by los angeles in between the padres lost seven successive games to the rockies and the giants but then won two of three from the dodgers the dodgers lost those two of three after sweeping the rockies the rockies , in turn , beat the giants three times after they lost three to the dodgers and the giants beat the dodgers twice in three games and the padres four times the giants finished the round robin with a 64 record , half a game behind the rockies , but ahead of the dodgers \( 54 \) and the padres \( 28 \) the roundrobin standings in the al west were oakland 64 , california 54 , seattle 45 and texas 46 the division right now is very even , sandy alderson , the athletics' general manager , said that s reflected in the standings there s no one you could really eliminate people thought california would not be a competitor , but with tony phillips and if they could get some pitching out of the bottom half of the rotation and some good bullpen work , they could be right there everybody has their strengths and weaknesses from the mariners' perspective , woodward said he likes the angels' young players and respects the athletics' veterans they 've done it before and that when the rangers are healthy , they 're going to beat up on some people but he added if we can stay healthy , we have a good shot at this division that s kind of the way i felt going in fred claire , the dodgers' general manager , came away from the first 11 days of may convinced that all of the teams in the nl west had improved since last year san diego went through that sevengame losing streak , but they 're definitely a better team , claire said colorado unquestionably is a better team you could make a case with the addition of larry walker and billy swift that they 're the most improved team san francisco had a question about their pitching , but they 've pitched fairly well we 've had a couple of tough injuries , but we 're a better team than last year smith , whose padres have the farthest to travel , given their lastplace finish in 1994 , has been impressed with the rockies' betterthanexpected pitching and the giants' defense the giants have potential gold glove guys all over the place , he said they made some outstanding defensive plays that saved them a lot of runs and enabled them to win a couple games they turned so many double plays they make it look easy just as easy as the rockies make hitting look in their new park it s tough going into coors field , smith said it s tough on pitching staffs they have a tremendous homefield advantage on the road , you can play them straight up defensively at coors , you play on the warning track or you need a rover in the leftfield stands pitchers in peril the grace period for clubs' rosters ends with tomorrow s games before they play tuesday , clubs will have to slice their rosters from 28 players to 25 most of the players who will be released or returned to the minor leagues are expected to be pitchers because they took up most of the additional spots three teams in the national league and two in the american began the season with 14 pitchers only the dodgers and the kansas city royals started with 11 everyone else went with 12 or 13 the extra pitchers were needed because starters , saddled with a shortened spring training , were n't ready to work late into games in fact , entering yesterday s games , kevin jarvis , a cincinnati rookie , had pitched the only complete game in the major leagues sandy alderson of oakland , one of the teams that opted for 14 pitchers , suggested that some teams faced a dilemma in their roster decisions if clubs had been relying on extra pitching , alderson said , and now will be faced with having fewer pitchers and wo n't be able to get more innings out of their starters , that could be a problem we have 14 pitchers and that has n't been too many do we cut down to 13 or 12 \? i ca n't see us going below 12 at this point in many instances , even the bulkier bullpen corps have failed to help as relievers squandered a good five or sixinning effort by the starter randy smith of san diego suggested that relievers were shortchanged in spring training we had to get the starters stretched out , he said the bullpen did n't get enough work another reason for poor relief work most of the additional pitchers did n't belong in the majors in the first place they were there only because their teams needed the extra arms scores not really soaring if teams are creating the impression that they are scoring more runs this season than last , which itself produced a whopping increase in offense , it s only because they are scoring in double figures more frequently entering yesterday s games , the major league average number of runs per game was not significantly different from a year ago , 1060 compared with 1045 but this season s average included 49 times that a team scored 10 or more runs compared with 36 last year the chicago white sox committed 25 errors in their first 10 games \( at least one in each game \) and lost 8 of them last week they suddenly stopped making errors , playing three consecutive games without any they won all three games
surrounded by the murmuring italian waiters , it is easy to get lost in this elegantly spare room with my eyes on the muted yellow walls and my arms cooled by the breeze , i imagine that florence is just outside the long windows then a woman goes to the pay phone near the kitchen and ruins the illusion her voice rises , becoming increasingly strident until the sound of her anger has invaded the serenity of savore and booted me firmly into reality the woman at the next table adjusts the silver bracelets on her wrist , looks at the menu and asks wild boar \? have you ever eaten wild boar \? the architect of this new restaurant in soho has eloquently captured the essence of an italian trattoria and the chef is trying to capture the essence of tuscan renaissance cooking , offering exotic dishes rarely found on new york menus but here s the question is that possible \? the cooking of renaissance florence was unlike anything we now think of as italian food tomatoes were unknown in europe until columbus landed in the new world , and while the florentines immediately took to beans \( another new world import \) , it was more than 200 years before they developed a taste for tomatoes so it is unlikely that pappa al pomodoro , the first dish on savore s menu , had a big following in renaissance tuscany the version here is n't likely to gain much of a following either pappa al pomodoro , a wonderful mush of bread , tomatoes and olive oil , is a great dish when made with firstrate , inseason tomatoes at savore , it is a pleasant but slightly dull dish tuscan cooking is characterized by quality and austerity the cuisine is based upon excellent ingredients simply cooked that is what makes tuscan food so appealing and so hard to duplicate on foreign soil many of the dishes at savore require ingredients that simply cannot be found in new york city consider the many boarbased dishes truly wild boar has a robust , gamy flavor that tends to dominate every dish it is in but the boar that is available in new york is a tame creature with none of those characteristics so cinghiale alla maremmana \( the marshlands of maremma are famous for game animals like wild boar \) is not as exciting as its name , but merely a stew made of olives and what tastes like particularly tough beef budino di granturco in salsa cinghiale , a sort of timbale of polenta topped with boar sauce , turns into a pleasant but delicate little dish and the ragu of wild boar is more notable for the lightness of the wide pappardelle noodles on which it is served than for the flavor of the sauce no matter how they are topped , most of the pasta dishes are excellent and reasonable the most expensive is 1250 , a dish of silky spaghetti with half a small lobster and some simple tomato sauce would people in 15thcentury florence have eaten this \? no , but it is their loss they did eat spaghetti alla chitarra , dense strands of handcut pasta , although probably not tossed with basil and roasted tomatoes but with grated cheese , sugar and cinnamon still , this dish is good enough to make anyone , from any era , happy a couple of the pastas are authentic renaissance recipes one is tagliolini , delicate strands of pasta tossed with lots of butter and lemon , a rich and flavorful dish another is ravioli filled with ricotta , thinly sliced lemons and a bit of sugar and if the tomato sauce atop the raviloi is a modern addition , so be it i like many of the antipasti too rotolo di radicchio , leaves of grilled radicchio rolled around a filling of mozzarella , capers and anchovies , is strong and exciting alternating bitterness and brininess with the smoke from the grill , it is easy to imagine that this is an ancient taste monkfish with artichoke hearts is equally unusual a pale green still life of artichoke hearts mounded with diced squares of fish and topped with olive oil , it is complex and compelling calamari is stuffed with a vegetable mixture , sliced into rounds and served rising from a sea of tomato sauce \( again \) , looking like some great medieval creature but many of the main courses are disappointing pigeon is boned and rolled , mixed with truffles , sliced and served in a wine sauce a renaissance dish in both texture and presentation , it would be great made with tasty pigeons and smoky truffles but since none of the ingredients taste like much , it does n't quite come off boneless pieces of chicken mixed with olives and rosemary also seem authentic , but the forceful flavors leave the poor city chicken in the dust and cacciucco , like most of the fish soups served in new york italian restaurants , is a bowl of red broth filled with mussels , mealy shrimp and bits of overcooked fish and perfumed more with garlic than with seafood pastry came late to florence , but given the tuscan taste for sugar , it was immediately popular the desserts at savore pay homage to the tradition each is a fine sweet my favorites were a fluffy lemon tart and a densely delicious bittersweet chocolate cake when did chocolate arrive in tuscany \? i was wondering about that when the woman at the next table got up and started working the room listening to her loud , local voice , i realized that no matter how authentic the ambiance , it is impossible to bring a real italian trattoria to new york city and even more impossible to import one serving food from the 15th century savore 200 spring street , soho , \( 212 \) 4311212 atmosphere the muted yellow walls of this elegant room with polished wood , biedermeier chairs and windows all around give it the true look of a tuscan restaurant service the waiters are all italian , all charming , all helpful recommended dishes sauteed monkfish with artichoke hearts radicchio rolls with mozzarella , capers and anchovies stuffed calamari tagliolini with lemon sauce spaghetti with lobster sauce spaghetti alla chitarra ravioli lemon tart bittersweet chocolate cake wine list small , choice and very reasonably priced it would be even better if the vintage years were listed hours lunch noon to 3 pm mondays through fridays dinner 5 30 pm to midnight mondays through fridays noon to midnight saturdays and sundays price range appetizers 7 to 12 , entrees 14 to 20 , desserts 5 credit cards all major cards wheelchair accessibility there is one step up into dining room what the stars mean \( none \) poor to satisfactory good very good excellent extraordinary ratings reflect the reviewer s reaction primarily to food , with ambiance and service taken into consideration menu listings and prices are subject to change  past reviews hundreds of times restaurant reviews are available on line from times , an arts and entertainment guide on america online software and information 18005485201

san francisco , jan 6 the chicago bears are a stagecoach the san francisco 49ers are a lear jet there is a generation gap between their offenses , although it is nothing a candlestick park quagmire ca n't equalize the forecast for saturday s playoff game here is mud , wind and a 75 percent chance of a 49ers rout but , as the visiting team enthusiastically points out , there is also the bear factor chicago is a team that gets its school clothes filthy , that draws up plays in the dirt , that arrives in a brokendown bus we kind of kid about the bear factor , chicago s stonefaced coach , dave wannstedt , said we ca n't throw the ball deep , we ca n't do this , ca n't do that everything is about what we ca n't do but if the team with the most dirt on its jerseys wins saturday , then it might just be chicago there was nothing pop warner league about the bears' playoff victory in minnesota last week , and they arrived here today convinced they are undervalued nobody knows about the bears , and that s fine , tight end keith jennings said nobody knew about the cowboys a couple of years ago , and then they whipped everyone the bears are either in denial , know something the oddsmakers do not or have never watched the 133 49ers on film san francisco is such a clear favorite 17 points , to be exact that the introverted 49ers coach , george seifert , tried standup comedy this week for instance , the team s grass practice field was so waterlogged tuesday that seifert could find only a 30yard plot of dry land yep , the 49ers' coach said we had a pretty good spot we found way over there in that far corner , adjacent to that apartment that chicago rented to film our practice and of the humongous point spread , the coach said , some guy having a couple scotch and waters in las vegas figures that out that is either complacency talking , or supreme confidence , or simply the knowledge that cornerback deion sanders is about to field his first kickoffs of the season sanders is the outfielder least interested in the baseball strike , and his daily ritual has been to beg seifert for the football he has tugged on seifert s shirt , whispered in his ear , slipped notes under his office door , and his patience for a championship ring is on empty the season s been long for me , said sanders , who normally lives a dual life of baseball and football this is the longest i 've played in a few years , so that s why i say it s getting pretty old right now i'm ready to cut the baloney and get on to the games i wish i could just show up on fridays and play sunday , to tell you the truth i'm ready to get on with it , man it s like a boxer i'm tired of the pregame hype , and let s just play the game let s get off to the super bowl it is a theme seconded by many 49ers , who know their season will ultimately be judged on whether they are still playing in late january if anything , that is what guards them against a letdown and that is why both sanders and quarterback steve young practiced with chest colds this week put it this way , san francisco linebacker gary plummer said there s a sense that if we do n't go all the way , the season s a failure seifert , as a result , seems to have their undivided attention , and , if not , all he must do is remind them of oct 2 that is the day philadelphia shoved the 49ers around candlestick park , 408 , the day the 49ers gained humility it is their scarlet l for loss and they still wear it on their lapels it is why wide receiver jerry rice said he was uptight this week , why he said he was a grouch it is why defensive end richard dent , a former bear , screamed at the coaches this week for not practicing him more it s nothing personal against chicago , dent said what s personal is winning a championship so , it is in the bears' best interest saturday to bring the 49ers down to their level because chicago could never play at san francisco s level at least not without oxygen masks the bears are plodders they are quarterback steve walsh and his threestep drops , they are running backs lewis tillman and raymont harris up the middle , they are alonzo spellman and chris zorich grunting on defense their players have a better chance of reaching the super bowl than the pro bowl because none are scheduled for honolulu their most popular player in chicago is their kicker , kevin butler , and they usually need to convert one trick play a game to win either that , or they block a kick in some ways , i equate it to a heavyweight fight , the bears' offensive line coach , tony wise , said we 're going to move them to the ropes and body punch time of possession run the ball , stop them from running it and get into the fourth quarter with a chance to block a field goal they seem to be coming here on a free pass , as if the outcome does not matter the bears are here to get their cleats and fingernails grimy , to play a throwback game the bears have nothing to lose , while the 49ers have hotel reservations in miami to lose come on now , said 49ers defensive end dana stubblefield we 're not going to fall on our faces the bears are happy to be here , but , well , we 're happy to be here , too photo the bears' defense is plodding and does n't include any pro bowl players , but it is known as an effective unit \( jonathan daniel allsport \)
a group of 50 fairfield university students and faculty members had good reason to feel discouraged as they huddled together on a remote airstrip in stratford this month on an afternoon that was to have culminated in an unusual business course project , just about everything seemed to have gone wrong the weather was atrocious a cold and steady rain had pelted the group for almost two hours because of the weather , apparently , they had been unable to launch any of the eight piper j3 cub model airplanes that 83 fairfield university students had built then when one of the planes was launched , it rose only about 20 feet before diving and crashing upside down but aided by members of the connecticut model airplane club , who had helped the students throughout the school year , the group remained undaunted and finally , almost two hours after launch time , the same yellow and green plane , undamaged despite its mishap moments earlier , soared skyward only this time it rose about 50 feet , made two loops and came in for a smooth landing as the students and professors cheered it was a poignant moment , said j michael cavanaugh , an assistant professor of management at the university , whose decision it was to use model airplane building as an integral part of a business course for fairfield university sophomores the project certainly would not have been considered a failure if none of the planes got off the ground , but getting one in the air was a significant , symbolic gesture it was also the climax of an innovative business course that had given students a handson learning experience about the business world the airstrip , in a field close by the sikorsky memorial airport , was in a sense an extension of the classroom that for eight months had been a spacious basement in dolan hall , a campus building that had been used for storage purposes in recent years there , the students , divided into eight classes of about 25 students each , had built eight sixfootlong model planes that weigh about 10 pounds and have 10 1 2foot wing spans a drastic departure from conventional business courses , bu 100 is reflective of a reorganization of the university s school of business under the new dean , russell boisjoly , that stresses interdisciplinary courses a gift of 250 , 000 from the general electric company , whose world headquarters are in fairfield , aided in the development of the new curriculum the course , dr cavanaugh said , was an act of desperation when he first offered it in the summer of 1993 at the university of massachusetts , where he has taught summer courses a member of the fairfield university faculty for the last five years , dr cavanaugh contends that no one has been happy with the content and format of traditional business course curriculums there s been a real panic among many business schools because of the dropoff in enrollment , which has been about 15 percent since 1989 , he said we feel there s been a gap between what is being taught and what students really need to know to connect with the business world and we have to make the curriculum more exciting many business school graduates , dr cavanaugh said , have lacked communications skills and an ability to comprehend political situations in the business world we have n't been preparing students adequately for the dynamic environment that exists in a global economy , and we 've had to rethink what we 've been doing , he said you have to take the principles of the course out and actually live them if you do n't do that , they just stay in the notebook and we , as teachers , are accountable and have to back up what we 're teaching in this case , the planes are a means to an end , dr cavanaugh said the objective was to turn the classroom into a laboratory , and to stress the active rather than the passive in effect , the students in bu 100 built their own business organization along the way , they determined how much each plane would cost and established an overall cost schedule then , on their own , they decided how various tasks would be done and who would do them as dr cavanaugh explained it , the project required student involvement in accounting , finance , marketing , business law and operations management it was a daunting project , a real challenge , he said dr cavanaugh concedes it would have been difficult , if not impossible , to have built the piper j3 cub model planes from balsa wood without the help of the connecticut model airplane club , which operates out of a small trailer off lordship boulevard in stratford they were our aeromavens , and they were indispensable , dr cavanaugh said along the way , they kind of adopted us indeed , some of the members went often to the classes on campus to lend their expertise in the building of the planes , which were built to onequarter scale not all of the classes worked at the same pace some paced themselves while some had to cram near the end of the course , dr cavanaugh said but all of the planes were ready by launch time dr cavanaugh conceded that gender issues did arise at times in some of the classes in a couple of instances there were disagreements , but over all everyone worked together pretty well , he said i do n't think either gender had any advantage or disadvantage oscar jensen , one of the professors who taught the course , said he thought that the women among the students stayed at it a bit more while some of the boys stayed away from classes for a while some of the girls became the leaders , he said dr jensen said there had been some resistance to the new concept like grownups , some students do n't like change , he said they wanted to learn about business the old way but dr cavanaugh and dr jensen said they thought that most of the students were receptive to the new approach laurent painchaud of southport , a coordinator for the team whose plane was successfully launched , said he felt that the model airplane project helped bring the students closer together working with your peers helped a lot , said mr painchaud , adding that he believed that the course already had benefited him in his outside job as the sales manager at a westport store that sells sailboats and sailing accessories the course taught you how to work as a team and the importance of planning and meeting deadlines , he said mr painchaud said he was looking forward to seeing his team s plane on display at the barone campus center , where it is scheduled to be hung for all to see photos laurent painchaud and kevin catalano are among fairfielduniversity students in a business course that uses model airplane building to stress the active rather than the passive \( janet durrans for the new york times \)
this christmas is going to be a major disappointment for me it has n't been commercialized enough i was hoping to achieve a piercing cynicism by this time about the mailorder catalogues that burden my life each holiday season , and it just has n't happened as one of the 98 million americans who collectively spent 58 billion on mailorder purchases last year , i anticipated the glossy arrival of l l bean , victoria s secret , smith hawken , williamssonoma , harry and david , damark , lillian vernon and all the others with bitter glee when the first seasonal catalogue appeared , i set out a huge cardboard box in anticipation of the coming onslaught now that box is full yesterday i weighed it on the bathroom scale the 228 catalogues came to 54 pounds i was hoping for more l l bean sent out 140 millionodd catalogues this year , and i only received two disney only sent three gardener s eden sent four , harry and david sent six j peterman sent seven damark sent 10 the woman downstairs got six victoria s secret catalogues , and my wife and i got none the contents of the catalogues have disappointed me , too i used to be able to whip up a very pleasant disgust at the load of junk that we americans sell ourselves each christmas but there s no need to get incensed about an electronic golfswing analyzer \( 8099 \) a batterypowered toenail filer \( 4995 \) a batterypowered tiedispenser \( 3495 \) a watch that tells you the average seasonal temperature in 23 cities \( 65 \) a flame thrower to blast away stubborn weeds \( 3995 \) a telescoping bug vacuum \( 4995 \) a telescoping golf club \( 6299 \) a telescoping bird feeder \( 7995 \) a telescoping hand truck \( 4495 \) an emergencyescape personal smoke hood with a multistage chemical catalytic converter \( 5995 \) a disposable toothbrush with the toothpaste inside the handle \( box of 50 , 1995 \) a device that measures wind speed up to 200 mph \( 595 \) an uncut sheet of 32 1 bills \( not 32 but 90 \) a monogrammed rock \( 3995 \) a figurine made of molded manure \( 1395 for dung bunny or toad stool \) , or a teddy bear \( 4995 \) that you warm up in a microwave oven the catalogue business is booming it is estimated at 626 billion in sales this year no doubt , this bonanza can be credited to the convenience of telephone ordering thus , it s the work of a moment to purchase a suit of armor \( 3 , 450 \) a sixandahalffoot bronze bengal tiger \( 3 , 500 \) a near life size statue of augustus caesar in outdoor resin \( 2 , 245 \) a set of geppetto and pinocchio dolls with a certificate of authenticity \( 2 , 350 \) , and a sevenfoot lawn alligator \( 1 , 365 \) i have faith that marketing specialists will continue to prove capitalism s uncanny ability to make us want things we really do n't need and will never , ever use but they could do better a genuinely cuttingedge catalogue would offer these products deion sanders s used pizza hut box \( 7995 , unsigned , but with certificate of authenticity \) a home tattooing kit \( 299 \) a jacket sewn from the patchwork sails of haitian boat people \( 399 \) an electronic budgetrhetoric decoder , with republican , democrat and concerned bipartisan versions \( 899 \) a dented blue united nations helmet \( 9995 \) a customized pink slip embedded in a lucite paperweight \( 2395 , ibm , at t and boeing stationery available \) the battered door of a lapd police car \( 5 , 995 , framed \) , and , to update an old christmas theme , an authentic 1907 coalburning furnace \( 50 \) removed this winter from a new york city public school such a catalogue would confirm that the untrammeled free market had brought us to a directmail milestone on the way to millennial capitalism but no such sign has appeared quite a disappointment i have tried to be cynical this year about christmas , and i have failed

the jewish high holy days , which begin on sunday night with rosh hashanah , demand both introspection and a searching look ahead , an emotional and intellectual challenge perhaps best experienced in spiritually familiar surroundings so what could be more startling than leaving one s synagogue at this very time \? yet that is exactly what abraham h foxman has done publicly , too mr foxman , the national director of the antidefamation league of b'nai b'rith , wrote in a local jewish newspaper recently that he would no longer worship at congregation b'nai yeshurun in teaneck , nj , an orthodox synagogue of which he has been a member for more than 20 years , because its rabbi spews hate and vitriol toward the elected leaders of israel mr foxman s decision has thrown a personal light onto a broad , if lopsided , debate among american jews over the israeli government s peace negotiations with its arab neighbors , especially the palestine liberation organization of late , the debate that has become more public through a number of opposing newspaper advertisements polls show that a large majority of american jews still favor the peace negotiations begun by prime minister yitzhak rabin but they also show that support has slipped somewhat since 1993 , and that a majority of orthodox jews are opposed that slippage has followed several terrorist attacks in israel , which killed two american jews this year joan davenny , a teacher from woodbridge , conn , and alisa m flatow , a college student from west orange , nj mr foxman said he did not leave the synagogue over rabbi steven pruzansky s politics , but over how he expressed them the tone of the discussion is not really one of tolerance , mr foxman said he s entitled to his opinions , he s entitled to express them it s the tone in announcing his decision in the jewish standard , a teaneck newspaper , mr foxman said rabbi pruzansky had glibly invoked holocaust terminology in two opinion columns opposing the peace effort , as well as in a letter the rabbi sent to a man who criticized one of those columns rabbi pruzansky , writing in the standard about antiisraeli terrorism , has said , once again , jews are sacrifices but this time it is to a 'process' in the letter , rabbi pruzansky also urged american jews not to listen to the blatherings of the rabin judenrat a judenrat was a jewish council set up by the nazis to preside over jewish ghettos early in world war ii the rabbi has distributed hundreds of copies of a prayer for use in private recitations during services that calls on god to thwart the conspiracy of those destroyers and demolishers who desire to tear apart the land of our heritage asked about the prayer , rabbi pruzansky said it was meant broadly , to invoke god s aid against anyone who would conspire against israel s security could the prayer apply to jews with an opposing political view , like mr rabin or mr foxman \? let s put it this way , he said , anyone who would deprive jews of the land of israel or the right to residence in israel i say it three times a day , he added rabbi pruzansky , who came to b'nai yeshurun from a synagogue in kew gardens hills , queens , last year , declined to talk about mr foxman s departure , other than to say he had seen little of mr foxman at the synagogue this year where one jew chooses to pray is really not very important , he said the priority has to be the security of jews in israel deciding to leave the synagogue did not come easily for mr foxman , who said he spent months wrestling with it it was a wrenching decision , he said this was a synagogue where my son was bar mitzvahed this was a synagogue where every happy event and every sad event i celebrated you do n't have your own seat , but you sit in the same place this was my religious home for his part , rabbi pruzansky has remained adamant the israeli government , he said , was leading israel down a suicidal path in its negotiations with the plo , and was giving away a gift of god , the land on which jews were to build a holy nation the rabbi acknowledged that he had compared mr rabin s government to a judenrat , but not publicly that was in a private letter , he said , saying that it became public when mr foxman referred to it in a column in the standard he also said it was intended to illustrate where he believed the peace negotiations could lead destruction of israel not to describe the government s motivations i'm sure he means well , he said of mr rabin a lot of people have meant well last week , the american jewish committee released a national survey of 1 , 000 jews , showing that 68 percent favored the way in which the israeli government was handling the negotiations with its arab neighbors the figure represents a gradual decline in support since negotiations with the plo began in september 1993 , a period in which progress in the talks has been marred by acts of terrorism by the militant group hamas in 1993 , the committee s poll found that 84 percent of american jews supported the negotiations in recent days , supporters and opponents of the negotiations have aired their feelings in a round of newspaper ads last sunday , for example , the american zionist movement declared in an ad in the new york times that while pursuing peace was risky , not to do so was unthinkable it was signed by the leaders of 28 major jewish organizations , mr foxman among them a quite different ad also appeared this month in new york jewish week , soliciting donations for a fund that aids jewish settlers in the west bank the ad was placed by a group whose chairman is a member of congregation b'nai yeshurun the american jewish committee poll found division over the peace effort along denominational lines about 75 percent of reform and conservative jews said they supported the negotiations , while only 31 percent of orthodox jews did so , the poll said rabbi steven dworken , executive vice president of the rabbinical council of america , which represents the nation s orthodox rabbis , said that many orthodox jews felt personal ties to the west bank settlers , among them americans who had emigrated to israel you 're talking about our brothers , our sisters , our next door neighbors , our colleagues who have gone , rabbi dworken said many orthodox groups have adopted settlements rabbi pruzansky estimated that no more than 20 percent of congregation b'nai yeshurun s 500 families supported the negotiations except for mr foxman s family , none have left the synagogue , he said as word of mr foxman s departure has spread , rabbi pruzansky said he has received calls of support from elsewhere in new jersey , from israel and even from a largely christian interfaith organization in kansas he also heard from one man who was so incensed by mr foxman s column that he said he intended to join the synagogue we 've picked up a member , rabbi pruzansky said so it s a wash , in those terms next january , the synagogue s men s club will visit israel several days will be spent at west bank settlements mr foxman too has received supportive calls , telling him , he said , thanks for having the courage to challenge intolerance i fight intolerance all day long , and it s mostly against jews , he said he has also found another synagogue in teaneck thank god , there are several around , mr foxman said i have bought tickets for the high holy days in a synagogue that is orthodox photos top , rabbi steven pruzansky in his synagogue , congregation b'nai yeshurun in teaneck , nj , from which abraham h foxman , above , resigned , because , he said , the rabbi spews hate and vitriol toward the elected leaders of israel \( ruby washington the new york times william e sauro the new york times \)
the new york philharmonic concert on thursday evening at avery fisher hall ended precisely where it had begun on the indefinable threshold between silence and the quietest sound if the effect seemed slightly less stunning on the last notes of tchaikovsky s pathetique symphony , it was only because valery gergiyev had by then made such wonders seem routine in the first work , anatoly liadov s tone picture the enchanted lake , the beginning was truly remarkable to a listener unable to see either the conductor s hands or the back stands of the cellos at some point , a presence half sound , half atmosphere arose from a suspenseful silence focused , intense and genuinely quiet pianissimos can never be taken for granted with the philharmonic , even as well as it usually plays nowadays but here and elsewhere in the program , which included liadov s from the apocalypse and three orchestral excerpts from berlioz s damnation of faust , mr gergiyev drew the finest , loveliest threads of sound from this orchestra in recent memory even at moderate levels , the string sound remained unusually soft and velvety none of which is to say that mr gergiyev skimped on volume where it was needed indeed , the impassioned first movement of the pathetique almost flew out of control , but did n't the sheer quality of the performances and persuasiveness of the interpretations made sense of an oddly conceived program , which will be repeated this evening and on tuesday

the dictator , gen sani abacha , who rules by decree , has dissolved labor unions and jailed their leaders , dismissed dozens of army officers , repeatedly shuffled his government , shut down newspapers and even reached deep into the bureaucracy to fire anonymous civil servants rarely appearing in public and trusting of few , general abacha has a penchant for security that sometimes passes for paranoia , probably arising from his experience at the center of several past coup plots if little is known of his motives or political thinking , most nigerian analysts and foreign diplomats agree that general abacha , the sixth military ruler since independence in 1960 , is the purest expression yet of the army leadership s obsession with absolute power and the wealth it brings when he took power in november 1993 by deposing ernest shonekan , a civilian who had been named president after the cancellation five months earlier of the first democratic elections in a decade , general abacha declared that his aim was to prevent the breakup of the country and to restore democracy but rarely has nigeria been so divided or the path to civilian rule been so uncertain in the latest wave of repression , earlier this month , general abacha s aides declared they had uncovered a coup plot involving prominent politicians and midlevel army officers diplomats say as many as 400 officers have been detained , many at secret locations where they are thought to be subject to torture facing complaints in the nigerian press and from foreign diplomats of a witch hunt and an absence of due process , the information minister denied in an interview with the bbc that there were any political detainees , saying , everyone who has been arrested knows why he is in jail but few nigerians seem to believe the story of a coup plot almost none of the names allegedly connected to the coup are officers commanding troops , said abayomi ferreira , a retired colonel who has called for restoration of democracy though nigerians have become accustomed to military purges , many say the inclusion of two former leaders in the latest sweep seems to have backfired , causing consternation among general abacha s own constituents and bringing calls from abroad for the isolation of nigeria the detention of one officer , gen olusegun obasanjo , the former military head of state , brought an unusual warning to general abacha from the united states against taking any summary measures against those arrested that could be construed as outside the bounds of international norms traditionally britain , nigeria s former colonial ruler and one of its leading trading partners , has been much quieter about military abuses than washington has but general obasanjo s arrest brought public criticism from london as well during a visit here last week , the former president jimmy carter met with general abacha to seek general obasanjo s release but instead of letting him go , the government put the former leader under house arrest at his farm near lagos a much more likely reason for his arrest than any participation in a coup plot was general obasanjo s quiet efforts in recent months to heal a long and bitter rift between his southwestern yoruba group and the igbo of the southeast for most of the period of independence , the military has been able to hold on to power because of lingering animosities between the yoruba and igbo , the two largest ethnic groups in the predominantly christian south the army is dominated by northern muslims like general abacha the moment the northern military elite senses a rapprochement in the south , it feels compelled to act , and to act brutally if necessary , said one former senior official in a recent military government there were likely other reasons that we may never know , but it seems that obasanjo crossed this line the other prominent figure arrested was a retired northern general , shehu musa yaradua , who was general obasanjo s vice president mr yaradua , reputedly one of nigeria s richest men , had angered general abacha by urging members of a government constitutional conference to stick to their choice of jan 1 , 1996 , for a return to civilian rule diplomats say general abacha has been frantically maneuvering with threats and bribes to persuade delegates to the conference to leave the transition date open the coup talk gave abacha the opportunity to remove his no 1 critic , said one western diplomat yaradua was the one remaining person with the guts and the money to match abacha dollar for dollar , if necessary close associates of general abacha say publicly that he will not be rushed out of office because he needs to stabilize the nation before handing over power to civilians we want to be the last , the last military regime , a senior officer said recently in a newspaper interview in lagos but many of the general s critics say the junta s real goal may be to become the richest team ever to govern the country and that ambition , they say , may explain the constant shuffle of ministerial posts as in many oilexporting nations , the awarding of supply contracts in nigeria is deeply marked by corruption , with government ministers and their allies given what amount to allotments of oil to sell to foreign middlemen at great personal profit to show their gratitude , those who get contracts typically pay large sums to the head of state and his inner circle each time a new government is named , the new actors scramble , along with their foreign partners , to offer new gifts and secure themselves a piece of the action , one senior nigerian oilindustry official said a western diplomat concurred what we are seeing under abacha is a worrying acceleration of the cycle of corruption that has been eating at this country for so long ministers see that their stays in office may be brief , so they steal as fast as they can map shows the location of lagos , nigeria
despite the distinct possibility that baseball will open the season with replacement players , wwortv channel 9 s tim mccarver is enthusiastic that his new twoyear contract guarantees his presence when the mets' season begins baseball s my passion , said mccarver , who reenlisted last week after months of talks , mostly with fred wilpon , the mets' coowner on monday , i'm going to puerto rico for the caribbean world series for the first time mccarver s contract took longer than expected to wrap up largely because of the uncertainty of the mets' revenues from its revenuesharing deal with wwor the mets and wwor lost advertising revenues when the season was cut short by the players' strike and will lose more the longer the replacements play any time you get locked up in negotiations , it s never certain you 'll succeed until you sign on , said mccarver , a mets announcer since 1983 with the situation in baseball you have to be more understanding mccarver s new salary was not disclosed , but he said i would not have signed if i were not happy he is ambivalent about the prospect of calling fraudulent baseball but like many others hired to call games , he will call them , regardless of the quality replacement baseball , he said , is reprehensible , but if the team to whom i'm signed asks me , i call them i'm an employee he added you 're not going to fool the public by hyping the players you have to express what their limitations are anyone used to bringing major league baseball into viewers' homes will be disappointed when and if replacement baseball happens it has n't happened yet but the chances get stronger now that we 're just a month away from spring training when he returns from a twoweek jaunt through kenya and tanzania in early march , mccarver will head to spring training , where he will probably know none of the players at the mets' facility in port st lucie , fla it s going to be a lot more work for me , he said i ca n't rely on past notes mccarver

sportschannel s 12 to 14 fee in favor of a 124 monthly fee for adding sportschannel and the scifi channel it s to meet demand , said robert jacobs , general counsel of the time warner new york city cable group , which has one million subscribers for a significant number of fans , 12 to 14 has been more than they could afford rainbow programming , an affiliate of cablevision , which splits ownership of sportschannel with nbc , had pressed time warner to make the sportschannel shift we 're happy that the number of people who see sportschannel will go from just 100 , 000 to 1 million , said josh sapan , rainbow s president cablevision , the city s other major cable system and the dominant one on long island , is not expected to make the change right now , said sapan , 40 percent of cablevision subscribers get sportschannel , so there is no urgency to make the change unless it wanted to shrink its customers' bills what time warner did is in keeping with how they want to sell channels , said cablevision s norm fein we are continuing to evaluate the situation one casualty of time warner s decision is newsport , the allsports channel that is a venture of rainbow , nbc and liberty media , which is available in seven million homes the scifi channel will take newsport s spot sapan said some newsport programs , like chet coppock s talk show , will find their way to

recently , walking into the main entrance of the new york public library for a ceremonial occasion before its centennial celebration this weekend , i was directed up the stairway to the left i found myself , however , walking past the stairs , to a corridor behind them set into the corridor s marble wall was a double door of dark wood , tall and forbidding , no lettering on it to identify it , and i stood in front of it , remembering when i had a key to that door and when that key was one of my most precious possessions for some years , in fact , that key a key to the library s frederick lewis allen memorial room , a marble and woodpaneled space containing 11 cubicles for writers was almost a talisman to me , a charm i clung to during those years to try to make myself believe that the biography of robert moses on which i was working might actually become a book before i was admitted to the allen room in late 1971 , it had become harder and harder for me to believe that i had been working on the moses biography for about five years i had begun it because i felt that an examination of moses' life would throw new light on the true nature of urban political power and on the history of a great city as year followed year , and i learned more and more about moses' life , i became more and more convinced that the book could indeed do that but , as year followed year , the project had , in my mind , taken on an air of unreality in part , this was due to the lack of any relationship between writing the book and the inescapable realities of the rest of life , such as earning a living while i had , in 1966 , been given a book contract , the advance i had received was 2 , 500 , and it had so long since been spent that it seemed to have no connection with the years that had passed since i received the check i had been a reporter on newsday , and as ina , my wife , and i watched our savings run out , and we sold our house to keep going , and the money from the sale ran out and my editor assured me that while my early chapters appeared to have literary merit , there would be so little audience for a book on moses that the printing would be modest indeed the book sometimes seemed more and more like a rather unreal interlude in my life i had always believed i was a writer , but to me being a real writer meant writing more than one book , and i could see absolutely no way of getting to write another one i was determined to finish this one , no matter what but the only future i could see after that was to try to persuade newsday to rehire me and it was becoming harder and harder to cling to my image of myself as a writer my editor , the only editor i knew , seemed to be taking longer and longer to answer my telephone calls my connection with my publisher seemed extremely tenuous these factors were changing , however i had acquired an agent and was switching publishers and after an interlude with another , only slightly more generous publisher , i was being brought together with a very different type of editor , robert gottlieb of knopf , who was trying to find some kind of mechanism that would allow me to stop worrying constantly about money \( and who even liked the title , the power broker \) but these changes had not yet sunk in , and while some things were getting better , what had not got better at all was what i have since realized was the most fundamental reason for the feeling of unreality that i had , for five years , been living in a world utterly unpopulated by anyone else who was doing what i was doing as a reporter , my days had been filled not only with bylines , a weekly paycheck and other trappings that made the journalistic world real , but also with interaction with my editors , with other reporters , with the subjects of my articles when i had a problem connected with my work , there were many people with whom to discuss it when i left newsday , i entered a world that was very different , and not just because , instead of seeing my writing in print every day , there had been , in 1971 , no writing of mine in print for five years following the sale of our house on long island , ina , our son , chase , and i moved to an apartment in riverdale , in the bronx there were certainly other writers in riverdale , but we did n't meet any of them i do n't think that during the first five years i was working on the power broker i had any contact with a single other writer of serious books there was no writer with whom i could discuss a writing problem by the time i was admitted to the allen room , moreover , my feelings about my book involved not only unreality , but doubt as well for one thing , it seemed far too long to be a book more and more frequently , as the piles of manuscript on my desk grew , i would calculate the words i had written \( the final draft of the power broker not a rough draft , the polished final draft would be 1 , 050 , 000 words , cut to 700 , 000 words for publication \) and i had to wonder if what i was doing would ever be published i was bothered , too , by the length not only of the manuscript , but also of the time i had been working on it
trapped for its fur and losing its habitat to farmland , the beaver declined in connecticut throughout the 19th century until there were none left attempts to reintroduce beavers in 1914 , 1926 and 1934 met with only limited success , and wildlife managers abandoned the efforts then , in the 1940 s , the animals started to cross into connecticut from new york and massachusetts by 1961 there were 121 colonies , and as the end of the century draws near , the beaver population has swelled to an estimated 3 , 500 to 4 , 000 statewide to some , it s a nuisance it s actually a problem here , said keith r cudworth , superintendent of the 4 , 000acre white memorial foundation nature preserve in litchfield and morris we have to go out three or four days a week from march to the end of november , breaking up the beaver dams , or the water will back up over our roads and trails howard eaird , who works on a road crew in sharon , called beavers a pain in the neck as he explained it , during the summer we 're out every friday opening up the beaver dams we 've got about five places we have to open regularly a variety of animals thought to have been gone forever have made a remarkable comeback in connecticut in recent years , said paul w rego , a wildlife biologist with the state department of environmental protection there are black bear , moose , cougar and a large weasel lookalike called a fisher other populations , ones that seemed to be on a decline , have suddenly become healthier weasels , muskrat , river otter and bobcat , for instance and at least one animal that never had been known to prowl connecticut , the coyote , has adapted happily to life in the suburbs although animal sightings might cause momentary alarm , there does not seem to be any public panic about large mammals returning to the state william f smith , the town manager in granby , said that over the last five years there had been several sightings of bear there and a coyote was killed on jan 12 on route 20 i do n't think there s been any particular alarm about it , mr smith said i think people see it as interesting , but not especially frightening of more concern , he said , is the rabies pandemic that has infected so many raccoons with a 700acre game reserve in the southern part of town and a large state forest to the north , mr smith said , people expect to see a lot of animals why are the populations rebounding \? the phenomenon among birds appears relatively simple to explain improvements in environmental quality played a major role in the comeback of eagles and osprey along the connecticut shore , mr rego said , and the elimination of many pesticides helped reduce the incidence of genetic mutations and improve survival of the young but for furbearing animals the connection between environmental conditions and their population levels is n't usually so obvious , mr rego said exceptions are river otter and mink , which require clean water we 're not sure if the river otter was every completely gone , mr rego said we do know at one point their numbers were very , very low , and now they 're pretty common mr rego said other animals have done well because they are opportunistic and adapted to a niche vacated by another animal coyotes , for example , originally confined to west of the mississippi river , have been expanding their range eastward throughout this century and reached connecticut less than 40 years ago , mr rego said today there are as many as 3 , 000 statewide one plausible theory is that with the lack of wolves and mountain lions , there s a role for a large predator to play , which coyotes filled , mr rego said it s not unusual for us to get a call or two a week from people who have heard or seen coyotes and want to know what the dangers might be a new niche may be opening in the connecticut ecology as rabies decimates the raccoon population opossums and skunks , which are not as susceptible to the disease , might benefit some animals have returned in part because of the department of environmental protection s helping hand turkeys , for example , were gone by the early 19th century in connecticut , but 22 of the deepforest birds were reintroduced in 1975 over the next few years there were 13 more releases of similar size today the population is estimated at more than 7 , 500 similarly , fisher were reintroduced in the northwest of the state in 1985 , about the time they started to move into northeastern connecticut from massachusetts the animals that were released were tracked with radio collars , and biologists learned they generally roamed no more than 15 miles and had a high survival rate today there are 60 to 90 of the dark brown , yardlong animals roaming the woods of northern connecticut but perhaps the major reason for the increase in many wildlife populations has been a change in land use , mr rego said a century ago , with the emphasis on farming , just 20 to 30 percent of the state was in forest , providing shelter for many animals but with farming dwindling in the state , as much as 70 percent of land is back in forest today the black bear , for instance , needs heavily wooded areas because it relies on nuts , like acorns and hickory , for a large part of its diet , mr rego said
to the editor ira berkow s hilarious rental car recital \( the renter s tale , feb 5 \) reminded me of a similar experience my wife and i had with a ford crown victoria rented at the west palm beach airport a year ago as we drove out , i found that the front seat must have been previously occupied by an nba center , it was so far back from the steering wheel but i , too , wanted to hit the road there was no bar under the front of the seat for adjustment , and hastily pushing an array of five buttons on the side got me nowhere so , leaning all the way forward and driving carefully , i got us to boynton beach the four of us then began poking away at the buttons a rectangular one was flanked on each end by two round ones we pushed all of them forward , back , to either side , and down we called a ford dealer nobody there could help us so we drove back to the airport and showed the hertz dispatcher how all our pushing had got us nowhere he solved the problem in a tenth of a second he pulled the rectangular button up none of us had thought of pulling dan wallack new york , ny
the yankees knew they were zealously pursuing their first postseason berth in 14 years , they knew how joyous it would feel if they finally secured it and they were relieved when they experienced those strong emotions on sunday but what the yankees did not know is how often the red carpet would be extended to them it keeps rolling open more and more the yankees won the wild card as the fourthbest team in the american league and , because of the quirks in the new playoff format , they suddenly look like a formidable team even more formidable than the team that had the best september of any yankee club in 15 years since seattle was forced to use randy johnson to defeat california , 91 , in the onegame playoff for the american league west title yesterday , the yankees will not have to oppose the best pitcher in the league until game 3 that is a significant edge in a fivegame series because johnson will probably only start once there is more even though the mariners supposedly have the homefield advantage with games 3 , 4 and 5 , they had to travel crosscountry from seattle last night , did not arrive in new york until after midnight and must play the first two games at yankee stadium they must also face david cone and andy pettitte , who have a combined record of 152 in the bronx that means the yankees could journey to the kingdome for game 3 friday with a twogamestonone lead that s what we have to do , said cone , who starts game 1 tonight against chris bosio we have to take advantage of this those two games at yankee stadium are huge only manager buck showalter , the batting coach rick down , cone and tony fernandez had not scattered from yankee stadium by the time seattle qualified as new york s opponent before their 90minute workout , the yankees explained that their celebration in toronto sunday was subdued because they have more to accomplish and want to save the champagne sipping for the world series so they stored the wild card caps in their lockers and focused on the first two games that are expected to attract sellouts of 57 , 545 because they realize how critical the early victories will be to advancing into the league championship series against boston or cleveland the first two games here are vitally important , randy velarde said if we win those two , we know we can win one of three anywhere even though showalter said the subject of not having to face johnson in the opener was overrated , because statistics are meaningless in the postseason , the mariners won 27 of the 30 games the lefthander started this season and those statistics are impossible to overlook at any juncture of any season no matter how valiantly showalter tried to play down the advantage , the yankees only had to catch a glimpse of johnson s fastballs against california to realize that their tuesday night would be more pleasant with bosio \( 108 , 492 earned run average \) as the opposing pitcher besides , the mariners were in the air last night while cone \( 188 , 357 era \) and the yankees were home relaxing every club does that all year , showalter said nobody feels taxed out by travel situations they 're going to be ready to play , said don mattingly , also trying to minimize the obvious advantage we would be if it was us the mariners beat the yankees 9 times in 13 games , taking 3 of 4 games on the yankees' 310 road trip in august that almost buried new york but the yankees said the mariners should not be surprised if they see an improved team tonight , a team that won 11 of its last 12 games and 26 of 33 to vault into the postseason i got to believe we 're a different team now , velarde said we got to feel that way showalter agreed physically , we are , showalter said mentally and emotionally , i think we are the guys are playing with a lot of confidence this club is reminding me of where we were last year before the strike i thought seattle would win , especially with randy johnson on the mound , showalter said it s never pleasant to be playing someone as good as seattle but it beats the alternative of not playing them at all they 're a multifaceted team that can hit the ball out of the ballpark to negate seattle s offense , cone needs to provide the kind of seven or eightinning stellar effort that highlighted the yankees' resurgence during the last five weeks the three starters cone , pettitte and jack mcdowell who were 132 in september must be influential for the yankees because the middle relievers have been erratic and showalter could be reluctant to phone the bullpen for anyone except john wetteland the euphoria of simply reaching the postseason for the yankees will be history when bob sheppard announces the starting lineups tonight it will be replaced by the reality of trying to keep the season alive and stretching the season and the red carpet until the end of october what happened with us is when we left spring training , it was n't to get to the playoffs , mattingly said it was to win the whole thing inside pitch after three days of inactivity , wade boggs \( strained left hamstring \) worked out yesterday and said he expects to play tonight melido perez , who has pitched once since june 30 because of rightshoulder inflammation , is not on the postseason roster perez \( 55 , 558 earned run average \) returned home to the dominican republic to prepare for winter ball joe dimaggio will throw out the first ball tonight photo yankees getting in a bit of stretching before their workoutyesterday at yankee stadium in preparation for tonight s playoff opener manager buck showalter looked on \( alan zale for the new york times \)

north bergen , nj , march 20 the nets have made a mosaic of their center position , cutting and pasting to fill the void left by the absence of benoit benjamin for the last six games , dwayne schintzius started , either jayson williams or armon gilliam relieved , and away they went , improvising their way to the eighth and final playoff slot in the eastern conference but after practice today , the situation at least for the next two games grew more desperate the 7foot2inch schintzius was hooked up to an electronic stimulation machine to relieve the pain in his lower back during practice benjamin received treatment earlier in the day for the back spasms that have kept him out for two weeks he is not expected to play until the weekend moreover , only eight nets practiced today , and none of them were kenny anderson or derrick coleman anderson is nursing a sprained right ankle and coleman left after showing up with flu symptoms both players are probable for tuesday night s game against the pistons at the palace in auburn hills the nets are host to david robinson and the san antonio spurs on wednesday before traveling to miami for a saturday evening game against the heat we 'll have to do what we can with what we have , said butch beard , who would not name a starting center for detroit the nets \( 2639 \) lead the celtics in the race for the last playoff spot by one game with 17 remaining they come off an eventful week , knocking off orlando at home before losing to utah , 10398 , on friday at the meadowlands and taking the knicks into overtime before falling at madison square garden but now new tasks present them with an interesting challenge just how do they secure a playoff spot without a legitimate starting center \? williams is averaging 13 minutes and 48 points per game a total of 178 if that figure reaches 20 , the 76ers will receive the nets' firstround draft pick , based on the provisions of the trade that brought williams from philadelphia in 1991 asked if that could present problems this week , given benjamin s unlikely return before the weekend and schintzius s back problems , beard allowed that it might gilliam , who has played center as well as possible for a 6foot9inch forward , said today he would not mind stepping into the starting role coleman has also doubled at the center position in certain defensive alignments i played shaq , i 've played against patrick ewing , so it s something i definitely feel comfortable with , gilliam said if we 're playing against a good center , i have problems matching up but we 're going to double down anyhow with those guys beard is hoping the nets will have benjamin by the time the team travels to indiana on march 27 to face the pacers and their center , rik smits for at least two and perhaps three more games , however , the cutandpaste method continues we 've done it before , so i ca n't be that worried , beard said i think they know the importance of these games if not , they 'll get the message rebounds with an assist to chris childs for a 3pointer on saturday night , kenny anderson became the nets' career assist leader anderson has 1 , 974 , surpassing the total of darwin cook \( 1 , 970 \) derrick coleman created a fuss the last time he was in his hometown of detroit by missing the team s shootaround because of alleged car trouble , which coleman now denies happened coleman , who believes it is all right to skip the shortened practices when he is home , was asked by a reporter two weeks ago if he would attend tuesday s shootaround no , he said butch beard , however , remained hopeful i assume that i will see d c at shootaround , he said he has n't told me anything about taking it off yet two nets players said monday that they were volunteering to pitch in for a limousine should coleman be confronted with supposed car trouble again

aventura , fla , nov 30 the owners' new payrolltax proposal appears to be aimed at ultimately reducing player payrolls to no more than 50 percent of club revenues , the precise point where the owners began the lengthy and contentious dispute with the players a year and a half ago negotiators for both sides have declined to disclose or discuss the proposal since the owners presented it to the players nov 15 donald fehr , the players' labor leader , and randy levine , the clubs' new chief labor executive , refused again today to talk about it on the last day of the union s executive board meeting here , none of the other union officials or player representatives would talk about the proposal either but the proposal , a copy of which was obtained by the new york times , calls for a 25 percent tax on portions of payrolls over 44 million in the first year of a sevenyear adjusting tax system in the next six years , the taxtriggering thresholds would be linked to the previous year s industry revenue , and the tax rates would be based on the percentage of the previous year s revenue that was spent on player payrolls for years two through six , the tax rate would be anywhere from 25 percent to 50 percent , graduating in 5 percent increments but in the seventh year , the tax would disappear if the clubs in the sixth year 2001 , if the system were to take effect next year spent 50 percent or less of the total revenue on player compensation the inducement , then , would be built into the system for clubs to reduce their payrolls to at least the 50 percent level so that they could avoid paying taxes in their last proposal , in march 1994 , the owners wanted a straight 50 percent tax with a 44 million threshold the players countered with a 25 percent tax and a 50 million threshold although the players , by their proposal , were agreeing to a tax system , a suspicion in some baseball circles now is that the union will reject the idea of a payroll tax asked about that view , fehr said it s premature , but all options are open the question always becomes , if you 're getting into a tax , why are you doing it , what is the anticipated effect \? what do you do with the money \? is it used to invest in the game s future or just to subsidize people \? does it have the effect of effectively inhibiting a free market or is it a tax that has a cost attached to it but preserves the essence of a free market \? if the union continues to accept a tax concept , the proposal could include enough variations for the two sides to negotiate an agreement the owners clearly have indicated the proposal is negotiable until it grudgingly got into the taxproposal business to try to generate an agreement early this year , the union rejected a socalled luxury tax , contending it would have the same effect as a payroll cap clubs , the union argued , would reduce their payrolls to avoid taxes in the new proposal , the clubs said the tax would have affected five clubs in 1995 based on fullseason payrolls compared with 11 clubs under their previous proposal and 6 clubs under the union proposal but payrolls were down this year because of the economic losses the owners suffered as a result of the players' eightmonth strike management people think their 44 million threshold would be the equivalent of the 50 million threshold in the players' march proposal the proposed system would maintain the payroll threshold at 44 million until industry revenue rose to 22 billion a chart accompanying the proposal showed that for a full season , 1995 revenue would have been 1556 billion once revenue went beyond 22 billion , the threshold for the ensuing season would rise by the equivalent of 2 percent of the amount over 22 billion if industry revenue rose to 24 billion , the threshold the following year would be 48 million the owners' proposal showed that if revenue rose 14 percent annually , which the clubs say it has historically , the threshold in the seventh year would be 68 million the tax rate , on the other hand , would begin at decreasingly lower ratios of payrolls to revenue player compensation this year was about 65 percent of total revenue contrary to initial belief , the owners have not proposed eliminating salary arbitration for players in some service groups in return for earlier free agency
washington the general yawn provoked in vietnam by robert mcnamara s controversial mea culpa tells a great deal about the enduring difference between the american and vietnamese relationships to the war in both hanoi and saigon , as the bustling southern city is still commonly called , the focus is on the present and future , not on the sins of the past vietnam is a country , not a war , deputy foreign minister le mai is fond of saying mr mcnamara s tears are not vietnam s even tomorrow s 20th anniversary of the country s reunification \( in vietnam , it s the reunification , not the war victory , that counts \) is seen as a minor distraction from the real business at hand that of becoming the next asian tiger workers were building bleachers in the park in front of the old presidential palace in saigon last week for a parade , but almost nobody i met cared vietnam today is in the business of business even hanoi , the once sleepy outpost of postcolonial charm and soviet collectivism , is a cauldron of capitalism everybody , everywhere , is selling something from the soup stall to the highrise construction cranes , the country resembles nothing so much as the unbridled freemarket economies of the west or , better , of the asian tigers vietnam seeks so ardently to emulate hanoi is madly striking deals with international investors eager to rebuild roads , phone systems and the remaining machinery of a market economy yet american businessmen find themselves handicapped in a game fueled by cash streams from hong kong , japan , taiwan , singapore and australia the lack of full diplomatic relations between the us and vietnam , held up by the demands of the tiny missinginaction lobby , cripples american companies by preventing them from using such key instruments as the exportimport bank the consensus among americans in hanoi is that closer relations would foster closer cooperation and enhance the full accounting that mia lobbyists seek president clinton should break the impasse with a historic exchange of ambassadors with vietnam hanoi strikes the visitor as a surprisingly free and open place i detected none of the dangerous electricity i always felt in the moscow and east berlin of old , where you knew the heavy hand of the secret constabulary was only a phone tap away in hanoi , men in uniform were few and far between if anything , the city needs more cops on the street to manage the colossal traffic this climate extends to the flow of information local tv is heavily westernized on my first night in town , i was stunned to see apocalypse now showing on the main channel on other days , oprah , popeye , the masters tournament and the ncaa final four the jewels of american popular culture washed over the doorman and drivers gathered before the tv set in my hotel lobby though governmentcontrolled , the press is relatively uppity , reporting all manner of corruption , scandal and general incompetence when the much admired lee kuan yew , singapore s semiretired dictator and hanoi s unofficial chief adviser , was in town this month , he publicly upbraided the government of prime minister vo van kiet for your inability administratively he was impatient with continuing bureaucratic impediments to private investment and miffed at yet another power outage that had killed his mike and darkened the hall where he was about to speak all this received frontpage treatment in the press this does not mean vietnam is free in larger terms it is a oneparty state with secret surveillance of those thought to be a threat some key buddhist leaders are imprisoned , some intellectuals gagged or hounded , some harsh sentences meted out for the slightest show of dissent such as the 15 years given to a man named pham van quang for waving the flag of the former south vietnam during the 1992 ho chi minh city international marathon still , political repression is hardly a topic that s on everybody s lips as best i could tell , in fact , it was on nobody s lips , unless i brought it up the national preoccupation is economic , not political , and vietnam is clearly a country on the make nine years into doi moi , vietnam s perestroika , the leadership is obviously doing something right the communists have succeeded , said my old anticommunist friend ly quy chung one day in saigon it was an extraordinary admission from a former opposition politician , now a journalist , who had battled both the viet cong and the ussupported government of president nguyen van thieu in the 1970 s he meant that his old enemies , after the 10 dark years from 1975 to 1985 , had now got it right , not merely economically but politically as well by giving the people what they want the liberty to pursue economic happiness the communist gerontocracy is able to keep what it wants full control but many think vietnam , opened to the west and electronically liberated by sidewalk fax and photocopy stalls , is slouching toward democracy by putting the war behind them and eagerly grasping their future , the vietnamese are able to forgive and forget and move forward the question is whether america is ready to do the same
washington , april 22 celebrating a quartercentury of modern environmentalism , hundreds of volunteers performed an earth day ritual along the anacostia river today , hauling debris out of one of the nation s most poisoned waterways the crowd had gathered at the bowers of the national arboretum to enjoy a sunny day on the tainted river that runs across the nation s capital , joining the much cleaner potomac not far from the waterfront towers of the environmental protection agency i have always maintained that if epa and the corps of engineers cannot restore this river , where on the planet can they do it \? said robert e boone , the head of the anacostia watershed society , a local voluntary group on a day when environmentalists all over the country were torn between celebrating the undeniable achievements of the last 25 years and fretting over the demise of their political clout when they see much left to be done , they could at least find in organizations like the small anacostia river group a continuing source of strength just as all politics is local , environmentalism is , too this drawing power at the grass roots could prove increasingly important as powerful business groups vie with large national conservation groups to influence public opinion and win lawmakers' loyalty at a time when the basic tenets of environmental laws are being reconsidered the eventual winner may be the side that argues most persuasively at the local level for just this reason , greenpeace , one of the more militant of the large groups , deliberately avoided the crowded gala on washington s grassy downtown mall celebrating the 25th earth day instead , it sent canoes and speedboats to the smaller anacostia river event , just as it joined small neighborhood activities across the country , said rick hind , a spokesman for the group our theme around the country is to honor and promote small local efforts , he said the same attitude is showing up in the government s environmental bureaucracy , which is trying to capture some of the energy that exists in the anacostia watershed society and its cousins all over the country increasingly , federal officials say they believe that local actions like trying to restore the anacostia may be more effective than new national programs at the environmental protection agency , for example , senior managers have been trying to come up with a style of management that is rooted in places , not in programs or permits or even politics in this new way of thinking , the agency s work would be driven by the environmental needs of communities and ecosystems decisions would be based on detailed understanding of the economic and social as well as ecological concerns of specific places so far , the bureaucrats ca n't seem to decide whether to call it placedriven or communitybased protection i do n't think it is just a new buzzword , said dana minerva , a water quality official at the agency it is an important way of changing how we do our thing of course , epa s role as a national standardssetter is very important , and the people who do the work on how many parts per billion of a chemical cause cancer is very important but the work that needs to be done in communities is the most satisfying in true bureaucratic style , the agency s first step was to publish a 357page phase 1 inventory of current epa efforts to protect ecosystems , a kind of guide to hundreds of local activities like those along the anacostia in the case of the anacostia , the agency s involvement has come slowly , in part because the river runs through poor urban neighborhoods without even a vote in congress federal aid has only trickled in but the clinton administration considers the river a model for how to manage the problems of polluted watersheds , and a place to redress environmental racism , the term used to describe what some say is the tendency to ignore serious pollution in poor areas with high minority populations all the good intentions of laws and bureaucracies have not yet made the anacostia river safe for fish or swimmers the raw sewage of washington still spills into the stream when heavy rains overwhelm the treatment plant , and pollutants from runoff from poor city neighborhoods and wealthier suburbs settle in the riverbed in a survey last year , the smithsonian institution found that 15 of 20 catfish netted in the stream had cancerous livers in clean water , no catfish is likely to have liver cancer but none of that discouraged the youthful crowd that took to the water today , arriving in school buses and in station wagons and on bicycles in a reaffirmation of that chestnut of environmental sloganeering , the commandment to think globally and act locally their activities were typical of those going on in hundreds of towns and cities across the country planting trees , sprucing up parks , teaching about recycling as grassroots organizations celebrated earth day dozens of organizations sought to make the 25th earth day a time to increase political pressure on washington not to roll back federal environmental regulations on campuses , students circulated petitions and urged one other to call and write their representatives in congress in big cities , there were outdoor concerts and rallies likely to draw hundreds of thousands of people , and the speeches dripped with denunciations of the republican contract with america and what it would do to environmental laws but along the anacostia river , the children , the students and even many of the adults who came to clean up did not seem terribly concerned about the changes being contemplated in congress , including proposed changes to the clean water act that many conservationists say would only slow down the cleanup of the anacostia even those who were well informed seemed to be saying they intended to achieve a cleaner environment regardless of what happened on capitol hill things we expected government to do , government can no longer do , so it falls on people to act as stewards of the areas that they themselves have dominion over , said ulysses garner , who brought a group of children to the scene one girl , 10yearold kathleen crosby of chelham , md , said she believed the government was doing its part and she was doing hers they have spent some money , so we thank them by helping to clean up the environment , to pay them back , she said

carriers fly more international passengers north to south than across the atlantic or the pacific between 1989 and 1993 alone , these airlines saw a 27 percent increase in traffic between the united states and latin america , including the caribbean for us airlines , latin america has now become the most important route area , the international air transport association reported recently the surge has coincided with an embrace of free markets in latin america that has spurred economic growth in many countries and brought new business opportunities to the region the increased activity has also contributed to a boom in hotel construction in latin america more important , it has forced latin american airlines to make their own wrenching changes to meet the competitive challenge from the north six years ago , for example , most big latin airlines were stateowned today , almost none are despite those efforts , though , the united states carriers should bolster their share of the region s northsouth traffic from 56 percent today to 73 percent by 2010 , according to a report by the association even mexico s sharp economic downturn this year has had a silver lining for united states airlines with a heavily devalued peso , mexico suddenly became a more inexpensive travel destination for americans while business destinations are declining , beach destinations are increasing , said peggy mahoney , a spokeswoman for continental airlines , which flies to eight mexican cities , the most of any united states carrier the federal aviation administration predicts that over the next 10 years , latin america will widen its margin over europe and asia as the largest passenger market for united states carriers but in revenue , asian and european routes will remain larger than latin america s almost 90 percent of traffic on united states carriers to latin america is on relatively short routes to mexico , the caribbean and central america the push into latin america started in 1990 , when the two largest united states carriers , american and united , bought routes from two failing airlines , eastern and pan american after doubling its latin traffic in five years , american , a unit of the amr corporation , is now the region s largest carrier it accounts for about half of the passengers going through miami international airport , where it plans to start construction later this year on a new 1 billion , 47gate terminal miami and san juan , pr , are american s hubs for much of its service to latin america and the caribbean american is pouring money into the region , said robert c booth , the president of aviation management services of miami , who is a consultant to latin american airlines he estimated that american earned 200 million on revenue of 2 billion on its latin american routes last year , offsetting losses elsewhere and helping put amr in the black amr , which made a profit of 228 million last year on revenue of 161 billion , declined to comment on these figures but only five years after american started flying to brazil , the airline expects this year to overtake varig , brazil s largest airline , for the largest share of the united statesbrazil market the most profitable flying we do is to deep south america argentina , brazil and chile , said robert a britton , american s managing director for international planning american s route from here to dallasfort worth , for example , became one of the airline s 10 most profitable only weeks after the service started in may mr booth estimated that american s frequentflier program now has a million members in latin america in 1992 , united airlines , a unit of the ual corporation , reactivated a latin route system purchased from pan american now , brazil is one of the 10 most profitable destinations for the company , said maria a sastre , united s vice president for latin america in our frequenttraveler program , latin america had the fastest growth rate of our international markets last year continental , the leading united states carrier to mexico and central america , expanded into south america in the early 1990 s having added colombia and ecuador to its

washington , april 8 of all the accusations flung back and forth in the new congress , none infuriates republicans more than the assertion that they are cutting the school lunch program speaker newt gingrich of georgia said recently that the fight over that program was one of the most horrendously disgusting examples of demagogy i have ever seen what you had , he said , was a group of reactionary politicians and reactionary reporters colluding to deliberately misinform the people of the united states democrats say the republicans are cutting the school lunch program and want to kill it , and they cite these efforts as a symbol of what is wrong with the republican agenda senator patrick j leahy , democrat of vermont , has said , the republicans know that children are not old enough to vote , so they have targeted the school lunch program in truth , said mr gingrich , the welfare bill passed by the house increased by 45 percent a year for five years the amount of money we allocate for school lunches the democrats , he said , are spreading factually false stories to scare children into thinking they will go hungry but the republicans have found it hard to explain exactly what they are doing with the child nutrition programs , and the complexity of their proposal has allowed the debate to catch fire in fact , there is no simple , straightforward way to compare the money that would be spent under their proposal with the amounts that would be spent under current law for the same types of food assistance the school lunch program , established in 1946 , now feeds 253 million children a day , subsidizing more than four billion meals a year the republicans would give each state a lump sum of money to help schools feed children this block grant would replace the school lunch program , and the separate school breakfast program , and would absorb part of the money that now goes to schools from three other sources the summer foodservice program , the childcare food program for youngsters in day care and the milk program for schools that do not offer lunch or breakfast the amount of money earmarked for school lunch subsidies this year is clear 52 billion , including cash and commodities and the congressional budget office has estimated the amounts that will be spent over the next five years if current law remains in place but it is not so easy to determine precisely how much would be spent on school lunches under the republican proposal because there would no longer be a separate account for such meals the lunch money would be lumped together with money for school breakfasts , daycare meals and the other programs merged in the block grant a state would have to use at least 80 percent of its grant to provide free or lowcost meals to economically disadvantaged children each side in this debate has some evidence to support its argument the amount of money in the block grant for 1996 is , as the republicans say , more than the 1995 appropriations for the five programs that would be consolidated in the block grant , and the amount would increase in each of the next five years but the block grant provides less each year than would be spent in that year for those five programs under current law , and it would not keep pace with expected increases in food costs and school enrollment school lunch would no longer be an entitlement , available at little or no cost to any child with family income below a certain level states could set their own eligibility criteria , and there is no guarantee that children entitled to free lunches today would continue to receive them over five years , the block grant would provide states with 363 billion that is at least 2 billion , or 5 percent , less than what they would receive under the existing programs in the same period in 2000 , the block grant would provide 78 billion , or 8 percent less than states would receive if current law continued robert greenstein , director of the center on budget and policy priorities , a liberal research and advocacy group , said , the block grant represents a decline in food purchasing power per student to deal with such a decline , he said , schools would have to reduce meal portions or quality , raise lunch prices or take other action to shave costs the school lunch provisions of the welfare bill were written by the house committee on economic and educational opportunities , headed by representative bill goodling , republican of pennsylvania under the bill , he said , the school lunch program would grow by 45 percent a year , and to prove this , he listed what he said were the bill s authorizations for school lunch spending but the bill does not set precise spending levels for the school lunch program , instead prescribing amounts for the block grant as a whole the numbers cited by mr goodling came from a work sheet used by the republican staff of his committee to illustrate how money in the block grant might be divided among various types of food assistance the blockgrant money could be divided in many other ways , with state officials ultimately making those decisions the work sheet shows that in setting the amount of the block grant , mr goodling assumed an annual increase of 45 percent in one part of the school lunch program , which provides cash reimbursements to schools but schools also receive commodities like meat , fruit and vegetables from the federal government , and under the block grant the federal money earmarked for such purchases in each of the next few years would be slightly less than the amount available this year considering commodities as well as cash , the congressional budget office estimates that federal spending for the school lunch program would increase under current law by an average of 53 percent a year from 1996 to 2000 by contrast , the block grant in the bill passed by the house would increase 41 percent a year another provision of the welfare bill would allow state officials to use up to 20 percent of the school nutrition block grant for other purposes , like child care next year , for example , 13 billion of the 67 billion in block grant money could be shifted in that way president clinton said recently that the republicans wanted to cut the school lunch program and end it mr gingrich said last week that we eliminated one group , washington bureaucrats , and transferred much of their power to state officials , but he said it was absurd to suggest that children would not be fed here , too , the republicans have had trouble laying to rest the democratic contentions because the federal framework for the school lunch program , including uniform national nutrition standards , would be scrapped under their proposal the republican bill calls for the national academy of sciences to develop model nutrition standards , but does not require states to observe them as a condition for receiving federal money
atlanta it took seven innings in the first game of the world series last night , but the atlanta braves and cleveland indians finally got their identities straight the national league team is , indeed , the braves , despite advance publicity that said they rely on power , not speed and defense and the indians , well , they 're down 01 in the fourofsevengame series because the team that has plenty of power but also uses plenty of speed and strong defense at the shortstop position was burned by some of its own potent weaponry quintessential national league ball of the sort that would have brought a tear to the eyes of maury wills the role reversal came in the bottom of the seventh and proved decisive in the duel between atlanta s greg maddux and cleveland s orel hershiser the indians' righthander had given little up to the braves only two balls left the infield in the first six innings that finesse pitching provided ample reason for the 11 tie he carried into the bottom of the seventh but hershiser then lost the strike zone because he did , fred mcgriff and david justice the two braves bashers he admittedly feared the most were walked on nine pitches to lead off the inning hershiser , having made 101 pitches to that point , about his limit since reconstructive arm surgery , left the game the indians turned to one of the specialists in the relief business , the lefthanded paul assenmacher , who walked the pinchhitting mike devereaux , setting up a a basesloaded , noout situation so the indians called on julian taveras cox countered with another pinchhitter , luis polonia , the little speed merchant who became available to the braves late in the season after the yankees released him to make room for darryl strawberry polonia , who used bunts to terrorize the reds in the national league championship series , hit the ball right at the one fielder the braves had to fear , omar vizquel , the shortstop whom the indians' manager , mike hargrove , compares to ozzie smith but vizquel , playing back at doubleplay depth on orders from the coaching staff , did an uncustomary thing he bobbled the ball , and kept bobbling it as he crossed second base the umpire gave the indians the controversial forceout , but mcgriff crossed the plate with the goahead run polonia , cognizant of his own speed , said of vizquel i'm sure he was rushing a little bit i always run hard , that s the way i play maybe that made him rush and he could n't turn the double play vizquel said polonia s speed was not on his mind , but the double play obviously was it was a tough play , he said i wanted to flip it so that carlos could throw , he said , referring to carlos baerga , the indians' second baseman but i dropped the ball , then dropped it again i had to run to the bag polonia did n't think the shortstop did that in time he never got hold of the ball , he said it could have been a lot better for us i think they made a mistake , but , hey , everybody s human it was too close to call , devereaux said , but i thought he juggled the ball back in the braves dugout , manager bobby cox was still furious he believed vizquel never had control of the ball and thus his runner should have been safe at second so cox could be seen giving signs in animated fashion to his next hitter , rafael belliard though angry , cox was also crafty belliard then laid down the perfect bunt as justice came charging home from third with belliard hitting and one out , they probably did n't want to hit into a double play , vizquel said they got us by surprise i knew something was coming all the way i was looking for a squeeze , said belliard , who redeemed himself nicely after a firstinning error that helped the indians build a run without a hit the perfect suicide squeeze had given the braves their second run in the inning and their third run of the night , a frightening prospect for the indians , to be sure , since maddux was still in the game , nursing a onehitter at the time the braves had put together the biggest rally of the series , but never put the ball past the infield dirt they had played little ball , national league ball , started by two sluggers hershiser had said he believed to be giants but mcgriff and justice had turned into table setters with discriminating tastes then the braves turned on the speed they took the game to the indians' fielders and forced errors where there was room for none and when they did , they not only had the victory in what turned into a 32 game , they also had reasserted their right to be called the ruling national league team in this series hershiser is a tough competitor , devereaux said we were hoping and praying that he would get tired , and we were fortunate he walked fred and david at that point that s fundamental baseball right there , braves center fielder marquis grissom said you 've got to bunt the guys over you have to get the runners in if there s a runner on third and less than two outs that s how we 've been playing all year , but it s crucial in the playoffs and especially the world series

there were six panelists yesterday morning at a seminar on film noir can the black film renaissance be jumpstarted \? does it need to be \? , and none of the six were keenen ivory wayans , who had been listed on the program but the audience got its slice of celebrity john singleton , the writer and director of boyz n the hood , who had not been promised , was on the dais if anyone wondered why the topic of film was included in vibe magazine s twoday music seminar , held thursday and yesterday at the marriott marquis hotel just off times square , arthur jafa s comments certainly tied the subjects together mr jafa , the cinematographer of spike lee s film crooklyn and julie dash s daughters of the dust , said that if black film makers did to cinema what we 've done to music , their work would become a dominant cultural force it s got to be as different from mainstream film as hiphop was from what was on the terrain at that time , he added toward the end of the 90minute session , larry robinson , who wrote the music for tales from the hood and for mario van peebles s recent film panther , even suggested that film makers go to record companies first when trying to sell a project , because there s no better way to sell records than to have that music in a movie the method is a very appealing proposition to record companies , he said helena echegoyan , the panel s moderator and token film studio representative , disagreed , saying film companies were unlikely to view that plan so favorably then she took the subject a step further cube is a singular talent , she said , referring to ice cube , the rapper who appeared in mr singleton s higher learning and in the film friday , but i do n't think everyone who raps should be in a movie mr jafa got a laugh from the audience , and from mr singleton , by adding , 'friday' was a horrible , horrible , horrible movie ice cube was also a cowriter of that film ms echegoyan , a senior vice president for production at miramax films , had the unpleasant job of reminding everyone present that studios are in the business of financing films and getting a return on their investments , not seeking out new artists with something culturally significant to say her fellow panelists agreed that the structure in hollywood was n't particularly supportive of white directors and producers trying to make movies either mr singleton acknowledged that he still found getting his projects done very difficult , despite my commercial status leslie harris , the writer , director and producer of just another girl on the irt , a 1993 underground hit that had its premiere at the sundance film festival , offered a suggestion we need to get more executives in the film business , she said , meaning more black executives , and more films will get greenlighted and we ca n't just go on making 'hood films ms harris also expressed hope that the black renaissance would turn into something permanent , not just a trend that would pass when hollywood decided the subject matter had been exhausted , as they did after the flurry of black exploitation films in the 1970 s there seemed to be no consensus on the timing of the socalled renaissance mr jafa noted that some people would say it began when spike lee wrote , edited and directed his first film , she s gotta have it , in 1986 , but that it might have been a decade earlier other issues seemed more pressing than chronology to the seminar participants colin callender , an executive producer at hbo and the only white person on the panel , said , i think the issue for black film makers is to find really great writers he also urged black film makers to think of cable television as well he cited strapped , a 1993 hbo film directed by forest whitaker , which was watched by 14 percent of hbo subscribers overall \( slightly higher than the premium channel s average audience \) but by 55 percent of young black subscribers when asked to define the black esthetic , ms echegoyan of miramax answered by saying , black culture is the dominant culture in this country mr singleton , who was quiet for most of the seminar , sitting at the end of the table in sunglasses and white turtleneck , was asked about promoting black films i like to market my films just like records , he said i have my own publicist , my own marketing team we tell the studio what we 're going to do i 've had to threaten to get physical with executives about the marketing of my films , he added the subject under discussion at the time , he recalled , was which poster to use mr singleton won the argument ultimately , it seemed , the biggest issue was money on one side there were the difficulties of getting financing for bigbudget movies on the other , panelists expressed the opinion that good movies could be made without spending millions of dollars ms harris said she had shot her first film in 17 days within a fiveblock radius in brooklyn mr jafa pointed out that hoop dreams , the critically praised 1994 documentary about young innercity basketball players , had been shot on videotape mr robinson did n't see film financing as the problem , however we can get money , he said there s enough money in the black community to make 'jurassic park 3' later , when the panel took questions from the audience , a man who said he was with paine webber , the brokerage firm , offered his assistance several of the panelists laughed , and one asked for his card photos larry robinson , a composer colin callender , of hbo , and helena echegoyan , of miramax \( jack manning the new

in two months of defense testimony , lawyers for 10 men charged with a new york terrorbombing conspiracy have sought to show deceit in the government s investigation and to humanize defendants pictured as fanatics bent on mass murder the defense case , expected to wrap up today , has presented what the lawyers say is evidence that the federal bureau of investigation gave the chief informer so much leeway that he could act as an agent provocateur who entangled the muslim defendants in a scheme in which they appeared to have plotted to blow up major buildings and transportation links the prosecution says that attacks were planned in 1993 on such targets as the united nations headquarters and the lincoln and holland tunnels to coerce the united states into changing its middle east policies whether the 70 witnesses and other evidence the defense has presented in federal district court in manhattan will overcome five months of prosecution evidence with twice as many witnesses and a mass of secretly recorded meetings and phone conversations will not be known until the jury speaks and that is still weeks away , after rebuttal testimony , closing arguments and what are expected to be long deliberations but what is clear in the biggest terrorism trial ever to come to an american courtroom is that the strength of the evidence varies against the different defendants it is powerful against some such as the four who are seen on an fbi videotape mixing fuel oil and fertilizer for what the authorities say was an intended bomb but less forceful against some others the jury could well have some of its toughest deliberations over the most prominent defendant , sheik omar abdel rahman , a militant cleric from egypt accused of being the leader of the purported conspiracy prosecutors say that the february 1993 bombing of the world trade center , which killed six people , was part of the conspiracy , though none of the defendants are accused of helping to carry out that attack four other men were convicted of the trade center bombing in a previous trial the direct evidence against mr abdel rahman is limited but what there is of such evidence is powerful a secretly recorded conversation in which the cleric briefly discusses possible bombing targets in new york city with the government informer , emad salem , who asked him for guidance on the matter the team of defense lawyers holds that it has made major inroads against the government s case the entire defense case has humanized the defendants , who before had been demonized by pretrial publicity and by the government , said lynne f stewart , mr abdel rahman s chief lawyer his own case has presented him as the man of god he truly is mr abdel rahman arrived in the united states from egypt five years ago from his home base in jersey city , the blind 57yearold cleric exhorted his fundamentalist followers back home to overthrow the egyptian government , which he had long opposed because of its secular outlook and strong united states ties miss stewart , speaking outside the courtroom last week , said that the informer , mr salem , a former egyptian military officer , set up her client by manipulating him into the conversation about possible bombing targets valerie s amsterdam , a lawyer for one of mr abdel rahman s codefendants , fares khallafalla , an immigrant from the sudan who also settled in jersey city , said the government set up her client and several others in a different way , which she described as a baitandswitch they baited these guys with bosnia , and halfway through they switched to talking about american targets , she said ms amsterdam and other defense lawyers contend that mr salem , the fbi informer , was an agent provocateur who misled some of the defendants into believing that the activities that led to their arrests were just training to go to bosnia to help the muslims there fight the serbs mary jo white , the united states attorney in manhattan , whose office is prosecuting the case , declined to respond to the defense lawyers' assessments , saying that the evidence presented in the courtroom speaks for itself the prosecution has denied in court that mr salem misled any of the men on trial during its fivemonth presentation , the prosecutors depicted mr abdel rahman as a leader who was consulted about which targets were permissible they painted mr khallafalla , 32 , a driver for a medical livery service , as one of the foot soldiers of the purported conspiracy ms stewart said she believed the defense had dented the credibility of the numerous recordings mr salem secretly made of his conversations with the defendants this would be especially important in the case of the may 1993 conversation with mr abdel rahman about possible bombing targets in the exchange , after mr salem asked whether the united nations and a federal building in manhattan should be attacked , mr abdel rahman is heard advising not to bomb the united nations and to put off plans to attack the federal building , but instead to find a plan to inflict damage on the american army mr salem and fbi agents have testified that this tape and the others were not doctored but another defense lawyer , john h jacobs , held that the taped evidence had been reduced in credibility because of other testimony indicating that the fbi agents had let mr salem throw away tapes of conversations he had recorded

as mike rasmussen , the football coach at st mary s college of california , said , this was really a business trip a successful one , too the galloping gaels took a redeye flight friday morning , rolled to a 3414 victory over columbia yesterday afternoon and flew home at 6 45 pm last night for st mary s , there was no sightseeing , just a sound running game that got better as the day went on it broke open a 1414 game in the third quarter with two touchdowns in 50 seconds and an additional touchdown less than five minutes later bonner cunnings made four touchdown runs \( for 4 , 1 , 4 and 1 yards \) , tying the school record cunnings is not even the starter he backs up ed williams , but williams resprained an ankle in the first quarter and returned only briefly in the third quarter we thought they would try to run the ball down our throats , rory wilfork , columbia s cocaptain and outside linebacker , said and st mary s did its ground game gained only 37 yards in the first half , but 201 in the second fullback ray scott carried 16 times for 125 yards , cunnings 19 for 74 and quarterback sean laird 11 for 60 cunnings set up one of his touchdowns with a 56yard kickoff return i did n't see big holes , cunnings said , but our guys were hitting them and hard rasmussen said st mary s running game kept columbia off the field st mary s had possession for 34 minutes 11 seconds to columbia s 25 49 , and while columbia gained 301 yards , it suffered five sacks , two interceptions and two lost fumbles on a glorious football afternoon , only 4 , 260 spectators turned out at the 17 , 000seat wien stadium in upper manhattan they saw st mary s score on its first three possessions in the third quarter , starting with a 60yard drive that ended with cunnings s 4yard plunge on columbia s first play after the ensuing kickoff , an option pitch from quarterback mike cavanaugh to jason bivens rolled loose , and raul murillo recovered for st mary s on columbia s 12 cunnings ran for 11 yards , laird hurdled the middle for the last yard and st mary s led by two touchdowns minutes later , st mary s drove 64 yards , with scott contributing 30 yards on a counter and 13 on a sweep cunnings belted over from the 1 , and the game was out of reach for columbia afterward , there was little joy among the lions we 're catching them at 9 30 in the morning , their time , and it s our home opener , coach ray tellier said , and they took it to us they played well we did not they played hard , they played with emotion and we had none of that why no emotion \? i do n't know , wilfork said i do n't know what the guys were thinking when we came out for the second half maybe we were tired and thought we could continue to play at the level of the first half maybe columbia had an emotional letdown after last saturday s lastminute upset of harvard we were n't as emotionally ready as the harvard game , cavanaugh said we were not as emotionally ready as we should have been maybe columbia could not get excited playing a team it had never met before no , cavanaugh said as coach says , you 've got 10 saturdays to get emotional if you ca n't do that , there s no excuse extra points st mary s is from moraga , calif , 10 miles east of berkeley it should not be confused with the st mary s colleges in nebraska or indiana or maryland or michigan or minnesota or texas in the 1930 s and 1940 s , this st mary s was a national power among major colleges , winning the cotton bowl in 1939 and losing in the sugar bowl in 1946 it came to new york every year to play fordham , another power then it dropped football after the 1950 season , revived it in the late 1960 s on a club level , returned it as a varsity sport in 1967 and moved up to division iaa in 1993 it is still iaa , but there are few other division iaa teams on the west coast there are many in the rockies , but they give the maximum of 65 football scholarships and st mary s gives 13 or 14 spread among 45 players photo st mary s defenders sacking columbia quarterback mike cavanaugh in the first half yesterday the gaels took control in the second half \( clifford hausner for the new york times \)
when all else fails , rockers use noise and dissonance to get a reaction from listeners through the years , listeners have learned to tolerate more jolts , leading bands to escalate in turn the boredoms , from japan , still have the power to shock and annoy listeners their secret weapon is to combine noise with unpredictability in a song the band played on monday night at irving plaza as part of the macintosh new york music festival , taps from an electronic drum kit accompanied a repeated guitar note , turning into feedback yamatsuka eye yelled , rock and roll ! a slow riff , accompanied by trumpet , started to grind the guitar brought in a pentatonic quasijapanese melody , which melted into echoey lines a heavymetal riff began and mr eye started howling , leaping around the stage with karatelike kicks below him , the mosh pit erupted into motion but slow drum tapping returned , and the song ended like the melvins , a pioneering seattle grunge band , the boredoms love the impact and excess of heavy metal , and can pound out low unison riffs in homage to black sabbath but the boredoms also toy with punk , with frank zappa s dissonant zigzags and with rhythmless synthesizer squeals and buzzes it s manic and arbitrary a song might last 30 seconds , as one did at irving plaza , or lurch along for 10 minutes through it all , mr eye , with a hairdo like an exploding land mine , brutalized his voice with growls , yells , shrieks and gibberish , none of it intelligible , all delivered with appropriate physical contortions he leaped into the crowd a dozen times , still singing the boredoms flourish somewhere between parody and devotion there are humor , rebelliousness , provocation and mockery in their performances , none of them easily isolated if it s a joke , it s a good one railroad jerk , which shared the bill , uses its noise in more standard frameworks bluesrock songs in which timetested riffs meet lower east side clatter and caustic lyrics the songs sound jerrybuilt they sputter and stagger more than they rock , with offcenter bass lines and colliding guitar twangs now and then , a minimalist web of guitar lines shows that the songs are fully premeditated but railroad jerk uses the raw spots of its songs to make them cantankerous and vivid

los angeles , may 25 the o j simpson trial took one more odd turn this evening when yet another juror was dismissed after a mysterious fourhour closeddoor meeting that included judge lance a ito , prosecutors , defense lawyers and investigators for both sides upon leaving the meeting , none of those in attendance would say which juror had been dismissed nor would they offer any explanation for the dismissal a replacement will be selected on friday when asked by reporters what had taken place in the meeting , one prosecutor , christopher a darden , snapped , get a life ! and strode off to the elevators the dismissal , the eighth in the trial , will leave only four alternate jurors , with months of testimony remaining unlike previous juror dismissals , the court officers refused tonight to give a description of the juror , so it was not immediately clear what impact the removal would have on the racial or sex balance of the panel the meeting to deal with the juror s dismissal forced cancellation of the afternoon session the break came before judge ito ruled on a defense request to allow jurors to hear mr simpson s statement to the police on the day after his former wife , nicole brown simpson and her friend , ronald l goldman , were killed the issue was raised on wednesday when a prosecution witness alluded to mr simpson s alibi , saying that he initially thought that it was air tight if judge ito were to side with the defense on the request , it could represent yet another setback for prosecutors , since the jury would get mr simpson s statement without the prosecution s getting the right to crossexamine the defendant a transcript of a sidebar conference with the defense and prosecution on wednesday showed that judge ito appeared to side with the defense on the issue , at least initially the jurors , unaware of the dispute , continued to hear evidence today from the witness who caused the uproar , collin yamauchi , a police laboratory analyst but prosecutors , after months of being pilloried in court for what the defense has portrayed as serious bungling by police technicians , won some measure of revenge today when , with the help of mr yamauchi and photographs , they showed that a defense expert had apparently mishandled crucial pieces of evidence the defense expert , dr henry lee , was shown examining a pair of socks found in mr simpson s bedroom hours after the slayings mr lee , a widely respected forensic expert , is shown wearing latex gloves but no laboratory coat or hair net devices routinely worn by crimescene investigators to prevent contamination of evidence did dr lee ever change gloves during this entire onehour examination \? rockne harmon , the government s chief lawyer handling dna issues , asked mr yamauchi i did n't see him change his gloves , mr yamauchi replied does that mean he did n't \? mr harmon asked to the best of my knowledge , he did n't , mr yamauchi said much of the defense s overall strategy has been built around trying to persuade jurors that mr simpson is an innocent victim of evil police officers and alternatively , if malevolent officials did not manipulate evidence , defense lawyers have suggested , then clumsy ones did inadvertently by sneezing or sweating on blood samples , rendering the subsequent test results irrelevant in particular , defense lawyers have made much of the fact that police technicians have acknowledged that they did not change gloves between handling some samples hence , mr harmon , with an almost palpable air of satisfaction , elicited from mr yamauchi that the defense s famed forensic expert may himself have botched his examination of evidence gathered at mr simpson s mansion and the crime scene for most of the morning , as the dna portion of the trial moved fitfully toward , lawyers from both sides sought to tie up loose ends that had been left from earlier testimony one loose end involved mr yamauchi s comment on wednesday about the alibi defense lawyers had pounced upon the remark , saying that it should allow the jury to hear the statement that the defendant first gave to the police ms clark had argued that mr yamauchi s statement was based on secondhand news reports , not on the police statement , which she said was self serving and should not be presented to the jury today , judge ito began the morning session by gently chiding a defense lawyer , johnnie l cochran jr , for accusing ms clark of being hysterical during her arguments about mr yamauchi s statement judge ito told mr cochran that he received an anonymous phone message on my voice mail this morning suggesting that i suggest to you that you look up the greek derivation of the word i did that last night , mr cochran replied the term as i understand it applies to both male and female all right just a word of caution , judge ito said ms clark leaped to her feet , and started to complain that mr cochran s statement was sexist counsel , judge ito interrupted , i'm cautioning him so i do n't think you need to add anything to it according to webster s new world dictionary third college edition , hysterical derives from the greek word hysterikos , literally suffering in the womb , based on the ancient notion that women were hysterical more often than men photo collin yamauchi , right , a police investigator , yesterday discussed the handling of blood samples taken as evidence from socks found in o j simpson s house from left were defense and prosecution lawyers , johnnie l cochran jr , barry scheck , marcia clark and rockne harmon \( pool photo by sam mircovich \)
gorazde , bosnia and herzegovina , oct 19 it is nice now , adila prutina said after 60 miles of road between sarajevo and this eastern muslim enclave was reopened this week through serbianheld territory the serbs do n't shoot us anymore and we have food to eat i pray that it lasts and that the world will help us overcome what has happened here after three and a half years of war and isolation , and being held up as a possible bargaining chip by the bosnian serbs , many residents of gorazde are optimistic that their town will again be permanently linked to the capital because of this route , i know our survival is certain , said haris halajibegovic , a gorazde resident our government knows that if there is no gorazde then there is no bosnia it is the heart of bosnia gorazde was once a main industrial center for bosnia , with a thriving chemical and metal trade , as well as fertile agricultural soil but little is produced in the enclave now other than vegetables and tobacco grown in pots on windowsills or on small plots of land near burnedout buildings the town has no natural gas or purified water and electricity comes only to those ingenious enough to build water wheels along the drina river , or from cherished gasoline generators at the hospital and a few other buildings we have been living like serfs , said nurka milic , 55 , a refugee from the nearby village of stjnice we once had a big house and two cars , with electricity and everything we needed now we live like people did 400 years ago the town s 57 , 000 residents have survived nearly entirely on relief shipments brought through serbia , though much of their twopound weekly ration of flour and beans was always skimmed by serbs along the way and sometimes the trucks reached the town nearly empty many survived by eating only grass for weeks after fleeing their nearby villages , then found things little better once they reached united nationsdesignated safe area in the first six months of the war , many people died of starvation , said dr husein praso , a doctor at the oftenshelled hospital , where an exploded 120millimeter rocket still sticks out of the earth near the front entrance it was also the worst time for injuries because no one knew how to react to the shelling and they could n't believe it was happening now they know to stay in the dark cellar , no matter how long it takes to the residents of gorazde , the new route , backed by western resolve and the warring parties' tenuous commitment to the peace , is the first sign that there is a wish to keep them alive aid workers say they will be able to bring in more than 1 , 000 tons of food a week , twice the amount they have trucked in previous years a small united nations aid convoy tested the road on tuesday , followed today by the united states ambassador to bosnia , john menzies , and his wellarmed entourage flying american flags from his armored truck , he barreled into town leaving mobs of tattered children waving and saluting in his wake he brought a pledge to help resupply the city and the newfound will to do so today , we tested the principle that there will be free and unimpeded access to gorazde , mr menzies said , standing among his bodyguards in the town square this must be available not just to the united nations and aid agencies but to all nonmilitary traffic this is just the first of many visits we will make to gorazde the reopening of the route to civilian traffic under united nations escort will allow gorazde s residents to leave the enclave for the first time since the war began in 1992 but there is some trepidation about being the first to test this theoretical possibility , as few in gorazde believe that the serbs can be trusted to honor their pledge of unimpeded access those fears were reinforced when mr menzie s convoy , which had been cleared by the bosnian serb authorities , was held at one checkpoint for nearly 10 minutes as the serbian guards tried to obtain identification cards from all on board none were given , and after a lengthy discussion with the french united nations officers in the lead , all the vehicles were allowed to pass but gorazde s residents know that they will not have the luxury of diplomatic immunity or a bulletproof car when they try pass the serbian barriers and mines on the road even with a united nations convoy , i think they would shoot , mehmet guso said about bosnian serb soldiers only last month they sent a bomb that killed four children they do not act on reason croatia assures us zagreb , croatia , oct 19 \( by the new york times \) president franjo tudjman told assistant secretary of state richard c holbrooke today that his army would not attack a serbianheld region in eastern croatia before scheduled peace talks begin in dayton , ohio , on oct 31 mr holbrooke , who is on his final mission in the former yugoslavia before the talks , said president tudjman had reiterated that his government hoped for a peaceful settlement over the serbianheld region , known as eastern slavonia but despite the assurances , western diplomats here noted that the croatian president had refused to renounce the use of force to retake the last slice of croatian territory held by the serbs president tudjman assured us that while he retains his rights to use whatever means he thinks are necessary to deal with the problem , mr holbrooke said , there will not be fighting in eastern slavonia , that he commits himself to the search for a peaceful settlement here in croatia the croatian army recaptured western slavonia in may and the krajina region in august before beginning those attacks on the two areas , which had been seized by the serbs in 1991 after croatia seceded from yugoslavia , mr tudjman ignored warnings from western countries

oklahoma city , april 26 in the week since the bombing of the federal building , the oklahoma city area has been disrupted by at least 35 bomb threats , aimed at schools , churches , government buildings and a large hospital here the threats have all been hoaxes , the police say , but they have strained already overtaxed emergency and lawenforcement workers we 've averaged about three or four a day , said sgt kim hughes of the oklahoma city police department we 're checking out each one we have to take them seriously , but so far we 've had just copycat stuff many places throughout oklahoma have received similar threats , a spokesman for the state department of public safety said one threat was called in last thursday morning to children s hospital , which has treated 16 children and one adult seriously injured in the explosion at the federal building though no patients were evacuated , about 200 people were told to leave , including some parents of injured children whoever is calling this in does n't really understand the trauma it s putting people through , brian bates , a spokesman for children s hospital , said bomb threats have also been made against the post office , the department of public safety , schools and other public buildings in oklahoma city and outlying areas before the bombing , the police said they typically received only about one threat a month , usually from schoolchildren a few hours after the blast , a high school was evacuated after receiving a telephoned bomb threat , and two teenage students were caught and suspended none of the other callers has been identified , the authorities said , and the bomb unit is constantly being deployed it s mostly a pain in the neck , sgt hughes said we have to have an extra bomb squad team on standby
menemsha , mass shortly after 5 30 am , david tilton eased his 33foot fortier , the see saw ii , out of the harbor and into fogshrouded vineyard sound we were the first sport fishing vessel to depart menemsha that morning some two hours of steaming lay ahead of us we were bound for an area nearly 40 miles southsouthwest of martha s vineyard before our trolling rigs went into the water the other anglers aboard were my brother dan , walter ashley and hokan alden , a friend of david s from sweden another passenger was brutus , david s black labrador who enjoys fishing almost as much as waterfowling brutus s selfassigned role on board is , should it prove necessary , to keep the fishermen on their toes when a fish hits , brutus either sees the strike or hears the line snap out of the trolling clip and sets off a wild clamor our primary quarry was yellowfin tuna , although we knew that we might see small bluefin tuna , socalled footballs skipjack tuna , dolphin \( the fish not the mammal \) , white marlin and atlantic bonito where we began fishing , the surface temperature of the water was about 75 degrees , some 6 degrees warmer than it had been just outside menemsha harbor that morning we trolled six lines , two each from the two outriggers and two more from the aft corners of the flying bridge the lures resembled the japanese feathered jigs with which i became familiar 50 years ago , but instead of plain white feathers , they were adorned with a dazzling array of colored strips of plastic and other synthetic materials four or five feet ahead of the lures on each line were wooden birds , as david called them equipped with fins set at right angles to their bodies , these birds , when trolled at 8 knots or so , create a tumult on the water s surface that attracts predatory fish to the lures skipjack tuna , small fish averaging about 6 pounds , were the first to come aboard the first few times this happened there was some confusion in the stern only walter and david were familiar with dealing with that many lines but we soon fell into a reasonably efficient ritual one person fighting the hooked fish and the others reeling in the remaining lines on four occasions , two fish were hooked simultaneously the next species to be captured were dolphin , always a surprise to me when taken in massachusetts waters a fastswimming , hardfighting pelagic species , dolphin are present in all tropical and subtropical seas they are in greatest abundance along the atlantic coast from florida to north carolina in summer , they swim north with the gulf stream occasionally as far as prince edward island this summer s unusual warmth has resulted in dolphin being caught only a few miles off the south shores of martha s vineyard and nantucket when pursuing prey or lures , dolphin light up in a brilliant blend of gold and green , colors that quickly fade after they are in the fish box they are marvelous eating the flesh is sweet , white , moist and flaky like the tunas , dolphin fish should be bled immediately after capture if the best of their flavor is to be preserved dolphin of more than 80 pounds have been taken on rod and line , but none of the three that we caught weighed over seven pounds dolphin often congregate under floating weed lines , floating logs or dunnage planks , and a school of them will sometimes follow a hooked fish to the boat if the hooked fish is left in the water , a fly or a lure cast to its freeswimming brethren will usually elicit a strike after the flurry with the dolphin , we caught an atlantic bonito and two bluefin tuna of about eight pounds each some nine hours after we had set forth , we were beginning to wonder if we would find any yellowfin tuna when a big fish slashed at one of the outrigger baits , missing it cleanly dan , who was on the flying bridge and watching that line at that instant , said that it was a tuna , species unknown , of more than 100 pounds fifteen minutes later , hokan was jerked from a semisnooze by a heavy strike on the rod nearest him it was clearly a goodsized fish and i scrambled to reel in the adjacent line i had taken only three or four turns on the reel when i was startled by a solid hit and a run that let me know that i also had my biggest fish of the day the other crew cleared the remaining lines , and hokan and i were free to play our

greenwich , conn , june 16 lawyers for the five greenwich high school seniors suspended for slipping a message of racial hatred into the yearbook have begun negotiations with the town attorney to resolve the situation , but the students have agreed to forgo graduation exercises tuesday night regardless of whether they are reinstated , town attorney john f meerbergen said today the lawyers for the students would not discuss the substance of the talks , but mr meerbergen said they were intended to see if something can be worked out as it stands , the students , some of whom have been accepted into college , will not graduate because they have been barred from taking final exams they may appeal their suspensions to the school superintendent but had not done so as of today the five students were suspended on wednesday after a coded message was discovered in the yearbook captions they had written to accompany their photographs school officials say the boys , who are white , conspired months ago to plant the message , each submitting a word or portion of a word which , taken together as a phrase , spell out kill all niggers the connecticut attorney general , richard blumenthal , said his office would be pursuing both criminal and civil charges against the students under the state s hatecrime statute this outrageous act of bigotry and bias is a direct affront to the entire educational system and citizenry of greenwich and connecticut , mr blumenthal said anyone who attempts to consider it an innocent , youthful prank ought to heed the tremendous damage done to human sensibilities and relationships as well as the whole social fabric the students could face imprisonment and fines if convicted under the hatecrime statute , which was enacted in 1989 and expanded this year to allow individuals to seek civil sanctions a message should be sent to anyone inclined to excuse or condone this kind of revolting conduct , mr blumenthal said after the meeting today , the lawyers for the students said they had agreed not to discuss the case we 're at a very sensitive stage right now , said emanuel margolis , who is representing keith dianis the other students are patrick fox , ed oberbeck , robert texiere and aaron valenti mr meerbergen , the town attorney , said he met with the lawyers for the students this afternoon none of the students attended the meeting , but their lawyers agreed that their clients would not participate in graduation ceremonies , mr meerbergen said i think there is a consensus among us all that they will not attend , he said the discovery of the message which was spread out over several pages in the yearbook led to outrage and sadness among students , teachers and administrators at the school today , students continued to express dismay over the incident but said the exclusion of the five boys from graduation ceremonies was the first step toward putting the matter behind them leigh j conover , a senior , said she felt it was appropriate for graduation ceremonies to go on without the five senior boys i think it s a good punishment for them , she said i'm sure it makes them realize how bad a thing they did they must not have thought much about it at first but now i'm sure they are
washington , oct 16 the supreme court agreed today to decide whether federal courts should respect the confidentiality of mental health counseling by giving psychotherapists and other mental health workers a privilege against having to disclose patient records in judicial proceedings all 50 states recognize a psychotherapistpatient privilege that , much like the betterknown attorneyclient privilege , shields therapists from having to give testimony or turn over notes or records of therapy sessions there is no general rule in the federal courts the supreme court , which has the authority to recommend new rules of federal court procedure , proposed adding a psychotherapistpatient privilege to the federal rules of evidence in 1973 but congress vetoed the proposal , along with other proposals for specific privileges instead , it left the entire question of privileges to be interpreted by the courts of the united states in light of reason and experience , as the vaguely worded rule 501 of the federal rules of evidence now states in the case the court accepted today , the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit , in chicago , ruled earlier this year that it was time to recognize a psychotherapistpatient privilege because reason tells us that psychotherapists and patients share a unique relationship , in which the patient s ability to communicate freely without the fear of public disclosure is the key to successful treatment the appeals court said that while other federal courts had declined to create the privilege , none of those decisions was recent and much has changed in the mental health field in the past five years the case is a lawsuit against the village of hoffman estates , ill , and one of its police officers , mary lu redmond , who fatally shot a man while investigating a report of a stabbing at an apartment building the officer said the man had been holding a knife and chasing someone at the time of the shooting the man s relatives filed suit in federal district court in chicago during pretrial discovery , they sought notes and records from a licensed clinical social worker who had counseled the officer several times a week for six months after the shooting the trial judge rejected the social worker s effort to shield the material on the grounds of a therapistpatient privilege , instead instructing the jury at the officer s trial in 1993 that there was no legal justification for withholding the records and that the jury was entitled to presume that the contents of the notes would be unfavorable to the defense the jury returned a verdict of 545 , 000 against officer redmond and the village in overturning that verdict and ordering a new trial last april , the appeals court said that the therapistpatient privilege it was recognizing was not absolute but should be balanced in every case against other interests , including the need for the evidence in this case , the court said , the balance of competing interests tips sharply in favor of the privilege if we hope to encourage law enforcement officers who are frequently forced to experience traumatic events by the very nature of their work to seek qualified professional help the court said the officer should be commended rather than penalized for displaying sufficient respect for human life to have been deeply upset by the incident in their appeal to the supreme court , jaffee v redmond , no 95266 , the relatives of the dead man are arguing that the appeals court created such a broad privilege that their ability to prove their case at the new trial would be impeded while the senate and house of representatives suspended normal operations today , the court directly across the street from the capitol was open for business as usual there were also these other actions today union lawsuits weighed the court agreed to decide whether labor unions can bring lawsuits on behalf of their members to seek back pay and lost benefits from employers who close plants without giving the 60day notice required by a 1988 federal law the law , the worker adjustment and retraining notification act , explicitly says that unions may seek damages on behalf of their members but the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit , in st louis , refused earlier this year to permit the united food and commercial workers union to proceed with such a lawsuit , saying that the union itself , as opposed to the individual workers , had not suffered an injury that could be redressed by a successful lawsuit for that reason , the appeals court said , the union did not have standing to bring the suit and the federal courts did not have jurisdiction to hear it the union had sued on behalf of 277 members who were discharged without the legally required notice by the brown group inc , which closed a shoe factory in dixon , mo , in 1992 in its appeal , united food workers v brown group , no 95340 , the union argued that the appeals court s ruling raises a fundamental and recurring separation of powers issue by refusing to enforce the law as congress wrote it no citadel ruling , for now the court refused to hear an appeal by south carolina s allmale military college , the citadel , of a ruling by a federal appeals court that the state also had to offer a military education to women while the justices made no comment on the case , jones v faulkner , no 95258 , the court most likely viewed the case as not yet ripe for review there has been no ruling yet by the lower federal courts on whether a military program for women that opened this fall at converse college in spartanburg , sc , is an adequate remedy for the citadel s exclusion of women , which the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit , in richmond , found earlier this year to violate the constitution s guarantee of equal protection federal district judge c weston houck is to hold a hearing on the adequacy of the women s program later this fall he has permitted nancy mellette , a young woman who wants to attend the citadel , to intervene in the case in place of shannon faulkner , whom the appeals court had ordered admitted to the citadel but who withdrew in her first week earlier this month , the supreme court agreed to decide whether the country s only other allmale , statesupported military college , the virginia military institute , must admit women or whether a program for women the state established at a nearby women s college is an adequate alternative christmas case rejected also without comment , the court refused to hear a constitutional challenge to a florida county s law barring the sale of alcohol on christmas the ordinance , in clay county , states that its purpose is to insure that no alcoholic beverages be sold during christmas day and christmas night of each year the ordinance was challenged by a group of liquor stores and nightclubs in the county in 1993 , when christmas fell on a saturday they argued unsuccessfully in the florida state courts that by singling out christmas as the one day when alcohol could not be sold , the county was endorsing christianity and violating the separation of church and state similar issues have come up in other states , with various outcomes in 1981 , the connecticut supreme court invalidated a state law that prohibited the sale of alcohol on good friday but in a 1992 decision , the federal appeals court in san francisco refused to strike down a hawaii law making good friday an official state holiday the case before the court today was silver rose entertainment v clay county , no 95327

fort lauderdale , fla , march 27 george steinbrenner swooped into the yankees' spring training complex here today sounding extremely edgy about voting to lock out major leaguers if the national labor relations board obtains an injunction that would prompt the players to scrap their strike it s not like i'm after a lockout , steinbrenner said sharply although the yankee owner did not make a definitive announcement , his hints of doubt were intriguing because only 8 of the 28 owners need to vote against a lockout to prevent one there is a growing feeling among some owners opposed to a lockout that there would be enough votes to block one , and steinbrenner is counted among those who would most likely vote against it more than one owner said the yankees , the mets , the orioles , the dodgers and the blue jays would be likely to resist a lockout one of the owners added san diego to that list and speculated that cleveland and colorado could also join the group if it came to a vote steinbrenner said he did not know if the owners would get the votes for a lockout and indicated he was as curious as anyone about how the other owners might react i have n't talked to many of them , he said i do n't know what would happen i'm not sure i'm for a lockout i have no idea how a vote would go i'm not predicting what the guys would vote one owner widely believed to be against a lockout , fred wilpon of the mets , declined to discuss his view today i have a view , and it s a very strong view , and i 've articulated that view very strongly within the walls of the meeting room , he said but i do n't think it s appropriate to express that view publicly right now when the vote is taken , i think it will be clear where we stand but the mets' position on using replacement players is no secret they dislike them intensely and they are almost certain to vote against a lockout if steinbrenner is indeed against a lockout , that would align the two new york teams with the dodgers , the blue jays and the orioles as the core of resistance the possibility of a lockout has been discussed since the players announced that they will return to work if the nlrb gains the injunction , which would force the clubs to restore salary arbitration and competitive bidding for free agents steinbrenner is trying to gain support for his feeling that a settlement can be reached if the sides stop posturing i'm not sure that i would vote for a lockout , he said i think the way to settle this whole dispute is through negotiation for whatever reason and for whoever s fault it is , the negotiations have not been productive and , to me , it s an embarrassment i'm embarrassed for the players and the owners when it was suggested to steinbrenner that allowing major leaguers back under the rules of 1994 would ruin what the owners had been trying to accomplish in negotiations , he disagreed not if we continue negotiating , steinbrenner said it would have to be with a nostrike clause and nolockout clause we 've got to get negotiating while steinbrenner was chatty about the elements of a lockout , he was quiet when asked about his decision to pay bigger salaries to the eight mostly nondescript minor leaguers who joined the replacement team today the yankees will mimic the dodgers in guaranteeing the four pitchers and four outfielders jobs for the season and paying them monthly minor league salaries of 3 , 000 at class a , 5 , 000 at class aa and 7 , 000 at class aaa if they spend 30 days at that level the average salaries for minor leaguers are about 1 , 200 at class a , 1 , 600 at class aa and 2 , 000 at class aaa presumably , the 10 minor leaguers who have been with the yankees since camp opened will also earn the higher salaries other teams are doing it , said general manager gene michael , who was unable or unwilling to attract more highly regarded minor leaguers we think this will improve the caliber of play among those who were induced to join the replacement team were pitcher mark carper and outfielder bubba carpenter , who were sent home feb 23 for refusing to be replacement players carpenter , a 26yearold with a 280 career batting average , hit 288 with 13 homers and 51 runs batted in for class aa albany last season the 26yearold carper , a righthander who was 86 with a 436 earned run average for class aaa columbus and could be the ace of the staff , has a career record of 2731 with a 399 era those two are the cream of a group that includes al drumheller , tom carter and john sutherland , none of whom has pitched above class aa , and outfielders shane spencer , richard barnwell and lew hill , who have combined for 112 atbats at the class aaa level there s no doubt the financial side comes into it , said carpenter , who made 2 , 100 a month last season and said his decision was endorsed by some major leaguers carper , who had once said he did not want the stress and burden of being branded a scab , conceded that when he was offered a salary of 7 , 000 a month , the financial considerations for his fiancee and 1yearold daughter altered his thinking i'm willing to take that chance now , carper said if major leaguers ca n't understand the difference between me making 2 , 400 a month as opposed to the money they 're offering me to take care of my family , that s their problem
chicago , oct 2 of all the investors who took their lumps as the usair group staggered through the 1990 s , none were more publicly embarrassed than warren e buffett and british airways plc the possible sale of usair would go only part way toward repairing the damage today , usair disclosed that it was in talks with ual and amr , the parent companies , respectively , of united airlines and american airlines for mr buffett , the billionaire chairman and chief executive of berkshire hathaway who is known for his astoundingly successful track record of investments , usair represented not just a huge loss but one that was hard to explain the 358 million in preferred usair shares that berkshire bought in 1989 was not berkshire s biggest investment , but it was a sizable bet in one of the types of industries that mr buffett had always said he would avoid those that had high capital costs and huge labor expenses mr buffett is a plainspeaking man but never one to dwell on negatives with successes like berkshire s investments in cocacola , gillette , capital cities abc , the washington post company , american express and wells fargo , not to mention the profits of numerous smaller concerns berkshire owns outright , he rarely needs to thus , wall street immediately read his pointed comment last december to analysts that the investment in usair reminds us of what not to do as a warning that his legendary patience was finally wearing thin in march , he announced that berkshire had written down the value of its investment to 895 million and that he and charles t munger , berkshire s vice chairman , would resign from their seats on usair s board berkshire should end up recouping all of that writedown if usair is sold it could also recoup lost dividends its preferred shares carry the right to 33 million in annual dividends , which usair stopped paying last year to conserve cash even before today s disclosure of takeover talks , there were signs that berkshire s writedown might have been more than needed while the usair series a preferred shares held by berkshire are not publicly traded , the series b preferred shares have climbed more than 40 percent since the writedown signs of usair s rebound had been a factor , albeit a small one , in driving berkshire s stock to a 52week high of more than 30 , 000 a share in september \( to keep things in perspective , berkshire became 400 million wealthier in a single day when the walt disney company agreed in august to buy capital cities abc \) berkshire s preferred shares are the equivalent of a 103 percent stake in usair , but it was not immediately clear whether they carry voting restrictions that might limit berkshire s influence over any sale mr buffett and other berkshire executives did not return calls seeking their comments british airways' investment was mostly a strategic bet that closer links with usair would help its business indeed , usair contributed an estimated 100 million to the british airline s revenue last year in terms of savings from shared operations and extra traffic from connections but those were costly gains considering that british airways was forced to announce in may that it would have to take a 200 million writedown to reflect the decline in value of the 246 percent stake it bought in usair in 1992 photo warren e buffet , the head of berkshire hathaway , one of usair sbiggest shareholders \( associated press \)

as a rule , joe mcilvaine prefers to avoid the city but yesterday he could not avoid it he had some appointments in manhattan and figured he would get everything done in one visit unknown to all but a handful of mets' officials , the general manager had added a stop to his itinerary david cone s east side apartment it was n't to be a social visit , not at 8 o'clock in the morning mcilvaine was visiting cone in a lastminute effort to snatch him away from the yankees and the baltimore orioles and lure him back to the mets mcilvaine , in fact , wound up meeting with cone at his apartment twice yesterday , for two hours in the morning , then for nearly two hours again in the afternoon at the second session , the mets' executive , this time accompanied by david howard , the team s vice president for business affairs , made cone an offer mcilvaine declined to say what the offer was , but it was believed to be three years for slightly less than 15 million cone s yankee contract guarantees him 195 million for three years , and the orioles offered just under 18 million for three it was wild , cone said last night it was a dramatic 11thhour attempt i was very tempted and i was very flattered we made him a very legitimate offer , mcilvaine said in a telephone interview i think we certainly made him think we gave him great pause we gave it our best shot it was n't a publicity thing when we sat down and analyzed it , we felt here was a guy who could take our good young pitching and bring it to the excellent level cone , reeling from the lastminute whirlwind of activity , said he gave serious consideration to the mets' offer actually , he said , i was more excited about it when the call first came the timing was incredible it was in between almost consummating the deal with the orioles and a dramatic call from george steinbrenner from a phone booth outside a hospital in tampa that s when joe mac called the mets' sudden leap into the scrap for the best pitcher on the freeagent market this winter was easily the most surprising development of the last 24 hours of the cone pursuit in the end , it was not surprising that he chose the yankees , nor would it have been if he had chosen the orioles but he would have shocked the baseball world and new york if he had returned to the mets , with whom he first established himself as a no 1 pitcher the mets' part in the denouement of cone s freeagent deliberations began wednesday afternoon when john franco , the mets' no 1 relief pitcher , who always is interested in the team s selfimprovement , called jay horwitz , the team s media relations director the club might find it worthwhile to call cone , franco suggested , because cone was undecided about what he wanted to do horwitz immediately told mcilvaine , who proceeded to discuss the possibility with howard and steve phillips , the new assistant general manager deciding they would contact cone and see where the talks led , they instructed horwitz to call cone at about 5 30 pm on wednesday , horwitz left a message with the pitcher s wife , lynn , to call joe mac joe mac \? she repeated incredulously cone called a minute later steve fehr , cone s agent , had called mcilvaine twice last month to determine if the mets had any interest in his client the first time mcilvaine did n't call back the second time he was in south america our thought process earlier , mcilvaine related yesterday , was our pitching was our strong point after we got the call , we sat down , discussed it and decided maybe this guy would be a good fit he could give our young pitchers someone to lean on , a leader , a role model we decided to come in as an 11thhour entry and see if we could get him after cone spoke with mcilvaine , he called fehr later they called fred wilpon , the mets' owner , at home to discuss the club s interest with him basically , wilpon told cone he was proud of him for his accomplishments in baseball and he was optimistic that the mets would be a very good team in the near future mcilvaine delivered his sales pitch in a oneonone meeting with cone at 8 am yesterday i talked about the opportunity he would have with a good young team , mcilvaine said , a team where he would be looked upon as the oracle of the pitching staff as far as starters go the younger guys could look up to him and learn from him i sold him on other facets of the organization he played here for six years so he knows what we had to offer his pitch was well received , mcilvaine said we thought we had a good chance of pulling it off , he added did cone indicate which way he was leaning , maybe even a little bit in the mets' direction \? david plays a pretty good poker hand , mcilvaine said i 'd hate to be across from him at the table but he was interested he has a fondness for the mets franco threw himself into the effort , too , calling cone on wednesday and yesterday as stunningly intriguing as the mets' attempt was , though , and as much as cone appreciated it and was flattered by it , in the end , he could n't choose the mets over the yankees asked if his decision , or at least his thinking , might have been different had the mets shown interest earlier , cone said , it s possible the complexion could have been much different but , he added , it s clear the mets would n't give a notrade provision in the third year of the contract and their offer was for three years the mets , the pitcher said , would have given him the right to veto a trade in the first year to eight clubs he designated and six in the second , but none in the third year so i was looking over my shoulder after two years to where was i going to be traded again , he said , alluding to the three times he had been traded in the last years of contracts about 24 hours after horwitz made the initial call , cone and fehr called mcilvaine they told us they appreciated what we had done , mcilvaine said we gave them a tremendous amount of thinking to do but unfortunately for us they decided to go with the yankees we wished them well and told them we appreciated them giving us the consideration what else could we say \? that was the choice he had to make
jerusalem , dec 22 prime minister shimon peres said today that israel would be prepared to close its nuclear program if there was a regional peace in the middle east , though he stopped short of confirming that israel possesses nuclear weapons mr peres made his comments at a lunch with israeli journalists in tel aviv , after one of them asked whether his new priorities include a change in nuclear policy yes , he said give me peace and we 'll give up the nuclear program that s the whole story mr peres used a word in hebrew , garin , that means nucleus , and in the context was a reference to israel s nuclear program at the dimona station in the negev , where israel has long been suspected of developing nuclear weapons if there will be a regional peace , i think we can make the middle east free of the nuclear threat , mr peres continued but when a reporter tried to pin him down on whether he meant that he would dismantle the dimona station , mr peres became evasive we 've never said dimona deals with what you attribute to it , he said what i'm saying is that after peace arrives , we 'll be in a middle east free of nuclear weapons the subject of nuclear weapons was broached by the reporters , not by mr peres , and it remained unclear whether he was presenting a new policy or talking generally of future options he also left unclear how broad a regional peace he had in mind before abandoning the nuclear option israel has negotiated peace treaties with egypt and jordan , and will begin new talks next week with syria , but none of these countries is known to have any nuclear capacity the only countries in the middle east that have demonstrated an interest in developing nuclear weapons are iraq and iran in 1981 israel bombed a reactor under construction in iraq , evidently to deny president saddam hussein any possibility of producing weapons at the lunch , mr peres reiterated israel s deep distrust of iran , noting that it was developing a nuclear capacity despite large reserves of oil and natural gas as power sources he had reportedly raised the issue with president clinton at their meeting in washington last week it is not a rich country , and it goes and invests hundreds of million of dollars in nuclear power , he said of iraq for what , if not for grave , horrible intentions \? although israel has never confirmed possession of a nuclear weapon , the united states and other governments have long suspected that this was the purpose of the dimona nuclear reactor that israel built with french help in the 1960 s mr peres was instrumental in building the plant this week , the israeli daily haaretz reported that a study by the rand corporation , commissioned by the pentagon , concluded that israel had enough plutonium to make 70 nuclear weapons israel has never agreed to sign the treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons mr peres noted that as long as its neighbors suspected that israel had a nuclear weapon , that in itself can act as a deterrent he added let them suspect i do n't see any reason to allay their suspicions
mcalester , okla , march 18 new york state s first execution in 32 years will , in a backhanded way , be carried out in this lonely plains town sunday at midnight thomas j grasso , who strangled an 87yearold woman in tulsa with her own christmas tree lights on christmas eve 1990 while stealing a cheap television set and 12 , will be strapped to a gurney and wheeled into a small room at the oklahoma state penitentiary when midnight strikes , executioners will begin the deadly flow of three chemicals into tubes in his arms although mr grasso is a symbol of the passionate debate that has been waged over the death penalty for 18 years in new york , his impending demise has stirred little interest here , where two large state prisons are major employers and the oklahoma prison rodeo is an annual summer event , pitting inmates from 12 institutions in riding bucking horses and wrestling down bulls the last executions here , of two murderers , were three years ago i do n't think people pay that much attention to what goes on out there , mayor dale covington said of the prison it s a good industry for the town because it employs a lot of people speaking of mr grasso and his punishment , the mayor continued he s requested it he said he wants to do it and does n't want to spend the rest of his life in prison i think his wishes should be carried out once before , mr grasso had been on the verge of execution , preparing to eat a hefty last meal but in what became a symbol of new york s stubborn opposition to the death penalty , there was an unwanted lastminute reprieve on oct 19 , 1993 , gov mario m cuomo won a federal court order sending mr grasso back to new york to first serve out a term of 20 years to life for the 1991 stabbing death of an elderly staten island man in a 1991 robbery the order , given within 12 hours of the scheduled execution , ended months of legal battles between states and governors with opposing views of the death penalty new york s highest court declared the state s death penalty law unconstitutional in 1977 for the next 18 years , the state legislature regularly passed new death penalty legislation each year , and democratic governors just as regularly vetoed it but the new republican governor , george e pataki , was elected after making restoration of the death penalty one of his central campaign promises indeed , he received the loudest burst of applause in his inauguration speech when he repeated the pledge one of his first acts in office , on jan 11 , was to work out an agreement with oklahoma and ship mr grasso there at a news conference on friday in new york city , mr pataki said there s no question it s the right thing to do he has acknowledged his guilt and he even has said the death penalty was appropriate asked if he had any second thoughts as the execution neared , he said , 'no , none at all but death penalty opponents vowed to renewed efforts to change the law i think it s clear that this is governor pataki s first execution , said damaris mcguire of new yorkers against the death penalty we did not expect there would be any executions in his first term this is the direct responsibility of governor pataki i would assume he would be having a few sleepless nights at their usedcar lot here , ron and betty testa reflected on the situation living in a prison town , people do n't pay too much attention or get too involved unless its a local case , said mrs testa , who said she favored the death penalty i think everyone wants to see justice served mr testa said he hated to see cuomo get defeated , but i think grasso is the reason he s no longer in office he continued there s more than enough people up there who want to see grasso executed i think cuomo was one of the nation s better leaders , besides being a good italian mrs testa added , he was just too liberal small protest vigils are expected on sunday night outside the prison , at the state capitol and the governor s mansion in oklahoma city for his part , mr grasso has been spending his final days since january in h unit , the death row that prison officials tout as a stateoftheart lockup no daylight penetrates concrete cells where the earth has been bulldozed up to the roof line h unit prisoners are let out of their cells for one hour each weekday in a concrete exercise area and for three 10minute showers a week mr grasso s lawyer , johnnie o'neal , told the tulsa world that mr grasso was ready for the execution his frame of mind is good , mr o'neal said he s contemplating a little more how he ended up there he s in good spirits and at peace he is as prepared for this as he can be at this time mr grasso has put in his order for a last meal consisting of two dozen steamed mussels two dozen steamed clams a burger king double cheeseburger with lettuce , tomato , onion , mustard and mayonnaise a 16ounce can of francoamerican spaghetti with meatballs in tomato sauce , to be served at room temperature half a dozen barbecued spare ribs , two large strawberry milkshakes , and a half a pumpkin pie , with whipped cream and diced strawberries this was somewhat more modest than his previous order for a last meal , which also included a roast cornish hen in sweetandsour sauce and another dozen mussels indeed , the menu sparked one of the few bursts of indignation here with the local newspaper , the newscapital and democrat , estimating the cost could run as high as 35 , declaring in an editorial no human being can eat at one sitting the amount of food grasso ordered photo

earnestly , urgently looking for workers , said a small red sign in chinese posted outside a garment factory in sunset park , brooklyn please inquire within the steel doors opened into a dim , dusty warehouse red and blue rags covered the four windows , shutting out all natural light bundles of cut cloth sat piled in haphazard mounds , some stacked taller than a worker under fluorescent lights swinging from chains , rows of middleaged chinese women hunched over sewing machines , squinting and silent a fashionable woman in her early 30 s rushed over with a clipboard what \? she snapped in cantonese , eyeing me from head to toe the sign says you are looking for workers she responded with a tirade in rapid chinese people said they wanted jobs , but really wanted only to steal her equipment bobbins , bobbin cases , thread it was hard to find people who wanted to work hard these days ! and without missing a beat , she asked do you know how to use a sewing machine \? before i could really answer , she cut me off it does n't matter , she said , hiring me on the spot as long as you are eager to learn and are willing to work , you will do well this is america hard work will be rewarded seven days later , after 84 hours of work , i got my reward , in the form of a promise that in three weeks i would be paid 5424 , or 65 cents an hour \( minimum wage is 425 \) i also walked away from the lintfilled factory with aching shoulders , a stiff back , a dry cough and a burning sore throat for years , going in and out of chinatown garment shops as a chinesespeaking reporter , i wondered what lay behind the tired eyes that met my gaze this time , i had gone to work beside these immigrants , to see what it is really like inside an underground industry that has been notorious in new york city for more than a century sweatshops have long seemed unknowable the owners are too secretive , the workers too scared the list of horrors is well known long hours , low wages , health hazards but is it really that bad \? are the owners so evil , the workers so victimized \? a week inside the chai feng sewing factory in sunset park suggests that something more complex is at work a miserable complicity born of necessity in an insular , immigrant world at chai feng , the woman with the clipboard the owner , maggie zheng is actually benevolent , albeit in a harsh way she does not pay minimum wage , but she serves her workers tea she makes them work until midnight , but she drives them home afterward she uses child laborers , but she fusses over them , combing their ponytails , admiring their painted fingernails , even hugging them and the workers seem to revere her they call her nu qiang ren , or strong woman , an expression that conveys affection and awe an immigrant and former factory worker herself , ms zheng , the sweatshop boss , is their model of success the workers not in the us to enjoy life that first morning , i walked three blocks from the n train s subway stop in sunset park to a brick warehouse that originally held a food processing plant now it is subdivided into eight garment shops , including chai feng chai feng is typical of the new , highly mobile shops that have cropped up outside the garment districts in midtown manhattan and chinatown many of these small shops open and close so quickly that they easily evade inspections by understaffed regulatory agencies ms zheng opened her shop a few months ago but she was really reopening an old shop under a new name in december , her brother , michael zheng , had closed the factory , then called superior fashions , and fled , owing his workers 80 , 000 in back wages his sister revived his business to make good on that debt , she later said it was easy to get the job ms zheng did not ask any questions not my social security number , my work history , my immigration status or even my name she also did not tell me how much i would be paid and no chinese worker would ask it would be considered shockingly blunt ms zheng showed me to station five , and gave me a stack of trimmings for practice on the brother exedra sewing machine it would be tough in the beginning , she said , but not once i became familiar with the machine then you can make multiples of 10 a day , she said i practiced controlling the foot pedal and sewing straight lines and even curves the hum of the sewing machines was numbing the only distraction came from the scratchy recordings of popular hong kong songs emanating from a cassette player and the cold was numbing , too sweatshop was definitely a misnomer the heater on the ceiling gurgled and gasped three other people started training that day two very young women did not bother to return after lunch cao wu yi , who had arrived from fujian only a month earlier , stuck it out , as zhang zhong zhu , her 5yearold son , played on the floor with toy airplanes almost all 30 workers at chai feng are fujianese , and from the same district in fujian as ms zheng they arrived in this country within the last seven years , some legally , and others illegally , helped by smugglers to whom they owe huge sums fujianese immigrants , because of their debts and their desperation , tend to work longer hours and endure more taxing conditions than cantonese immigrants the workers at chai feng later confided that they did not like their job , but they were grimly grateful just to have one they are not in this country to enjoy life but to make money , they said

the swarm of tired , delirious grown men in white pinstriped uniforms crowded around home plate after 15 unforgettable innings on what was already yesterday morning , jumping around like preschoolers , jawing like radio talkshow hosts and celebrating jim leyritz s arrival as if they had just won the lottery or something more significant after leyritz s tworun homer off tim belcher cleared the rightcenterfield fence at yankee stadium , causing jay buhner to hang his head and causing a few police officers to scurry after the souvenir , the yankees rumbled out of the dugout to welcome the teammate who had finally and mercifully propelled them to a 75 victory over the mariners and a commanding twogamestonone lead in their threeoffivegame division series with a mixture of excitement and relief , the yankees embraced leyritz and pranced around like rugby players in a scrum seconds later , after the yankees had escaped into the clubhouse , the bulk of the 57 , 126 spectators who miraculously stayed for the 312minute marathon turned the stadium into carnegie hall by emotionally crooning along with frank sinatra as his voice climaxed the unforgettable event with , new york , new york you need boosts like this to get you through , said pat kelly , who walked before leyritz s blast you go out and shellac a team 80 , it s just a hohum type thing but this pumps you up did you see that pileup behind home plate \? that s not just a victory that s something more than a victory that s something that s everlasting in your mind not just for the next game in seattle , but forever forever even while the attention shifted to jack mcdowell opposing randy johnson in game 3 tonight at the kingdome , the yankees realized they would remember game 2 forever there is so much to digest , so much to store away for a snowy night in january when they want to reflect on an evening in october when the baseball was pure , the fans were frenzied and the game would not end after awhile , said don mattingly , you just said , 'oh , man , what a game' how memorable was it \? this is the type of win that can get a team to the world series , said darryl strawberry it s the kind of game that makes you wish you were in the stands just watching it , said buck showalter , one of the four managers who has a 20 lead in a division series there were six homers , a handful of snazzy defensive plays , including one smothering stab and shovel from shortstop tony fernandez to second baseman randy velarde that was legendary , 470 pitches , 27 hits and hundreds of people who called in sick to work yesterday there was one owner who could not stop criticizing the umpires during the game and could not stop praising his resilient team after it there was one losing pitcher in belcher who was so perturbed after the loss that he wrestled a camera away from a cameraman and tossed it to the ground while hollering profanities there was even one fan who helped strengthen the comparison between leyritz s homer and chris chambliss s homer in 1976 that secured the american league pennant by sneaking onto the field and slapping leyritz s hand between second and third base chambliss had fans join him on the bases 19 years ago i just wanted to make sure i touched every base because i felt like i was floating , leyritz said , who has one hit in his last 27 times atbat and no homers since aug 6 it ranks up there with chambliss in '76 , said george steinbrenner and reggie s three homers and bucky dent in '78 there was so much emotion how many times can a team reach down and do it \? the yankees did it four times they trailed 10 , 21 , 43 and 54 ruben sierra and mattingly gave the yankees their first lead , 32 , with backtoback homers off andy benes in the sixth , an explosion that turned sticky because the fans were so elated by mattingly s shot that they littered the field with caps , helmets , cups , bottles , frisbees and even one grapefruit manager lou piniella pulled the mariners off the field for three minutes after seattle nicked andy pettitte for two runs in the seventh to eke ahead , 43 , paul o'neill slugged a homer off lefthander norm charlton in the bottom of the seventh it remained tied until the 12th inning when ken griffey jr rapped john wetteland s 31 fastball for his third homer in the series and a 54 lead wetteland , the closer who normally pitches one inning , was in his fourth i felt i could have gotten out of that , said wetteland , who called griffey fun but the yanks were not buried wade boggs walked against jeff nelson and piniella curiously summoned belcher , a starter , to replace nelson , and he walked bernie williams after o'neill popped out , sierra crushed a ball that looked like it might vanish for a threerun homer that is how left fielder alex diaz played it but the ball caromed off the fence for a runscoring double to tie it , 55 , bounced off diaz s leg and enabled him to recover in time to relay it home to nab williams and negate the sixth run we were on the top step of the dugout , halfway home to greet bernie , said david cone i think 25 guys turned around and looked at the crowd in disbelief to have to go back in the dugout and see the looks on the fans' faces jaws dropped , mouths wide open it was good and bad , but it was good it was good because mariano rivera , who replaced wetteland in the 12th , was great he retired the side in order in the 13th , struck out three straight in the 14th and , through a misty rain , wiggled out of a first and second jam in the 15th mariano rivera , said boggs , was unbelievable in the bottom of the 13th , leyritz had his first chance to end the game with mattingly on second and one out , but he swung over belcher s 20 slider and squibbed it to the mound he promptly stormed into the clubhouse where he pummeled two water coolers and broke two bats that guy is amazing , cone said after catching 13 innings and all the ups and downs , he grounds out and still has the energy to tear up the clubhouse leyritz , who started because pettitte prefers pitching to him , showed everyone something more in the 15th he has had an ongoing feud with randy johnson , who plunked him in the helmet earlier this year , and was also hit by jeff risley wednesday his majestic homer was impressive and so were the roughly 50 , 000 fans still in the stadium to witness it when the game officially ended at 1 22 am it s very emotional , said leyritz because it s the playoffs and because of things that have happened between us and them everybody told me new york is the best place to play when you 're winning , i can see that now photos going , going , going , gonzo yankees catcher jim leyritzwatching his gameending , 15thinning homer wednesday night \( pg 15 \) don mattingly heads toward home after being congratulated by the yankees' thirdbase coach willie randolph mattingly homered in the sixth \( pg b17 \) \( g paul burnett the new york times \)
roslyn , li the county pool at suburban christopher morley park is olympicsized , the same size jessica foschi s dreams were before she was accused of trying to achieve her athletic goals the dirty way , by beefing up her freestyle strokes with an obscure anabolic steroid from the black market the 15yearold foschi still does her practice laps here , splashing dutifully alongside her teammates some 30 hours each week , but suddenly this is the only pool where she is welcome somehow she has become famous before she has become a champion foschi is the leading lady in an olympicsized scandal not only over her failed drug test at the summer nationals in pasadena , calif , where she tested positive after her thirdplace finish in the 1 , 500meter freestyle , but also over the unusually light penalty a twoyear probation , rather than a twoyear suspension imposed by a united states swimming board of review her times from the nationals should n't exist anymore , but i'm skeptical about throwing her out for two years when this could have been a onetime thing , said one of the reviewboard members , jill sterkel i do n't think she knowingly took it sterkel , a fourtime olympian , advocated probation over suspension after foschi , her parents and her coach passed a polygraph test even so , united states swimming , the sport s national governing body , immediately renounced the penalty as inappropriate , and its board of directors will convene in december to reconsider the ruling made by its own review board in addition , carol zeleski , the president of united states swimming , said she was 95 percent sure that fina , the international governing body , will impose its own twoyear suspension the timing of the incident could hardly have been worse the united states has zealously endorsed the twoyear bans given to a slew of chinese swimmers who tested positive , and the united states federation plans to press fina for stricter antidoping legislation later this month in rio de janeiro foschi s test and penalty have proved an illtimed global embarrassment that robs united states swimming of the moral high ground the swimming community thinks the probation was a ridiculous decision , said john collins , who coaches a national champion , cristina teuscher , on his badger swim club in larchmont , ny distraught but unapologetic , foschi has been allowed by her father and her lawyer to make only one public statement on the subject i have never taken any steroid or any other banned or illegal drug , she said anyone who knows me knows i would never cheat , lie or do anything dishonest in or out of the pool her position is that she was framed whether by an enemy of the united states swimming program or a saboteur with a more personal axe to grind , the teenager ca n't say the consensus of the american swimming establishment , which counted foschi among the top eight contenders to secure an olympic berth in the 400 and 800meter freestyle at its team trials next march , is that she should receive the same twoyear ban that was imposed on seven chinese swimmers last year it does n't matter how it got into her system , our rules tell us she has to be suspended for two years , said john leonard , the executive director of the american swimming coaches association , who said that hundreds of coaches from all over the world had called him to protest foschi s probation if everybody who tests positive for steroids can get out of it by saying they did n't do it , then our whole sport s going to go down the tubes as far as that board of review decision goes , two members chickened out the board advocated probation in a 21 vote on nov 3 , with sterkel and bill stapleton , a lawyer and sports agent , supporting probation and gerry olsen , a former united states swimming vice president , voting to suspend foschi that same day , zaleski said the federation would appeal its own board s ruling as the conflict brewed , foschi kept quiet and kept swimming she will continue to do so , said her coach , dave ferris , until her legal options have been exhausted on nov 4 , just a day after the penalty was announced , foschi competed in her usual freestyle events , against usual adversaries like teuscher , in a meet at christopher morley amid stares , glares and incredulity from her rivals , none of whom confronted her but all of whom were shocked to see her back in her racing suit , foschi carried on as if she were not at the center of a developing controversy in the international swimming community i'm not on steroids , and i do n't know if she is , said teuscher , a new rochelle high school senior who is the 1994 and 1995 national champion in the 200meter freestyle i do n't know what would possess a 15yearold to take a drug that stunts your growth , gives you pimples and turns you into a raging crazy person i do n't think this decision to give her probation looks very good when chinese cheaters get banned but an american gets a slap on the wrist , it seems like we 're not proving the right point it s not like we 're trying to get drugs out of swimming , it s like we 're trying to get the chinese out though teuscher beat her in the 400 and 800 freestyle , foschi won a few races in her first meet since the scandal broke but she is no longer assured that her strokes will carry her to the 1996 or any olympic games her reputation is clearly endangered as is that of her frazzled coach , ferris , who postulated that her positive test was the work of a saboteur who spiked her jug of gatorade meanwhile , longtime admirers of foschi s swimming have started to wonder which is the real jessica foschi , the tenacious but wellmannered competitor or the alleged cheater she resides on an old brookville , li , estate , attends friends academy and has a father so supportive that he provided the engineering services required to winterize the christopher morley park swimming pool a lanky middledistance freestyler who was already 5 feet 10 inches when she turned 15 last month , foschi became ferris s star pupil at the long island aquatic club by winning three freestyle events at the junior national championships in 1994 and nearly defeating the veteran olympian janet evans in the 800 meters at the 1995 spring nationals at the summer nationals in pasadena , she finished a strong third in the 1 , 500meter freestyle on aug 4 , qualifying for the pan pacific games in atlanta the next week but she withdrew from them after learning on aug 9 that the steroid mesterolone had turned up in her urine specimen in tests for the 1 , 500 two weeks later , when she was tested again , no traces were found foschi s father , bob , has charged that her case has become a pawn of the political dockets of the powers of international swimming her lawyer , mark levinstein , who previously represented the sabotage victim nancy kerrigan , said that united states swimming has put its own political agenda ahead of the swimmer s legal rights , that keeping the chinese away from medals is more important to the federation than foschi s guilt or innocence she s going into a race and the pool is tilted , said levinstein , who maintains there is neither proof that foschi knowingly ingested steroids nor any ironclad rule that mandates her suspension and you thought tonya harding was prejudged everybody knew most of the skating establishment disliked her even before she did what she did but in this case they do n't even care about this girl she s irrelevant to them , which is almost worse they 're telling her , 'fina s just going to cut your legs off eventually anyway , so you might as well let us do it now' levinstein said well , this is not the end for jessica photo jessica foschi , the focus of a drug controversy , at a unitedstates swimming camp in colorado springs last month \( dave black \)
it was a chilly october night in 1984 , at the end of a twoyear recession and the start of a shakeout in boston s medical establishment , when a dozen or so women all health care professionals got together over a dinner of chicken and shop talk in brookline , mass the women , all in their 30 s , most of them married with children , had been meeting monthly for seven years during that time , they had navigated their way from middle management to senior positions at local hospitals and in state government and academia and for the most part , their conversations focused on the nitty gritty of health care administration nursing shortages , obstreperous physicians , salaries but that autumn evening , the group , which would come to call itself the a team , had a collective epiphany we realized that we had started low , and were now all among the senior management of our organizations , says elaine ullian , a founding member of the group , who recently took over as chief executive of boston university medical center hospital , a top teaching hospital we were all working for new ceo s we could be ceo s but none of us was in 1981 , not a single one of over 60 hospitals in the boston area \( except for one religious hospital \) was run by a woman and although the mid80 s saw a rapid turnover in the top jobs at massachusetts hospitals , no a team members had been considered for them there were three or four search firms that recruited for these jobs , ms ullian explains , and they did n't even know we existed the women decided this was n't for lack of qualifications , since several of them already had senior positions and felt their resumes matched those of men who got many top jobs , but for lack of contacts so the a team set out to be noticed over the course of a twohour meeting , the women discussed the wisdom of an allout push to help one another move up some women initially balked at appearing too aggressive , but in the end the group set a firm goal to establish at least three of its members in executive suites within a few years and they set out to do this with a sophistication rare among such networks in a methodical , highly planned drive , the a team worked the phones , brought in headhunters and local politicians , even held seminars on downtoearth matters like financial statements all this was knit tightly together with regular meetings , sometimes over chinese food , sometimes over breakfast , always with clarity of purpose a quick payoff the payoff was dramatic the a team , which has maintained a membership of 12 to 14 , far exceeded its original target , with nearly half its members clinching top positions by the late 1980 s in early 1987 , ms ullian got the first of two leadership posts she would hold in the coming decade when she became chief executive of boston s faulkner hospital in 1987 , marva serotkin became chief executive of lemuel shattuck , a state hospital and a year later , judith kurland became both chief executive of boston city hospital , a public hospital , and boston s commissioner of health and hospitals , a coveted job in which she won out over half a dozen established men a team members also took charge at several community hospitals of course , the network cannot be judged as if in a test tube sweeping changes were opening health care to a surge of new ideas and new faces , with massachusetts on the revolution s front lines , and affirmative action was very much in the air placed as they were in the top ranks of their organizations , many of these women may well have won promotions on their own but there s abundant evidence that the a team speeded them on their way the a team is remarkable not only for its longevity and its members' accomplishments , but for what it says about the selfimage of modern , professional women indeed , many in the group acknowledge that it took some time to come to terms with the extent and limits of their aspirations ms ullian , for one , said she was 22 and working in a clinic before she even realized a woman could be a doctor and although she had been on a fast track since the mid70 s , it never occurred to her that she might want to become a chief executive until she joined a consulting firm in the early 1980 s , advising the heads of some 35 hospitals on their strategic plans suddenly , she said , she realized that she could do the job her clients were doing and in many cases do it better some a team members were cautious at first i was n't quite sure how aggressive we were going to appear and whether it would work potentially against us , said sandra fenwick , who in 1984 had already won three promotions in her first five years at beth israel ms fenwick said male colleagues had cautioned her that aggressive women might be seen as having forced their way to the top , rather than rising on merit alone as it happens , ms fenwick turned down a chief executive offer in 1987 she calls it one of the most difficult decisions of her career because she had a 2yearold child and was pregnant
larry lucchino could never have imagined having trouble deciding which team to root for in a game between the pittsburgh steelers and the san diego chargers lucchino , after all , was a lifelong resident of pittsburgh before he went off to become a lawyer and later became involved in baseball but when the steelers and the chargers played two weeks ago to determine the american conference representative in today s super bowl , lucchino was in a quandary only weeks before , he had become president and minority owner of the san diego padres suddenly , he had reason to want the chargers to win , too whom did he root for \? i was in san diego and i was going to go back to pittsburgh , but i had the flu , lucchino related it was just what the doctor ordered i watched the game all by myself so no one knows who i was rooting for lucchino harbors no ambivalent feelings today his rooting interest , as he watches the game not from a sickbed but from a seat in the stadium , is clear yes , i absolutely think it will , lucchino said when asked if he thought the chargers' unexpected success would have a carryover effect for the padres it s a san diego effort to get a little respect the chargers finally are getting respect the city is getting respect we have a franchise that has n't been respected there s reason to hope that the new padres will bring some measure of respect , too lucchino , a former president of the baltimore orioles , obviously is into salvation projects he was part of a group interested in buying the pittsburgh pirates before he joined john moores , a computer software magnate , in the purchase of the padres from a group of owners who stripped the skin off a contender and left a skeleton of a team we 're talking about the new padres that s been our mantra since the sale and the trade , lucchino said , referring to the 12player trade with houston that brought them ken caminiti and steve finley i think people , at least locally , are taking a new look at the padres now they 're doing it in the context of sports excitement in the town , and the town is on fire i 've seen pittsburgh and washington excited about super bowls , but this is second to none and i think that enthusiasm will carry over our slogan is 'we want you back' it s easier to issue that invitation when there s sports excitement in the air there is the point of view , lucchino acknowledged , that says excitement by a team in one sport detracts from interest in a team in another sport but he said , referring to edward bennett williams , the orioles' late owner ed williams was a very strong advocate of the principle that the success of one sports team helps develop the interest in other sports teams in a town early on , i disagreed with that , but he testified in court on that i questioned him and he persuaded me it depends on the city , but in san diego , which has had trouble getting recognition as a good sports town , this should help the padres long have had a geography problem in trying to attract fans they never have been able to find any , for example , in the pacific ocean to the west and the desert to the east the new ownership is trying to generate interest south of the southernmost big city on the west coast previous padres efforts have failed to lure a significant number of fans from tijuana , but general manager randy smith said the new owners plan to pursue them more aggressively than before indeed , the first week of this month , moores , lucchino and the mayor of san diego held a news conference in tijuana with the mayor of tijuana we did our first ever press releases and press material in spanish , lucchino said i even said 'we want you back' in spanish but it s not just an effort in tijuana we 're reaching out to hispanic fans in the whole area it s not going to be easy we ca n't just issue some press releases in spanish and expect people to come issues on union agenda the players association s executive board will meet tuesday in washington with an intriguing array of items on the agenda the player representatives are n't expected to reach decisions on all of the issues , but their discussion will cover the union s signing boycott , the question of who among minor league players should report to spring training , the games striking players could play during the season under reebok s sponsorship and the status of managers , coaches and trainers as recipients of union membership and benefits signing boycott players have not signed major league contracts since the owners implemented the salary cap dec 23 , but as unified and solid as they have been throughout the strike , players traditionally grow nervous as spring training approaches and they do n't know where they will be playing in this instance , as long as they are on strike , it should n't matter where they will be playing , but most players would feel less insecure if they knew where they would be playing if they were playing restricted free agents especially will be affected if the boycott continues under the new system , they will have to remain with their old clubs if they do n't sign elsewhere by midnight feb 15
is there really such a creature as a born television actor , a performer who can wrest stardom from the small screen yet ca n't quite reach bigscreen success \? of course there is think of raymond burr as perry mason or andy griffith as matlock or look at lucille ball who , after a career of supporting roles in movies , became a television classic in i love lucy television is particularly hospitable to fine character actors carroll o'connor is now and forever archie bunker of all in the family candice bergen s middling film career is overshadowed by her triumph as murphy brown still , hollywood movies tend to be more seductive , especially for the young and beautiful , as superagents like michael ovitz negotiate ever more stupendous salaries for superstars the higher the nut , of course , the bigger the agent s purse still , it is possible that corporate capitalism , fixated on mass markets and bottom lines , could flatten the profession of acting , much as overpriced athletes have hobbled professional sports it s not as if the stars of top 10 television shows are underpaid those like roseanne and angela lansbury can make several hundred thousand dollars an episode , not to mention what they get in rerun residuals but there is always the lure of making many millions relatively fast , even for a single movie \( tom cruise gets about 12 million a picture \) that move , though , could turn out to be a career downer recent example david caruso leaving the hot abc series nypd blue to star in kiss of death , a shortlived flop lots of publicity , but paltry ticket sales there have been , to be sure , occasional crossovers that worked the leader of the pack is clint eastwood , who started out in 1959 in the series rawhide , moved on to spaghetti westerns and steadily progressed so that today he is , deservedly , one of the most acclaimed multiple talents in hollywood john travolta jumped from welcome back , kotter , which recently returned in reruns on nickelodeon , to a starring role in the 1977 blockbuster saturday night fever his career meandered along without much notice until last year , when pulp fiction got him an oscar nomination comics have a generally dicey transition record goldie hawn used laughin as a springboard for a substantial career in movies chevy chase left saturday night live to wind up in a string of film duds tim allen of home improvement struck boxoffice gold last year with the santa clause and jim carrey , a graduate of in living color , is balancing himself , promisingly , on hollywood s treacherous tightrope going in the other direction , there is one category of major actors openly receptive to television work women who do n't fit the sharon stone or julia roberts mold years ago , aging giants like bette davis , katharine hepburn and jessica tandy did n't hesitate to sign on for television movies younger stars followed glenn close , a recent tony award winner for sunset boulevard , added to her distinguished television credits this year with serving in silence and after dominating the recent miniseries buffalo girls , anjelica huston announced that she would do more television because hollywood roles for women of her age and caliber had almost disappeared but there remain the truly major television stars who just ca n't seem to establish a major career in the movies some emerge from shows that miraculously provide a speedo latex fit for performers the ensemble cast of the mary tyler moore show , for instance , was a seamless marvel , yet none of the performers , with the exception of ms moore in ordinary people , went on to hollywoood acclaim in cheers ted danson consistently proved a most engaging comic actor , and in magnum , pi tom selleck suffused a rather ordinary action role with distinctive charm but , despite several opportunities , neither actor has snatched the hollywood golden ring curiously , their best film appearances were made together , in three men and a baby part of the actors' predicament in televisionseries work , aside from becoming too closely identified with a single character , is the formulaic straitjacket that from week to week gives them little room to show what they can do this more constrained palette , as well as widely publicized money considerations , no doubt figured in mr caruso s decision to leave nypd blue after a single season american actors might look to their british counterparts for some careermanagement tips in england , there is considerably less pigeonholing and fretting over salary legends like laurence olivier , ralph richardson and john gielgud moved easily and frequently between theater , films and television peggy ashcroft gave viewers a powerful female equivalent of king lear in the miniseries a jewel in the crown and tonight at 8 on ae , ralph fiennes , a recent tony award winner for his hamlet on broadway , can be seen in a haunting bbc film called the cormorant mr fiennes , who is only in his early 30 s , has already scored impressively in american films like quiz show and schindler s list and , like jeremy irons , he has accumulated outstanding british television credits , including wuthering heights and a dangerous man lawrence after arabia in the cormorant , stunningly filmed in north wales , mr fiennes is mesmerizing as a writer who inherits a remote house and , the catch , a cormorant , an exotic sea bird associated with evil meanwhile , big hollywood films have become at least as formulaic as television bruce willis , who did some of his best work in the series moonlighting , now spends much of his time in the die hard flicks , reduced to a smirk surrounded by special effects mr willis will make his millions mr fiennes will end up with that rarer commodity called artistic

the nation s manufacturers , restless that weak demand is restricting production and profits , declared yesterday that the united states is capable of much greater economic growth , without a sharp increase in inflation , than the clinton administration , the federal reserve and wall street believe is possible the manufacturers' declaration , in a resolution adopted unanimously by more than 100 directors of the national association of manufacturers , is their bluntest , strongest statement on the issue it came just before a federal reserve meeting on tuesday to consider whether to lower interest rates to stimulate growth several fed officials have suggested in recent public statements that they are satisfied with current growth and will not act to reduce rates but a poll of more than 100 top executives of manufacturing companies who voted on the resolution at the association s semiannual board meeting in washington suggested that they want the fed to push down shortterm rates on tuesday by a quarter of a percentage point if you look at the last year or so , we have had intervals of high economic growth without inflation , said dana g mead , who is chairman of the association and also of tenneco inc we think that basically underscores the point that we should not be scared by the bugaboo of inflation mr mead said the manufacturers association , which represents 15 , 000 companies , would try to push the 1996 presidential candidates to endorse faster growth the issue is this does the economy have the capacity enough factories and skilled workers to expand output by more than a 25 percent annual rate without eventually running short of enough goods and services to satisfy the demand \? shortages would result in inflation , as consumers competed for scarce products the federal reserve and wall street s traders say that 25 percent is the upper limit none of the republican frontrunners in the campaign have challenged this view neither has the administration s economists laura d'andrea tyson , assistant to president clinton for economic policy , repeated the administration view in a speech to the manufacturers yesterday even the manufacturers had been vague while they have pushed for months for policies that would stimulate growth , they had previously declined to set a specific target yesterday they did so producing a number that made their lobbying effort far more specific we now believe a target range of 3 percent to 35 percent annual gdp growth is both realistic and appropriate , the manufacturers said in their resolution , referring to gross domestic product , the standard measure of economic growth a statistic that adds all of the wealth generated in the economy each year regarding the election campaign , mr mead said we intend to ask each political candidate where he stands on this issue specifically do you believe economic growth greater than 25 percent is possible , and if so , how would you get there \? the economy grew at an annual rate of only 11 percent in the second quarter and 27 percent in the first , after reaching 4 percent or more through most of last year the sharp decline in growth , and with it demand for manufactured products , clearly played a role in the manufacturers' advice to the federal reserve the common assumption that the economy cannot exceed annual growth rates of 25 percent without risking a resurgence of inflation does not reflect changed economic realities , the resolution said the nation s inflation rate has remained at 3 percent or less for the last year the manufacturers insist that they have become far more efficient and productive in recent years than either the federal reserve or the administration acknowledge mr mead , for example , says that tenneco s paper operations can now make paper at greater rates of production than government statistics acknowledge but if there is not the demand for the paper , then the alternative is to hold back on production , laying workers off in the process by increasing economic growth to at least 3 percent , we would significantly reduce the downsizing that is going on , said jerry jasinowski , president of the manufacturers association you wo n't eliminate it , but you would reduce it the manufacturers , in their resolution , also favored a balanced budget by the year 2002 , but acknowledged that this downsizing of government could in the near term dampen economic growth with lower government spending , the task of stimulating economic growth falls heavily on the federal reserve
hollywood at sony pictures entertainment the mood is so bleak these days that executives , over the holiday season , were exchanging graveyard jokes the latest one what s the difference between sony and the titanic \? the titanic had entertainment it was not quite that grim elsewhere in hollywood , but neither was there much holiday cheer the sony corporation s staggering 27 billion writeoff on sony pictures entertainment which includes columbia and tristar shocked hollywood for two reasons when sony announced the news late last year not only did it baldly underscore the fact that the senior tier of executives at the studios in culver city , calif , had crashlanded , but it also showed that the industry is as wildly expensive as it is unpredictable the sony move was a chilling reminder that spending millions of dollars overpaying executives all over town which is the rule guarantees neither competence nor taste for the moment , the hopeful signs seem hazy a new studio , owned by three power players , steven spielberg , david geffen and jeffrey katzenberg , was announced to fanfare but the three are not so much focusing on movies as on television the dream team , as it is known , and capital cities abc inc agreed in late november to form a tv production company in which the troika and abc would share advertising income and other revenue such a step by a network is unprecedented the team will probably start producing only a few films a year , but its overall direction remains vague and , for that matter , the direction of some of the more established studios also seems vague at universal , another japaneseowned studio , the situation is brighter than sony s but hardly lustrous a new extravaganza now in production in hawaii , waterworld , starring kevin costner , has reached spending levels reported to range anywhere from a record 120 million to 150 million it is probably the most expensive film ever made even longtime hollywood executives and producers who remember other films with swollen budgets are astonished that universal has allowed the project to balloon unless the film turns into a jurassic park , its prospects of turning a profit are improbable at the same time , the senior executives of mca universal , lew r wasserman and sidney sheinberg , are in a nonetooprivate war with its owner , matsushita electric industrial the two may leave mca universal next year twentieth century fox , after a strong summer with one of the year s biggest hits , speed , smashed into a wall with three duds miracle on 34th street , the pagemaster and trapped in paradise the walt disney company has hits in the santa clause and the rerelease of the lion king but the studio s schedule after that has slim pickings which has been the case with disney in recent years \( with the exception of animated films , disney s record has been tepid \) paramount , with two big hits , forrest gump and clear and present danger , was relatively successful but warner brothers , traditionally the most solid and formidable studio , endured bigbudget disappointments like wyatt earp and love affair disclosure , released for the holidays , failed to live up to expectations the studio s interview with a vampire is a qualified success , given the costs of the film and its top actors , especially tom cruise , who is paid 12 million to 15 million and receives a chunk of the film s gross to hollywood executives and producers , there were no messages or signs in 1994 except turmoil profit margins narrowed , movie costs rose to an average of 30 million and despite all the lip service about wanting to produce good movies , the industry struggled , by the end of the year , to come up with five films that could actually qualify as the best movie of the year for the academy awards
san francisco lew goldhammer blanched and stammered at the papers spread before him in the conference room at brouwer janachowski , an investment advisory firm where the 55yearold architect had come for help with his muddled finances it was clear from his body language that mr goldhammer would rather be anyplace but here , facing a spreadsheet titled family financial independence calculation , a list of recommended mutual funds and a packet of forms for closing and opening an ira and other accounts mr goldhammer could not find the place on the spreadsheet that showed which year he would run out of money as he moved from working life into retirement he had no idea how to read the 1 , 3 and 5year results of the mutual funds and he was daunted by the task of filling out trusteetotrustee transfer forms for his retirement accounts i'm intelligent , cultured and welleducated , mr goldhammer said , but i do n't have a head for this kind of stuff as soon as one of these investment people begins talking about dividends , payoffs , deferrals , pretax dollars i get lost i hear it , but i do n't remember it 10 minutes later kurt brouwer , president of the investment advisory firm , was having none of it for years , ever since mr goldhammer had renovated the firm s office here , mr brouwer has been urging the architect to make some sense of his mishmash of investments and learn to manage his affairs with an eye toward retirement the notion that mr goldhammer has no head for finance is a disempowering belief , mr brouwer said , and that gives the architect an excuse for not gathering the information he needs deal with it you 've got to deal with it , mr brouwer said , as mr goldhammer picked through the documents , having at long last accepted the challenge to get his house in order , with brouwer janachowski s free advice it s just a new language , mr brouwer said , more gently now you spend more time drafting plans for your clients than thinking about this stuff it s great to take care of your clients but this is your life mr goldhammer s predicament is a common one he has modest sums to invest , no financial expertise and no interest in acquiring any so he has turned for advice to friends , relatives , strangers on the next bar stool , brokers met socially and others the result was a portfolio of dribs and drabs , fads and fancies mr goldhammer , who has a working wife and two grown children , had only the foggiest idea what investments he held , no clear memory of why he had bought them , no clue whether they could be liquidated and at what cost , and no plan for the future indeed , loss is about the only pattern in mr goldhammer s investment history several years ago , mr goldhammer and his wife , ruth , refinanced a twounit rental property they own to free 50 , 000 for a deal with a business associate the associate went bankrupt the couple lost the 50 , 000 they had even worse luck in the stock market listening to friends , relatives and brokers he chanced to meet , mr goldhammer lost money on insurance stock that i rode all the way down , on eastern airlines somethingorother and on some company where this guy knew the owner in oakland who made surgical laser devices frustrated over his missteps , mr goldhammer gave 40 , 000 to an investment adviser he had all those charts , graphs , projections , mr goldhammer said but he did a lousy job everything went down and he charged me a percentage mr brouwer can easily explain all these losses he was doing it hit and miss , he said somebody 'd call , and he 'd say , 'hey , that sounds all right' the solution \? for mr brouwer , it is a financial makeover that is as systematic as mr goldhammer has been unsystematic the first step an inventory of income and assets mr goldhammer draws a salary of between 50 , 000 and 100 , 000 from his small architectural firm his wife earns 60 , 000 as a school administrator in a nearby county the goldhammers recently bought a 340 , 000 house , which they had rented for many years their other real estate asset , the rental property , is worth 325 , 000 , with 200 , 000 owed on the mortgage as for their investments , mr goldhammer took most of it to merrill lynch after his earlier missteps the broker advised mr goldhammer to take a rollover ira from a previous employer and buy a variable annuity , a popular investment that has mutual fundlike choices that investment is now worth 120 , 000 also following the broker s suggestion , the couple put 21 , 800 in other ira money into zerocoupon bonds , which pay all their dividends at maturity 14 , 300 in the merrill lynch basic value stock fund , and 16 , 000 in a merrill lynch cash management account finally , mrs goldhammer had 55 , 000 in a retirement account similar to a 401 \( k \) plan mr brouwer looked at this inventory , including the merrill lynch revisions , and pronounced the portfolio still a jumble so , along with richard m goldstein , the chief financial officer at brouwer janachowski , mr brouwer sat mr goldhammer down for the second part of the makeover determining when he and his wife wanted to retire and how much income they needed the advisers assumed a 100 , 000 income and a portfolio of 70 percent stocks and 30 percent bonds under that plan , the couple would run out of money when mr goldhammer was 77 and his wife 73 the advisers crunched the numbers again , this time with an allstock portfolio and a 90 , 000 income that bought the goldhammers five more years of solvency with that plan in place , it was time for step three analyzing investments mr brouwer asked mr goldhammer to investigate if his wife had any flexibility in her retirement account could she alter her portfolio to include more stocks \? or withdraw the money and manage it herself \? these were questions the couple had never asked , concepts they did not know the adviser also wondered if the goldhammers should sell the rental property to free up more cash , but concluded they had only modest equity in the property , were earning a decent rental income from it and would be taxed heavily for its sale similarly , mr goldhammer will keep the zerocoupon bonds , on mr brouwer s suggestion , because they return a good rate and mature in less than two years but for the biggest chunk of mr goldhammer s money the 120 , 000 annuity the word is sell although the pros and cons of exiting from annuities can be complex , to put ira money into them offers a pointless double tax deferment , mr brouwer said and , given the annuity s limited investment choices , the money would grow more quickly elsewhere mr goldhammer will sell his shares in the merrill lynch stock fund , too , in favor of more aggressive investments in noload mutual funds to replace what he sells , mr brouwer proposed five mutual funds and allocated the couple s assets to them according to their risk tolerance and retirement plans they are pimco low duration , a shortterm bond fund , 30 percent fidelity disciplined equity , a stock growth fund , 25 percent strong opportunity , a smallcompany fund , 25 percent , and 10 percent each in two international funds , tweedy browne global value and warburg pincus international but mr brouwer did not dictate the selections rather , he sent mr goldhammer home to study the funds , in the expectation that such choices would soon be his mr goldhammer paled at the very idea his eyeballs rolled at the list of indexes mr brouwer offered that would help him analyze the funds his heart beat at the suggestion he read each prospectus now mr brouwer turned parental , verbally shaking his finger at the quailing man across the table this is your money , he said you have to invest time before you invest it no more of this throwing it against the wall and hoping it sticks if you were going to put 10 , 000 into a car , you 'd look at the blue book , would n't you \? there s no excuse for not knowing you ca n't just say i do n't understand that s tough noogies photo lew goldhammer , left , an architect in san francisco , and his adviser , kurt brouwer chart tidying a tangled portfolio shows lew goldhammer s portfolio after it was overhauled by kurt brouwer
storrs , conn , jan 16 no 1 learned something today no 1 is no longer no 1 in a gritty , physical , often frenzied game this afternoon before a national television audience , unbeaten connecticut soundly beat previously unbeaten tennessee , 7766 when the weekly polls of writers and broadcasters \( associated press \) and coaches \( usa today cnn \) come out tuesday night , uconn is sure to move up from no 2 to no 1 tennessee will not disappear , and a rematch could come in april in the national collegiate athletic association championships because no 1 is nice but a national championship is better , coach geno auriemma of connecticut had warned his players for a week not to get too excited about this game and before the game , his players did say it was more or less just another game but they played it as if there would never be another game anybody who did n't like this game , auriemma said afterward , does n't like basketball when the final buzzer sounded , jamelle elliott , uconn s outstanding power forward , threw the ball halfway up to the roof the uconn bench emptied , and in seconds there was one happy pile of players on the floor the crowd was so excited that it would not leave , and almost a halfhour after the game ended , the uconn players returned to acknowledge their supporters tennessee went into the game with a 160 record uconn was 120 tennessee has won three national championships and had been ranked no 1 since the preseason its coach , pat summitt , is probably the best in the game but this game was in uconn country , in compact gampel pavilion , where uconn has now won 28 consecutive games , where the noise bounced back so fiercely today that one uconn player , rebecca lobo , said she could not hear another , elliott , shouting to her on the floor from 5 feet away the game was an advance sellout of 8 , 241 there were reports of 4 and 8 tickets being scalped for 75 this was a big game for a college that also has an unbeaten men s basketball team , ranked second in the nation , but which has won national championships only in men s soccer and women s field hockey and which has never been ranked no 1 in a national poll in any sport the coaches were dressed for the occasion , auriemma in a connecticut blue suit , summitt in a tennessee orange suit at the start , orange looked better than blue in the first 65 seconds of the game , latina davis stole the ball and dribbled downcourt to score and allamerica nikki mccray sank a 15foot jumper so tennessee led , 40 , but uconn soon ripped off 10 straight points for a 156 lead tennessee never got closer than 4 points in the first half and 5 points in the second tennessee s intimidating strength inside and its fluid perimeter play were negated it was not elegant basketball , but it was certainly good basketball on offense , uconn s 6foot7inch sophomore center , kara wolters , did heavy damage on turnaround shots , on defense , under the boards , wolters , lobo \( 64 \) and elliott \( 60 \) neutralized tennessee s unrelated johnsons tiffani \( 64 \) , dana \( 62 \) and michelle \( 60 \) wolters blocked five shots , lobo five , tennessee none they pressured us , dana johnson said , and we did n't take care of the ball i think that was our biggest fault with 4 minutes 52 seconds left in the game , lobo , an allamerica post player , fouled out her 13 points and 8 rebounds were below her average , but worthy considering she played with a broken right little finger taped to the next finger you can write nice things and say i played in pain , she said but it did n't hurt the biggest player in the game was the smallest 54 jennifer rizzotti , uconn s point guard she was a gnat as she made five steals , on three of them dribbling more than half the length of the court to score she hit a 22foot , 3point shot early in the game and a 20footer late her 17 points were second highest in the game to the 18 by wolters i think she s the best point guard in the country , auriemma said the biggest player for tennessee this season has been mccray , who is quick , fast and instinctive but she was harassed constantly and her 10 points and 7 rebounds were overshadowed because she made 8 of tennessee s 25 turnovers and shot just 2 for 10 i tried to deny her the ball , elliott said when she got it , she did n't try to dribble past me , thank god next for uconn is boston college wednesday night , from the sublime to the lastplace team in the big east \( 410 over all , 15 in the conference \) how does uconn get up for that game \? we have to , lobo said today was not the national championship photo uconn s rebecca lobo , left , cheering after huskies' victory kara wolters is behind lobo , and jennifer rizzotti is to the right \( associated press \)
washington , dec 21 bad communications and a balky chain of command were to blame for the frustrating wait for firefighting c130 tanker planes that came too late to do much good in battling a major brush fire on long island last summer , a report from the secretary of agriculture to senator alfonse m d'amato said today the struggle to contain the fire , which scorched 12 square miles of suffolk county pine barrens , was compounded by the expectation among firefighters and government officials that the big waterbombing c130 s were on their way gov george e pataki had requested the planes through the united states department of agriculture , and department officials had promised that they would be sent but none of the boxy , fourengined cargo carriers was available at the peak of the fire , the agriculture secretary , dan glickman , reported moreover , federal officials had concluded that it was not appropriate to use the planes against the long island blaze generally , such planes are used only to fight fires in the west but somehow , federal officials never notified the local authorities that the tankers were not coming , mr glickman said two c130 s were finally brought in to wet the charred ground on aug 26 , after the fire had been effectively suppressed but the confusion surrounding the planes during the peak of the battle , when a wall of flames menaced the south shore towns of westhampton and speonk , irritated governor pataki and senator d'amato , who requested the report on the muddle from mr glickman mr glickman said the firefighting operation was clearly a success , but he conceded , that it failed in this case to keep the public , meaning nearly everyone outside the system , adequately informed cannot be seriously disputed mr d'amato said he was satisfied that the matter had been laid to rest the secretary has thoroughly reviewed this incident and has assured me that measures to combat this problem have already been implemented
washington , april 19 the supreme court today took up perhaps the most basic affirmativeaction issue in a democracy whether election districts can be drawn according to the race of the people who live in them at issue were two congressional districts one in louisiana and the other in georgia specifically created to contain majorities of black voters , with the aim of helping to elect more blacks to congress in arguments that at their philosophical base mirror the widespread debates over racial preferences in employment or college admissions , lawyers for the plaintiffs asserted that districts drawn to insure that black voters are a majority violated their clients' rights under the 14th amendment s equal protection clause they argued that the government must treat citizens as individuals , not as simply components of a racial or sexual class but civil rights groups , state officials from louisiana and georgia and the clinton administration argued that without such districts black representation would be minuscule , especially in the south they have also asserted that the supreme court has in the past allowed the use of race as a factor in drawing electoral districts so long as it is not done for the sole purpose of segregating voters since 1990 , 14 states have adopted redistricting plans that doubled the number of districts with black and hispanic majorities from 26 to 52 before states were compelled by the voting rights act to construct such districts , no southern state had sent a black to congress since 1901 eric schnapper , a law professor who was formerly a staff lawyer for the naacp legal defense and education fund , said that if the court ruled that race could not be used in redistricting , the congressional black caucus will be able to meet in the back of a taxi cab the two cases argued today were the first to be brought to the court since it ruled in 1993 that the constitutionality of such districts could be challenged in a 5to4 ruling in that case , known as shaw v reno , justice sandra day o'connor wrote that a bizarrely drawn district in north carolina was so irrational on its face that it can be understood only as an effort to segregate voters into separate voting districts basing their rulings on the shaw decision , district courts in georgia and louisiana upheld challenges to the constitutionality of blackmajority districts in their states in a twohearing hearing today , the nine justices peppered lawyers from both sides with questions , including whether race could ever be eliminated in the drawing of districts and to what extent the creation of blackmajority districts contributes to racially polarized voting do you draw these districts in order to perpetuate that practice or in order to eliminate it \? justice anthony m kennedy asked justice david h souter said , you ca n't draw districts without taking race into consideration the arguments focused on a host of questions including the following did the challengers to the districts actually suffer harm from their creation \? what role did the justice department play in fashioning the districts \? was the construction of blackmajority districts any more insidious than creating districts with other ethnic majorities \? much of the questioning by the justices centered on this last point justices stevens , souter and stephen g breyer all questioned whether blackmajority districts were being singled out for constitutional challenges justice breyer asked whether it was all right to draw districts for italians , catholics or protestants but not for blacks if that is the case , justice stevens said , blacks would be the only group that would not get the benefit of having their group interest treated as a group interest drew s days 3d , the united states solicitor general , said , if louisiana decided to draw a district for creoles , that would not trigger a constitutional challenge mr days entered the case because the districts were created in response to the federal voting rights act mr warren , the lawyer representing the original plaintiffs in the louisiana case , argued that while the courts said race could help to define the boundaries of communities , the problem is when race takes over and the decisions are all based on racial stereotyping he added that the impetus to create blackmajority districts stemmed from what he termed a stereotypic view that blacks will vote only for blacks and whites will vote only for whites justices ruth bader ginsburg , souter and o'connor , the author of the shaw decision , questioned the plaintiffs' lawyers about whether their clients had actually suffered harm because of blackmajority districts and therefore had legal standing to sue in the louisiana case , none of the four plaintiffs lived in the district they were challenging justices souter and ginsburg noted that if they were allowed legal standing , then anyone in a state where the legislature drew a district to contain a majority of racial or ethnic minorities could challenge that district justice ginsburg also noted that the four louisiana voters who questioned the legality of the blackmajority district included two whites , a black and an asianamerican i do n't see how you get racial discrimination by an exclusion that equally affects a black and a white , she said photos representative cleo fields , left , democrat of louisiana , and representative cynthia a mckinney , democrat of georgia , after a supreme court hearing on challenges to the way their districts were drawn the two lawmakers were first elected to congress in 1992 in districts created with black majorities \( photographs by associated press \)
philadelphia , dec 10 it s called load left , and dallas guard nate newton calls it the cowboys' breadandbutter play the team s massive offensive line grinds the opposing defense into a pulp and running back emmitt smith runs over the residue we know it s coming they know it s coming , newton said the whole world knows it s coming call it arrogance call it supreme confidence whatever it was it compelled dallas coach barry switzer not to punt the football on a fourthand1 at the cowboys' 29yard line with two minutes to play and the score tied at 1717 he called load left not once but twice ! the eagles knew it was coming and they stuffed it not once but twice three plays later , with 1 minute 30 seconds to play , eagles kicker gary anderson hit a 42yard field goal to give philadelphia \( 95 \) a 2017 victory it surprised us , eagles coach ray rhodes said but when you 've been on top as long as they 've been on top , you take your chances but i do n't think you 'll see that again the loss was the second in a row for the cowboys \( 104 \) , sent the preordained super bowl contenders into a tailspin and muddled the playoff picture in the national football conference a dallas victory would have given them the nfc east championship and put them two victories away from gaining the homefield advantage in the playoffs now philadelphia is only a game behind the cowboys in the race for the division title and san francisco has the edge over them in the battle for the homefield edge the cowboys did clinch a playoff spot after today s results were all in , but consider that they were 81 a few weeks ago and had a twogame lead in the nfc leading up to a showdown with san francisco , which was 54 at the time the cowboys lost to the 49ers and have lost twice more in the division since then the wheels on the cowboys' super bowl express have started to wobble the cowboys' owner , jerry jones , who has spent 42 million in bonuses on his players this season , still considers anything short of a super bowl victory unacceptable after surrendering a 173 lead to the eagles this afternoon , even jones can sense some doubts creeping in we 've got some of the same things that every team asks itself when it s lost a couple of ball games , jones said we 've got to get it back together and play well if we get to the playoffs , we 'll do it by playing well when we get in we 'll see what we can do jones , who agreed with switzer s decision to twice go for it on fourthand1 , was asked whether he will consider dismissing switzer if the cowboys fail to reach the super bowl there wo n't be any coaching changes , jones said he 'll be back next year definitely switzer s call , which he had an opportunity to reconsider when the first play was nullified because it did n't get off before the twominute warning , was questionable mainly because of how little time was remaining and how deep the cowboys were in their territory none of the cowboy players disagreed with the call , but it raised some eyebrows in the eagles' locker room that s the sign of a team that has a lot of confidence in their players , rhodes said i think i would have punted in that situation switzer said he decided against punting because of the swirling wind on this frigid day \( 13 degrees at game time \) cowboys punter john jett averaged 395 yards on six punts , including one that traveled just 23 yards early in the fourth quarter if we kick it into the wind , they 're going to come back and kick a field goal , switzer said we just needed to do something with the ball he added that was n't the difference the way we played for 30 minutes of the second half was the difference switzer was right about that the eagles completely shut down the cowboys' big three smith , quarterback troy aikman and receiver michael irvin in the second half , smith was held to 10 yards on 9 carries and had a crucial fumble near the goal line when the cowboys had an opportunity to go ahead by 2414 early in the fourth quarter aikman completed just 9 of 22 passes for 45 yards in the half and exited the field screaming at his teammates when his final attempt was stripped from his hands by defensive end william fuller and irvin , frustrated by double coverage and blanketed by the 6foot3inch rookie cornerback bobby taylor , made his only catch of the second half on the cowboys' final drive the eagles made a key defensive adjustment at halftime by bringing a linebacker closer to the line of scrimmage to stop smith , who had 98 yards rushing in the first half the eagles' offense , which had maneuvered into position for a 27yard field goal near the end of the half to cut the deficit to 176 , came out in the second half fired up in the third quarter , philadelphia put together an 11play , 46yard drive that was capped by a 1yard touchdown run by ricky watters the eagles got the 2point conversion on a pass from quarterback rodney peete to fred barnett that narrowed the score to 1714 and anderson tied it with a 38yard field goal with 3 minutes to play in the game that set up switzer s decision on fourthand1 i was a little surprised by that , said eagles defensive tackle andy harmon , who tackled smith for no gain the second time but when they lined up in the same blocking scheme the second time , i knew it was coming again and i knew where i had to be to stop it photo eagles tackle andy harmon celebrating after stopping cowboys'emmitt smith for no gain on a fourthdown play with two minutes left and the score 1717 it was smith s second straight failed attempt at a first down \( associated press \)
when att finally overcame the resistance of the ncr corporation in 1991 and paid 74 billion for what was the nation s fifthlargest computer company , att s chairman , robert e allen , proclaimed a new era in which att would make global computer networks as easy to use and accessible as the telephone network is today that vision of a convergence of computers and telecommunications is held even more widely today , as businesses and consumers move to the internet in search of the next generation of business technology but att s stewardship of ncr , which it renamed att global information solutions , had done little , if anything , to advance that revolution , and att is now quitting that particular struggle after years of losses , the new management of the division has decided its only hope of survival is to abandon the personal computer business , narrow its focus and return to its roots , providing hardware and software to retailers , financial services and communications companies yesterday , att said the troubled unit would again become an independent entity , one of three to be formed by the breakup of att and to begin realigning the company , att said 8 , 500 of its 304 , 500 workers would be terminated , including 1 , 000 at its dayton , ohio , headquarters att thought they could throw their muscle around to make ncr what it was n't , said jon oltsik , an analyst at forrester research in cambridge , mass they tried to diversify into everything , but they did n't have a plan att will take a 15 billion charge against earnings in the current quarter to account for the revamping not including ncr s 74 billion purchase price , the writedown makes a total of more than 2 billion in ncrrelated charges since 1991 the division lost 332 million in the first half of this year lars nyberg , the executive who arrived in june to turn around the troubled computer unit , said the cuts would allow the division to break even in 1996 , just before it is expected to be spun off in early 1997 this company has not done what other companies have done in this industry , he said yesterday it has not reduced expenses as gross margins have declined strong medicine is not new to ncr , which began life in 1882 as the national cash register company in dayton , ohio , where it is still based in the early 1970 s , the company almost went under when its managers failed to recognize the growing importance of computers after threequarters of its workers were laid off , the company fought its way back to profitability and became a leader in automatic teller machines and highend computers after cutting expenses , mr nyberg said , he plans to increase revenue by focusing on the unit s strengths , rather than making pc s , where the competition from lowercost manufacturers was too formidable he pointed to opportunities in the banking industry , where the pace of technical change is gathering momentum he said that he also planned to exploit the company s lead in the area called data warehousing , in which retailers and other companies plumb huge data bases containing information about their customers to tailor marketing campaigns because of the expense of the powerful systems needed for such jobs , data warehousing has been available only to large players like walmart but next week , mr nyberg said , he would introduce a line of machines to make the practice affordable for mediumsized and even small companies it was a niche business , but it wo n't be a niche business anymore , he said the computer operation would enter the world as the smallest and weakest of the three new att companies it had 84 billion in revenue last year , and after the revamping it would be smaller , mr nyberg acknowledged most analysts believe that it will face an uphill fight outside of their traditional banking and retail areas , they have lots of things going but none of them are leaders in their areas , said david moschella , an analyst at international data group in boston they still ca n't make up their mind whether they are a product company or a service company that s a tough position to be in photo a liberty , sc , plant is one of the operations that att global information solutions will close as it leaves the personal computer business and narrows its focus to providing business hardware and software \( associated press \) graphs telephone forces shows revenue of the nation s biggest telephone companies in 1994 computer competition shows where the att global information solutions ranks among the computer companies with which it most directly competes in 1994 \( source hoover s guide to computer companies \)
in december 1993 , according to dozens of witnesses , colin ferguson killed 6 people and wounded 19 others in a shooting spree on the long island rail road yet only 13 months later mr ferguson seems more like a clown than a killer it s a sick farce that s playing out in a mineola courtroom far sicker than arsenic and old lace but it s comic all the same having rejected sane advice that he let professional lawyers mount an insanity defense on his behalf , mr ferguson is not only serving as his own defense counsel but trying to prove his innocence never mind the evidence mr ferguson , who is black , has persuaded the court to cough up 300 to hire a detective to produce an alternative suspect whom he describes as a white caucasian he refers to himself in the third person as a man with a gun or the shooter as he smilingly questions the understandably startled prospective jurors what we have here is an example of the inmates taking over the asylum , declared ronald kuby , who had been one of mr ferguson s lawyers until he was shoved aside later he elaborated people will be dressed in suits and objections and rulings will be made , but the content of what s going on here is utter madness when this case started , colin ferguson needed a psychiatrist by the time it s over , we 're all going to need psychiatrists might mr kuby s remarks apply to the o j simpson trial as well \? as that los angeles carnival finally reaches its opening statements tomorrow , it , too , increasingly resembles a farce , for its theatrics are also increasingly disconnected from the human tragedy that prompted it in the first place the defense lawyers , none of whom can resist a photo op , are now preoccupied with their own scenestealing show of pique , kiss and make up newsweek says the leading prosecutor , having successfully completed her hair and personality makeover , is letting it be known that , as a former actress , she would n't mind playing herself in any tv movie based on the trial the judge has already starred in his own tv series a fivepart interview on kcbs and the defendant has now embarked on a publishing career second in notoriety only to newt gingrich s this is the trial of the century \? an associated press poll says a sizable majority of americans now presume mr simpson guilty an abc news poll says 84 percent of the country is sick of media coverage of the case yet despite the apparent lack of suspense and seeming overkill , a newsweek poll says 82 percent still want to watch if so , it s not because the case is a riveting whodunit out of perry mason , or because it will deal with a controversial issue , like the monkey trial of the 1920 s nor is everyone lured by the supposedly irresistible power of o j s fame we 're not talking about michael jackson here prebronco , mr simpson was on a career trajectory leading directly to celebrity jeopardy no , what most makes this trial at once watchable and repugnant is the element that most makes it farcical highpriced lawyers twisting language and exploiting legal loopholes to suppress evidence if the trial s actual content is only slightly more substantive than the utter madness mr kuby finds in the ferguson proceedings , that s exactly what the audience expects the o j circus is the gaudiest possible confirmation of the prevailing american cynicism , as dramatized by november s election , which says that the entire system does n't work and cannot work because big money , fancy lawyers and selfaggrandizing public officials have hopelessly corrupted the works in a new book excoriating regulatory law , the death of common sense how law is suffocating america , philip k howard compares the gridlock of american government to the interminable court case that outlasts generations of litigants in dickens s bleak house the same could be said of a courtroom serial like mr simpson s , in which the anticipated entertainment \( can he get off \? \) is all ironic the obfuscation of truth and justice , rather than their revelation such a show hardly amounts to the trial of the century , but it may yet prove a parable for our time
well , it looks like congress is going to stop this flag desecration that s been going on going on somewhere not sure where anymore went on all the time everywhere , though , back in vietnam war days at least everywhere a television camera caught an antiwar demonstrator in its view finder congress is going to fix that next time there s a vietnam war there s going to be none of that burning the flag , none of that sewing the flag on the seat of your pants and sitting on it congress is going to amend the constitution to stop it that s right the constitution itself the big parchment going to amend it now , now , none of that talk about congress being on a constitutionamending toot congress does n't go on toots just because it s spent half the year trying to amend this noble document noblest of all documents you ca n't call that an amending toot is it a toot when congress comes out for the flag \? congress standing up and voting for the flag , is that a toot \? a congress has the courage to sit there in washington inside the beltway , mind you the beltway ! has the guts to sit there inside that beltway and tell america it loves the flag is that your idea of a toot \? when the house of representatives democrats and republicans by the dozen voted against flag abuse by amending the constitution that was no toot just plain old courage now it s up to the senate to stand and be counted the famous old veteran capitol observers are saying it looks like the senate probably will muster up the courage to move the amendment right along to the states so flag burners can feel the iron hand of the law next time they decorate the seat of their pants with old glory sure , a lot of congressmen and senators will probably be voted out of office next election for showing the courage to stand up to those who would say to hell with the flag ! and what is it that makes them willing to risk their careers \? what gives them such courage \? it s as simple as this congress loves the flag loves mother too , of course and loves home at least the american home provided it is a twoparent home and neither parent is an immigrant or on welfare there s a good chance , if the flag amendment flies all the way through , that congress will be encouraged to push for a homeandmother amendment to the constitution the idea already has a lot of supporters willing to stand up and be counted against the homeandmother hate bloc these brave solons and solonesses have n't yet decided though whether to fight for one homeandmother amendment that would make it a crime to desecrate home and mother there s some fear that lumping home and mother in one amendment might bring the home haters and the mother haters into a coalition that would make it impossible to pass the amendment some think it would be politically smarter to go for separate amendments one dealing with home desecration , the other with mother desecration the big question of course is , is it fair to ask congressmen to risk political ruin by coming out for the flag , then ask them to go back once more into that deadly breach by coming out for home and mother \? the word from those famous old veteran capitol observers is that it would take more guts than anybody has a right to expect of a congressman with an election year just around the corner most likely , they 're saying at the capitol , congress will exhaust most of its courage this year in the struggle to save the flag if these brave men and brave women survive the fury of the voters next year , they may just possibly have enough fight left to stand up for a home amendment in the following congress most think the mother amendment will never make it , though too many mothers nowadays belong to the singlemother variety for congress , that s pushing motherhood beyond the limit
hidden treasures revealed is not scheduled to open at the hermitage in st petersburg , russia , until late next month , but it is already aswirl in controversy these french paintings were taken from private collections in germany at the end of world war ii and have been kept out of view in russia ever since they are mainly impressionists and postimpressionists by degas , pissarro , daumier , cezanne , renoir , toulouselautrec , seurat , gauguin and van gogh , and many have not been viewed publicly in 70 years when reproduced from old photographs , they were often tagged as missing , presumed destroyed in 1991 art news magazine reported that they were being kept at the hermitage in october last year , mikhail b piotrovsky , the director of the museum , announced that some of them would go on view in the spring exactly which of the 74 paintings will be in the show when it opens on march 30 has not been announced but as to the future of these works , everyone concerned is fighting for the moral high ground are the paintings prisoners in the hermitage , or are they cosseted guests \? should they stay in russia , or should they be returned to those who would have inherited them in germany and elsewhere \? or should they be turned over to the german government , which is eager to have them \? much rides on the answers to these questions if put up for sale , these paintings would be worth several hundred million dollars at the least relatives of the original collectors have a good case to make , and they must be presumed to have made it in both germany and russia , the matter has been discussed in the government in the higher echelons of the art trade , there are hopes of an eventual spinoff the paintings will be shown in the grandest room the hermitage has to offer but until quite recently they have been sitting around informally , unframed and upright in racks or laid flat on a table in the kind of anonymous room , high up in the hermitage , in which imperial housemaids once stored imperial buckets and brooms conservators bring them out , one by one , in no particular order , into the pale marine light that is reflected upward from snowcovered streets and squares seen together , these paintings speak well for the discernment of german collectors before world war i and into the 1920 s over and over again , different works subtly adjust our understanding of artists often seen and long familiar pissarro is an example still lifes account for barely more than 1 percent of his total output but here is his crucial still life with coffee pot of 1900 , which looks both back to his close friend cezanne , in the crumpling of the tablecloth , and forward to the sumptuous patterned backgrounds in the still lifes that matisse painted almost a decade later history itself is present in this painting with van gogh , something similar happens he loved the south of france , but he had trouble getting away from the idea , ingrained in his native netherlands , that dizzying heights had no place in landscape when he was in stremy in october 1889 , he could look up at a steep hillside on which plowman and plow , high up and far away , seemed to merge , in a single insectlike form and he put them into one of the most memorable of all these pictures , the landscape with house and plowman , together with the bright scarlet of a provencal roof and the yellow of a field of stubble that contrasts with the violet tints of the plowed earth with cezanne , equally , there are key works in his lifetime cezanne made about 200 paintings and drawings of bathers , but rare among them is the euphoric resolution of the bathers of 189091 as for his houses along a road of circa 1881 , it is the epitome of his delight in the motif of the turning road that scythes its way through space and those who rank cezanne as the greatest of all stilllife painters will marvel at apples , peaches , pear and grapes , in which these everyday fruits are assembled on a plain wooden board that is supported by a rudimentary table leg from this humdrum collocation , an awesome dignity results seeing the pictures from the front , the back and the sides can bring surprises the most famous of these works is degas s place de la concorde in it , degas s friend the vicomte lepic painter , pioneer engraver , dogbreeder , dandy and archetypal boulevardier takes a walk in paris with two daughters the painting has the offcenter , apparently accidental look of which degas was a supreme master but everything about it is perfectly judged , from the bright yellow coachwork of the carriage on the far left to the tiny splash of red on the lapel of lepic s overcoat not only does the patch of red indicate lepic s rank in the legion of honor it also holds the entire composition together degas , the master portraitist , is at his best in that picture but this visitor to the little locked room was startled to find , when the painting was turned over , that an inch or so of the canvas at the bottom was folded over the stretcher not long after the painting was finished why degas did this , thereby readjusting the balance of the composition , all are free to speculate
a latin lover in updated macho mode jon secada radio city music hall a longstanding pop archetype that until recently seemed unshakable was the image of the latin lover as a suave crooner pouring out his heart in smooth , semioperatic declarations of passion his seductive appeal derived from a mixture of matineeidol elegance and stylized vulnerability but as jon secada , the cubanamerican pop star who sold out three shows at radio city music hall over the weekend , has shown , that image is as subject to change as everything else in pop mr secada is no crooner singing in a big , braying voice that suggests an operatic billy joel , he declares his feelings with a punchy urgency that is just this side of strident in his performance on friday , mr secada augmented the emotive body language of the traditional latin crooner with overt macho posturing although he arrived on the stage wearing an elegant doublebreasted suit , he eventually stripped down to a tank top to show off his welltoned body punching his fist in the air or raising his arms triumphantly , he played the role of pop star like an excitable prizefighter mr secada s singing and songwriting blend a traditional latinamerican pop melodiousness with 1970 s popsoul styles during his performance , he lauded marvin gaye and philip bailey \( of earth , wind and fire \) as influences but while he more than matched them in vocal stamina , he displayed none of their rhythmic subtlety and nuanced expressiveness everything was declaimed with the same blunt forcefulness mr secada has a falsetto of unusual strength and staying power but this upperregister voice with which he serenaded a female fan picked from the audience revealed little textural coloration or sweetness it was a sharp , hard whine applied to impassioned pop ballads like just another day and mental picture , mr secada s singing carries a genuine emotional clout but the acoustics were so muddied , with the percussion and background singers burying the keyboards and guitars , that even here , the music lacked focus stephen holden
john r rolls , chairman of deutsche bank s north american unit , proudly cites his firm s management of the united states portion of a 18 billion worldwide offering of stock for a major automobile company as evidence of the german banking giant s nascent power on wall street but the auto maker was not one of the big three it was daimlerbenz of germany , which is not only a loyal customer but is partly owned by deutsche bank as for doing stock deals for american companies , the bank s record is far less impressive it has led only four issues so far this year , raising 815 million that ranks it 55th in that category among wall street firms , according to the securities data corporation deutsche bank is one of europe s largest financial institutions its 370 billion in assets tower above those of any united states bank , even the planned chasechemical combination its credit ratings could not be better , outshining those of american banks , and it has a global reach beyond that of most american institutions but deutsche bank and two other european banking powerhouses , union bank of switzerland and swiss bank corporation , are learning how tough it is to break into the biggest and most competitive securities market in the world the three european giants have become serious in the last year about sharply increasing their share of the united states investment banking and securities markets basically the underwriting and trading of stocks and bonds , and providing financial advice for the european banks' home offices , the american numbers so far make depressing reading deutsche bank , for example , gained only twotenths of 1 percent of the american market for managing stock offerings in the first eight months of this year that is below the eighttenths of 1 percent it had in 1994 , according to securities data and in the american market for issuing debt , deutsche bank has won a meager twotenths of 1 percent this year ubs has also had limited success in building its equity business its market share is still tiny , though it has risen to half of 1 percent this year from twotenths of 1 percent and onetenth of 1 percent in the previous two years ubs has done better in debt issues , where it has captured 25 percent of the american market this year , compared with 17 percent for 1994 and half of 1 percent for 1993 , according to securities data it has climbed to 11th place from 13th last year and 21st in 1993 and swiss bank whose investment bank will be known as sbc warburg also has yet to make significant progress in the underwriting of debt and equity issues in the united states market for corporate debt issues , its share is running at threetenths of 1 percent , compared with onetenth of a percent in the two previous years its share of the equity issue market has declined to fourtenths of 1 percent this year , compared with 15 percent last year and eighttenths of 1 percent in 1993 the biggest hindrance for the european banks is the harsh fact that the vast majority of transactions in united states securities markets are between american parties breaking into those markets will not be easy for overseas firms but the europeans say they have no choice but to try in the global marketplace , any major financial institution that cannot put down roots in all three of the world s main financial centers new york , london and tokyo is doomed to secondclass status moreover , they are determined to retaliate for a more successful american invasion of their turf since the mid1980 s , big american securities firms have been scooping up business in europe deutsche telekom , for example , recently named goldman , sachs company to its otherwise allgerman team of international equity coordinators for its planned privatization and , to the chagrin of european bankers , salomon brothers inc has recently dominated the investment banking business for cable television in britain as for investment banking in the united states , most american commercial banks have not succeeded only j p morgan company is deemed a success as for foreignowned firms , only credit suisse has established itself as a major wall street player and only by acquiring a big local franchise , the first boston corporation , which it renamed cs first boston buying a wall street firm is the quickest route to success in this country , but all three european newcomers have in the past rejected that tactic , at least for now , said roy smith , a limited partner at goldman , sachs company and a professor of finance at new york university all these fellows are playing secondtier strategies in the us , he said far from being discouraged , the three european banks vow to make the list of the top 10 firms in american investment banking by the end of the decade they figure that with their size , sterling credit ratings and international experience , they can gain a foothold on wall street and expand their influence through aggressive hiring and

dublin , july 27 a prominent roman catholic bishop has been ordered to the vatican next month to explain his insistence that the church in ireland should have an open debate on the requirement of celibacy for priests the dispute has set off widespread contention in ireland , where 95 percent of the country s 35 million people are members of the church it has been frontpage news since early june as the bishop , brendan comiskey , and the primate of ireland , cahal cardinal daly , have exchanged volleys in newspaper articles and interviews callin radio shows have taken hundreds of calls on the issue church officials acknowledge that the church s image has been tarnished and its authority weakened by scandals involving priests convicted in cases of sexual abuse of children and disclosures that several priests have fathered children vatican officials , confirming that bishop comiskey has been summoned to see the head of the congregation of bishops , bernadin cardinal gantin , said the holy see was concerned more about the clash between the irish churchmen than about the celibacy issue they said that such a summons was unusual and added that if bishop comiskey failed to back off from his campaign for a celibacy debate , the pope could strip him of his diocese , which is based in the coastal city of wexford , about 90 miles south of dublin the dispute began several weeks ago when bishop comiskey , in an interview in the sunday tribune , said that the irish church was suffering a steady decrease in the number of young men entering the priesthood and proposed a debate in the church on whether compulsory celibacy should continue in other articles and interviews he has said that he is not advocating the end of celibacy the only thing i did was call for a debate , he told the irish times i did not question celibacy itself he blamed cardinal daly for the summons to rome the cardinal is behind all this , he told the irish times otherwise why would brendan comiskey be called to rome \? cardinal daly , who denies he was behind the summons , at first responded by saying that bishop comiskey s views were purely personal , with no stamp of church authority later , the cardinal appeared to be joining in the debate on celibacy , however indirectly , when he told the sunday business post that his main objective in speaking out on bishop comiskey s proposal was to outline the reasons for celibacy and its conformity with scripture experts on church history note that celibacy is a practice that was imposed in the early centuries of the christian era , not a matter of faith or morals that all catholics must obey ronan fanning , a history professor at university college in dublin , said there is probably profound disappointment in rome that in a certain sense the irish hierarchy is n't putting its house in order the papacy would have thought that ireland would be the one country where the catholic hierarchy might have held the line so far , none of ireland s 34 other bishops have come out for or against bishop comiskey but the country s two most influential newspapers appear to support him the sunday independent said in an editorial that dissent within the catholic hierarchy on the subject of priestly celibacy should be welcomed as a healthy sign both of intellectual maturity and openness to change and debate the irish times said , regardless of the personalities involved , the debate that rome wants to suppress is inevitable
restaurant critics are very suspicious people do you think they 've spotted me \? i often ask my guests a waiter has only to pour the wine a little too often , bring us fresh ice for our water or a new basket of bread to make us certain that my disguise has been pierced but after a while , i stopped wondering at deniz \( pronounced dehneez \) i was convinced they were on to me everybody was so kind perhaps this was only because i became one of the restaurant s most constant customers through the hottest days of summer when i thought about what i really felt like eating , an image of the perfectly grilled fish at deniz would pop into my head i 'd remember the fine smoky eggplant salad or the irresistible yogurt with cucumbers , and the next thing i knew i 'd be pulling up a chair in that large , strangely nondescript dining room true , the owner did once snap at me when i asked if the turkish menu listed any dishes not translated on the english one only a couple was the answer but for the most part the staff was extremely solicitous suspiciously solicitous , i thought then i invited a famous television personality to dinner and discovered exactly how solicitous the staff could be what i had experienced was nothing the minute the celebrity walked in the number of people waiting on us miraculously doubled special homemade flat bread i had never seen before suddenly materialized on our table it was warm , crusty , studded with sesame seeds it was delicious and there was the owner , orhan yegen , standing next to us , saying that he would like the honor of ordering our meal i am happy to report that with the exception of the bread \( a vast improvement over the dull slices usually parceled out at the restaurant \) , the food was no different from what it had been on any other night which is to say that it was mostly delicious deniz \( ocean in turkish \) calls itself a mediterranean seafood restaurant , which is only partly true it is really a turkish restaurant , and while the kitchen concentrates on food from the sea , the menu is laden with dishes that would make people who do n't eat fish happy to begin , there are two kinds of eggplant one is panfried until the small purple cubes are swollen with olive oil , tomato and garlic it is rich and delicious the other is a salad the eggplant is grilled until the flesh has absorbed the taste of the charcoal and then is beaten until it has a smooth and creamy consistency the cool homemade yogurt is thick and almost as rich as sour cream , filled with cucumbers and topped with shredded mint and the salty little rolls of phyllowrapped feta cheese are crunchy and delicious enough to disappear in two bites but those who do n't eat fish will have to miss the crisp , light rings of fried calamari and the rich taramosalata , fish roe whipped with olive oil and lemon not to mention those wonderful sardines that are wrapped in grape leaves and topped with thinly sliced rounds of lemon they will also have to forgo the chewy , oniony octopus salad perhaps mr yegen thought the celebrity might not like fish why else would chicken have been among the several courses he brought us \? very fine chicken , to be sure , thinly sliced , grilled and served with slivers of onion coated in the pungent purplish spice called sumac a plate of what looked like plain rice came with the chicken , but a mush of eggplant and tomatoes was hidden beneath the surface on other occasions , i have had turkish meatballs with grilled onions and tomatoes , and they were good , too but it is a shame to come to deniz and miss the fish so few restaurants in new york city serve whole fish and here they are beautifully charred with nothing more than lemon and a small onionandparsley salad i 've tried grilled mackerel and grilled red mullet i have had fabulous bluefish and fine red snapper but would n't you know that on the night of the celebrity we were served whole rouget and striped bass , and they were both overcooked \? there was another disappointment that night the special artichoke appetizer turned out to be a pair of whole , soggy artichokes that were not only overcooked but also overpriced at 9 a pair as if to make up for it , mr yegen went around the table after dinner handing out pieces of kunefe , crisp , rich cheesefilled pastries it is not on the menu , but kataifi , shredded dough with sweet syrup , pistachios and a rich , almost cheeselike topping , is as we were eating dessert somebody came up and snapped a photo of the celebrity somebody else came by to ask for an autograph new desserts appeared on the table i like this restaurant , said the celebrity well , why would n't he \?

san francisco , nov 8 the best thing about the mayor s race in san francisco , a place where politics is still fun , is that tuesday s vote was inconclusive and so there is more to come no candidate won a majority in the nonpartisan contest , and that means a runoff on dec 12 between the top two finishers in the sevencandidate field the former state assembly speaker willie brown and the incumbent , frank jordan the betting is that mr brown will ultimately prevail , perhaps easily , because he is expected to pick up most of the votes that went to the thirdplace finisher , roberta achtenberg , a leader in the city s large gay community still , this being san francisco , the coming month is not likely to produce setpiece politics , if for no other reason than san francisco , with its doyourownthing approach to life , does not produce setpiece politicians consider mr brown , a democrat , like most politicians and voters in the city as speaker of the california assembly , he was one of the most powerful state politicians in the country because he is black , he also was , and is , one of the country s most powerful black politicians , who is more than likely to be the first black mayor of san francisco but he is much more than that now a robust 61 , he is also a great public show , not just hugely skillful in his chosen life s work but also eyepopping flamboyant at times , with a penchant for 100 , 000 roadsters , 1 , 000 silk suits and 1 characterizations of his political enemies we 're going to take it to jordan like he s never seen it before because i want to stuff this turkey by thanksgiving , he vowed early this morning as a balky city registrar s computer finally spit out the last returns , leaving him with 34 percent of the vote , the mayor with 31 percent and ms achtenberg with 27 percent the coming month could also be a funky month , this being san francisco consider mr jordan , 60 normally a somnolent , saltoftheearth former police officer , he has lately shown his own flare for the flamboyant , conducting an interview a few days back while bucknaked in a shower with two disk jockeys got nothing to hide , he said of the stunt it s a new side of me what did that little episode get him \? or cost him \? in san francisco , the postmortem concentrated more on the yuks than the votes in any case , when mr jordan resumed campaigning this afternoon , he did so in front of one of the city s newly installed parisianstyle street toilets , an appearance intended in part to underscore what he boasts is one of his accomplishments for the city none of this is to say that san franciscans do not take their politics seriously to the contrary , they know that they live in an urban treasure , and they take great pride that it is one of the world s leading tourist destinations and highly rated as a business center they are also fully aware that it has a full bag of urban troubles crime , the homeless , overloaded health services , inadequate public transportation , not enough money they are proud that they well might elect a black mayor , but the fact that he is black is only incidental and they are proud that in few other american cities , perhaps no other american city , could a gay candidate pull 27 percent of the vote in a sevencandidate contest san francisco can be an extreme kind of place in the best sense , said david binder , one of the city s leading pollsters and political analysts it s typical that at a time when the rest of the country seems to be tipping more and more to the right and conformity , we are reaffirming our tradition of tipping to the left and nonconformity still , some san franciscans worry about some aspects of the city s particular brand of politics during the weeks leading up to tuesday s vote , they note , all was not fun and funk rather , there were times when the candidates , particularly mr jordan and mr brown , attacked each other with the kind of ad hominem abandon often found in other cities the mayor accused mr brown of consorting not just with the usual special interests but even with drug dealers mr brown countered that the mayor was nothing more or less than a bumbling incompetent as for ms achtenberg , she repeatedly referred to both men as failures but in the end , early this morning in a concession speech , she called on her supporters to support mr brown in december , a switch that could give him a comfortable winning edge will the personal attacks continue in the second half of the campaign \? in its lead editorial this morning , the san francisco chronicle called for civility and castigated those who impugn the motives and smear the character of their rivals it does not have to be this way , the editorial concluded together , we can have a campaign worthy of san francisco photos san francisco s mayoral election campaign will continue foranother month , as no candidate received a majority of votes on tuesday stan hunt , a doorman at a downtown hotel , greeted the two top votegetters who will face each other in a runoff willie brown , left , the former speaker of the state assembly , and the incumbent mayor , frank jordan , center right , shown with his press secretary , sean clegg \( photographs by jim wilson the new york times \)

researchers have discovered an important clue to one of the fundamental mysteries of aids , the ability of the virus to persist in the body for years while under vigorous attack by the immune system an answer , say researchers at oxford university in england , may be that the virus , by subtle mutation , actually defuses the immune system attack force that is meant to destroy virusstricken cells dr bruce walker , director of aids research at massachusetts general hospital in boston , said , if you want to think of it with a war analogy , it s as though the soldiers are still on maneuvers , but they no longer have their weapons when they encounter the enemy , they lose their weapons ordinarily , the immune system s army of white blood cells , which includes killer t cells , can obliterate invading viruses the t cells seek out and destroy cells that the viruses have infected but in infections with the human immunodeficiency virus , or hiv , which causes aids , the killer cells are strangely impotent the oxford researchers , dr rodney phillips , a reader in medicine , and dr andrew mcmichael , a professor of immunology , isolated the aids virus from four patients they found that the viruses had undergone a subtle mutation , or change in their genetic structure when killer t cells approached cells infected with the mutated virus , not only did the t cells fail to kill the stricken cell , they seemed to lose their appetite for killing altogether , as if their hunter instinct had been distracted or lulled into abeyance now , the t cells were unable to kill even cells infected with the original , unmutated aids virus the investigators published their results in today s issue of the journal science dr mcmichael said in a telephone interview that he did not think that the newly discovered mechanism was the only way that hiv evaded the immune system , but that it might be an important one the mutations not only allow the altered strains to proliferate but also allow unaltered strains to grow with abandon he cautioned , however , that as yet he had no way of knowing how often the virus resorted to this trickery in a real infection others voiced the same reservation , but said they were nonetheless intrigued this is just totally unexpected , said dr dani bolognesi , an aids vaccine researcher at duke university the discovery , dr bolognesi said , means the fight against aids is a whole new ball game dr anthony fauci , director of the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases , said the finding ran counter to the usual way a virus would evade the immune system the classic way you think of a virus evading the immune system is merely by mutating , by having the immune system chase after it and never find it because the virus is constantly changing , he said but , dr fauci added , this is more of an active role it s like the virus is turning around and coming back , he said , attacking the immune system rather than running from it dr hugh mcdevitt , an immunologist at stanford university said , they have n't proved that this is a mechanism of escape , from the immune system in a real infection but , he added , all the pieces are there the battle between hiv and the immune system begins when the virus slips into a cd4 cell , a type of white blood cell that it preferentially infects the cd4 cell signals to killer t cells that it is infected by displaying snippets of hiv proteins on its surface this triggers the killer cells to spring into action , multiplying and seeking out infected cd4 cells in order to pierce them open and destroy them in their study , dr phillips and dr mcmichael found viruses that had minor mutations that did not affect their ability to infect cells and proliferate but they did have a profound effect on killer t cells the scientists were inspired to begin their study after research by others indicated that it might be possible to turn off killer t cells with particular protein fragments until that work , dr mcmichael said , researchers used to think that killer cells had an all or none response either they would recognize and kill cells with particular protein fragments or they would ignore them but the studies , by dr paul allen at washington university and others , indicated that killer cells could have a sort of halfway response they could recognize protein fragments but not kill the cells and once they received that sort of signal , the killer cells became at least temporarily inactivated dr bolognesi said that the oxford discovery had enormous implications for vaccine research in testing potential aids vaccines , he said , researchers look to see if the vaccine has elicited the production of killer cells that can destroy hivinfected cd4 cells in laboratory experiments now , he said , it becomes unclear whether such a laboratory result means that the killer cells will destroy infected cells in a patient whose viruses may be mutating to inactivate the killer cells but dr fauci was more optimistic if you prevent infection with a vaccine , the virus is n't going to be able to do these little tricks , he said dr fauci added that , to him , the discovery was more important for understanding how the aids virus infection becomes chronic dr mcdevitt agreed it is still a puzzle , he noted , to explain how the virus can elicit a strong immune response yet remain unscathed this could be one mechanism , he said diagram discovery how hiv may disarm immune cells shows t cells binding to a protein and piercing an infected cd4 cell \( source

irvine , calif if there are two words that sum up this obsessively planned city of 120 , 000 in the heart of orange county , they are symmetry and order in woodbridge village , the largest subdivision here , there is a central corridor of churches , shopping centers and lowrise office buildings with nearly identical manmade lakes on either side spreading out from their banks are similar woodframed town houses , thickets of oleander and tract housing businesses , and homeowners , are strictly regulated so they do not upset the buffhued color scheme and in a city dedicated to healthy living , there is no cemetery this neatly packaged version of the california dream , 50 miles south of los angeles , is the creation of the largest designer and developer of masterplanned communities in america the deceptively lowkey irvine company and its secretive owner , donald l bren the privately held company is a sprawling behemoth that began as the irvine family ranch in the 1860 s its properties today sprout everything from the state s biggest producer of avocados to shopping malls , hotels , office towers and affluent towns like newport beach and its influence is just as pervasive their fingerprints are on everything that happens here , said louis masotti , head of the real estate program at the university of california at irvine s management school but the orange county government s bizarre bankruptcy last december , and then the voters' angry rejection of a tax increase that was supposed to clear up the mess , has turned this seemingly harmonious landscape into a complex , unruly battleground and all this comes at a time when the county , once nearly allwhite and affluent , is in the midst of deep demographic and economic changes of the sort that many residents came here to escape no one has more at stake in the outcome of the bankruptcy battle and the social contours of the county s future than the irvine company , which has the mixed fortune of owning a wonderful stretch of land that is concentrated in just one , troubled place their future depends completely on the county s viability , said mr masotti as a result , a company that has been compulsive about controlling its environment is now at the mercy of that environment and a company that always saw its future in clear , bold strokes is now facing the sort of uncertainty its planners had tried to sweep away drastic county budget cuts and the struggle by local and state officials to hammer out a financial rescue plan are producing big reductions in county services and thus a threat to property values according to the rescue plan passed by the state legislature in the last day of its session friday , the county will have to make steep cuts in bus service and cut hundreds of jobs in order to divert funds to repay creditors and no matter how successful the plan , the county s troubles will persist for years already , it appears that the weak market and the lingering effects of the recession may have forced the company to defer offering interests in some of its real estate holdings to the public nevertheless , company executives continue to express confidence in their longterm prospects is this going to hurt us in the long term \? asked raymond l watson , who is the company s vice chairman and its original urban planner , as well as the former chairman of the walt disney company i do n't think so but getting to the long term from where we are could be difficult to some extent , the irvine company is orange county it owns a sixth of the county s land , about 90 square miles stretching from the hills above the pacific coast to the cleveland national forest , 22 miles to the northeast its developments are often praised for their quality and planning , and they are a big reason orange county has enjoyed a reputation as a pleasant alternative to los angeles the irvine company leaves little to chance in any field of endeavor the company is also a welloiled political machine with an outsized influence over the election of everyone from town supervisors to the state s governor and perhaps the next president of the united states mr bren is one of the national republican party s top financial contributors and he is the finance chairman for the presidential campaign of his close friend and former marine buddy , gov pete wilson of california last year , mr bren , his companies and his employees contributed more than 210 , 000 to governor wilson s reelection campaign when one of mr bren s executives gets involved in a political battle , no one here doubts that mr bren is calling the shots nothing happens at the company that he does n't have his hands on , from the color of a door knob to the types of trees at fashion island , said mr watson , referring to the tony shopping mall that the company owns in newport beach during the lengthy and often acrimonious negotiations over the county s financial crisis , mr bren s top political operative , gary h hunt , has been a constant presence we are vigorous in representing our own interests , wherever we see them , mr watson said , adding , that is what we are supposed to do it s part of what we are

washington , jan 4 a panel affiliated with the national academy of sciences said today that the government s research on the health problems of persian gulf war veterans had been badly organized and had failed to determine if the gulf war syndrome really exists the panel recommended that vice president al gore s office should coordinate a better organized study of complaints by thousands of veterans that they contracted illnesses in the gulf the report was issued by a committee of the institute of medicine , an arm of the national academy of sciences the panel s members are experts in epidemiology , environmental medicine and the design of scientific experiments in a response , the persian gulf veterans coordinating board , which has been coordinating the government s work on the syndrome , agreed that more coordination and better scientific work was necessary the three departments represented on the board , veterans affairs , defense and health , said they agreed with the panel and already have initiated or planned a number of research efforts , including largescale epidemiological and mortality studies , along the lines that iom recommended since 1993 , government agencies led by the veterans affairs department have kept track of complaints that an unusual , unexplained illness has affected thousands of the veterans so far , the veterans administration has a registry of 30 , 000 veterans , and the department of defense has a registry of more than 9 , 000 veterans , all of whom reported unexplained symptoms preliminary reports concluded that most of those examined have ordinary , diagnosable illnesses , while a small portion have symptoms that are unexplained the institute of medicine report said the government s efforts had mostly been aimed at finding and caring for those who have identified themselves as possibly suffering from illnesses they picked up in the persian gulf though these efforts may be seen as responsive to community concerns and may also provide care to those who are ill , the methods used to select participants and collect data make these undertakings intrinsically unsuitable for systematic study of the health effects of the gulf war , the panel concluded because those who came forward were selfselected , they cannot represent the collective experience of those who served in the gulf war , and because no control group was used for example , a comparison group of those who were in the military at the same time but did not go to the persian gulf no conclusion can be drawn about what symptoms may have been caused by gulf service the symptoms reported by those worried about gulf war syndrome include fatigue , muscle pain , hair loss , breathing trouble and memory loss so far , the report said , none of the several government committees that have studied the syndrome have been able to define it
tucson , ariz one man s problem with too many zeroes has captured the imagination of the technical people who answer questions daily for thousands of perplexed users of turbotax and macintax software he complained that he could n't get the program to accept his income figure , said mark allemand , a supervisor at the technical support center here for intuit , the maker of the popular tax programs then , he told us his income was in eight digits more than 10 million our software will only take figures up to 9 , 999 , 999 the caller was offered a refund was the multimillionaire really doing his own taxes \? the software helpers suspect that he was among a growing number of people who pay professionals to prepare their tax returns and then use computer programs to check that work while intuit says it offers only technical help and not personal tax advice , the explanation of the way to get the software to take or move figures is not simple based on a recent march day , when taxpayer panic was building , the staff often winds up advising taxpayers on how and where to report their income and deductions intuit expects to sell 19 million copies of its tax programs this year , giving it 63 percent of the market , according to pc data , a research firm in reston , va because buyers use the software to help friends and family , about 10 million of the 116 million tax returns filed by individuals will be prepared on intuit software , said mark r goines , vice president and general manager of the company s personal tax group during the peak season the company gets 4 , 500 calls a day from users about everything from loading the software to wondering why the program asks them to fill out a form on foreign income when they have none \( the answer remove a zero from the foreign income line and leave it blank \) despite several widely reported bugs , some involving quarterly estimated tax payments , the company has received only 609 phone calls about the bugs intuit says it expects 390 , 000 calls this tax season to handle the onslaught , the company employs 250 people , most earning 7 an hour the advisers get four weeks of training , then sit at computers loaded with the software so they can replicate the customers' problems most calls are answered at the main technical support center , housed here in a modern industrial building with high ceilings , exposed ducts and plainvanilla walls satellite centers in san diego and albuquerque , nm , handle the overflow each technical adviser gets a free copy of the software for practice i do my own taxes as a game , said kevin davis , who handles macintax calls i play with it , try things to see how low i can get my taxes intuit says its helpers do not give tax advice , but as a practical matter they often guide people through complex depreciation issues , indicate the way to separate deferred interest from nondeferred interest and explain that the state revenue department may define income quite differently than the internal revenue service does a caller recently complained that turbotax would handle only 53 capital gains the solution , the caller was told , was to report 52 gains and summarize the others on the 53d line , with an attached statement giving the details another caller , who had switched his business from a proprietorship , reported on schedule c , to a partnership reported on form 1065 , needed help allocating interest expenses and working out depreciation on a building of modest value the deduction turned out to be worth 319 of course , some taxpayers are more interested in sleeping soundly than in shaving every dollar from a tax bill they may worry about the complexity of the tax laws , which provide many opportunities for creative or erroneous interpretations reporting income and deductions in different ways are one reason that professional preparers can come up with strikingly different tax returns from the same information a professional tax preparer can give you a very aggressive tax return if you want , said deidrie griggs , a senior technical representative turbotax will give you a conservative tax return , with all the calculations done right as mr allemand said , a lot of people are n't interested in taxes , do n't understand taxes , but they trust our program the irs finds math errors on 16 percent of tax returns prepared by hand , but on less than 1 percent of those done with tax software , mr goines said on occasion , callers to the intuit help center , where help is free except for the longdistance charges , are told to ask the irs for advice but many callers do not want the agency s tollfree number there s this tremendous fear of the irs , said kemper bickel , a technical representative i think people fear taxes because they do n't know about them when i tell people to call the irs they say 'no no no i do n't want to talk to the irs' photos intuit handles up to 4 , 500 calls a day at tax time kevin davis , above , and patty maza fielded questions recently \( photographs by jeff scott for the new york times \)
after days of painful uncertainty for thousands of metronorth commuters , railroad officials yesterday invoked a provision in federal law to postpone a possible strike for four months the move came at the end of a day in which the railroad s unions gave up some of their cherished , decadesold work rules in contract talks the surprise maneuver by the metropolitan transportation authority , metronorth s parent agency , was intended in part to isolate the two unions that continued to hold fast against workrule changes , said an mta official who spoke on condition of anonymity the decision late last night to invoke the law , the railway labor act , automatically starts a 120day coolingoff period during which the unions cannot legally strike and the management cannot unilaterally impose new work rules the action was an abrupt reversal for mta officials , who had said that the law served only to prolong contract disputes with the unions acceding yesterday to the most significant rules changes since 1983 , and the management dropping many of its proposed revisions , the mta reached tentative agreements with 15 unions on work rules , raising the prospect that contracts with those unions could be near but the unions representing engineers and conductors resisted proposed changes that the railroad said were needed to improve productivity , and continued to hold out the threat of a strike this week , that threat has kept thousands of commuters on edge and driven away thousands of others , costing the railroad hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenue , and it has forced the management to spend hundreds of thousands more on a contingency bus service the union s tactics put pressure on mta officials and gov george e pataki , who wields considerable influence over the authority along with the financial costs , the waiting game had made commuters in the governor s home base of westchester county uneasy and eager for a settlement with the uncertainty in the lives of our customers , the situation has become untenable , said gary j dellaverson , the mta director of labor relations michael doyle , general chairman of the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and a spokesman for the 17 unions in the talks , called the mta s move a desperate act it shows they know they 're in a corner , and they 're the ones that put themselves there , he said under the railway labor act , twice during a labor dispute the railway management can ask the president to appoint a panel to weigh the issues , and that request starts a 120day coolingoff period in the current dispute , the first coolingoff period ended last month , and the mta did not immediately start a second one , saying that only urgent negotiation would end the dispute the premise we had worked upon was that the current situation would force the parties to negotiate to a conclusion , mr dellaverson said it s clear to us at this point that that has not worked starting a second coolingoff period now gives the mta a chance to retreat from the brink of confrontation and gives management time to reach deals with most unions , isolating the engineers' and conductors' unions but the mta also risks the possibility of a strike in november , when ridership is heavier and school buses are not as readily available to ferry commuters the work rules , which bolster workers' incomes and improve their working conditions , represent the unions' gains in decades of contract talks , and the railroad s insistence on eliminating some of them to save money has proved even more controversial than the dispute over wages one of the thorniest disputes , with the teamsters , who represent track workers , was resolved yesterday with an agreement for workers to be paid a 10 percent differential , or bonus , for work on nights or weekends , when it is easiest to repair tracks currently , workers are paid the overtime rate of time and a half for all night or weekend work , even if they work no more than 40 hours accepting an end to that policy means accepting a substantial pay cut for many teamsters mta officials said such an important rule had not been eliminated since 1983 , when , after a 42day strike , the conductors' union agreed to a reduction in the number of conductors on each train but the united transportation union , which represents conductors and tickettakers , continued yesterday to resist the railroad s insistence on freedom to hire parttime assistant conductors , who union leaders fear would siphon work away from regular conductors and who would have no benefits we will not agree to parttime assistant conductors , said anthony bottalico , general chairman of the union that s a strike issue for utu the brotherhood of locomotive engineers also held out , protesting a number of proposed work rule changes and none of the unions have yet talked with the management about the mta s wage offer of a 103 percent increase over four years the unions have indicated that they would accept a similar increase over three years we have made quite significant progress with a large number of our unions , mr dellaverson , the mta labor relations director , said unfortunately , we have made less than no progress with some of the others the mta has moved considerably since last week on wages , where it had been offering a oneyear freeze and no guaranteed increase for subsequent years , and on work rules though the workrule changes the railroad has sought would save less than 10 million out of a 550 million budget , officials consider them a crucial first step toward streamlining operations and toward setting a pattern that could be followed with other mta agencies like the long island rail road and the transit authority the brotherhood of locomotive engineers refused to agree to a number of changes , including one in the way engineers are chosen to fill in for other engineers who are on vacation or call in sick each terminal has an extra list of engineers who work exclusively filling such vacancies and are paid straight time when the extra list is exhausted , managers must pick engineers from the relief list , where engineers volunteer for overtime work management wants each terminal to have the freedom to call on the extra list of another terminal , rather than resorting to paying overtime photo metronorth linemen

los angeles , july 3 they are capable of seeing their name in lights or losing a fly ball in the lights the national league pennant may be about to hit the los angeles dodgers in the hands , and the question is whether they will drop it their owner should go down as scout of the year , their manager had better be trilingual and their pitching ace has the perfect antidote for their swisscheese defense strikeouts hideo nomo , the pitcher imported from japan minus the tariff , is personally taking whiteout to the dodger record book just last week , in fact , he recreated august of 1965 his fourgame strikeout total of 50 surpassed sandy koufax s alltime team total of 49 set 30 augusts ago and now nomo is pining for an allstar game start you happy , tommy \? right fielder raul mondesi asked his manager the night nomo s forkball danced a jig against colorado contento , said tommy lasorda contento the dodgers may be an east coast transplant , but they are currently the only game in town the raiders and rams have just hitchhiked from los angeles , but , assuming the dodgers purchase some stickum , they may be playing deep into football season they lead the national league in errors , but are also second in attendance , and are good for a house of 50 , 000 almost every night nomo \( 61 , 205 earned run average \) takes his turn the other attractions are their catcher with the biceps , their right fielder with the quadriceps and their rally bucket in the dugout the dodgers of the 1960 s and 1970 s were homegrown , and they are again picking prospects out of their own garden catcher mike piazza and first baseman eric karros spent the last three seasons living in a stucco manhattan beach condominium , never too far from a ucla keg party women have followed them home from dodger stadium you either drive fast or you just lose them , karros said because it is not often two rookies of the year live under one roof piazza used to raid karros s closet and karros s refrigerator , but now the catcher finally has to learn to steam vegetables on his own piazza moved out last week after buying a home up the street , and , on his first day out , he begged karros to do lunch comes a time when you got to grow up , karros said of their split but let me tell you , piazza got away living there two and a half years without ever going to the grocery store one time and if i was ever missing clothes , all i had to do was go into his bedroom and there they were , buried somewhere piazza that s ridiculous karros s clothes are tacky , cheesy but they both wear a similar roaring batting average especially piazza , who scares pitchers the moment he flexes injuries have kept piazza out of 26 games , and the dodgers are a subpar 917 without him but tony gwynn of the padres screams , move back every time piazza steps to the plate , and the catcher is gwynn s early nominee for most valuable player but across the clubhouse is roberto clemente in a raul mondesi disguise if piazza does not win mvp , it will because he split the vote with a bowlegged right fielder who turns opponents' singles into groundball outs san francisco pitcher mark portugal lined a base hit mondesi s way last month and mondesi charged it like a shortstop and threw the giant out at first that may be the only way i get an assist , mondesi told his teammates his throwing arm proceeds him so much now that doubles are dying at first base so few players are running on him that mondesi has turned to sabotage yep , said teammate chris gwynn , raul tricks people , sets people up now the first to fall was craig biggio , last season in houston mondesi intentionally loafed on a base hit to the rightfield corner , waited for biggio to dig for second and then pegged him out sometimes i want to throw and they do n't go , mondesi said so , i play with them a little to see if he 'll go i want to throw , i want to throw but i can not do this every time it does n't look good if the guy is safe his bat proceeds him , too , and he has thighs reminiscent of bo jackson s he has scored from second base on infield singles and has prompted karros to say he 'll be the most exciting player that ever wears a dodger uniform i mean that , man mondesi goes nowhere without his cousins from back home , and the dodgers were concerned early in his career about the company he kept he has won them over , however , and they still laugh about the day he took right field in colorado without his baseball cap on he went to adjust the bill of his cap and went , wait a minute , ' karros said considering mondesi is batting 323 with 13 homers , that karros is at 314 with 14 homers and that piazza is at 396 with 13 homers and none a day over 27 the dodgers apparently can book a playoff itinerary from here until the year 2009 but then someone grounds a ball to their shortstop , and reality sets in jose offerman is an error waiting to happen , and his perceived nonchalance caused a consequential team meeting in st louis offerman , whose batting average \( 314 \) , is the only reason for his allstar berth , made an error and failed to run out a pop fly on a recent june day against the cardinals , and karros poked him in the chest about it in the dugout a playersonly meeting was called the next day , and chris gwynn claimed there was no cussing , no namecalling but something registered , because the dodgers returned to win six straight and retake first place nomo signed for the major league minimum and has not even uttered the dreaded words , sai kei ya ku \( translation renegotiate \) the dodger owner , peter o'malley , who has ties to every continent , was the one who urged the nomo acquisition , and the result has been lasorda s fifth language i know english , italian , spanish , a little bit of french when i played in montreal , and now i'm trying to get a little japanese in there , the manager said korean is not far off , either chan ho park is their top class aaa pitching prospect who actually called lasorda on father s day i'm his american father , why would n't he call me \? the manager said meanwhile , lasorda s pet japanese expression is strike nagero translation throw strikes and the manager is glad he has a whole new audience \( the japanese media \) that has never heard his jokes the team is more united nations than national league another phenom pitcher is the mexican ismael valdes , who , it turns out , is nomo s dearest friend i do n't see how they understand each other , lasorda said there are american pieces to the puzzle , too , like todd worrell s renaissance \( 12 saves in 13 chances and an 033 era \) and the rally bucket that reserve chad fonville sits on every night it s a bucket of seeds turned over , fonville said whenever we need a hit or an out , tommy comes over and rubs my head the possibilities are endless , especially with nomo assimilating by the hour the pitcher did not phone lasorda on father s day well , he ca n't talk yet , the manager said but he knows what he needs to know tony gwynn , for instance , approached nomo for small talk last week , and asked how do you like la \? nomo answered yes , like la gwynn how do you like colorado \? nomo no , no , do n't like colorado photo when healthy , mike piazza of the dodgers causes opposing outfielders to line up close to the fences

paris , feb 6 a proposal by president francois mitterrand for a european union conference to help end algeria s war against islamic militants put him at odds today with the algerian leadership and france s own conservative government the algerian authorities recalled their ambassador for consultations over the weekend after mr mitterrand suggested friday during a news conference with chancellor helmut kohl of germany that the european union call a conference to find a solution to a conflict that has taken an estimated 30 , 000 to 40 , 000 lives in three years algerian officials denounced the proposal as attempted interference in their internal affairs , and algerian radio and television denounced mr mitterrand today the military government has outlawed the islamic opposition and has been hunting down militants in operations that french officials say are killing about 1 , 000 people a week on both sides mr mitterrand s proposal seemed to surprise the conservative government of prime minister edouard balladur , who public opinion polls say is the leading candidate to succeed the socialist president when his second term expires in may i am a member of his government , and at the same time i am not certain that we were a partner in this move , interior minister charles pasqua told a television interviewer on sunday he is the government s most prominent backer of tough action against the islamic sympathizers among the 900 , 000 algerians living here , today foreign minister alain juppe , who has urged the algerian government in the past to talk with its opponents , made clear that mr mitterrand had not cleared his remarks in advance with the government that serves under him let s see if this idea germinates and if , at some point , it can help to renew the necessary dialogue , he told reporters in brussels under france s constitution , the government is named by a majority in parliament , not by the directly elected president , who nevertheless calls the shots in foreign and security policy mr balladur became prime minister after the conservatives won the legislative elections of march 1993 now mr pasqua is backing mr balladur s presidential candidacy , while mr juppe is supporting another conservative , mayor jacques chirac of paris like nearly everything else at the moment , the appearance of discord on algeria immediately took on a political cast , with some french newspapers calling the rift the most serious foreign policy dispute since powersharing began nearly two years ago rising violence in algeria , or a surge in immigration after a government collapse or islamic takeover there , would benefit none of the mainstream french parties , and the political bickering obscured a fundamental shift after years of siding with the military government in algeria in its war against the militants , french leaders appear to have concluded that the military might not prevail , and most of them are encouraging political discussion instead certainly we 've seen the government as a whole moving toward dialogue , though this is the first foray into the issue by the presidency , a foreign diplomat said but the first foray may have been mr pasqua s his antiterrorism troops disabled the islamic hijackers who supposedly planned to blow up an air france plane from algiers over paris in december to protest french support for the government of president liamine zeroual mr balladur owes a good part of his popularity in opinion polls to the success of that antiterrorism operation but almost immediately after it ended , his government began calling for talks between the algerian government and the more mainstream of its islamic opponents representatives of eight opposition parties met in rome in midjanuary and offered to stop the violence if the government met their demands three of them the islamic salvation front , the front of socialist forces and the national liberation front , the group that won algeria s independence in 1962 after a colonial war with the french had won 85 percent of the popular vote in the algerian legislative elections of december 1991 but the results were annulled by the military government a month later the militant group that hijacked the airplane , the armed islamic group , also said it would end its insurgency if the government punished the generals leading the battle against them , released the group s top leaders and ended a ban on atheist and communist political parties after the government dismissed their demands , the group carried out a carbombing late last month near the main police station in algiers that killed 42 people it seems to the chancellor and me that terrorism and extremism take strong nourishment from the economic and social misery in algeria , mr mitterrand said , with mr kohl at his side on friday calling it a hope rather than a proposal , mr mitterrand said he believed that the european countries could help remedy the situation
imagine newt gingrich bothering to write a pugnacious article attacking a new play by david mamet , or fierce rows breaking out in the democratic party because of something penned by sam shepard , or even an editorial in a major american newspaper discussing the relevance of the latest work by arthur miller it does n't seem too likely , does it \? still , when what is familiarly known as the david hare trilogy ran in its entirety at britain s national theater one saturday in 1993 , the following week not only brought the usual clutch of reviews examining the plays' artistic merits and demerits pundits , parliamentarians , columnists , eminent lawyers and senior churchmen felt impelled to join a debate about the issues that had been raised new yorkers may get some inkling of the reasons for all the ado when mr hare s racing demon opens tomorrow at the vivian beaumont theater at lincoln center the play involves the travails of a socially conscious but spiritually impotent clergyman and , by implication , the problems of anglicanism itself the overriding subject is a church of england divided between people who see their prime task as helping the underdogs and outcasts and those who want to fill pews and robustly preach the gospel racing demon is the first of mr hare s three plays involving british institutions that , before the 1993 showing , had been staged separately at the national murmuring judges , about the legal system , caused greater controversy absence of war , about electiontime politics , created a hubbub that ended with the times of london editorially defending mr hare against attacks by labor s former deputy leader and its foreign affairs spokesman but racing demon made quite a stir too the play provoked dr david hope , bishop of london in 1993 and now archbishop of york , to applaud mr hare publicly for giving valuable insights into the turmoil afflicting the anglican church moreover , most critics rated it more highly than either of its two companion pieces not least , the play enhanced the reputation of richard eyre , the artistic director of the national and the same man who is now restaging it with another cast headed by brian murray , josef summer , kathleen chalfant and michael cumpsty three of mr hare s previous plays plenty , map of the world and the secret rapture started at the national theater and moved on to new york but none proved as successful with british audiences as mr eyre s production of racing demon it was popular enough to transfer in rapid succession from the national s smallest auditorium , the cottesloe , to the larger olivier and lyttelton , and to go on a long regional tour before returning to the olivier what does all this tell us \? perhaps that the theater in britain is more culturally central , and a much more credible forum for public argument , than it is in america certainly , mr hare himself has said that one of the joys of writing drama in england is that the ideas you express can be taken so seriously and enter so smoothly into the currency of political discussion but that s scarcely true of every british playwright what the impact of his trilogy still suggests is that , at the age of 48 , mr hare has won a public respect and enjoys a public influence rare if not unique among dramatists on either side of the atlantic does that make him sound a bit of an institution himself \? if so , it s ironic and unfair , for the one constant in his evolving career has been his distaste for the british establishment in almost all its aspects he would better be described as a theatrical ombudsman at war with what he sees as privilege , injustice and entrenched greed is insularity a more telling objection , then \? well , mr hare certainly creates more socially specific worlds than that human zoologist harold pinter or that witty philosopher tom stoppard one ca n't imagine either of them attending church convocations and painstakingly interviewing dozens of clerics , as mr hare did when he researched racing demon but , no , he s scarcely a parochial writer mr hare has consciously brought an international scope to some of his work , notably map of the world , seen at the public theater in 1985 , which put the west and the third world , cynicism and idealism , into conflict at a conference in bombay and several plays set securely in his native land have their universal echoes racing demon may examine a particular institution in detail , but the politicking we see is sadly familiar reportedly , an actress appearing in the national production invited her bank manager to a performance , and he emerged asking how mr hare knew so much about the inner workings of his company the bishop of southwark , he swore , is my area manager to the life unsurprisingly , mr hare is a controversial figure in britain to the right , he s a moralizing prig clinging to the remnants of a discredited socialism to the hard left , he s a vacillating liberalhumanist who should pander less to mandarin audiences and wave the red flag more in fact , neither tag adequately describes the complex , contradictory dramatist yes , he continues to find the enterprise culture hostile both to the individual and the community but yes , he also writes polished , witty dialogue for characters whose points of view he invariably tries to convey fairly yes , he loathed and loathes thatcherism , but , yes , he despises the kind of political theater that thinks a few gimcrack mottoes of the left will sort out the deep problems of reaction in modern england
washington , nov 13 so how long can treasury secretary robert e rubin keep up his juggling act \? the answer to that question is at the heart of the clinton administration s strategy of holding off the republicandominated congress without actually ruining the impeccable credit rating the country has had since 1789 every few days for the past month , mr rubin has proclaimed that default is imminent , unless he takes extraordinary , and costly , action and every few days , showing just a few cards at a time , he has come up with a strategy that keeps the united states afloat , and the markets and congress guessing today , he announced the outline of a strategy that would allow the treasury to pay out 102 billion to investors on wednesday and thursday , not a bad trick for a country that technically can no longer borrow enough to buy a used car to pull it off , he is juggling accounts in two huge retirement funds , liquidating their investments so that the government has more room to borrow without crossing its 49 trillion debt ceiling he is using those funds because , under legislation passed a decade ago , congress has committed the country to repaying any interest the two funds lose because of financial footwork of this kind but if this standoff lasts for several more weeks or months , mr rubin will find himself running into dubious legal ground and shaky political territory and there is always the lurking possibility that the bond markets , which rose today on the news that default has again been deferred , will suddenly decide that mr rubin has run out of maneuvering room you are watching a very intricate game of poker , with gingrich and the markets occupying the other seats at the table , one of the administration s senior economic officials said the other day and the hand that beats one does n't necessarily beat the other so for mr rubin , the challenge is clear he must constantly proclaim that disaster is nigh , to keep the political pressure on congress and he must constantly keep that disaster a week or so away , to give his boss some room to operate without fear of a backlash for messing with retirement funds entrusted to the government the elements of that strategy are dribbling out piece by piece , as mr rubin shows just enough of his hand to keep the markets calm by early wednesday morning , assuming that no lastminute deal is struck with congress , he will stop investing the federal employees retirement system s fund in government bonds that will allow him to borrow up to 215 billion that has been done before , and it is politically riskfree , because congress passed legislation in 1985 to refund any lost interest to the fund unfortunately for mr rubin , that money will barely get him through the end of the day on wednesday after that , the treasury secretary dips into new territory the same 1985 legislation allows him to declare a fiscal emergency , giving him the right to disinvest the 350 billion civil service retirement and disability fund no one has tried it before , and there are restrictions the amount he can withdraw depends on how long he estimates the emergency the possibility of imminent default will continue the law does not say when , how , or in what amounts the secretary can liquidate the funds , creating more room to borrow , a senior administration official dealing with the issue said today as a result , the treasury is taking the position that the secretary has broad discretion exactly how broad \? mr rubin s aides will not say they are being evasive for several reasons the first is that mr rubin s legal authority will almost certainly be challenged republicans , seeking to tie his hands in the bigger budget battle , are already encouraging suits charging that mr rubin is violating his fiduciary responsibility to the federal employees whose retirement money is stashed in the giant fund the people on behalf of whom the trust fund is held may take an interest , the house majority leader , dick armey , republican of texas , said today mr rubin is likely to respond that while he must protect the retirement fund , he also has a fiduciary responsibility to keep the united states out of default but as time goes on , mr rubin will begin to run out of both political and legal room there are more than 160 other trust funds , but none of the others are protected by legislation insuring that any interest lost in the name of preventing default would eventually be paid back to those funds as a result , president clinton will be loathe to touch that money , knowing it would create an outcry even more complicated is the question of how to keep the markets happy so far , investors have shrugged the whole situation off as insidethebeltway maneuvering as long as mr rubin keeps sending reassuring signals that he can meet the next payment , that view is unlikely to change but the minute the markets get nervous , mr rubin and his sparring partner , speaker newt gingrich , may quickly run out of options neither wants to be blamed for causing a market run , which could be felt by ordinary investors , holders of variablerate mortgages and allies who hold hundreds of billions of dollars in treasury securities in private , mr rubin s aides seem most worried about foreign investors the fear is that those investors will simply not want to take the risk of getting involved in the crossfire between congress and the white house they could voice their protest with their checkbooks , parking their national reserves in other currencies german marks , japanese yen or the currency of a country that does not allow domestic politics to cast a pall on its creditworthiness the reaction of foreign investors , in the end , could be the measure of how much the debtlimit argument has affected american power in an age in which markets speak as loudly as military might
san francisco the x86 architecture is dead ! advanced micro devices' chairman , w j sanders , gloated yesterday , in the aftermath of a remarkable agreement by his company and the intel corporation to end a bitter sevenyear legal battle and go back to designing computer chips the settlement announced late wednesday resulted in a low net cost of 40 million to advanced micro and allowed it to continue making copies of intel s 386 and 486 computer chips on the surface it seems a stunning victory for advanced micro it had lived in intel s shadow throughout the 1980 s and 1990 s while making compatible microprocessors , the chips that are the brains of personal computers and for once , wall street seems to agree with amd the stock , which had been largely ignored despite a string of strong quarters recently , shot up yesterday by 3125 a share , to 3175 , while intel shares rose 875 cents , to 67125 even cyrix , a maker of compatible microprocessors that was not involved in the legal battle gained 375 cents a share to close at 1850 but it is easily possible to hear intel responding , the x86 is dead , long live the x86 ! the x86 the name given to intel s family of microprocessor chips is far from dead , and if intel can stay on track with new generations of the chip , its power in the marketplace may soon be stronger than ever from its first 8080 microprocessor until today s fastest pentium chip , intel has constantly increased the performance of its x86 chip family , adding new features and turning up the clock rate the speed governor for each of its chips in the future it may be even harder to compete with intel , because the microprocessor feature wars are going to accelerate and intel has the financial muscle to finance the factories and designs needed i think intel , through their design labs , is one of the key contributing organizations to the design of future pc desktops , said thomas a thornhill 3d , a semiconductor industry analyst in san francisco computer architectures themselves are composed of the set of instructions that a chip executes and the unique design of the chip s circuitry to compete with intel , such makers of clone chips as advanced micro , nexgen or cyrix have to offer either new features or lower cost or have volume available when intel cannot supply enough chips intel is now raising the stakes on all of those fronts intel is already planning a successor to the pentium , a chip that is codenamed the p6 industry analysts say that the p6 will be the first step in a transition for intel , weaning its customers from the old x86 architecture and adopting many of its rivals' more innovative techniques thus , mr sanders , who is getting ready to introduce his own next generation chip , called the k5 , this year with his company s own microcode , will face competition from intel before he gets the k5 fully into the marketplace according to those who follow the microprocessor market , the p6 will be just as fast and innovative as the k5 as a result , amd will continue to face a difficult uphill struggle amd has some major challenges right now , said david wu , a financial analyst at s g warburg and company those hurdles include designing its own microcode the lowlevel software embedded in a microprocessor that controls how a chip responds to programming instructions for the first time in the past , advanced micro has used its disputed license to intel s microcode , rather than designing its own now with the k5 , it must undertake that task itself , and do it for a chip that is significantly more complex than the pentium together , all of these things spell out new risks for mr sanders at the moment , however , none of this seems to faze the silicon valley executive as my daughter would say , he said yesterday , we 're really stoked
newark , oct 4 in the heart of a gritty urban archdiocese , president clinton and pope john paul ii held a warm facetoface meeting today , a short time after the pope offered a pointed admonishment against current proposals to restrict immigration and limit services for the poor in terms that closely echoed many of mr clinton s own recent warnings from its beginning until now , the united states has been a haven for generation after generation of new arrivals , the pope said minutes after his own arrival at a rainswept newark international airport before the two men repaired to a private meeting and a vespers service at sacred heart cathedral it would indeed be sad if the united states were to turn away from that enterprising spirit which has always sought the most practical and responsible ways of continuing to share with others the blessings god has richly bestowed here with that pointed statement he went on in words that seemed to repeat mr clinton s own warnings that the nation s social safety net must be protected while welfare programs are overhauled the same spirit of creative generosity will help you to meet the needs of your own poor and disadvantaged , the pope added they too have a role to play in building a society truly worthy of the human person a society in which none are so poor that they have nothing to give and none are so rich that they have nothing to receive later , seated on maroon velvet chairs in the residence of archbishop theodore e mccarrick of newark , the two men spent about half an hour reviewing other issues , principally the quest for peace in bosnia and other diplomatic efforts in all , it was a welcome communion for mr clinton aides say he has shared a good personal chemistry with the pontiff though the president s support for abortion rights drew a public rebuke from the pope after their first meeting in denver two years ago their divergent positions on such issues remain sharp points of disagreement the pope s remarks today were , of course , aimed at a nationwide audience , not just mr clinton , and while their impact on unfolding policy debates would be impossible to gauge , it is safe to say that congressional leaders and other politicians will parse them carefully in the current welfare debate , the catholic bishops have been a leading force in arguing for greater sensitivity to the needs of children and the poor in his own remarks , mr clinton spoke effusively of the roman catholic church s tradition of social activism and the pope s support for family rights , noting that today was the feast of st francis of assisi , the champion of the poor , the defender of the defenseless we know that if we value our families , as we must , public policy must also support them , mr clinton said it must see to it that children live free of poverty with the opportunity of a good and decent education if we value our families , we must let them know the dignity of good work with decent wages if we value our families , we must care for them across the generations from the oldest to the youngest the white house spokesman , michael d mccurry , said the congenial tone today reflected the diplomacy both sides had exercised in recent months at the united nations international conference on women in beijing last month , the administration worked with the vatican to emphasize common concerns like human rights and access to education , instead of flashpoints like abortion and contraception photo pope john paul ii was welcomed by president clinton on arrivalyesterday afternoon at newark international airport \( monica almeida the new york times \)
florham park , nj , july 28 he is one of the best blocking tight ends in football if he is n't clicking on all cylinders , the offensive line of the giants is in deep trouble and right now , howard cross is sputtering he will fight through it , of course he is a tough player and it would take a lot to keep him off the field he has not missed a game in his sixyear career and has made 64 consecutive starts but this off season , he had surgery done to repair a torn labrum , a tendon that keeps the shoulder in place structurally , the shoulder seems to be fine , and cross is having his usual good camp but that does n't mean there is no pain the doctors told cross that his shoulder would pretty much be sore the entire season he probably needed more time for it to heal , but with camp , there just was n't time i'm still rehabing it basically , cross said i'm still able to lift weights and play , so thus far there has n't been a problem the only time it really hurts is when i'm lifting weights and after practice , it s sore what is somewhat worrisome is that cross s injury is similar to the one that bothered the former giants quarterback phil simms the key word is similar first , cross s injury is not careerthreatening second , simms s shoulder was in much worse shape than cross s and third , as a quarterback , simms was much more dependent on a full range of motion but there is still cause for concern cross will be sore for most of the season and there is no telling what kind of impact all the hitting and banging will have on him there could be some concern there , said simms , now an analyst for nbc sports but it s a great sign that he can play with it now if he can keep from getting any setbacks from training camp until the season starts , he 'll be fine he 'll be over the hump but if he gets hurt now , there could be problems now , cross is bothered by minor nuisances he must ice the shoulder before and after practice and it is constantly sore the soreness and having to ice it all the time will be a pain , said cross i'm not a big fan of ice but whatever the coaches ask me to do , i 'll be able to do currently the giants have four tight ends hbacks on their roster they will probably keep three cross , aaron pierce , and brian kozlowski pierce and kozlowski are slotted as hbacks , which is a kind of combination tight end and fullback either player can play tight end and herschel walker might play some hback as well but none can block nearly as well as cross if cross goes down , it would be a huge blow to the team but he has rarely gone down , and that s what makes him so special if cross can have a good season , fighting through this injury will only enhance a solid career entering its seventh season cross , 6 feet 5 inches and 260 pounds , is already seen as a player who will play through almost any pain he takes amazingly good care of his body and he has rarely been seriously injured considering that his job is 90 percent blocking and 10 percent pass catching , it is amazing he has not been to the doctor s office more his blocking is tremendous , said simms if it s not the best in the league , it is definitely one of the top two or three we 're talking about a big man here the average person ca n't understand how big he is when i first came into the league , he would have been a big tackle extra points negotiations with running back tyrone wheatley , the giants' top pick , will continue into next week giants coaches are beginning to get irritated by his holdout offensive tackle jumbo elliott worked out on friday he looked good and his back is fine , for now hback aaron pierce dislocated a finger but is not expected to miss any time
hartford , may 4 provoking the toughest confirmation battle of his young administration , gov john g rowland has nominated five people to the state board of education who are so controversial that it almost appears he was looking for a fight mr rowland has chosen four whites and a colombian woman to replace three blacks , one puerto rican and one white this would mean the ninemember board would have no representatives of the state s two largest minority groups , blacks and puerto ricans , at a time when many in connecticut are concerned about the state s commitment to improving education for minority students in addition , two of mr rowland s nominees have devoted their careers to private schools and have no experience in public schools in the most controversial selection , mr rowland tapped kay wall , a parentteacher association leader from greenwich , who last year led a successful drive to defeat a sweeping educational change proposal championed by the business community , education professionals and legislative leaders while mr rowland says criticism of mrs wall stems from her backtobasics educational philosophy and her advocacy of local control , critics say she is a demagogue who has ties to the christian right , charges that mrs wall angrily denies in one of the strongest criticisms of the nominees , state comptroller nancy wyman , a democrat and the former cochairwoman of the legislature s education committee , sent a letter to lawmakers saying she was shocked , disturbed and saddened by the governor s action if his nominees are confirmed , she said , the state board will be put in the hands of people whose commitment to public education is , at best , suspect , and , at worst , who do not share our basic belief in educational opportunity confirmation hearings for the five are scheduled for friday , and the two state teachers unions , the black and puerto rican legislative caucus , the state association of public school superintendents and the connecticut parentteacher association have voiced strong reservations about some of the nominees and house speaker thomas d ritter , the leader of the democratcontrolled house of representatives , has expressed dismay over the slate s lack of diversity the nominations were made on april 24 unlike other executive appointments , which require a vote by only one chamber of the general assembly , nominees to the education board must be acted on by both chambers the board selects the commissioner of education and sets policy for the public schools and their more than 500 , 000 students besides mrs wall , 49 , who established a statewide parents group , save our schools , to protest legislation that would have instituted new state educational standards , mr rowland has nominated toni boucher , 45 , of wilton , former chairwoman of the town s board of education janet m finneran , 50 , of bethany , a biology teacher in the cheshire public schools timothy j mcdonald , 48 , of waterbury , the principal of holy cross high school , and amparo adibsamii , 54 , a spanish instructor at suffield academy , a private school ms adibsamii is a native of colombia mr rowland defended his slate today , saying he had chosen the best people available , regardless of background i have spoken with some legislators of color and asked them for names , and they have n't submitted any , he said several lawmakers were angered by his remark , saying that state representative annette w carter , the leader of the black and puerto rican caucus , had given a stack of resumes to mr rowland s office for these and other appointments they said it was not the responsibility of minority lawmakers to find qualified applicants if the rowland administration was truly color blind , this would not have happened , said state senator toni harp , a democrat and a caucus member last month , mr rowland offended civil rights advocates by brandishing a champagne bottle to celebrate the state s victory in the landmark school desegregation case , sheff v o'neill the decision relieved the state of any obligation to address the isolation of black and hispanic children in hartford schools , though mr rowland promised to continue to push voluntary measures to desegregate schools state senator catherine welles cook , a republican , said that given the state s commitment to such voluntary steps , it was vital for mr rowland to be creating role models and getting as many perspectives as possible on the school board racial balance should have been considered , she said some lawmakers went so far as to say that the lack of blacks and puerto ricans was a politically calculated move , a gesture intended to win mr rowland points with conservative constituents who bridle at the suggestion of quotas the republican game book relishes being attacked for lack of diversity , because that plays into the politics of the moment , said state senator kevin sullivan , a democrat lawmakers said it would be unusual for the legislature to reject a governor s nominees , and added that the two nominees with public school experience , ms boucher and ms finneran , are not expected to have much difficulty ms adibsammi and mr mcdonald , whose experience is entirely in private schools , are expected to face closer scrutiny , though a few pivotal legislators said they felt it was appropriate to give private schools representation on the board , given mr rowland s support for providing state money to private schools to educate more students mrs wall s critics said that she unfairly portrayed last year s proposals for new educational standards as a conspiracy of education professionals to lower standards in schools , eliminate grades and abandon teaching a traditional body of facts , such as multiplication tables some critics said her organization has ties to focus on the family , a christian right organization but mrs wall denied that and insisted that she never stretched the truth there are a tremendous number of people who are in absolute agreement with what i stand for high academic achievement and local control , she said
san diego , april 4 his words sounded like those of a prizefighter psyching himself up for an especially loathsome rival ok , rockne , come on out , put them up , boy , he said , his voice low and edgy and ominous i'm ready right now sitting at the table in a modest apartment in the city s la jolla section overlooking the pacific ocean was not mike tyson or george foreman , but kary b mullis , the nobel prizewinning scientist who is expected to be a vital defense witness in the murder trial of o j simpson dr mullis won the 1993 nobel prize for chemistry for inventing one of molecular biology s most powerful tools , the polymerase chainreaction technique , or pcr , which allows scientists to identify even a fragment of the dna genetic code and then reproduce it virtually an infinite number of times the movie jurassic park , based on michael crichton s fictional account of recreating dinosaurs from ancient dna , drew upon this technique dr mullis s formidable scientific credentials could prove crucial when prosecutors present the results of dna tests done on blood samples found at the crime site and at mr simpson s home in the brentwood section of los angeles the prosecution says the tests convincingly identify him as the killer dr mullis is expected to explain why he feels the tests , which he considers himself an expert on , should not be relied upon with so much at stake at the moment , dr mullis is preparing for a confrontation with rockne harmon , a simpson prosecutor and dna expert mr harmon , who has a reputation as a prickly and tenacious interrogator , has intimated that should dr mullis take the witness stand , he intends to discredit the scientist by bringing up his welldocumented fondness for drinking and illicit drugs dr mullis , who says he has pretty much abandoned scientific research to devote himself to surfing , reading , chasing women and hallucinogens , makes no apologies for his unorthodox habits and cravings prosecutors have hinted that they are particularly interested in several 1990 incidents in which dr mullis was accused of beating his estranged wife in a plea bargain , he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was ordered to undergo counseling and attend meetings of alcoholics anonymous but none of that , mr mullis insists , is the least bit relevant to the simpson trial i like a good debate , and i like sticks and stones , he said , but i do n't really think it belongs in this case and should mr harmon take a detour away from issues regarding the reliability of dna to question mr mullis about his private life , i will respond in kind , and i have been known not to be easily crossexamined , dr mullis said he continued , in tumbling scraps of sentences if little mr harmon thinks he s going to shine in his crossexamination by attacking me , he s got another think coming if he starts to play that kind of ball , and he very likely will , he s an idiot dr mullis , a slightly rumpled , unpretentious and curiously pugnacious figure , has long been a scientific renegade even , some say , a little loony last september he was banned from speaking at the european society for clinical investigation , one of the continent s leading research bodies , after illustrating a lecture with a slide he had taken of a naked woman lit up with colored lights john martin , the society s president , wrote a letter to the magazine nature complaining that mr mullis had decreased the nobility of the nobel prize he also accused him of being a corrupting influence on young scientists dr mullis is unrepentant if everybody likes you then something is really wrong , he said my past is full if you want to look for skeletons in a closet , come look in some of my closets i 've got eight dead penguins back in there , but they 're all plastic but it is not only his eccentricities and unabashed hedonism that trouble some of his colleagues he has compounded his sins with againstthegrain scientific theories for example , he does not believe that aids is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus it s very hard to say this absolutely , i know this , but from my observations of what there is published , there is no scientifically defensible evidence to support these contentions that hiv is the probable cause of aids not surprisingly , that argument has caused considerable consternation dr mullis recalled , with visible annoyance , a recent scientific meeting at which someone he hardly knew came right up to me and lit into me because of my opinions about hiv and he said , 'just because you 're a nobel prize winner you think you can talk about everything' he did n't know that i had spent two or three years doing little else but reading the literature dr mullis continued i 've probably read more different things than anybody about aids , except for a few other people and i might be the only one who is right , because i 've done the work his own theory is that aids results from exposure to a large number of viruses and bacteria
mexico city , nov 4 doctors are struggling to identify a mysterious disease in the dirtpoor backlands of northwestern nicaragua whose victims die suffocated by their own blood according to the world health organization , 18 people have died and more than 1 , 000 suspected cases have been reported in the epidemic , which first appeared in the farming village of achuapa in rugged hills about 50 miles northwest of managua , the capital researchers in nicaragua and at the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta have determined , based on samples from the victims , that the illness is not hemorrhagic dengue fever , a disease accompanied by agonizing bone pain that is already endemic in nicaragua they have also ruled out yellow fever , another disease that , like dengue , is carried by mosquitoes those stricken by the unidentified illness suffer from high fever , severe abdominal pain and body ache , all symptoms of dengue as well but the patients also develop severe hemorrhaging , which fills their lungs with blood without treatment , they suffocate in three or four days , doctors in nicaragua who are treating the disease said today last week president violeta chamorro declared a medical emergency in the country , and the health ministers of the five central american nations convened on friday to discuss the epidemic medical investigators do not know what causes the disease or how it is transmitted but it does not appear to be passed through the air or by personal contact , a spokesman for the pan american health organization , daniel epstein , said by telephone from managua researchers suspect there may be an animal carrier for the disease , which has been tentatively named achuapa febrile syndrome , but have not ruled out a mutation of some familiar virus achuapa is in a region of dry hardscrabble hills where water and food are scarce but torrential rains spun off from an unusual series of caribbean hurricanes in recent months washed rats and cockroaches from their holes and provided new breeding grounds for mosquitoes and countless other tropical insects the epidemic has spread to other towns near achuapa but does not appear to have spread outside the region , mr epstein said patients are being treated at the teaching hospital in leon , the largest city in the area if they come to us right away , we can save them , the hospital director , dr donald quintana fajardo , said by telephone from leon but nicaraguans have a machismo complex where we pretend there is nothing wrong with us they only come to the hospital at the last minute dr quintana said 133 patients suspected of having the disease were under treatment in leon with intravenous liquids and blood and treatment to control the fever , doctors have succeeded in stopping the onset of bleeding in the lungs , he said but blood components needed for treatment are in critically short supply a team of physicians from the world health organization , the pan american health organization , the nicaraguan health ministry and the government of cuba are scouting the achuapa hills to detect patients and possible carriers in the early years of the rule of the sandinista national liberation front in the 1980 s , government health programs were greatly expanded but years of war with the contra rebels , who were backed by the united states , sapped the public health system the government of president chamorro has not received the aid from the united states or other countries that she expected , and the economy has remained stalled , forcing her to limit public services the living conditions in achuapa are deplorable , dr quintana said none of their basic needs are satisfied this year almost 11 , 000 cases of dengue were reported in nicaragua , and cholera is also endemic map of nicaragua showing location of achuapa
if you 're interested in the process by which musicals sometimes get made , you may want to catch harold prince s production of the petrified prince playing at martinson hall in the joseph papp public theater until jan 15 when i saw the show two nights before its official opening , it was a mess but , in this case , a certain amount of mess is allowed though the petrified prince looks as if it cost a mint , and though the 27 cast members never miss cues or collide on stage , this is a workshop production one of those early realizations of a stage piece that allows the various collaborators to see what they have done , to judge audience reactions and to decide whether the work will continue as a disinterested onlooker , i might suggest that the petrified prince be dumped , feet first , into the hudson but then i might have said the same thing if i 'd seen kiss of the spider woman , also directed by mr prince , when it was done in an early production at purchase , ny , in 1990 the word then was that the musical was a disaster yet the collaborators persevered today , 19 months after its broadway opening and with seven tony awards to its credit , kiss of the spider woman is still going strong at the broadhurst so much for the suggestions of disinterested onlookers the petrified prince , as it now plays , is a confusion of contradictory impulses , some of which have been dimly realized , and none of which have an easily recognized point in addition to mr prince , the principal collaborators are edward gallardo , who adapted the book from an unproduced screenplay by ingmar bergman , and michael john lachiusa , who wrote the words and music the show is part operetta , part fairy tale and part satire about the kind of affairs of church and state that have n't been relevant since the french revolution the time is 1807 and the locale the mythical kingdom of slavonia , a place you might expect to find groucho marx ready to ravage instead of a mildmannered napoleon \( alan braunstein \) as napoleon covets slavonia to make his sweep across europe a clean one , pope pius vii \( ralph byers \) and cardinal pointy \( timothy jerome \) are after slavonia s treasury , while the vaguely defined roberta \( loni ackerman \) hopes to seize its throne and these are just the subsidiary characters at the center of the show are slavonia s sexually voracious queen katarina \( candy buckley \) , a former viennese whore , and her son , the virginal prince samson \( alexander gaberman \) he has been catatonic and unable to walk since his mother murdered his beloved tutor , one of the book s many red herrings and a character who s dispatched even before the show starts can you keep all this straight \?

hempstead , li , aug 8 it is not the fear the jets suffered in the paranoid final days of the joe walton regime at the end of the 1980 s a healthier fear seems to drive the jets under coach rich kotite , who demands accountability and fear of failure has helped a littleknown specialteams player named victor green move up in kotite s esteem and on the depth chart in fact , green will probably play with the defense close to full time when the jets meet the eagles on saturday night in jackson , miss green watched as kotite dropped , traded or lost to free agency 10 starters during the off season green wondered about his own job i was a free agent , played here two years and then it seemed i was a free agent again when rich kotite came , green said i had to prove myself all over again green , voted the honorary title of specialteams captain by his teammates after last season , is a secondstring defensive back he was in for only 10 percent of the jets' defensive plays last season , but will get a chance to become the jets' new nickel back , if not an outright shot at starting , especially since otis smith has a shoulder injury i liked what he showed me against tampa bay , said kotite of saturday night s preseason opener , won by the jets over the buccaneers , 93 he was all over the place we 've got to get him playing time green forced a fumble and produced three tackles in the game essentially , he played as he practices every day is an audition today the audition continued as he deflected several passes while playing safety that s the mentality i 've got to have , green said so when i came to camp i did n't want the coaches to say , 'here s victor green , backup' green is n't the only player auditioning ryan yarborough and stevie anderson are listed as the starting wide receivers , with orlando parker just behind them none had caught a pass before last year but kotite has promised the inexperienced receivers two games as the main performers at their positions the jets will almost certainly pick up an experienced wide receiver within the next two weeks unless something extraordinary happens to change kotite s mind , such as the young receivers suddenly becoming factors like green , the receivers have been given another opportunity that s all i ever wanted , said green i had this dream as a kid growing up in americus , ga that s where dan reeves comes from , you know i told my mom i wanted to play in the big leagues , and she told me i had to work hard she works in a factory my father is a painter he joined the jets in 1993 after graduating from akron , where he had been a star defensive back he got no further than the jets' special teams , though his career consisted of running up and down the field chasing kick returners but he got very good at it i was getting double and tripleteamed near the end of last season , he said players from the other teams were coming over to me before the games and telling me , 'watch yourself the coaches want us to get you' still , he had to start all over again this year but so did many other jets i see a lot more guys running to the ball now , he said this is hardnosed football nothing s certain extra points donna hanover giuliani has skated with the rangers' mark messier and called the post parade at belmont for channel 5 s good day new york program on tuesday , she kicked with nick lowery and caught passes from boomer esiason i 've always been a football fan and rudy s been a baseball fan , she said , referring to her husband , mayor rudolph w giuliani she is doing a segment on football techniques for next tuesday s show , and turned out in a jets jersey with a no 1 esiason sent her out on a passing pattern do n't run too far , he cautioned i ca n't throw the ball downfield photo an impressive performance in the jets' preseason opener may lead to more playing time for victor green \( vic delucia the new york times \)
well , it looks like congress is going to stop this flag desecration that s been going on going on somewhere not sure where anymore went on all the time everywhere , though , back in vietnam war days at least everywhere a television camera caught an antiwar demonstrator in its view finder congress is going to fix that next time there s a vietnam war there s going to be none of that burning the flag , none of that sewing the flag on the seat of your pants and sitting on it congress is going to amend the constitution to stop it that s right the constitution itself the big parchment going to amend it now , now , none of that talk about congress being on a constitutionamending toot congress does n't go on toots just because it s spent half the year trying to amend this noble document noblest of all documents you ca n't call that an amending toot is it a toot when congress comes out for the flag \? congress standing up and voting for the flag , is that a toot \? a congress has the courage to sit there in washington inside the beltway , mind you the beltway ! has the guts to sit there inside that beltway and tell america it loves the flag is that your idea of a toot \? when the house of representatives democrats and republicans by the dozen voted against flag abuse by amending the constitution that was no toot just plain old courage now it s up to the senate to stand and be counted the famous old veteran capitol observers are saying it looks like the senate probably will muster up the courage to move the amendment right along to the states so flag burners can feel the iron hand of the law next time they decorate the seat of their pants with old glory sure , a lot of congressmen and senators will probably be voted out of office next election for showing the courage to stand up to those who would say to hell with the flag ! and what is it that makes them willing to risk their careers \? what gives them such courage \? it s as simple as this congress loves the flag loves mother too , of course and loves home at least the american home provided it is a twoparent home and neither parent is an immigrant or on welfare there s a good chance , if the flag amendment flies all the way through , that congress will be encouraged to push for a homeandmother amendment to the constitution the idea already has a lot of supporters willing to stand up and be counted against the homeandmother hate bloc these brave solons and solonesses have n't yet decided though whether to fight for one homeandmother amendment that would make it a crime to desecrate home and mother there s some fear that lumping home and mother in one amendment might bring the home haters and the mother haters into a coalition that would make it impossible to pass the amendment some think it would be politically smarter to go for separate amendments one dealing with home desecration , the other with mother desecration the big question of course is , is it fair to ask congressmen to risk political ruin by coming out for the flag , then ask them to go back once more into that deadly breach by coming out for home and mother \? the word from those famous old veteran capitol observers is that it would take more guts than anybody has a right to expect of a congressman with an election year just around the corner most likely , they 're saying at the capitol , congress will exhaust most of its courage this year in the struggle to save the flag if these brave men and brave women survive the fury of the voters next year , they may just possibly have enough fight left to stand up for a home amendment in the following congress most think the mother amendment will never make it , though too many mothers nowadays belong to the singlemother variety for congress , that s pushing motherhood beyond the limit
'the last incarnation' it s been two and a half months since jerry garcia died , a period just long enough to allow for the usual slew of memorial books and records to be put together coming soon to stores is a benefit album , an avantgarde tribute to mr garcia s music recorded by henry kaiser , a guitarist and friend of the grateful dead among the many new books coming is rolling stone s garcia , a collection of articles about him published in the magazine in fact , the grateful dead bassist phil lesh has even been in the studio working on his own version of a tribute i'm looking for a live tape that we can release from the band that just came to a close , the last incarnation of the grateful dead , he said , then corrected himself not the final incarnation , but the last up to now i 've got about five years of performances to look through to find a representative concert most notable among already released grateful deadrelated projects are two albums that were in the works before garcia died they are the music never stopped roots of the grateful dead \( released on shanachie two days ago \) , which compiles original versions of other artists' songs that the dead perform in concert , and hundred year hall \( released on grateful dead arista records at the beginning of the month \) , a tworecord set capturing a topnotch live show in 1972 the music never stopped is a valuable exploration of the dead s allamerican roots , though mr lesh confessed to never having heard several of these versions of the songs the music includes the folk singer obray ramsey performing rain and snow , bobby \( blue \) bland s turn on your love light , cannon s jug stompers playing big railroad blues and bob dylan s it s all over now , baby blue mr kaiser , who produced the album and plans to compile two to four sequels , said that this was the first compilation in which mr dylan had ever allowed one of his songs to be included he did it in exchange for some 78 records from the president of shanachie , mr kaiser said hundred year hall features the flexible improvising of a transitional lineup of the grateful dead , from a time when its second drummer , mickey hart , was on hiatus and the band used two keyboardists , ron \( pigpen \) mckernan and keith godchaux , both of whom later died \( more information on the grateful dead s fast living can be found in living with the dead , the new book by the band s former manager rock scully \) other posthumously released garcia recordings include blue incantation \( akar rain dog \) , on which he joins the indian guitarist sanjay mishra for three songs , and the soundtrack to smoke , with two songs performed by the jerry garcia band garcia also played in an impromptu band called second sight with the dead members bob weir and vince welnick , plus mr kaiser and bob bralove the record , visions of the vortex , is to be released on shanachie early next year the fate of two other garcia recordings , a song for a jimmie rodgers tribute album and instrumental tracks for a new grateful dead album , remains uncertain as for the future of the grateful dead , mr lesh said there s all kinds of stuff , but nothing that s more than a proposal on paper now this is a period of transition everything has changed , but you 'll see us again classical , not classic eric matthews s debut album , it s heavy in here \( sub pop \) , is out of step with almost every other current pop music release the music sounds clean and refined , with soft singing augmented by string and brass instruments , all composed , arranged , even conducted at times by mr matthews it is not classic or alternative rock , but classical rock , informed by brahms and brian wilson , rachmaninoff and david sylvian mr matthews , 26 , is a pop rarity , and he knows it there are eras when my music would have been accepted popularly , he said , speaking by telephone from his home in oregon but i think this time needs me there must be other people who are utterly frustrated with the climate of noisemakers in music today and the lack of dignity in the young people making music it s odd , then , that mr matthews s new record was released by sub pop , the seattle label on which noisy grunge bands like nirvana and soundgarden started out they 're the enemy , mr matthews said of sub pop they have worked in a musical direction that i deem as fairly worthless but they just might be the best possible label i could be on everybody there , unless they 're lying to me , says they love the record before trying to foist classical values on a rock audience , mr matthews studied trumpet at the san francisco conservatory of music and led a brass quintet he dropped out after two years and spent time in boston , where he recorded an excellent album of soft , pristine pop under the name cardinal with an australian musician named richard davies on his new album , he further defines the intersection where the selfstyled pop arrangers of the 60 s , the newwave romantics of the 90 s and the chambermusic composers of the 19th century meet recording this album was a big experience for me because it was my first time actually conducting my work , he said this concept of eric matthews as arranger and orchestrator is fairly new i did n't think it would happen until some day in my old age i expect with each record i have you 'll hear less drums and guitar until there s none and sub pop will drop me
to the editor re cuba time to change direction \( editorial , march 19 \) the claim that trade and contact will bring about the end of the castro regime ignores facts that make the argument inapplicable to cuba fidel castro has taken no steps that would allow increased trade and contact to lead to political or economic liberalization instead , any hard currency from united states trade and investment , and multilateral development loans that would follow , would substitute for reform the cuban government controls every industry that generates significant hard currency , including agriculture , mining , medical supplies and tourism almost none of the hard currency generated by foreign companies reaches ordinary cubans foreign companies in cuba are not permitted to hire employees except through communist partycontrolled agencies the government pays these workers the equivalent of 5 a month in pesos cubans themselves cannot hire employees , buy supplies from nonstate sources or protect earnings from arbitrary confiscation by government squads created by decree to seize assets of those deemed unduly wealthy if , as the argument goes , the purpose of rapprochement with mr castro would be to get money into the hands of ordinary cubans , make them less dependent on the regime and enable them to support institutions independent of state control , like political parties , newspapers , church groups , and professional and labor organizations , the argument is settled mr castro is not permitting it investors from france , spain and mexico have been providing crucial support for the castro regime for years , yet there is no benefit to ordinary citizens it is curious that you present cuba s military threat as a paranoid fantasy cuba may not pose the same military threat it once did , but mr castro s inclinations apparently remain unchanged in november a russian military delegation led by the chief of staff of russia s armed forces visited havana to discuss , among other things , the creation of a joint weapons production facility russia is also providing 200 million annually in continued financing for cuba s eavesdropping facility at lourdes unsafe sovietera nuclear power plants are the subject of a possible french renovation project the attempt to ascribe continued support for the embargo and other anticastro measures solely to senator jesse helms is inaccurate , and you should know better twenty senators , including bob dole and me , not to mention the democrats charles robb , joseph lieberman and ernest hollings , support continued pressure on mr castro by cosponsoring the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity bill connie mack us senator from florida washington , march 20 , 1995
vilified from the outside as provocateurs of yitzhak rabin s assassination and roiled from within by selfexamination , the orthodox jewish community has been profoundly shaken by the slaying and divided over how to respond the sense of siege among the orthodox is evident in new york , having grown steadily since mr rabin s death two weeks ago , with reports of men wearing yarmulkes being called murderer in the city , as in israel proponents of the peace agreements in israel have attributed the assassination partly to the charged rhetoric used by some religious opponents of mr rabin s policies as prime minister consternation over the assassination by a 25yearold jewish student can be heard on the streets of brooklyn , the base of orthodox judaism in the united states i do n't know what kind of orthodox people they are , leslie loewy , 71 , a pocketbook salesman in borough park whose family was wiped out in the holocaust , said of the killer and his coconspirators it s not a jewish way , that s for sure orthodox organizations in recent days have gone on the offensive , condemning the assassination and expressing outrage that , in their view , their entire community is being portrayed as sympathetic with yigal amir , the confessed killer they are garbed in our attire , they look like us , but they are not us , rabbi rafael g grossman , president of the rabbinical council of america , said of extremists who support mr amir signs of a purging by the orthodox movement are evident , from admissions of incendiary language in the peace debate to the shunning of rabbi abraham hecht by his brooklyn congregation because of a statement in june that was interpreted as sanctioning the killing of anyone giving away israeli land rabbi hecht said on friday that in october he had sent a letter of apology to mr rabin rabbi grossman said his organization planned to monitor the rhetoric of rabbis and other community leaders more closely in the last two weeks , his group has warned two rabbis to tone down their speech to guard against being interpreted as condoning violence the arrest of orthodox men in connection with the assassination and a small minority of religious jews voicing support for the slaying have prompted some orthodox leaders to call for a selfexamination where have we gone wrong in raising a generation who are both idealistic but whose idealistic sensibilities can distort values \? asked norman lamm , the president of yeshiva university , in the washington heights section of manhattan , the most prominent orthodox college in the united states the public debate among factions of orthodox jews and especially the statements of regret and embarrassment are highly unusual for a strain of judaism that views itself as exceptionally pious and exists largely in an insular world we took for granted that no one would allow political values to overwhelm the basic respect for human life , rabbi lamm said he said that he advocated soulsearching by orthodox jews but that to accept blame for mr rabin s death would be ludicrous aaron soloveichik , a renowned jewish scholar and teacher , said , i , to a certain extent , feel guilty because i did n't try enough to hammer into the minds and hearts of my students the barbarity of bloodshed added rabbi marc angel of the spanish and portuguese synagogue in manhattan if he was a lone assassin , we could just say he was a nut but now they 've arrested six or seven other people and we hear people are sympathetic to him in orthodoxy at large , there s kind of a loose cannon we have n't been successful at stopping this rabbi lamm and other heads of religious schools said they were looking for ways to reemphasize the basic lessons of tolerance and the sanctity of life in their curriculums but other orthodox jews , particularly those who are more insular , see this talk largely as selfflagellation , as one brooklyn rabbi said in their view , there is less reason for more centrist orthodox jews to look for fault within themselves rabbi morris sherer , the president of agudath israel , an international organization of traditional orthodox jews based in manhattan , agreed that emotional rhetoric on both sides of the peace debate was dangerous because verbal violence can lead to real violence but he said none of us feel guilty about the assassination because there was no chance of moderating the radical fringe i would never give these people credibility by even talking to them , he said others go further in washing their hands of responsibility there is no sense of guilt whatsoever , said rabbi moshe david tendler , a professor of ethics and talumdic law at yeshiva university we did n't do anything wrong but rabbi tendler is seen by some moreliberal orthodox jews as embodying a rigidity that causes antagonism within the orthodox he has said israel s peace agreements are contrary to jewish law because they expose israelis to increased danger and risk lives in the short term with the hope more lives will be saved in the future \( he stops short of calling for punishment for those involved in the peace agreements \)
nicholas w leeson , the young trader linked to the 136 billion in losses that brought down barings plc , said that in a single day he could make or lose more than 50 million , and that to his astonishment , his superiors in london kept funneling him money because they wanted to believe he would somehow come out a winner when the kobe earthquake rocked the japanese stock market and wiped out his investments early this year , he said , he made up stories and forged documents to convince barings executives in london that his bets were covered and that there was little risk to his surprise , he said , barings kept sending him huge amounts of money daily , ultimately 1 billion more than the 232yearold bank was worth he made the remarks in an interview with david frost for the british broadcasting corporation , parts of which were shown last night on cbs s 60 minutes it was his first interview since he fled singapore , where he had been based , in february to me , the first day that i asked for funding , there should have been massive alarm bells ringing , he said in the excerpt shown on cbs the interview was taped in a prison in frankfurt , where he has been held since his capture on march 2 addressing one of the most puzzling questions about the supervision by senior management , he said it was advantageous to me that the people , the senior people in london that were arranging these payments , did n't understand the basic administration of futures and options , and that was probably the biggest failing they wanted to believe he added that because of the profits , they were n't willing to question , or they were less inclined to question looking thin and wearing an opennecked gray shirt , mr leeson said that his downfall began when he discovered he could hide his losses from his bosses in london because he was not only the chief trader but also the bookkeeper he said he had hidden losses since 1992 though he lied to management , he said , the amounts he needed from london were so huge , amounting to 1 billion at the peak , that he was amazed that management did not catch on mr leeson , who is 28 , described his role in trading derivatives as similar to being in a casino there are a lot of similarities with gamblers , he said unfortunately , i lost more than i won as stupid as it may sound , none of this is really real money it s not as if you have cash sitting in front of you , he said there were days when i could lose 25 to 30 million \( 39 million to 46 million \) there were days when i made 50 million \( 77 million \) not every day is a down day i have nothing to hide i'm the guy who wants to go to jail now i understand what i 've done but i do n't think of myself as a criminal , he added i did n't steal any money i 've certainly misled people but it never entered my mind not once that barings would fold as a result it s not like it s the first time that it has happened , and i presume that it wo n't be the last , he said i 'd like to sit down with the regulators and talk about what i specifically did , give my ideas about how it can be combated barings collapsed on feb 26 , after it could no longer cover its losses ten days later , most of its assets were acquired by a dutch bank , internationale nederlanden groep , or ing mr leeson is battling extradition to singapore , where he carried out his transactions and where he faces 12 charges of fraud and forgery , which carry a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison he has sought to have himself extradited to britain instead last week he was interviewed by investigators from britain s serious fraud office , which investigates whitecollar crimes the sunday times of london reported that mr leeson failed to convince the investigators that he should be brought back to britain and that a decision on whether to seek his extradition to britain would be made early this week a german court is expected to rule in the next few weeks whether it should accept the extradition request by singapore mr leeson s losses apparently kept mounting during 1994 , but he kept up a front that everything was normal , going to the track and the cricket club because he reported only profits and was able to hide his losses , he said , he became a star , earning big bonuses early this year , however , the losses became so great from his incorrect bets that the japanese stock market and interest rates would go up that it became difficult to keep up the good impression , he said it was n't fun at all , he said i hated every minute of it i mean , you know i was looking at massive figures , massive losses every day i had to keep up the pretense by the time the auditors at barings began to break through his screen of deception in february , he said , he was avoiding reality i was hiding from the figure , he continued i was in a situation where i was n't asking for the running balance it scared me to death , he added and i just did n't want to know it was the scariest thing in my life photo nicholas w leeson , whose trading is said to have brought down barings bank , is being held at a prison in frankfurt as he fights extradition to singapore recently he was interviewed for the bbc \( 60 minutes \)
when a manhattanbound subway train rearended another one in brooklyn this month , transit officials explained apologetically that the track would have been cleared more quickly if the accident had occurred a decade ago back then , work crews had much more practice at removing derailed wrecks thirteen years and more than 20 billion into an ambitious rebuilding effort , the subways have come a long way from the time when the system was a staple of jokes and a symbol of a city in decline the trains are faster , cleaner and far more reliable , ridership is up and dozens of stations have been made over but transit officials and advocates are fearful of the new austerity in city hall , albany and washington although officials say they hope to make enough service and administrative cuts to preserve the 125 subway and bus fare at least for now they are much more worried about the system s longterm health they speak darkly of a return to the early 1980 s , when a dwindling number of passengers waited on crumbling platforms for trains that were likely to be late and slow , if they had not broken down or derailed there are times that you look back on and say , 'this was the moment that made things the way they are , ' said barry l feinstein , a board member of the metropolitan transportation authority , the regional agency that administers the subways , buses and commuter railroads right now will turn out to be one of those times i'm not ready to say we 're headed for a fall , but many things are in danger this could be the moment that triggers erosion again peter s kalikow , an mta board member who headed gov george e pataki s transition effort on transportation issues , said the agency must brace itself for a sea change it is a turning point , no doubt about it , said mr kalikow , a real estate developer and former owner of the new york post but while transit officials are pessimistic about the future of the rebuilding effort , how deep any cuts will be , and what will be cut , remains anybody s guess the mta s plans for the next two years include renovation of more than a dozen stations including those at main street in flushing , queens , 161st streetyankee stadium in the bronx , and flatbush avenue in brooklyn major reconstruction of the workhorse stations at times square and atlantic avenue in brooklyn , replacement of hundreds of antique signals and switches and installation of new turnstiles at 400 stations to accommodate the new electronic fare card starting in 1997 , transit officials hope to renovate more subway stations , like west 72d street at broadway and 42d street at avenue of the americas , and buy new subway trains for the first time in a decade they also intend to rebuild the franklin avenue shuttle in brooklyn , which is in worse condition than any other part of the system peter e stangl , the mta chairman , said that with 17 billion set aside for capital projects , work will proceed as planned this year but he makes no promises for 1996 and beyond we are at a threshold here , he said the next few months are going to be pretty critical large cuts have real consequences , and none of us should pretend they do n't there are similar worries about other arms of the mta the city s bus system is scheduled to get 1 , 800 new buses and electronic fare boxes in the next two years , the long island rail road is to get new doubledecker coaches , and new tracks are planned by metronorth but it is the subways , by far the nation s largest mass transit system , that are in the greatest danger we 're afraid that what we 're looking at is the end of the city , state and federal partnership and the commitment that brought the subways back from the brink of collapse , said gene russianoff , staff attorney for the straphangers campaign , a rider advocate group the city has cut its 600 million subsidy for daily operations by 128 million , forcing officials to shelve an ambitious plan for monthly passes and free or discounted subwaytobus transfers , which were among the main reasons for bringing in the fare card , and to consider ways of cutting service in addition , the governor has seized 220 million in surplus funds that had been earmarked for all mta operations , and he has proposed cutting the regional agency s operating subsidy by 128 million per year transit authority officials will go to albany today to discuss its finances predicting what will become of capital projects is more difficult privately , local and state officials say the state will cut money for renovations , but beyond blocking 690 million in borrowing by the transit authority , governor pataki has not yet shown his hand and some prominent republicans , like state senator norman j levy of merrick , li , chairman of the senate transportation committee , say they do n't know what the governor intends with a new republican majority in congress , support from the federal government , which has provided about a quarter of the money used to rebuild the subways , is expected to drop , though no one knows how much mr stangl refused to say what projects would be the first to go , insisting that they are all valuable postponing station renovations would an unpopular choice , as was demonstrated last year , when the mta dropped 17 stations from the current rebuilding plan , citing cost overruns and the loss of 500 million in capital money that the city said it could not afford to contribute the move was bitterly protested by the affected communities , and the mta reinstated one station , at main street in flushing , under pressure from the giuliani administration
under most circumstances , beating a winless , lastplace team would not spur a celebration in the home rink of the stanley cup champions but the rangers were on a threegame losing streak , and their fans were disgruntled everyone cheered up when two key rangers sparked a goal explosion to lead new york to a 62 victory over the ottawa senators last night at madison square garden the first star was adam graves , the rugged left wing who is rebounding from back surgery after leading the team last season in goals with 52 he came into the game with only one goal in five contests their other notable scorer was petr nedved , their stylish new center , who had none in that span and was showing frustration after missing several good chances by the time they were finished with the senators , graves had three more and nedved had his first two in ranger blue it s a relief for everybody , not just myself , said nedved coach colin campbell said graves feels a lot of pressure to repeat what he did last year he added that graves could n't let october back surgery change his gritty style adam not only has to hit , he has to take hits , campbell said graves said he was n't feeling pressure , but he told himself keep going to the net keep going to the net keep whacking away graves scored his first goal at 6 minutes 35 seconds of the first period after taking a pass from mark messier , he fired a long shot that changed directions when it hit defenseman stan neckar and sailed past don beaupre that gave the rangers a 10 lead he scored his second at 6 58 of the second period after breaking up ice with messier he banked a pass off the right boards to messier and bulled to the net , creating more open ice for messier the captain shot , beaupre made the save , but graves arrived at the lip of the crease in time to push the rebound over the line this gave the rangers a 31 lead graves got this third of the night at 10 23 of the period , on the power play , when he deflected a shot from the left point by brian leetch to make the score 41 but the most important goal of the night was steve larmer s , on a long , deflected shot , with six second left in the first period , to break a 11 tie even without the goals , graves had an active night midway through the first period , while killing a penalty , he put a hard elbow in the face of radek bonk , which caused the rangers to be shorthanded by two men for 1 40 later , again while killing another penalty , graves was so persistent in the ottawa zone that he forced sylvain turgeon to pull him down , nullifying ottawa s man advantage the most negative note of the night was a concussion suffered by aleksei kovalev , the flashy right wing , who banged his head on the ottawa goal post after a spectacular spin move , on the fly he said it was sore and was sent home with instructions to stay up for several hours and sleep only in brief naps through the night elsewhere in the garden , intrigue is beginning to build around the edges of this traditionally edgy franchise neil smith , the general manager , said that mike keenan , the coach and general manager of the st louis blues , called campbell , not smith , sunday night to discuss possible trades two days before , keenan said he would have no problem talking trade with smith , despite the power struggle between them that led to keenan s departure for st louis last summer , after the rangers won the stanley cup keenan may be seeking to trade craig janney , a center who he has benched smith said he is n't interested in janney the rangers are missing two centers at the moment ed olczyk was out last night for the third consecutive game with kidney stones sergei nemchinov missed with a bruised heal other rumors are sweeping down from canada a toronto paper reported that smith may soon leave the rangers to take a similar position with the detroit red wings , where he worked before as a head scout in the 1980 s absurd , smith said it really is a bizarre rumor it makes absolutely no sense i 've got a longterm contract it s so ridiculous slap shots sean hill and pat elynuik scored for ottawa although attendance was announced as 18 , 200 , there patches of empty seats at both ends of the rink and many , scattered empty chairs throughout the building mark messier , adam graves s linemate , got cut on the nose by the stick of aleksei yashin in the first period in the second period , messier was upended by a hip check by hill photos the rangers' petr nedved , far right , scoring his first goal last night the rangers snapped out of their slump to win \( g paul burnett the new york times \) \( pgb10 \)
a small bomb was found in a rutgers university library yesterday morning , just three days after another bomb exploded there , and the authorities shut down four campus libraries so bomb squads could search them the police evacuated the mabel smith douglass library on the new brunswick campus and sealed off the area for 150 yards in all directions after a staff member found the bomb on a shelf in the lower level of the building at 9 40 am yesterday the state police bomb squad removed the device no one was injured bombsniffing dogs were called in to search all of the main libraries , and a rutgers spokesman said they would not reopen until noon today to give the police another chance to sweep for explosives a small bomb blew up in the literature section of the douglass library around midnight tuesday , damaging 10 books and causing 100 in damage to the shelves and ceiling tiles no one was injured in the blast students working elsewhere in the building reported hearing a small pop at the time the federal bureau of investigation and rutgers officials said no notes had been found at the scene and no one had called to warn about either bomb no one has taken responsibility through telephone or written communication at this time , said ann ford , an fbi special agent involved in the investigation she refused to describe the device found yesterday or to say if it resembled the earlier bomb students at the campus said there was some concern on campus but that they were more at ease after the police started searching bags , parcels and backbacks of people entering the libraries they think it is someone being stupid , trying to scare everybody , said sheila velez , 19 , a psychology major from pemberton , nj , noting that most students spent the day at a spring arts festival everybody is trying to get their work done school is almost over ms velez , who works at the student center across the street from douglass library , said friends had been calling all night to see if the library was open so they could study police officials said the four main undergraduate libraries douglass library , alexander library , the library of science and medicine and the kilmer area library would all open at noon today university officials said bomb scares were common at exam time , but none of the threats had ever proved true i have been here 20 years and there has never been a real bomb in this time , said william w owens , a university spokesman ms ford , the fbi agent , said there was no indication that the explosion had anything to do with the socalled unabom case , in which a serial bomber has attacked university professors , among others in december , a prominent advertising executive was killed in his home in north caldwell , nj , by a package bomb that federal authorities linked to the unabom case

nashville , july 1 only two years ago , they were defeated and discouraged but abortion opponents who gathered here this week expressed such eagerness to press their agenda that more than once their leaders cautioned them not to overreach emboldened by electoral victories last year , by the death of dr henry w foster jr s nomination for surgeon general and by the bright prospects of several congressional bills to curb abortion , participants at the annual convention of the national right to life committee , the nation s largest antiabortion group , said their next targets were president clinton and political candidates at all levels who favor abortion rights but despite their expectation that they will find even more success in next year s elections than they did in 1994 , when abortion foes claimed a gain of 40 house seats , many participants here said they were prepared to be pragmatic to avoid alienating themselves from the republican party they were careful to say that they would not try to dictate the party s presidential nominee they even said they would not fight against modest changes in the strict party plank that calls for a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion you may have your favorite prolife presidential candidate now , darla st martin , associate executive director of national right to life , told the conventioneers but she urged them several times not to speak ill of any republican candidate whose opposition to abortion might not be as strong as they would like , and to rally around the eventual nominee clinton is the alternative , she said , and none of us want to see clinton reelected carol long , the director of the organization s political action committee , said right to life could live with efforts , now being proposed by former education secretary william j bennett and other conservatives , to soften the republican plank on abortion to get the wording more acceptable to party moderates , as long as it stays prolife and she said she understood that abortion was so sensitive an issue that the leading presidential candidates would have to muffle their oratory on it we do n't expect them to put abortion at the top of their list , she said if abortion is not at the top of most candidates' lists , the same is true of american voters , only 5 percent of whom consider abortion the most important single issue at the polls , according to a new york times cbs news survey conducted feb 2227 but it is at the very top for many of the 1 , 000 people gathered here , who are far more politically active than voters generally if you talk about putting a street light up on a corner or not , that s a difference of opinion , said one conventioneer , john hubbard , 48 , a chemical engineer from cleveland , tenn but when a candidate does n't believe in the rights of the unborn , it speaks to the kind of society that he is going to lead the country to be paul dunn 3d , a 32yearold office manager for right to life s chapter in knoxville , expressed the view of many at the convention when he said flatly if there s a prochoice candidate on the ticket , i just wo n't vote if you do n't have right to life , there is no other issue at a session today devoted to preserving an antiabortion republican plank , susan brackin hirschmann , a longtime antiabortion organizer , asserted that eliminating the plank would be not only a betrayal of our tradition but it would be politically stupid the abortion issue , she added , is not going to go away the theme at this convention , only two years removed from the dawn of an abortion rights administration and a string of legal and legislative setbacks to the antiabortion cause , was alive and growing on the surface , it was a convention largely , and strikingly , devoid of presidential politics , a far cry from the gatherings of organizations like the christian coalition , whose recent meetings have been like minipolitical conventions , dominated by white house aspirants convention organizers here said they had not invited presidential candidates to speak in part because they did not want them to overshadow the agenda only one presidential campaign button keyes for president was spotted during the threeday event , which ended today rather than candidates' bumper stickers , there were displays of plastic images of fetuses at up to seven months' gestation , and antiabortion calendars and greeting cards one exhibitor distributed a flier that bore photographs of a dog and a fetus it should n't happen to a dog , the flier declared it does happen to babies they are tortured they are used for experiments some are poisoned most are dismembered they experience excruciating pain they all die ! although the national right to life committee describes itself as nonpartisan , it contributes more to republicans because of the party s customary opposition to abortion yet despite its stated desire not to overreach , the organization also signaled this week that it would not be totally accommodating for example , right to life officials said that to discourage abortions , they were opposing republican welfare proposals that would cut off support of teenage mothers

washington , sept 14 house republican leaders unveiled their proposal to redesign medicare today , but it was surprisingly short on details and had none of the expected financial incentives for elderly people to join health maintenance organizations or other private health plans the package is supposed to cut projected medicare spending by 270 billion , or 14 percent , over the next seven years , and republicans had hoped to achieve much of the savings through greater use of hmo s and other forms of managed care they said affluent beneficiaries should pay much higher premiums , but they acknowledged that they were still struggling to achieve the savings they need to meet their selfimposed goal in deciding not to offer financial incentives for joining hmo s , the republicans said they feared that such incentives would make them vulnerable to charges of crass commercialism but they predicted that elderly people would voluntarily join hmo s to get coverage for prescription drugs and other goods and services not covered by the standard medicare program as republicans scrambled to flesh out their plan , it was clear that many important decisions had yet to be made they issued a brief summary of their bill , the medicare preservation act of 1995 , with a series of questions and answers but there was no precise breakdown of how they would meet their goal speaker newt gingrich provided some details at a fourhour party caucus he opened the session with a blistering speech attacking president clinton think about a party whose last stand is to frighten 85yearolds , and you 'll understand how totally morally bankrupt the modern democratic party is , mr gingrich said at the caucus , a rare joint meeting of house and senate republicans the senators stayed for one hour democrats reacted with fury and anger , saying the republican proposals would increase costs for medicare beneficiaries and damage the quality of their health care they said the republicans were hiding crucial details of their medicare proposals and intended to ram the legislation through congress before people understood it republicans said they were determined not to repeat the tactical mistakes that president clinton made in trying to redesign the nation s health care system in 1993 and 1994 but the delays in the development of the republican plan , the confusion over cost estimates , the daily disclosure of new details and the hasty revisions made in response to political pressures were eerily reminiscent of the problems that bedeviled mr clinton the republicans start from a stronger political position than president clinton , and they have displayed much greater party discipline than congressional democrats showed last year but the republicans face a formidable challenge because the democrats have vowed an allout effort to resist their medicare proposals and see the battle as an opportunity to establish themselves as champions of the elderly in outlining their proposals , republicans said they had decided to spare beneficiaries while curbing medicare payments to doctors and hospitals but representative henry a waxman , democrat of california , predicted that such cutbacks will destroy medicare in a few short years because many doctors will decide not to take medicare patients at the lower payment rates for their part , republicans said they were modernizing medicare to prevent its hospital insurance trust fund from going bankrupt democrats said increasing medicare premiums would do nothing to help the hospital trust fund because the premiums do not go into that trust fund representative sander m levin , democrat of michigan , said the republican plan was vague it says little , and much of what it says is untrue , he said moderate democrats said they were also disappointed , for somewhat different reasons senator joseph i lieberman , democrat of connecticut , said , the republicans are proving remarkably timid david b kendall , a health care analyst at the progressive policy institute , a research center for moderate democrats , said the republicans have blinked they seem to have given up on the idea of restructuring medicare the heart of the republican bill is a proposal to let medicare beneficiaries enroll in all sorts of private health plans , including hmo s , but it does not give them strong financial incentives to do so the purpose , as described by mr gingrich and bob dole , the senate republican leader , is to inject freemarket forces into the medicare program to save money and increase beneficiaries' options but house republicans seem to have retreated on an important issue representative bill thomas , chairman of the ways and means subcommittee on health , said that private health plans would not compete on the basis of price the government would make a fixed payment to any private health plan chosen by a medicare beneficiary under the republicans' earlier proposals , medicare beneficiaries who chose lowcost health plans would have received rebates for the difference between the premium and the federal payment but mr thomas said the republicans no longer intended to allow such rebates hmo s and other health plans could compete by offering additional benefits , but they could not compete on the basis of price , he said representative james c greenwood , republican of pennsylvania , said we want seniors to make choices based on what s good for their health care , not on the basis of getting a toaster or some other financial incentive rebates should not enter into that decision ten percent of the 37 million medicare beneficiaries are now in hmo s the republicans proposed higher medicare premiums for beneficiaries with incomes above certain levels 75 , 000 a year for individuals , 150 , 000 for couples for the most affluent beneficiaries , premiums would more than triple the premium is now 4610 a month republicans said the premiums would increase by smaller amounts for less affluent beneficiaries but democrats said the republicans had significantly understated the increases that would be required republicans said they did not know how many additional people would join hmo s under their plan or how much money would be saved by managed care so they are relying on a budgetary device known as a failsafe mechanism under the proposal , the secretary of health and human services would reduce the scheduled increases in medicare payments to health care providers like doctors and hospitals if they exceeded spending targets democrats said that looked like the price controls republicans vehemently denounced as a feature of president clinton s health plan after today s caucus , representative christopher shays , a connecticut republican on the budget committee , said he did not have enough information to know if the proposal would save 270 billion mr gingrich said that under current law , medicare s hospital trust fund would run out of money in 2002 , and he said mr clinton had offered no plan to prevent that photos house republicans yesterday outlined a plan to revamp medicare in an effort ro save 270 billion over seven year bob dole , the senate majority leader , and house speaker new gingrich met lawmakers at a caucus \( stephen crowley the new york times \) \( pg a1 \) the house minority leader , richard a gephardt of

system \( stephen crowley the new york times \) \( pg a32 \) chart reworking medicare republicans issued a broad outline today of their plan to revise the medicare system , but left the details sketchy here are the highlights premiums calculated to rise slightly every year but to continue to account for 315 percent of part b costs , which cover doctors' fees , rather than drop to 25 percent under current law no increase in copayments or deductibles means testing affluent beneficiaries singles making more than 75 , 000 or couples making more than 150 , 000 would pay more , as much as triple the amount of current premiums , now 4610 a month private choices beneficiaries could choose to keep their current medicare coverage or join private health plans , including health maintenance organizations in return for a limited choice of physicians under a private plan , recipients could get added benefits like outpatient prescription drugs or eyeglasses medical savings accounts an option to all seniors in which they would get a highdeductible insurance policy along with a cash deposit in a medical savings account that would cover a significant portion of the deductible the policy would have no copayments , so that seniors would be assured a limit on their outofpocket costs a person who used few medical services could get money back at the end of the year \( pg a32 \)

a major puzzlement of our musical time has been the absence of a recording by mstislav rostropovich , clearly the greatest cellist of the last 35 years , of bach s six suites for unaccompanied cello \( bwv 100712 \) , which are not only the greatest music written for the instrument but in the running for the greatest music ever written it seemed possible , but not really likely , that somehow he had just never gotten around to them now he has , and he makes clear in a parallel video release that the omission was not an oversight i am now 63 years old , he explains \( he was speaking in march 1991 , when these recordings were made \) only twice in my life have i recorded a bach suite forty years ago i recorded the second suite in moscow , and in 1960 i recorded the fifth suite in new york in both cases i cannot forgive myself i acted rashly now at 63 , i must pluck up courage and record all the bach suites nothing in the world is more precious to me than these suites these compositions always allow you to discover something new each day , each hour , each minute you reflect upon them , you reach deeper you think you know everything about them , but no , next day you discover something new the recordings were made in the abbey church of the town of vezelay , in burgundy , france mr rostropovich was , he says , attracted by the rhythm of the internal architecture , shorn of all superfluity , with none of the gilt and ornamental trimmings of the baroque style and the severity of line and the rhythm of this vaulted construction , which reminds me so powerfully of the rhythm of bach s music but at least as important , the remote location seems to have enabled him to focus mentally on a project that is in significant part artistic autobiography and credo at the risk of slighting mr rostropovich s performances , which are quite special , it is his presentations in the video edition a general introduction , and an individual introduction for each suite that claim first attention the presentations generally consist of mr rostropovich speaking while leaning on the piano and then demonstrating at the keyboard he speaks extemporaneously , with all the intellectual power and concentration of one of the great musical minds and hearts of the century since he speaks in russian , you ca n't just let your eyes wander as you listen , but fortunately the subtitles are excellent of course , if you do let your eyes wander , you can always go back , as often as you want and you will want to rehear the story of the elderly pablo casals playing for mr rostropovich at their first meeting or rehear mr rostropovich at the piano demonstrating bach s seemingly vocal use of cello registers , or playing the opening of chopin s fantaisieimpromptu , or realizing the actual fugue implied by the threevoice fuguelike section of the prelude to suite no 5 for each presentation mr rostropovich chooses an aspect of the piece in question that particularly interests him and focuses on that by the end , he has had a great deal to say and show about how this music works and how artistic communication in general happens little musical knowledge is assumed , and the proceedings are never pedantic or didactic mr rostropovich notes at one point that in performing , there is music that you play for the audience and music like this that you perform for yourself , and he seems to have applied the same principle to this venture if he can make these matters of such deep personal importance intelligible for himself , he trusts that the viewer will be served in the introduction to suite no 3 , there is a wonderful demonstration of the fundamental harmonic relationship between the first and fifth degrees of the scale , the socalled tonic and dominant mr rostropovich plays a goofy tango that he explains he had played for his friends in his student days , when , as we learn here , he was known as sunflower he ended on a dramatic but defiantly inconclusive dominant chord , leaving his friends to beg him at least to finish the piece properly to their great relief , he returned to the piano and played the missing tonic chord even features that initially seem obtrusive turn out to be integral when it rains on the day scheduled for recording the second suite , mr rostropovich relates this to the autumnal quality he feels in the piece , which marks a transition from the g major of the first suite to d minor he associates evening , too , with autumn , and observing the large number of noisy birds gathered in the sky as evening nears , he notes that by dark they will have roosted for the night , and he will be able to record then , the night before he records the sixth suite \( which i always think of as a symphony for cello \) , the empty church itself becomes the setting for his discussion , at the church organ a fiercesounding contraption what mr rostropovich has done here is to show that video really does have some application for music the production is not annoyancefree , though the camera keeps moving in that annoying publictelevision way , never entertaining the possibility that the viewer might actually be interested in watching what s on the screen \( fans of widescreen bach will be relieved to know that the production is letterboxed \) the incessant changes of visual perspective are almost without exception disruptive , especially as the sonic perspective \( mercifully \) does n't change and it s a good bet that when there is something you really want to see how , for example , mr rostropovich is producing such volume of sound the camera wo n't be where you wish it were but after a while you just do n't look so intently , and eventually everything you want to see is shown the impeccable lefthand fingerwork , the easy , seemingly effortless glide of the bow arm that produces such amazingly intense and varied sounds it is hard to separate the performances from the video presentations i had listened to them several times on cd \( emi zdcb 55363 two disks , with a booklet containing edited versions of mr rostropovich s talks \) , before the video package arrived , and duly noted the bracing rhythmic snap of the two bourrees \( suites nos 3 and 4 \) , and the growing intensity of the later suites once through the video edition \( a3vz 77815 , two vhs cassettes lde 77811 , five laserdisk sides \) , i understood much better what mr rostropovich was aiming for the quick tempos of the first suite came to sound quite natural , including the lack of inflection in the patterned 16thnotes of the prelude he explicitly rejects the practice of inventing a melody where bach chose not to compose one now , with these performances in my ears , others tend to sound trivial and ill considered my one major reservation concerns the church acoustics , which have the virtue of sustaining harmonies that the instrument itself ca n't , but which are n't my ideal of cello sound both at full volume and at a whisper , mr rostropovich produces a sound like nobody else s now that he has broken the bach barrier , i hope he has n't ruled out the possibility of undertaking yet another set of the suites , in a comfortably intimate physical environment , to complement this one in addition , because of the great emphasis mr rostropovich places on the cyclical nature of the six suites , buyers of the cd edition will have to exercise care suites nos 4 , 5 and 6 being too long to fit on a disk , nos 4 and 5 have been put on the first disk , following no 1 for everyday audio purposes , the durable recordings by janos starker \( mercury \) and maurice gendron \( philips \) are available attractively priced on cd photos mstislav rostropovich nothing in the world is more precious to me than these suites , he says \( steve j sherman \) johann sebastian bach , whose suites were performed \( camera press london \)
washington , nov 25 on the morning of nov 6 , 1986 , as news of his secret role in the armsforhostages deals with iran first cascaded onto the world s front pages , oliver l north sat at a computer terminal in his thirdfloor office at the national security council and tapped out an electronic message oh , lord , he wrote to a coworker , sounding pained i lost the slip and broke one of the high heels forgive please will return the wig on monday whatever the meaning of mr north s missive it is unclear to this day whether he had just returned from an undercover mission or a rowdy halloween party it surely was never meant for public consumption now it is public , along with 499 other white house computer messages , in a new book that purports to expose what oval office advisers really thought and did during former president ronald reagan s tumultuous second term what they did , besides conduct government business and hatch various foreignpolicy plots that have been largely reported , is play practical jokes , flirt and practice interoffice politics the resulting white house often looks less like the locus of earthly power than the water cooler in a lot of corporate accounting departments , law firms and some newsrooms the paperback book and an accompanying computer diskette , titled white house email , are published by the national security archive , a notforprofit washington organization that seeks to preserve and declassify federal foreignpolicy documents the book is based on a mountain of interoffice messages exchanged by white house employees over an inhouse computer system during much of the 1980 s many authors believed the computer exchanges were being automatically erased from white house computer files and would never resurface , while in fact , technicians were regularly transferring those messages and hordes of other files to more permanent storage devices in the years since irancontra investigators discovered the backup files in 1987 , the national security archives has fought a continuing legal battle to prevent the reagan , bush and clinton administrations from destroying both those files and others recorded in the 1990 s and late 1980 s at stake are nearly 6 , 000 computer tapes and 135 hard drives , crammed with data drained from white house computers from 1982 to 1989 the tapes and drives hold literally millions of pages of messages , more than could be readily declassified the book and diskette , culled from 4 , 000 sanitized messages that the white house and irancontra investigators have released , are a cross between history and voyeurism a stream of insights into past american policy , spiced with depictions of white house officials in poses they would never adopt for a formal portrait stunning revelations are few , perhaps because the book s main characters , mr north and adm john m poindexter , his boss during irancontra , have already been exhaustively investigated by reporters and lawyers to no one s surprise , mr north comes across in the book as a public servant concerned more with expediency than bureaucratic or diplomatic protocol in a series of 1986 exchanges , for instance , he discusses a fairly good relationship with panama s head of state at the time , gen manuel antonio noriega , in which the two men sidestepped state department channels to discuss ways of advancing what they considered their nations' interests in central america through an intermediary , the notes showed , mr noriega offered to take care of the socialist leaders of nicaragua , where the united states was engaged in a proxy war i told the messenger that such actions were forbidden by our law , mr north wrote , but he added that he was intrigued by the dictator s counteroffer to assist in sabotage operations against the nicaraguan army and government mr poindexter liked the notion if he really has assets inside , it could be very helpful , but we can not \( repeat not \) get involved in any conspiracy on assassination , he wrote of mr noriega more sabotage would be another story i have nothing against him other than his illegal activities mr noriega is now in federal prison on drugrelated charges later that year , an agitatedsounding mr north wrote that he had personally threatened costa rica s president , oscar arias , with a cutoff of american aid if his government held a planned news conference to expose an americanbacked operation that was ferrying arms to nicaraguan rebels from a costa rica airstrip the airstrip was , in fact , part of a rogue operation that mr north and friends were financing with profits from the secret sale of weapons to iran after a conference call with cia and state department associates , mr north wrote , he called mr arias to tell him that if the press conference were held , arias a line of the note is censored here wd never see a nickel of the 80m that mcphearson had promised him on friday i recognize that i was well beyond my charter in dealing w a head of state this way , mr north wrote his boss , but it seemed like the only thing i could do
washington , april 3 in the 1920 s and 1930 s , deployment of clubswinging company goons stirred sympathy for striking workers and made the american labor movement an institution in the nation s mainstream in the eightmonth baseball strike that ended on sunday , management deployed the club of the 1980 s and 1990 s , the permanent replacement worker other employers are using it right now in 1991 the diamond walnut growers in stockton , calif , permanently replaced 500 workers who are members of the international brotherhood of teamsters , and the workers are still on the picket line , living on charity and minuscule strike benefits the japanese owners of bridgestonefirestone , the tire company , have put 2 , 300 permanent replacements in four factories in the midwest where the united rubber workers went on strike last july in many other labor disputes of recent years , the mere threat of permanent replacements has blunted the spirit to fight workers have stayed on the job and settled for less than they otherwise would have , a factor that has contributed to a decline in wages for most workers for two decades and has helped employers chip away at pensions and health benefits unions , unable to assuage their fears , have seen membership levels plunge , and organized labor now represents just 112 percent of privatesector workers , less than half what the figure was during labor s heyday in the 1950 s it may be a little bizarre that 750 baseball players , men in their 20 s and 30 s who earn an average of 12 million a year , would boost unions' spirits , if not as yet their fortunes many union members will not earn 12 million in a lifetime of work and that discrepancy in wages made some union leaders queasy about going to the mat for the striking ballplayers but one who did was ronald carey , president of the teamsters' union he promised that his 13 million members would boycott the replacement games that strike reminded america of how much skill and experience is lost when companies replace striking workers , he said the 28 team owners were faced with acres of empty seats and it is not much of a stretch , mr carey said , to see that the fans of bridgestone s tires and diamond s nuts might have the same misgivings but that baseball players , almost alone among unionized workers , could pull off a strike with none crossing picket lines , forcing management to live with an expired contract that the players liked , is the exception that illustrates the depth of the deterioration of labor s power few workers are so skilled that management cannot find others who can take their jobs right away or after a few months of training the message here is that you have to have a unique set of skills , said thomas geoghegan , a labor lawyer in chicago who in articles and a book has bemoaned the decline of unions it s odd , surreal , being in a situation where only this elite group of ballplayers can engage in a right that should be everybody s , mr geoghegan said we 're all getting robbed because we ca n't engage in the same thing today only professional athletes and a few other union groups like orchestra musicians , airline pilots and machinists among the most skilled factory workers can call the bluff of employers who threatens permanent replacement this year began as the bleakest of many bleak years for an institution that was once called big labor it has been defeated in cause after cause in congress , losing on the overhaul of the health care system , a ban on permanent replacement workers and the north american free trade agreement , which unions opposed it has egg on its face , having promised to marshal its troops against lawmakers who voted against its causes , only to see republicans win both houses of congress but the success of the striking ballplayers coincides with other signs of a shifting tide within organized labor itself , some leaders , although still a minority , for the first time want to push aside the president of the aflcio , 72yearold lane kirkland , who has presided over the decline of unions and faces reelection in october early last month , president clinton issued an executive order instructing the labor department to deny federal contracts to companies that use permanent replacements and a year ago , he put a democrat sympathetic to labor , william b gould 4th , in charge of the national labor relations board the board enforces regulations governing strikes and is notorious for letting lawyers for employers stall enforcement of measures that favor workers what has killed us there has not necessarily been antilabor sentiment , but justice delayed , said victor gotbaum , a research scholar at the city university graduate center in new york and former head of the city s largest union of municipal workers mr gould said he believed that the balance of power had shifted too far toward management i think the baseball strike , along with the president s order , ca n't help but put renewed focus on the issue of the right to strike and employers who then take away the jobs of the strikers , he said today mr geoghegan said the change at the labor relations board was important the democrats ended this strike , he said clinton ended this strike the president failed when he called the owners to the white house , mr geoghegan said , but it was he who appointed the nlrb , and the board s ruling against the owners for unfair labor practices led to the court injunction last week that stopped the strike now , mr gotbaum said , in baseball at least , the playing field is level and the old processes of collective bargaining can resume negotiators who throughout the strike had postured to television cameras can now talk face to face they can sit down now and torture each other , he said that s the way unions and employers wrote contracts in the years before permanent replacement workers
westbury , li , july 5 by hiring mike milbury as their new head coach , as the islanders formally announced at a news conference here this morning , the onceproud franchise did more than secure a longterm commitment from perhaps the best available candidate for the job they also openly moved to make a break from their past by going outside the organization to fill the position , all the while stating the goal of reattaining past glories in the near future i 've heard enough talk about people wanting to put the past behind them that it must be an issue for some people , milbury said today it just does n't happen to be an issue for me that was somebody else s past , not mine in a way , that s maybe why i'm here , and not somebody else i'm part of a fresh approach to this thing as much as i respect what was won then , i do n't live that day to day and neither should these guys and they wo n't in introducing milbury as the sixth coach in franchise history , islanders general manager don maloney spoke of milbury s fierce competitiveness as a player and then coach of the boston bruins mike has the combination of people skills , motivational tools and hockey savvy , maloney said the complete package to make him one of the most complete coaches in today s game we want to send the message to all our supporters that the new york islanders expect to compete and expect to win here we 've brought in a coach , and more importantly a person , that commands competitiveness out of his team and has a work ethic second to none the islanders have also brought in a coach who will be among the highest paid in the national hockey league , in part in an effort to dispel notions that they are not willing to spend the money necessary to compete although neither milbury nor maloney would disclose figures , a person with knowledge of the signing confirmed that milbury had agreed to a fiveyear contract that will pay him more than 35 million the contract has an escape clause that will allow him to explore upper management opportunities with other teams midway through the deal that was certainly a factor , milbury said of the islanders' willingness to invest in him the offer they made says to me they feel , 'yes , we want this guy to coach our team' but i also heard the right things from don and the management team about where they 're going and where they want to go eventually , the islanders hope , that is back to the past the islanders won four consecutive stanley cups from 198083 , while milbury was a bruins defenseman but the islanders have failed to make the playoffs in three of the past five seasons they were swept by the archrival rangers in the first round two seasons ago last season , the islanders had the secondworst record in the nhl and now they have turned to a man who spent two decades in the bruins' organization to turn them around a man who lists current boston general manager harry sinden and the former bruins coach don cherry as two of the greatest influences in his career a youthfullooking 43yearold who does n't mind being labeled oldfashioned depending , of course , on the definition if hard work , commitment and loyalty mean oldfashioned , then yes i am , said milbury , who led the bruins to the stanley cup finals and the conference finals in his two seasons as their head coach milbury spent last season as an analyst for espn he has done his homework on the islanders and is well aware of what lies in front of him in the end , they fell apart , milbury said when asked for an assessment of last season i do n't know why there is no question there is good potential in goal there is a very competent defensive group as far as the forwards are concerned , i do n't how it s all going to shake out , but last year , they clearly did n't have enough scoring or intensity to make things work and that is precisely why milbury was brought in , to make things work because he comes from outside the organization , neither the past nor the legacy of al arbour seems to weigh so heavily on him as it did on the man he is succeeding , the original islander lorne henning this seemed fine with arbour , the former coach who led the islanders to their four cups there is no doubt in my mind or anybody s mind that he s the guy for the job at this time , arbour said he s tough but fair the team s going to work , but they 're going to have a good time doing it
the american symphony chamber orchestra s program on monday evening at merkin concert hall would have made more sense to a listener who got some message either from richard wilson s playing of mozart s piano concerto no 16 in d \( k 451 \) or from the premiere of mr wilson s own pamietam mr wilson is chairman of the music department at vassar college and composer in residence of the american symphony orchestra while he probably has deep feeling for and understanding of the mozart concerto , none of this helped him play it well or interestingly pamietam \( i remember , in polish \) is a 20minute piece written in memory of charles botstein , a doctor , teacher and friend for whom the composer clearly felt strong affection there is obvious memorial significance in the four polish poems \( three by leopold staff , the fourth by mieczyslaw jastrun \) incorporated in the piece , in czeslaw milosz s english translations but the piece sawed its way forward in dutiful modernist dissonance , the mezzosoprano mary ann hart intoned the words and finally it ended after intermission came a performance of the beethoven seventh symphony that was not awful the conductor , leon botstein \( charles s son \) , took quick tempos and communicated the piece s general shape there were moments when the small body of strings allowed an interesting textural detail to pop out but with fewer string players , any lack of polish in the playing is magnified , and even the smallest orchestra is not going to produce chamberlike textures in the tight confines of merkin hall for the most part , the performance was simply , in a word , loud
hanoi , vietnam , aug 5 declaring an end to a decade of war and two decades of estrangement , secretary of state warren christopher arrived here today to open formal diplomatic relations with the communist leaders of vietnam , and immediately plunged into talks about turning a former enemy into an emerging trading partner in a day constantly haunted by images of a war from which neither side has fully recovered , mr christopher began his visit by witnessing the return of fragmentary remains of four american servicemen who were among the 58 , 000 who died here more than a million vietnamese also died a generation ago , the trauma of war bound together the history of our nations for all time , he said , standing against the austere backdrop of thud ridge , the mountain range where scores of american pilots were shot down as they flew bombing runs on hanoi let us now lay our past of conflict to rest , and dedicate ourselves to a future of productive cooperation those were the words the vietnamese have waited years to hear , and by midday over a luncheon at which his hosts conspicuously served california wine there was already talk of trade and tax treaties and investment incentives the vietnamese were so eager for quick accords that mr christopher had to send his top economic deputy , joan spero , to explain that such agreements can take months or years to draft , and will require major changes in vietnam s economy they took copious notes , ms spero said later they are beginning to understand this will be a detailed process , one that many in congress will oppose and that many others will insist include specific requirements for vast improvements of vietnam s dismal record on human rights today there were already signs that the country s leaders would stiffen at any such conditions vietnam s urbane foreign minister , nguyen manh cam , said at a signing ceremony with mr christopher , at an ornate colonialera guest house , that a key to the new relationship would be noninterference in each other s internal affairs as mr christopher moved through the center of this increasingly chaotic capital , which is gradually being restored to its old french graciousness , there still seemed to be two vietnams living side by side the ideological state that continues to decorate its parks with statues of lenin , and the bustling , motorbikechoked streets that have brought a vibrancy to this city that was markedly absent just four years ago the conflicting images are everywhere mr christopher met tonight with vietnam s president , le duc anh , just blocks from the simple wooden house in which ho chi minh and his successors prosecuted the war and wrought political havoc half a world away in america the house has been carefully preserved , and both vietnamese and foreigners visit it daily to see the simple long table where ho met his generals a single ancientlooking telephone sits at the end , near his seat , to dispatch commands but if the vietnamese are preserving ho s home , they are racing to tear apart the other remnants of the war , betting that the documents signed today will clear a wider path for investors while mr christopher was signing the formal documents establishing diplomatic relations , workers a few blocks away were in the last stages of knocking down one of the city s most notable landmarks , the hanoi hilton , where american fliers and other prisoners of war were held for years john mccain s cell was over there , but it was knocked down already , pham tu , an official of the cultural affairs ministry , said today , referring to the arizona republican senator whose support of diplomatic recognition helped give president clinton the political cover he needed to make the move where the prison once stood , a group of local and foreign investors is building two office towers , one 23 stories high and the other 13 , making them among the tallest in the city the block that became a symbol of the terrors of vietnam is to contain a hotel , a supermarket , a parking lot and offices a few cells are being preserved in the front as a museum to mr christopher , this was a day heavy with history no american secretary of state has ever visited hanoi \( though henry a kissinger came here as national security adviser in 1973 \) , and none have set foot anywhere on vietnamese soil in the quarter of a century since william rogers traveled to saigon , the capital of south vietnam , now named ho chi minh city acutely aware that many veterans and relatives of the missing consider mr clinton s diplomatic recognition of hanoi a betrayal , the administration carefully orchestrated mr christopher s first day here to focus on the efforts to account for the 1 , 615 americans still listed as missing in vietnam every one of them is a cherished human being with a name and a family and a nation that cares and this endeavor is a reflection of that deep caring we have for every one who goes into battle , he said at a news conference the vietnamese leaders , while promising continued cooperation on the prisoner issues , made it clear that their focus is intently on the markets and on making up for time lost when america s trade embargo sharply limited the country s ability to grow they see trade and tax treaties with the united states as the surest way to reassure international investors , and thus the path to building the kind of foundation that turned thailand and malaysia into economic powerhouses but they want to do so on the singapore model letting free markets bloom , but with minimal challenges to central political authority by some accounts they were perturbed by president clinton s observation last month that trade benefits often require certification regarding human rights and labor rights before they can succeed it was a subject that mr christopher was not anxious to discuss at length today , perhaps for fear of putting a damper on the celebration today s normalization gives us an added basis for having a human rights dialogue , he said , adding that his chinese counterpart was ready to proceed down that road the main thing is that the trend be in the right direction , he said i do n't want to give a letter grade to vietnam on human rights , he said , presumably a reference to the country s sharp controls on press freedom and political opposition this is a great day in vietnam we should n't miss the significance of this day photo secretary of state warren christopher , in hanoi opening formal diplomatic relations with vietnam , attended a ceremony yesterday at the airport there for the return of four sets of human remains believed to be those of american servicemen who were among those killed in the war \( reuters

to the editor in your may 2 news article on the church of st ann and the holy trinity in brooklyn heights , you write the the parish s vestry charged that the diocese wants to sell the property in the affluent brooklyn neighborhood as junior warden of st ann s and a member of its vestry , i advise you that this is incorrect while a few vestry members may feel that there is a conspiracy to close our landmark church , the majority feel this situation is only a symptom of our troubled relationship with our rector , not part of some plot this is the opinion we have expressed repeatedly to the rector , the archdeacon and the bishop and while there is no question that we have serious fiscal and physical plant problems , we have seen no evidence that the st ann s center for restoration and the arts is either failing or misusing funds in our position as financial stewards of the parish we would be concerned if either of these situations existed most troubling though is bishop orris g walker s allegation that our actions have been racist in a parish that prides itself on being multicultural and diverse , such a charge is taken very seriously it is especially painful that it should come from someone the parish actively supported as a candidate for his position since bishop walker has not visited our parish in some time , i am unsure of what he is basing this charge upon however , none of the 14 vestry members , including the five black members , believe any actions in this dispute have been motivated by racism i hope your readers will visit our historic church during our spring fair may 6 duncan kruse brooklyn , may 2 , 1995
dallas , april 8 after hearing united states lawmakers threaten day after day to cut off 20 billion in aid , mexican officials came here this week to strike back among them was president ernesto zedillo , who used his first speech in the united states since taking office to attack critics of his policies and of american aid as backwardlooking isolationists he specifically rebuked senator jesse helms , chairman of the foreign relations committee , for implying that mexican billionaires might be drug lords , and the central intelligence agency for telling lawmakers that mexican oil exports pledged as collateral for the american loans were dangerously eroding it should not surprise us that events have tempted some to retreat from free trade , to seek scapegoats or to treat neighbors as adversaries , mr zedillo said , alluding to critics in both countries though initially mentioning none by name speaking to an audience of more than 600 at an american society of newspaper editors convention on wednesday , he urged them to resist those who would return us to a time of protectionism , suspicion and isolation mexico s ambassador to the united states , jesus silvaherzog , said in an interview here that mexican officials could not rest a second it s incredible , he said on thursday , a day after house and senate conferees amended a military appropriations bill with a threatened cutoff of all future loans and guarantees to mexico they have tried in the defense bill they have tried in the budget bill we are all over lawmakers' attacks on president clinton s economic rescue plan for mexico have increased since he decided two months ago to extend 20 billion in loans under his own authority , without congressional backing senator alfonse m d'amato of new york , chairman of the banking committee , recently proposed a budget amendment blocking aid to mexico beyond the 52 billion already sent mr zedillo countered by boasting of economic and political reforms and some signs of an economic turnaround , including a gain of nearly 40 percent in exports this year in taking questions after his speech , mr zedillo cast diplomatic niceties aside , relaxing his stiff posture and delivery one editor mentioned that senator helms , in a discussion of colombian drug trafficking this week , pointedly asked how mexico s billionaires earned their wealth if mr helms has information supporting his assertion , it is his duty to make public that information , mr zedillo said otherwise , he is in trouble reminded of the cia s forecast of eroding oil exports , delivered in a closed congressional briefing last week , he found fault with the question and then with the agency it is an error to focus on our oil export earnings , he said , adding that rising exports and , soon , an improving economy will allow mexico to cover its debts we are not depending on oil exports to pay back these liabilities as for the cia , he said perhaps they were not well informed last week that our secretary of energy had just announced that the mexican government plans to increase production , starting this year , to increase exports i think they should have had that information mr zedillo received a warm welcome from about 70 texas business leaders , after months of watching his ministers return shellshocked from meetings with outraged american investors more than 40 percent of the nation s exports to mexico come from texas , and more than 80 percent are shipped through the state in a closed meeting after his speech , the texans praised his turnaround plans and pledged to keep doing business there i thought it was a realistic but optimistic message , said robert a mosbacher , commerce secretary in the bush administration and now chairman of the mexicanunited states business council you came away with a feeling that he knows what they are and he s going to stay the course , mr mosbacher said in an interview photo ernesto zedillo \( associated press \)
eighteen years ago , california reinstated capital punishment and with it the long and costly legal process involved in executing a criminal fifteen years passed before the first man was gassed to death at san quentin one other man has since been executed , while 397 men and 6 women await their fates on death row when gov george e pataki and state legislative leaders reached a preliminary agreement last week on restoring the death penalty in new york state , the governor rejected proposals for a study of the measure s costs because , he insisted , the law would deter crime and save tax dollars but the experience of california and many other states offers a cautionary example of both the legal burdens and daunting expense of capital punishment people may debate passionately whether the death penalty deters crime , whether it is applied fairly to rich and poor , black and white , or whether it is moral but there is little dispute that it is a costly , complicated undertaking it certainly is an expensive process , said ronald m george , a justice on the california supreme court who once , as a deputy state attorney general , argued for the death penalty before the united states supreme court it has to be , in order to make it fair governor pataki said he aims to make justice more efficient and to limit appeals from death row but other states have found that nearly everything about a trial in which prosecutors seek a judgment of death takes longer and costs more than one in which they do not and to meet federal constitutional standards , lengthy appeals are nearly inevitable the penalty of death is qualitatively different from a sentence of imprisonment , however long , the united states supreme court said nearly 20 years ago it is also , for that reason , uniquely difficult to impose of the 37 states that have restored capital punishment since the supreme court cleared the way in 1976 , 7 have executed 1 or 2 people , and 13 have executed none even in texas , which leads the nation with 92 executions since 1976 , many condemned criminals have spent a decade or more on death row a man put to death yesterday had spent 18 years in appeals many small texas counties have all but stopped asking for the death penalty , purely , prosecutors say , because it is too expensive a duke university study of capital murder cases in north carolina , conducted for that state s court system two years ago , found that it cost taxpayers twice as much to try , convict and sentence a defendant to death as it did to secure and impose a firstdegree murder conviction with a sentence of 20 years to life california , which like new york has a long history of strong protections for the accused , has not commissioned such a study but prosecutors , defense lawyers and experts on capital punishment agree that in the 18year history of well over 1 , 000 death penalty trials and just two executions , the extra costs have run into the hundreds of millions it is always more expensive to have and use the death penalty than it is not to have it , for the very simple reason that lawyers are more expensive than prison guards , said franklin e zimring , director of the earl warren legal institute at the university of california at berkeley it s that simple judges on california s highest court have spent half of their time in recent years reviewing death penalty appeals , and judges on new york s highest court have already quietly expressed concerns about a similar burden on their docket lawyers in the california attorney general s office , their cost to the taxpayer clocked at 90 an hour , logged 57 , 000 hours last year on such appeals the state has also established an 8 millionayear office of public defender that does nothing but appellate work for indigent defendants on death row but it can handle only a fraction of the caseload , so the state has also assigned a fulltime officer to recruit private attorneys , who are offered a flat fee usually ranging from 75 , 000 to 200 , 000 , sometimes much more even at that , nearly onethird of the people on death row have no one to represent them on appeal so despite a common perception that most death row inmates can delay execution by filing endless appeals , many actually do so simply because the state ca n't find them a lawyer until they get one , they are virtually assured of not being executed the wait protracted cases and reversals nationally , the vast majority of those who have been sentenced to death since 1976 have not been executed those who were waited an average of 7 years , 10 months , between sentence and death , according to the death penalty information center , a group based in washington that opposes capital punishment federal courts in several states have made moves in recent years to limit appeals and otherwise speed the process still , the basic constitutional guarantees accorded anyone facing the death penalty , including the right to file a petition challenging the sentence and to question the competency of the defense , are likely to insure that most death row inmates will continue to gain years of reprieves and studies have suggested that nearly half of federal petitions filed in death penalty cases result in a reversal of either the sentence or the conviction
detroit , may 21 detroit has tried for decades to revitalize its moribund downtown , but never before with so novel an approach as a proposal now on gov john engler s desk to create an indian reservation in the heart of the city solely to establish casino gambling there michigan law prohibits casino gambling , but federal law provides an exemption states that permit any form of organized gambling , like michigan s lottery , must permit gaming operations run by indians on sovereign indian lands , as opposed to private or commercial land owned by indians if approved , federal officials say , the casino here will be the first casino gambling enterprise run by indians anywhere away from their main lands detroiters , frustrated by decades of decay , unemployment and a dwindling tax base but leery of gambling s harmful trappings , have mixed feelings the voters rejected gambling initiatives four times but after casinos opened last year in nearby windsor , ontario , and began drawing 25 , 000 people a day across the detroit river , the voters had a change of heart by a twothirds majority in a referendum last august , they approved a proposal , which had the backing of mayor dennis archer and the city council , to transfer land in the greektown area downtown to a chippewa tribe for the purpose of establishing an indianrun casino there the voters also approved a riverboat casino , but state law would have to be changed before that could be allowed the rev jim holley , pastor of the little rock missionary baptist church near downtown , who opposed the ballot initiatives , said pragmatism had won out over principle when you 've got a million dollars a day going over to windsor , which is a few blocks of water away , mr holley said , the people saw it as something that was already here , but the city was n't benefiting from it mr holley served on an 11member commission , appointed by governor engler , that concluded that indianrun casinos would benefit the city they figured that they already had gamblers in detroit , he said they just did n't have gambling in detroit the willingness to risk for economic good the social ills that critics warn accompany gambling districts is a measure of the desperation many people feel about the longtime plight of detroit s derelict city center the city s unemployment rate is 15 percent , and an estimated third of its population of one million live at or below the poverty level the greektown proposal promises 4 , 400 jobs reserved for detroiters , 25 million a year to city coffers and additional millions for economic development projects the exodus of department stores and business offices from detroit began with the marriage of cars to new freeways in the 1950 s and accelerated after the riots of the 1960 s each decade since has had its own ambitious plan to bring people and prosperity back , none of them successful in the 1970 s , it was henry ford 2d s renaissance center , the soaring , cylindrical twin hotel and office towers but the rencen keeps its visitors indoors , and nearly two decades later the nighttime streets around it are as empty as before in the 1980 s , it was the people mover , several miles of elevated tramway subsidized by washington to encourage visitors to tour downtown but by then there were few places worth visiting , and riders gazing at eye level into the empty upper floors of the relics of preworld war ii detroit commerce were left with the impression that this was a city that had moved out of town now gambling is being heralded as the catalyst for renewal so far , three competing groups , including the one whose specific plans were approved at referendum last august , are vying for the right to deed various parcels of downtown land to the chippewa for a casino while the investors would not own , operate or directly profit from a casino , they would expect to reap the spinoff profits from the casino crowds and the hotels , restaurants and shops on adjacent land they owned and , despite awareness that casinos in atlantic city have not delivered broad prosperity , voters here are evidently counting on the promoters' scenario to reverse decades of decay and provide muchneeded jobs john kelly , a lawyer and former democratic state senator who opposed gambling when he was in the legislature but is now working with one of the investor groups , said the presence of canadian casinos across the river had been persuasive to him and many other detroiters since gambling is , in effect , already here , the rationale goes , detroit ought to reap some profit from it rather than watch its people and their money cross the border still , the odor that surrounds gambling dictates that political leaders speak reluctantly of the proposal as a last resort , though even among opponents the betting is that governor engler , a republican , will not stop the project when he makes his decision , perhaps by the end of june , on whether to accept in trust for the chippewa 135 , 000 square feet of greektown land offered by two developers for a casino he is also weighing other proposals , though it is expected he would not sanction them without another referendum
paris , feb 23 foreign minister alain juppe said today that he was shocked that france s accusations of economic espionage by the former cia station chief and four other americans here had been leaked to the french press i am scandalized that a delicate problem between us and this is not the first time that such a problem has arisen could be dragged out into the open this way , mr juppe said he called for a thorough public inquiry into how the daily newspaper le monde had obtained government intelligence documents on the case despite reports on wednesday that france was insisting that the five americans leave the country immediately , the former station chief was still in his office at the american embassy today french diplomats said that apparently none of the others had left either if there was ever any doubt that the revelations had more to do with the french presidential campaign than with a grave dispute between france and its traditional ally , the remarks by mr juppe , a supporter of jacques chirac , mayor of paris , seemed to dispel it there is no crisis whatsoever between france and the united states , the foreign minister said we had no intention to go public on this affair the implication is that someone else did the chief of the french counterespionage service , interior minister charles pasqua mr pasqua is the cabinet s leading supporter of prime minister edouard balladur s , whose lead in the presidential race is evaporating mr balladur is now running neck and neck with his fellow conservative mr chirac and a socialist , lionel jospin , in public opinion polls one reason for mr balladur s loss of momentum was the disclosure early this week that he had approved a telephone tapping operation recommended by mr pasqua on grounds that later turned out to be legally insufficient if there was any way to divert attention from the wiretapping scandal , partisans and nonpartisans agreed today , throwing the spotlight on the big power the french love to hate the united states was perhaps the obvious course in an election campaign , diversionary maneuvers are part of the game , said philippe vasseur , another supporter of mr chirac s in the presidential race it is mr pasqua who has held most of the strings in the investigation since 1993 on jan 26 , he took the unusual step of summoning pamela harriman , the american ambassador here , to his office to discuss the allegations usually it is the foreign ministry that deals with foreign diplomats , or the prime minister or the president , diplomats noted according to the report in le monde , mr pasqua told mrs harriman that his counterspies had caught her cia station chief , three of his embassy colleagues , and a fifth american redhanded in the act of trying to buy french economic and political secrets from high officials , and that she should see to it that all five leave france as soon as possible he followed up this demand with a letter feb 1 , and with a second summons to his office on feb 10 mrs harriman apparently argued that her diplomats had just been doing their jobs , making contacts with french officials and gathering information on politics and the french position on trade issues , and that there was no reason to send them packing mr juppe , the foreign minister , tried to sound relaxed about the accusations during a news conference at the foreign ministry today what we have to do now is to continue to discuss this sensitive issue with our american friends , he said i am confident that we will soon find a way out the recommendation that the alleged cia staff members leave , he said , was made in the spirit of trust that exists between our two countries it was not intended to be made public mr juppe refused to answer questions after making his statement , and mr pasqua left today on a fiveday tour of african countries since the candidates the two support , mr chirac and mr balladur , are both members of the neogaullist rally for the republic party , the campaign battle between them has been particularly rough the first round of voting on a president to succeed francois mitterrand will be april 23 , with a runoff in may if no one wins more than 50 percent the news of the alleged american espionage pushed articles about mr pasqua s telephone tapping operation off the front pages of french daily newspapers today le monde followed up with interviews with three of the unnamed french officials the americans supposedly approached for information about french domestic politics , industry and trade matters one of them , recalling conversations with one of the five americans , told the newspaper she was quite a bit older than me , and not very pretty the banalities i told her about french politics , and france s concern about not being isolated in the negotiations on gatt , et cetera all that seemed to interest her passionately photos le monde s coverage of assertions about us spying may be an attempt to divert attention from a wiretapping scandal involving the interior minister , charles pasqua , who addressed a political rally wednesday \( photographs by associated press \)
galleries vs auctions this week s announcement that pacewildenstein gallery is handling the modern art collection from the estate of mark goodson , the television producer , demonstrates an interesting development in the art market in past seasons , art dealers both here and abroad have tried to compete headtohead with auction houses for major estate property many have even offered executors some of the attractive financial packages that sotheby s and christie s provide , like guarantees \( an undisclosed minimum price that an auction house promises the seller regardless of a sale s outcome \) but in almost all cases , auctions have been the selling method of preference for major estates , in large part because executors feel that selling in a public arena is a safer way to carry out their fiduciary responsibilities the tide may be turning when goodson died in december 1992 , the executors met with both sotheby s and christie s as well as with several dealers the time was not good for sellers because the market was still in a slump since the goodson estate was not under the gun to convert art into quick cash for taxes , the executors decided to hold onto the 50 or so works by such masters as picasso , bacon , giacometti and kandinsky until conditions improved this season they felt the time was right to sell arne glimcher , the president of pacewildenstein , had sold mark a substantial part of the collection and had a personal feel for it , said jeremy shamos , an estate executors pacewildenstein gave a compelling sales pitch we can provide a service the auction houses ca n't , mr glimcher said everything does n't hinge on one night like it does in the auction business , and we can protect the works over time , since nothing is publicly burned if it does n't sell pacewildenstein will soon have a gallery in los angeles in addition to those in london and new york , so it will be able to take the art on tour just as the auction houses do we are planning to do an exhibition of the art in new york at the end of october , and the works will go to los angeles in time for the opening of the gallery at the end of the month , so the art will be seen on both coasts , mr glimcher said some of the works will also go to london he would not discuss whether the gallery had offered the estate a guarantee , but art experts close to pacewildenstein say that the estate was not interested in such financing deals mr glimcher also declined to give prices of individual works , but he estimated that the entire collection was worth over 40 million , nearly twice the minimum estimates the auction houses had put on it for a public sale highlights of the collection include a bacon 1964 study for selfportrait a larger and later bacon portrait of john edwards sold at sotheby s in london in june for 21 million also in goodson s collection is an important kandinsky , violet dominant no 603 , from 1934 a comparable one sold at sotheby s in london two years ago for 4 million another highlight is giacometti s woman from venice vi , from 1956 an identical cast of the sculpture sold at christie s in new york last year for 16 million , but some experts say the goodson giacometti has a richer patina no plastic for art you can leave home without it just a year after sotheby s announced to clients worldwide that they could pay for purchases on their american express cards , the auction house informed clients that beginning oct 1 it would no longer accept american express for auction purchases , shipping charges and the fees charged to sellers when works of art fail to sell the company will , however , continue to accept american express for the purchases of catalogues and books a staff memo explained over the past year american express has worked diligently with us to make this relationship mutually beneficial to our clients and to both companies in the process , however , we have discovered that the nature and the economics of the auction business are not as compatible with those of the charge card business as we had originally hoped after the los angeles collector and philanthropist eli broad paid 25 million for roy lichtenstein s i i'm sorry , a painting from 196566 , using that little piece of plastic to be entitled to 25 million membership miles on any airline that participates in american express s program , the auction house was flooded with buyers eager to do the same while neither american express nor sotheby s would discuss the arrangement between the two companies , obviously sotheby s itself was racking up quite a hefty american express bill the credit card company typically charges merchants that accept the card 2 to 5 percent of the value of its purchases it s disappointing sotheby s will no longer be taking american express , since obviously there was a clear demand for the card , said marcos rada , director of communications for american express but we could not agree on many logistical and business issues mr rada declined to elaborate on exactly what the disagreements were and would only add that it was an amicable parting of the ways hushedup theft the museum of modern art understandably hopes that when calamity strikes on a quiet saturday in august , nobody will notice but now that it s fall and the art world is back and gearing up for a new season , this is just the kind of tale everyone is talking about picture this a man racing down the museum s escalator carrying duchamp s famous bicycle wheel from the modern s collection he is almost out of the building , gets stuck momentarily in the revolving door , then runs down the street museum security guards try unsuccessfully to catch him the next morning , the wheel is found on the flagstone terrace of the museum s sculpture garden , and the white stool it normally sits on is unearthed in a nearby ivy bed the work , which experts say could be worth as much as 1 million , is duchamp s 1951 recreation of the 1913 original , which no longer exists so keen were museum officials to hush up the incident that board members were never notified of it but time , it appears , is not healing this wound museums never like to talk about such incidents for fear of encouraging others , so it is not surprising that information about the bicycle and the perpetrator was hard to elicit it s receiving minor attention , said jessica schwartz , the museum s spokeswoman but she confirmed that the modern s own conservation department was attending to the damage , which she says is minor , and that reports that the white stool was smashed are untrue detective joseph arigoni , however , confirmed that the stool was in bad shape ms schwartz confirmed that the object would go back on view , but she said she was not sure when she refused to comment on whether the culprit had been caught detective arigoni said none of the security guards at the museum got a good enough look at the thief to identify him

port st lucie , fla , march 4 george steinbrenner , meet bubba and marcus , the card dealer and chris walpole , the third baseman who impersonated a thunder bay whiskey jack to get the job angry over the yankees' two losses to clubs stocked with minor league talent , steinbrenner , the team s owner , released six replacement players on friday and called for a change from what gene michael , his general manager , termed a true replacement team steinbrenner might not have been as miffed if his club had opened against the mets looking for a true replacement team \? look no farther than thomas j white stadium , where the mets opened their spring season this afternoon no mets minor league players participated in the game against the yankees instead , the roster was built solely from the club s replacement ranks in center , the mets played marcus lawton , who came to camp from a riverboat casino in mississippi , where he dealt cards at shortstop , they called on tom allison , a former minor leaguer who was working as an administrative assistant in their scouting department just last week and at second base , the mets started bubba wagnon , a kevin bacon lookalike who abandoned his job at b b landscaping in alabama \( that s b b as in bubba bubba , the other bubba being his best friend \) and arrived in camp last sunday it did n't seem to matter much to the fans in comparison with other clubs , some of which have drawn fewer than 500 spectators , the mets counted 2 , 323 through the turnstiles over the course of the afternoon , and more than 1 , 500 were still seated when the game ended with a 21 yankees victory the usual turnout for a metsyankees spring training game is between 5 , 500 and 6 , 500 , but , given the circumstances , the mets were pleased by the turnout i think it will be different in different areas , said fred wilpon , the mets' coowner we might do better here where the community is built more around the team than in places where there are a lot of other distractions the fans actually cheered when lou thornton , the mets' left fielder , made a diving catch in the first inning , and there were no hecklers when lawton dropped a fly ball to center in the second , an error that cost the mets a run and whenever wagnon came to the plate , chants of bubba , bubba could be heard all the other bubbas in birmingham are sucking down brews watching me on tv , wagnon said before taking the field for his three hours of fame as amusing as it was at times , the two teams provided far from quality baseball , even by spring training standards todd hundley , the mets' regular starting catcher , was on a local golf course when mike eberle stepped behind the plate for the replacement mets kevin hickey , a relief pitcher , dressed in bobby bonilla s locker and with bret saberhagen , the mets' top pitcher , a mere mile away at his florida home , the club started doug sisk , who is one of the top replacement pitchers in camp , but is better known for being a favorite target of fan abuse during his first incarnation as a met in the 1980 s sisk remained in the game for two innings , giving up one hit and one unearned run the hit went to j t kroeger , the yankees' catcher two hours earlier , while facing a batting practice pitcher , kroeger had failed to hit the ball out of the cage on six straight attempts never thrilled to lose , and certainly not this way , dallas green , the mets' manager , acknowledged after the game that he had not enjoyed the experience but yankees manager buck showalter whose team got its first spring training victory in three games was able to joke afterward about the whole situation got to win the big ones , showalter said green said afterward that he planned to bring a few of his minor league players to sunday s game in fort lauderdale the yankees started three minor leaguers today , including the pitcher , kevin wallace , but still fielded primarily a replacementplayer team that is expected to change soon , though , with steinbrenner s commitment to adding more minor league players to his club for today , though , the yankees' replacement players remained safe none today , showalter said , when asked whether the yankees had decided to release any more replacements we 'll have to see what tomorrow brings inside pitch individual game tickets for all mets regularseason home games will go on sale at 9 am tuesday and can be purchased at shea stadium prices have been reduced to 5 for box seats and 4 and 2 for reserved seats tickets can be returned for a twothirds rebate if the club starts the season with replacement players in the veteran half of the mets' clubhouse , only three lockers have not been assigned to replacement players , who moved in saturday morning last spring , those lockers belonged to dwight gooden , bret saberhagen and john franco asked whether there was a method behind that decision , one clubhouse worker said franco s the godfather i would n't want to mess with him photo dallas green , the mets manager , did not enjoy yesterday s 21 loss to the yankees in his team s spring opener \( associated press for the new york times \)
tampa , fla , feb 18 managers , in the early days of this spring training , do n't have players to talk about , at least none they want to talk about , so some of them express their concerns about the players who are n't in florida and arizona and are n't expected any time soon tony la russa of oakland and joe torre of st louis spoke not of specific players but of players as a group , lamenting the changes they have seen develop over the years the players , especially the ones you need most , are more and more disrespectful to everybody other members of the organization , to fans , la russa said they ca n't be bothered with this request or that request they 're disrespectful to past players former players walk into the clubhouse and they look at them like , how good could they have been they did n't make this kind of money simply put , la russa said , the players have a disrespect for the game the message , he said , has to go out to them that they 've got to change the way they view it torre said the problem is money he was n't campaigning on behalf of the owners to induce the players to accept management s position in the stalled negotiations , but he made a point that even people on the players' side of the labor dispute have seen and commented on in recent years i do n't think many players are aware of what went on 20 years ago , how this came about , torre said , referring to the lucrative economic position players enjoy they have no idea of where the money came from they feel they have it coming in his time as a player , torre was intimately involved in offfield developments , first as a club player representative , then as the national league representative some people might see his current views as the typical reaction of former players to those playing now , the new generation of players and all that but 25 years after curt flood and nearly 20 years after andy messersmith , a player survey on the relationship of those names to the current players' wealth could produce embarrassing results younger players especially act as if baseball history began with them , as if they are entitled to salaries in the millions i have trouble with guys , torre said , who are negotiating between four and five million and they do n't want four million because , they say , they 're thinking of their family that sort of thing does n't go over well with the public do n't flaunt it but bob gibson , the hall of fame pitcher who is back in the game after a 10year absence , added some perspective i have n't been altogether away from the game that i do n't understand that things have changed , the cardinals' new bullpen coach said it s not just players it s society i 've been involved in society , so players are n't going to be any different torre himself provided a note of perspective showing that it s not only players who have changed consider autograph seekers , the manager said i 've seen kids get my autograph , then go give it to somebody and he gives him a buck or two , torre related you ask a kid s name so you can write 'to billy , ' and he says , 'oh no , just sign your name' not even 'best wishes' adulterated autographs do n't sell , and autograph seekers no longer seek players' signatures to put in a scrapbook or a desk drawer if one of the worst modern practices of players is to charge for their autographs and if they need an excuse for doing it , the collecting industry has given it to them an innocent victim sam mejias , the seattle mariners' first base coach , has become an unintended victim of the strike a resident of the dominican republic , mejias has been unable to get into this country to work , even though he has a p1 visa because the labor department has certified the players strike , the immigration department wo n't allow foreign nationals into the country to work with p1 visas at strike sites the players association pursued the certification , intending to block the clubs from bringing in replacement players from latin america and elsewhere now the mariners might need a replacement coach anderson s viewpoint sparky anderson is notorious for ascribing hall of fame qualities to untested rookies now he has graduated to front office executives discussing his decision to step aside as the detroit manager for replacement baseball , anderson told of his conversations with john mchale jr , the tigers' new president they got something there , anderson said of the 46yearold mchale i mean they got themselves a catch if they leave this man alone and let this man go about his business and let him do his work , they finally got a catch i really believe if they leave this guy alone for two years , mchale is going to clean this mess up anderson publicly disclosed for the first time the real story behind his 16day leave during the 1989 season at the time , the tigers said he was exhausted that thing had nothing to do with anything but my daughter , he said my daughter was going through a terrible thing with her husband that was a very concerning thing she was seven months pregnant and getting anorexic over this thing this guy was putting her through the wringer when i got home , i got that straightened out jim campbell was very good about the way he covered it , he said , referring to the tigers' thenchairman i told jim , i do n't want my daughter brought up in this jim , as always , knows how to cover things he said , we 'll say it s fatigue anderson also spoke about his 1995 salary of 12 million , though he did n't acknowledge the figure this was the first time i asked for the money , he related i said a number i kind of shook when i said it i heard a couple things what guys were getting , and i said if that guy s going to get that , i should get this i went to the top very fast anderson said he does n't want anyone to salute him for shunning replacement baseball the person to cheer , he said , is cal ripken , whose consecutivegame streak could end with the first replacement game just imagine what he s risking , anderson said is that character \? you think i got character \? i got to take a back seat to old calvin that is strong character that you cannot buy it s unassailable this man does not deserve not to have a legitimate shot at it not only does anderson not like replacement players , but he also does n't care for strikers who would return to work before the strike ends you and me play together , he said if you 're going to suffer , do n't i have to suffer \? why are you different than me \? why do you have to take the bow and arrows and i do n't have to we started out on an even playing field mine got rocky so now i'm supposed to cry and squeal and run for cover \? no when the field gets rocky you got to be there you ca n't go back and forth you 're not allowed to do that
while the political sages bounced around albany the other day trying their best to sound like educators , robert p burns was at his desk in flushing , queens , wondering if he would ever get the extra math teacher and librarian he needs the politicians' fandango over who should control new york s schools , not to mention the longrunning soap opera involving the new crew at 110 livingston street , meant about as much to mr burns as the news the same day that austria s governing coalition had collapsed he still was short a teacher and a librarian and he doubted that all this handwringing over the school board and chancellorship was about to solve his problem none of this is real , he decided mr burns is the principal of francis lewis high school , which sits on utopia parkway by the long island expressway \( quick , for no extra credit , who was francis lewis \? \) it takes little time to see that he runs a school well above middling , with higher regents exam scores than the citywide average , good attendance rates and a general sense of order that defies blackboardjungle stereotypes burdening new york public schools but its street address notwithstanding , francis lewis is no utopia nearly 3 , 200 students are crammed into a lowlying structure built 35 years ago for 1 , 800 class sizes average 34 students , and many are much larger the down side of an ethnic mix worthy of a united nations agency is that 17 percent of the students have little to no english the school has its share of security fears and how , a guidance counselor asks , can he intelligently tend to all 700 children who form his caseload \? so it is not surprising that mr burns , who took up his duties at francis lewis in 1982 , seven chancellors ago , becomes impatient with the highdecibel political debate over school control precious little of it touches him maybe , he says , mayor rudolph w giuliani is right about bloat in the system but as he walks his hallways , shooing lollygagging students into classrooms , he is hardpressed to find any fat quite the opposite we 're 20 percent under what the formula says we need in funds to run the school , he says it means that he sometimes feels like the chief surgeon in an army field hospital it s triage , he says take the fact that he is breaking the law by employing only two librarians shy by one the number that the state requires for a school this size the only way i can add a librarian is to cut a teacher handling five classes of 34 kids a day , he says so 170 kids would be getting one less credit toward a degree is that better \? his response is to make do with two librarians and trust that no one will pack him off to jail it would be nice to think that rudolph f crew of tacoma , wash , will make a difference when he takes over tomorrow as the latest chancellor ramon c cortines was a very decent , kidcentered person , mr burns says but he doubts that one person so far away at the top can make a great difference for his classrooms , no matter what the title is chancellor or , as the mayor wants , commissioner of education if the principal is skeptical , his students are doubly so who is this mr crew \? i think he s from texas he comes from phoenix they found him in washington that seems the right answer then this young man blows it by adding , dc the point is n't that these students might follow the news more closely but that the political fisticuffs over the chancellorship strike them as removed from their lives nobody ever explains what a chancellor is and what he does , says drina dalton , a senior on this score , no one draws more blame than mr giuliani , who should be grateful that the school has few people of voting age the consensus there is that he is interested mainly in expanding his own power at least mr crew , as the new fellow on the block , enjoys the benefit of the doubt for now on utopia parkway , they want to see what tone he sets i can tell you , mr burns says , that if he does n't nurture schools that are functioning , the flight to catholic schools and out of the city will continue so i hope he takes care of both ends meaning the schools that are disasters and also places like francis lewis , which , in case you wondered , is named after a signer of the declaration of independence
washington , feb 17 not since john f kennedy has a sitting senator run a successful presidential campaign one can make the case , in fact , that the very qualities that make an effective senator like the ability to compromise are a hindrance in the modern campaign primary voters tend to like their meat red and their ideological positions undiluted none of this , however , has prevented the quadrennial outbreak of presidential ambition in the united states senate , where it is sometimes said that every senator , sooner or later , looks into the mirror and sees a president it has happened , in recent months , to senators bob dole and phil gramm , richard g lugar and arlen specter it has happened , in fact , to 10 percent of the members of the current senate , who have already run for president , from strom thurmond in 1948 to bob kerrey and tom harkin in 1992 this is not to mention the ones like sam nunn , charles s robb and john d rockefeller 4th , who simply explored a run or seriously pondered it or encouraged , ever so delicately , a draft movement they see the president , and as in most things , they say to themselves , 'hey , i can do that job , and do it better , ' said senator john h chafee , republican of rhode island it s only crossed the minds of maybe 98 senators the result is a strange intersection of senatorial and presidential politics the business of the senate affects the campaign and the imperatives of individual campaigns affect the senate \( which , even in noncampaign years , has a fairly rich mixture of ambition and personal agendas \) this phenomenon is apparent in ways small and large there is , of course , the requisite teasing from noncandidate senators boy , are you getting good press and a lot of money ! senator barbara a mikulski , the maryland democrat , boomed to senator gramm when she spotted him on the capitol subway on wednesday moments later , senator john mccain , republican of arizona , and a close friend of mr gramm s , explained to a reporter in mr gramm s presence that the only senators foreclosed from presidential fever were those under indictment or in detox \( he was , of course , joking \) there is , as well , the constant search for hidden motives , like the flurry of speculation that mr dole and his allies kept mr gramm off the powerful finance committee \( which has vast fundraising potential \) there were denials all around , of course but senator alfonse m d'amato of new york , who exercised his seniority rights and gave up another important committee assignment to take a seat on finance , said he found it necessary to call mr gramm and assure him that it was not a stopgramm move \( mr d'amato attributes a lot of this tealeafreading to the news media otherwise , you 'd have to do the mexican debt thing , he said what fun is that \? \) any aspirant s issue positions are , rightly or wrongly , seen through the prism of a presidential campaign \( candidates almost invariably assert it is wrongly \) would mr gramm have come out so forcefully against the administration s mexican bailout plan or the nomination of dr henry w foster jr as surgeon general if he were not running for president \? would mr lugar , chairman of the agriculture committee and a senator from indiana , be pushing for such deep cuts in farm programs if he were not thinking nationally \? that has to do with presidential politics , mr kerrey of nebraska said in an interview this week a spokesman for mr lugar said it reflected longstanding views would mr dole have been more willing to seek a bipartisan compromise on health legislation last year if he had not been thinking about the presidency \? more broadly , politicians and analysts are carefully watching the legislative dynamic between mr gramm , staking out the right flank on any given issue , and mr dole , who as leader of the difficulttolead senate will have to engage in some artful dealing , maneuvering and compromising to get the republican agenda through congress many political analysts say that mr dole has a hard balancing act he must produce legislation yet avoid looking like the dreaded insider bargaining away the gingrich revolution remember , they note , the most important audience initially is republican primary voters , who are much taken with the gingrich revolution if i were writing the dole script , it would be , 'in a revolutionary age , you need an old pro to make it work , ' said bill kristol , a conservative strategist he s got to be the old pro who signed onto a new agenda what he has to avoid , mr kristol said , is bob dole , legislative tactician and compromiser who s bogged down in the messy process in washington , vs phil gramm , new leader of the reagan coalition this is where the dole campaign could suffer from the nature of the senate , which requires elaborately brokered deals to do almost anything , given its tradition of unlimited debate and rigorous protection of the rights of the minority mr gramm , without the burden of leadership , can keep staking out the purist right dole has an incentive to make things work , said thomas e mann , an expert on congress at the brookings institution , a research organization and gramm has an incentive to draw lines on the other hand , the dole campaign notes , republican control of the congress offers an invaluable platform for mr dole people are already seeing him as an alternative president , said kathryn coombs , press secretary for the dole campaign newt is the idea engine , and dole translates it into action moreover , mr dole has the advantage of his last run in 1988 , in which he experienced \( and presumably learned from \) all the disadvantages of bringing a legislative image and mindset to a presidential campaign still , modern presidential history suggests that as the scholar ross k baker puts it , the closer you get to the core of power in the united states senate , the harder it is to run for president it is the senators without the primary responsibility for moving the senate along , reaching a consensus , actually producing a stream of major legislation , who have tended to fare best in presidential campaigns , according to this argument in 1960 , for example , there were several senators with presidential ambitions , including the junior senator from massachusetts and the senate majority leader , who was arguably the most skillful legislator of his time the outcome suggested a precedent that does not go unnoticed by mr gramm certainly , jack kennedy had an advantage over lyndon johnson , he said with a smile photos gop senators aiming at '96 , from left phil gramm \( stephen crowley the new york times \) , richard g lugar \( david scull the new york times \) , arlen specter \( associated press \) and bob dole \( stephen crowley the new york times \)
washington , jan 18 in its final report on a natural gas explosion last march that sent a fireball roaring into the sky above edison , nj , the national transportation safety board said today that the accident was a warning to the whole pipeline industry that it needs tougher standards on how pipelines are built , how they are inspected and what the public is told about them the safety board concluded that the edison blast , which left hundreds homeless when a nearby apartment complex was devastated , occurred because the 36inch pipe was made of steel too brittle to withstand a gouge that had been inflicted by construction equipment , perhaps a backhoe , months or years earlier and federal officials said that while the pipeline owner , texas eastern transmission corporation , exceeded national standards in many ways , it was still insufficiently vigilant in protecting its pipeline the board said that aerial inspections of the pipeline route were not required to include reports on excavation work there describing the explosion as a wakeup call , the safety board s chairman , james hall , said it should lead to changes that might prevent an even more devastating accident elsewhere many of the board s recommendations appeared to be an effort to remedy the problem by greater public awareness if companies , local governments and members of the public know exactly where the pipes are and the dangers of digging too closely , the theory is they will exercise local vigilance scores of people were injured in the edison explosion , on march 23 , and one woman with a history of heart trouble died of a heart attack the board , an independent federal agency that is better known for investigating plane crashes , issued a long list of recommendations , including better inspection of pipeline rightsofway to spot excavation activity like the work that caused the edison explosion and it urged the widespread installation of valves that close automatically in case a line ruptures , or valves that can at least be operated by remote control another major focus of the recommendations was public awareness of where pipelines are buried no one at the durham woods apartment complex in edison seemed to know about the pipeline , which was laid in 1961 only one employee at quality materials inc , a paving materials plant on whose property the line was buried , knew it was there , the board concluded investigators found that the ground about the line had been excavated , filled in , and then excavated yet again for use as a burial ground for everything from car parts to an office filing cabinet what does n't compute , mr hall said , is how 400 pieces of debris can get buried there , including a ford ranger truck , and no one seems to know about it the pipeline owner , texas eastern transmission , did not detect the activity above ground or the flaw in the pipe below ground though it conducted far more surveillance than the legally required minimum it had sent an electronic sensing device through the inside of the pipe in 1986 to look for defects , and regularly sent a spotter plane overhead according to charles batten , the chief investigator , texas eastern sent a pilot over the line about once a week before the accident , and now sends one three times a week the problem , said mr batten , was that the inspectors accepted as usual practice the activities in a plant like this and did not report excavation even if they saw it the aerial surveys are not required , he said neither are internal inspections , but texas eastern did one in 1986 , with a device that sends an electromagnetic current into the pipe walls , and looks for defects in the metal by measuring fluctuations in the field the instrument , which is called a pig , found no defects in 1986 , and investigators have concluded that the damage must have been done after that the damage , a gouge , reduced the wall thickness to 05 inches from 0675 inches , said jean bernstein , a metallurgist with the board the effect was to concentrate hoop stresses , the pressure to make the pipe s diameter grow , on the one spot either the gouge created a crack , said ms bernstein , or one developed under it as a result of the stresses , and the crack grew , traveling down the pipe what metallurgists could learn from the damaged section of pipe was limited by destruction from the fire that followed the rupture , she said but by modern industrial standards , the pipe was brittle , she said like a log on a woodpile , the pipe has an increasing tendency , as it grows colder , to crack open when it is hit , she said on the day of the rupture , march 23 , the pipe was at 29 degrees adding to the problem in edison and raising questions around the country is the aging of natural gas pipes , and their burial in rural areas that have since been urbanized new jersey has over 1 , 000 people per square mile , compared with a national average of 70 people middlesex county , of which edison is a part , has 2 , 162 people per square mile the board urged special inspection efforts in urban areas the board also said that the current practice of having pipeline companies send annual reminders to landowners was not sufficient if the landowner is a landlord or an employer , it said the information should be passed along to tenants or employees the board also wants other public information measures , including better marking of pipelines , especially in urbanized areas at the interstate natural gas association of america , the trade organization of the interstate gas pipeline companies , theodore l kinne , vice president for environmental and safety operations , said that most of the board s recommendations had been under study since the edison accident , and that none was a surprise but the industry is proceeding cautiously in some areas , he said for example , the board members were clearly dismayed that it took two hours to shut down the 36inch edison pipeline and said one solution was valves that automatically shut off if they sense a sudden drop in pressure , the kind that is consistent with a rupture because the shutdown took so long , the edison pipe released enough gas in two hours to run a city of a quartermillion for a day , the board said but mr kinne said that if such a valve were on a pipeline that fed a big electric plant and the plant suddenly switched on , the valves would kick in , and you would shut down new york city and everything else downstream remotely operated valves might work better , he said also , most companies now use tougher steel , he said photo devastation caused by a pipeline blast in edison , nj , in 1994 a safety board has urged that the public be made aware of the locations of pipelines \(

sabbath s theater by philip roth 451 pp boston houghton mifflin company 2495 asked in an interview about his relationship to the character of nathan zuckerman , also a novelist , philip roth replied that it was a matter of impersonation making fake biography , false history , concocting a halfimaginary existence out of the actual drama of my life is my life in zuckerman s own word for it , the novelist must be , above all else , a personificator over the 10 years since zuckerman bound , mr roth has published five books that contrive to make fake biography , false history by calling their narratives into question by confusing the distinctions between art and life , truth and falsity , the real and the imagined most recently , in operation shylock , he invented a second philip roth with whom to confront philip roth the protagonist and while subtitling that book a confession , he claimed in a final note to the reader that it was all made up , wholly imaginary yet the note s closing sentence advised us , this confession is false \( the foregoing novel \?

so you 're sitting there waiting for the latenight scores from the west coast when those internal baseball voices start battling it out , again the argument , not surprisingly , revolves around the state of the sport in new york just before july ended , the yankees , seemingly ready to exchange the pretenders' tag for that of a contender , pulled off two megatrades to bring in david cone and ruben sierra they then promoted darryl strawberry to bulk up for an august run at firstplace boston in the american league east but august has brought the yankees to their knees , because of a 913 tumble and the way the stunningly lifeless , errorprone and unfocused yankees are playing , even thoughts of a wildcard berth seem absurd right now then there are the mets , the team that not only resided in another borough , but another league compared with the yankees , even before their intriguing plunge into a rebuilding phase the mets do n't dare think in terms of winning the national league wild card , let alone catching atlanta , the team that fronted the mets by 22 games in the national league east entering play yesterday still , let the record show that the mets , yes , the mets , have a better record in august than the highpriced , suddenly lowyield yankees the mets are 119 this month , even after a 32 loss to the san francisco giants yesterday at shea stadium , in which the mets seemed to tie the game with two out in the ninth but a ball that chris jones seemed to hit off the rightfield foul pole was not ruled a home run the mets and their fans walked away disappointed , but they did not walk away disgusted by this effort or any in recent weeks , something that can only bode well sure , the mets have traded away most of their power in the form of bobby bonilla and yes , they traded away the closest thing they had to an ace when they sent bret saberhagen to colorado still , the mets did n't trade away all hope they have talented kiddie corps pitchers named isringhausen and pulsipher they have a powerful young hitter appropriately named huskey , first name butch and they 've got prospects paul wilson , rey ordonez , jay payton lined up from here to norfolk , suggesting that a brighter future is closer than any the yankees' farm might produce lastly , the mets are having fun , an ingredient too rare in these parts in the past it is also an ingredient that is all but nonexistent in the increasingly uptight world of the yankees as they wander from loss to loss on the west coast so , the mind wonders , just what is up with this 119 run and that 913 slide into oblivion \? and do n't those questions get the internal wrangling going in your head \? that s not fair , one little voice whispers in your ear the yankees were asked to chase the hottest american league team east of the ohio they have all the pressure and the mets have none , unless you count flipping coins with the florida marlins to see who gets to finish last in the nl east you start to agree , overwhelmed by the sheer rationality of such an argument , but another voice devilishly pipes up who cares about pressure \? right now , the team that s most fun to watch in new york is the mets they got guys named izzy and pulse they got youth they 're dripping with enthusiasm and , it whispers in a most sardonic tone , they have the winning record in a month that it s supposed to count the most that s a tough argument to have , carl everett , the mets' right fielder , said the yankees have hit a little slump and we 're playing well we 're playing top teams , too , and we 're beating them just ask the dodgers , who came into shea last weekend with two teams hot on their trail in the nl west the mets swept la in three the kids have got a lot of growing to do , manager dallas green said they 're still not real sure of themselves in game situations at times but we 've told them in meetings that everybody wants an opportunity to play major league baseball the new york mets are offering that opportunity you 'd better take advantage of it as green points out , some are , some are n't , but every one of them is playing hard every day that makes it a refreshing moment for the mets it also signals to the yankees and all of baseball that the mets just may come out to play for the real big stakes again sooner than anyone thought photo mets sporting rally caps in ninth inning

washington , jan 23 prodded by republican lawmakers who want to eliminate federal financing for public broadcasting , executives at the bell atlantic corporation said today that they might be interested in acquiring a stake in the corporation for public broadcasting , but cautioned that the idea had not progressed beyond casual responses to questions from members of congress we have n't been lobbying at all on this , said eric rabe , a spokesman for bell atlantic , adding that the idea of investing in public television was just one of dozens of possibilities the company might consider for acquiring new programming bell atlantic , the regional bell company that owns local phone companies from pennsylvania through virginia , has been extremely aggressive about investing in technology to distribute television programming over its network and it has sought alliances with producers late last year , bell atlantic and several other bell companies teamed up with michael ovitz , the hollywood agent , on a new venture to develop interactive video material bell atlantic s possible interest in investing in public television was disclosed on sunday by senator larry pressler , the south dakota republican who is now chairman of the senate commerce committee he said bell atlantic and other communication companies were interested in assuming the role now filled by the governmentfinanced corporation for public broadcasting senator pressler has argued in recent weeks that taxpayer money should not be used to underwrite public broadcasting when many other sources of educational and cultural programming are available tens of billions of dollars have been spent to date to help public broadcasting get started , he said last week in testimony before a house appropriations subcommittee but are we now locked into a longterm dependency situation \? on sunday , appearing on cbs s news program face the nation , senator pressler tried to rebut supporters of public television who have argued that forprofit companies have no interest in producing the kind of shows now underwritten by the corporation the corporation distributes about 285 million to public stations and producers of programming , and accounts for about 14 percent of the public broadcasting budget the balance comes from corporate sponsors and individual contributors mr rabe of bell atlantic said the company had yet to seriously evaluate a possible investment and had not made any proposals to either station owners or the corporation this was one of the issues that came up in the context of a wideranging discussion of telecommunication issues with senator pressler , he said they asked us , 'would you guys have interest here , if we changed the laws \? ' our answer was yes , that we might be interested in a couple of ways in particular , he said , bell atlantic had an interest in acquiring original programming and in acquiring public stations in some of the areas where it owns telephone companies indeed , the company has approached various publictelevision producers about entering business arrangements , though none of those talks have resulted in deals federal law now forbids a forprofit company to own part of a public television station or part of the corporation , which has few financial assets in any case
the place is limbo , the time an unspecified present at the start of him , christopher walken s woozily conceived , fantastical new play , elvis presley \( mr walken \) , identified as him in the program , looks rather more trim than when he left us more than 17 years ago as a bloated wreck of a man , dependent on chemicals and disconnected from the reality of day he wears an understated las vegas jumpsuit and cape of what seems to be green velvet , cut full , though he no longer has a belly to hide he s surprisingly healthy , and he s definitely fed up he s furious with bro \( rob campbell \) , his runty twin brother , who was stillborn all those years ago and whom he now accuses of feeding on his oceanic public memory it s bro , he says , who s responsible for the trashy stories of elvis sightings that litter the supermarket tabloids it s just fun , says bro they want you to come back according to him , he may well be here as the elvis legend calls the faithful to his graceland shrine in memphis , it has called mr walken to write and star in this jocular contemplation of mythomania , presented in the style of the theater of the absurd him , which i saw at a tuesday preview , opened officially last night at the luesther hall of the joseph papp public theater if you want to see him , however , you 'll have to put on your namebrand running shoes it closes sunday night this is not the critics' fault the play , which has the look and sound of a work in progress , has been in public previews since dec 13 presented without an intermission , him begins with a certain amount of dizzy promise and ends , approximately 75 minutes later , with the only sequence in the play that comes close to realizing it in between , him is cluttered with murky thoughts expressed in windy speeches , illustrated by anecdotes that have no point , though the general idea seems not to be a foolish one when he died in 1977 or , as him suggests , when he engineered his own disappearance , elvis had become an absurd figure in an absurd world made in the image of las vegas here was someone overwhelmed by time and drugs though surrounded by adoration , he was isolated and alone , dogged by the fame that forced him to have his teeth cleaned at 4 am absurd , indeed , is any such god who has no other god but him though the play s running time is short , him often seems longer than both parts of angels in america as directed by jim simpson on kyle chepulis s handsomely spare platform set , it s a succession of takes on fame , innocence and emotional befuddlement , written and staged as burlesque sketches when elvis recalls the day of his death from what was officially listed as cardiac arrhythmia , he listens appalled as the doctors make the decision to pull the plug on him says the nurse we 're dealing with someone who s braindamaged to some extent says elvis i could live with that , but the plug is pulled anyway there s an utterly mysterious sequence as four actors in their underwear stand by his grave and mourn there s also a variation on the gravedigger scene from hamlet a reporter from vanity fair arrives to interview elvis and accuse him of song theft his taxman reports that he s making more money dead than alive a disappointed fan describes one of elvis s grotesque final appearances in las vegas at one point , a fat , largerthanlifesize , spongerubber likeness of the lateperiod elvis is tossed around the stage through it all , elvis himself offers lengthy and opaque commentaries , with incidental music supplied by organ donor , a fourmember rock combo seated in a small pit to the back and left of the playing platform never has any fully clothed actor looked as naked on the stage as mr walken does in him he appears to be enjoying himself immensely , but the performance also seems uncharacteristically edgy , full of awkward movements and transitions , sometimes almost embarrassing there s none of elvis s own intuitive grace , nor of mr walken s he both plays the role and stands outside it , speaking in a southern drawl that recalls tennessee williams s while every now and then sending up the accent by saying thang for thing though it s clear that he s made the decision not to do an elvis impersonation , it s not easy to identify what he is doing , possibly because the lines he s written for himself are so full of wooly generalizations sample chaos is the mamma and poppa of all things as mr walken briefly sings in his own not elvis s manner , the music , composed as well as played by organ donor , evokes a sound that , while it has its roots in 1950 s rockandroll , is completely contemporary a wise decision mr walken s most cheering and refreshingly absurd invention elvis did not die on that 1977 august afternoon in a memphis hospital instead , he plotted his disappearance and transportation to a clinic in morocco there he underwent hormone treatments as the first steps toward his rebirth as a woman all this is introduced by mel \( barton heyman \) , a garrulous old truckdriver who first noticed the resemblance between a diner waitress and the late king of rock though elvis s transformation was not surgically complete , mel reports that he first felt sympathy for the former star , then the stirrings of carnal desire in burlesque drag as her , mr walken is a hoot , especially when he thinks about the old days , missing his daughter , lisa marie , and her new husband , michael he s tempted to reveal himself to the world , but he s concerned by how his fans would react to the drastic changes i 've undergone he says , from now on , i want to be plain old me mel s comment he had a mexican standoff with eternity , and eternity blinked in the sharpness and wit of the writing and in the performances by mr walken and mr heyman , this sequence gives you some idea of what the rest of him might have been him by christopher walken directed by jim simpson scenery and lighting by kyle

saratoga racing until labor day \? the idea is being pushed by kenny noe jr , chairman of the new york racing association , who is convinced that the summer season upstate would be enhanced by extending it into september an announcement could come as early as today in albany , where a racing association news conference has been called noe has been polling the 21 trustees of the racing association , explaining the pros and cons of starting the saratoga season one week later than last year and prolonging it one week through labor day , sept 2 saratoga has always been the august meeting , anyway , he said the other day none of the trustees has said no yet noe has been whirling through new york s tracks since he arrived from florida more than a year ago and took charge of the deepening problems at saratoga , belmont and aqueduct he lopped off executive heads , trimmed the staff , made pilgrimages to albany to open contacts with gov george e pataki , won more money from the legislature and generally began putting new york racing back on its feet he admitted in an interview at aqueduct that he still has no easy solutions to the problems besetting the entire thoroughbred industry , notably the steady drop in attendance and betting at tracks but he intends to launch his second and final year as chairman by intensifying the work he has undertaken he has agreed to the trustees' request to stay on the job through 1996 everybody has his own philosophy of how to run a track , noe said but we do n't think that any one course is necessarily the right one simulcasting , athome telephone betting , whatever so , we 're going to make changes in our advertising approaches , we 're going to continue to spruce up the tracks and we 're going to try to win people back noe said that 1995 was a positive year spiced by several things a new attitude by the legislature , new heroes on the race track like cigar and new successes like the breeders' cup at belmont on oct 28 the legislature agreed to restructure the taxes on winning bets , resulting in 20 million a year more in revenue for nyra the new takeouts went into effect with the start of the saratoga season on july 21 , and the racing association received about 10 million more than it would have through the end of the year we used it for capital improvements , noe said we did a lot of painting and paving on the backstretch and repaired the barns but attendance problems gnawed at him at times the final weekend at belmont the third week in july , the opening weekend at saratoga starting july 21 and the opening weekend at belmont , from sept 1 to labor day , sept 4 when you draw 18 , 000 people on a supposedly big weekend , he said , and a little old country track draws more , you know something s wrong he came to the conclusion that the dates were wrong saratoga , the august meeting , was starting and ending too early why not start the season there one week later next summer , on friday , july 26 , and end it on labor day \? that calendar would also alleviate the housing crunch caused by saratoga s schedule for performing arts
alarmed by exploding rates of skin cancer and especially of deadly melanomas , a coalition of health , environmental and consumer organizations has taken its message about sun protection to the movies along with movie trailers and sales pitches for popcorn , candy and soft drinks , many viewers of feature films this summer will see a 40second spot teaching them about the uv index and how to prevent hazardous overexposure to the sun the coalition , called partners for sun protection awareness , worked with the national weather service to introduce the uv index on an experimental basis last summer the service has declared the index a success and this year expanded its distribution to 160 cities , where daily predictions about ultraviolet exposure accompany the weather report in newspapers and on radio and television scheringplough healthcare products inc , the maker of coppertone sunscreens , has teamed up with the orbital sciences corporation , a private weather forecasting company , to bring daily uv index reports to 527 more cities , towns and resorts nationwide what is the uv index \? ultraviolet , or uv , light is one of many things in life that are best taken in small doses a little uv helps the body make vitamin d too much can cause painful sunburn and skin damage and eventually result in skin cancers , premature aging and wrinkling of the skin and cataracts ultraviolet radiation , the short , invisible rays from the sun , reaches the earth s surface in varying amounts , depending on the time of year , distance from the equator , altitude , time of day and extent of cloud cover in recent years , another factor has entered the picture thinning of the ozone layer , the layer of gas in the stratosphere that blocks much of the uv light , keeping it from hitting the earth s surface there are three bands of uv radiation uva , which penetrates deeply into the skin s layers , contributes to premature aging and wrinkling of the skin , as well as to sunburn and skin cancer it is not absorbed by ozone and reaches the earth at a relatively constant intensity all year uvb radiation , which is stronger than uva , is more intense in summer , at high altitudes and near the equator it is the most common cause of sunburn and a cause of cataracts and also contributes to all the problems associated with uva the third type , uvc , is the strongest and most dangerous but normally does not reach the earth s surface because it is filtered out by ozone ultraviolet radiation is most intense in the middle of a summer day when skies are clear it is more intense near the equator and at high altitudes while heavy cloud cover on an overcast day blocks much of the radiation , a light cloud layer does little to reduce it people are exposed not only to ultraviolet radiation coming directly from the sun but also to indirect rays reflected from sand , sidewalks and road surfaces , water , ice and snow the more rays reaching the skin directly , for instance when a person is lying down rather than standing , the greater the damage the national weather service , in cooperation with the environmental protection agency and the centers for disease control and prevention , created the uv index , a daily computerized forecast of uv exposure based on location and cloud cover predictions , for cities throughout the country readings are generally valid for a radius of about 30 miles around each city the index is calculated to reflect how long it would take a typical fairskinned american \( the type who sometimes tans but usually burns \) to get sunburned during an unprotected stint in the noonday sun the index also suggests what protection is needed to prevent burning from sunglasses and sunscreen \( not less than spf 15 \) for days when the uv level is minimal or low to sunglasses , sunscreen \( spf 30 or higher \) , protective clothing and a widebrimmed hat and shade when the uv level is high or very high but the coalition is quick to point out that darkerskinned people are also at risk of developing uvrelated health problems \( it just takes a longer time for them to get into trouble \) and urges everyone , even blacks , to follow the uv index guidelines for sun protection despite its long association with a healthy look , tanning represents skin damage , even for those who always tan and never burn although uv exposure is most intense when the sun is shining in the middle of the day \( in summer , from 10 30 am to 3 30 pm \) , uv radiation reaches the ground all day long , and 80 percent of it can penetrate a light cloud cover do not be fooled by cool air temperature or a refreshing breeze they do nothing to reduce the uv and while you may never bask in the sun , experts estimate that 80 percent of uv exposure is incidental , acquired while walking around , working or playing outdoors protecting yourself to prevent sun damage , start with your eyes everyone should wear sunglasses , even children look for products that have been coated to absorb 99 to 100 percent of both uva and uvb rays as well as most blue light wraparound styles give the best protection while polarizing lenses can reduce glare , they do not necessarily block uv rays adequately wearing sunglasses that lack uv protection is worse than wearing none at all , since dark glasses make the pupils dilate , and even more uv can enter

helena , mont an audience of 1 , 400 people took their seats at the civic center here the other night for a performance , financed in part by the national endowment for the arts , featuring men dancing in skirts , women dancing with women , fetishism , strong language and open mockery of little rock , ark it was south pacific , and the people loved it they swayed to the strains of some enchanted evening and beamed at the chorus boys and at intermission , many praised the notion of washington s kicking back a little of their tax money so that they could enjoy the show i never saw dance or heard a symphony until i came here , said janet fine , who grew up 200 miles from helena , the daughter and granddaughter of white traders on montana s flathead indian reservation we get the best of both worlds the kind of entertainment we might get in a big city , and the life of this town , being together and seeing things together we would never have this sort of thing if the federal money was cut off this sort of thing troubles swede orham , a farmer who stands against a free lunch for anyone i think art should support itself , said mr orham , who happened to be attending a gallery opening at a helena museum at a friend s invitation the government should n't support anything not grain growers , not farmers paid not to grow crops still , mr orham did not seem to be having a very bad time the argument over federal money for the arts often seems to be a dispute between politicians and performers , played out in the artificial light of staged demonstrations and scripted congressional hearings but millions of other people around the country have a stake in the outcome , too , and perhaps none are more aware of it than the consumers of governmentfinanced art in outoftheway regions like western montana many people like mr orham oppose such programs but a few days of sampling montana s cultural life suggests that those who support government financing do so with a passion an avid audience fills theaters , museums and art shows here on the slopes of the continental divide people drive through blizzards and over mountain passes for a chance to see art and to be part of it many talk about a yearning to be connected to a larger world , to see and hear a creation apart from the overwhelming western sky and most do not match the description of a cultural elite the national endowment for the arts gave montanans about 779 , 000 last year less than 1 a head , but more than the roughly 65 cents allotted to the average american in the endowment s 167 million budget the money helps pay for a little of everything writers' workshops , art museums , community centers , dance troupes , indian tribal singers , quilting bees and woodwind quintets during a threeday tour , many of the people interviewed at performances , galleries and museums said that the art itself was not the point what drew them in was a longing for belonging for most , the federal money seems to play the same role as the rural electrical cooperatives of the 1930 s it electrifies remote regions , creating a kind of wiring to connect them a sense of community is absolutely essential we crave it as human beings and that experience is particularly satisfied through the arts , said gov marc racicot \( pronounced rahscoe \) , a republican regardless of political ideology , our identity and our spiritual health depend on the arts as for montana s other politicians holding statewide office , senator conrad burns , a republican , is down on the idea of federal support for the arts senator max baucus , a democrat , supports the endowment and montana s lone representative , pat williams , a democrat , has defended it at a thursday night show at helena s civic center , the audience for south pacific included paul stahl , a deputy county attorney artists see things differently from the rest of us , he said they make us see things we would never see on our own and if the government does n't help fund it , only the rich can enjoy art that night , a committee of the montana house voted 14 to 3 to defeat a bill that would have converted the state s cultural trust , from which the interest income provides money for the arts , into funds for refurbishing the state house the next morning , at a writers' workshop on the flathead indian reservation , seven high school students working on family histories , short stories and songs heard phil condon , a writer , explain that anger times imagination equals poetry mr condon traveled through montana last year in a program supported by the endowment , giving readings in isolated communities he recalled how , on a night in glasgow , when the mercury hit 27 below and he expected his reading would be canceled , 65 people showed up at the public library to hear him in missoula , the museum of the arts had mounted a show of the works of jacob lawrence , an artist who depicted the black migration from the south the guest book was filled with comments , ranging from perplexing to i love it
when colombian drug lords tried to use salvador dali s selfportrait \( 1972 \) to launder money , the outcome was fittingly surreal united states customs service agents seized the painting , estimated to be worth up to half a million dollars , and are now preparing to auction it off in miami beach to support their crimefighting operations of course , the dali , a mixedmedia work , is scarcely a selfportrait at all , but rather a montage of the face of marilyn monroe superimposed on a bust of mao zedong , superimposed in turn on a dalilike mustached profile surrounded by , naturally , a melting clock , an ant and a vulture awash in cascades of red and yellow paint none of this explains why dali painted the canvas , which is roughly 3 by 4 feet , to mark the composition of his sixpart poem opera etre dieu , featuring dali as god and brigitte bardot as an artichoke the opera is available on hardtofind compact disks , but it has never been performed onstage , although there are plans for a premiere in berlin someday dali died in spain in 1989 at the age of 84 the customs service s involvement with selfportrait began on dec 7 , 1993 , when agents in miami seized it because it had been purchased with the proceeds of illegal drug sales , the agency said this week the intent of the colombian drug traffickers was to have their miami associates sell the painting at auction and funnel the proceeds back to them in colombia , the customs service said in a written statement a spokesman for the agency in miami , michael sheehan , declined to go beyond the official announcement and explain who sent the painting to whom , how the customs service knew about it and where it was seized he described the seizure only as an administrative forfeiture no prosecutions were said to have come out of the case a news conference on the auction described as the customs service s first such sale of a seized masterwork is scheduled for tonight at the bass museum of art in miami beach , where the painting is on exhibit the auction is to be at 8 pm on june 1 although dali s oeuvre is notoriously prone to forgeries , in part because of his tendency to sign blank sheets of paper , the agency said this painting had been verified by several recognized dali experts and authenticated by the artist s archivist , albert field , in new york city as for the painting s provenance , the agency , without elaboration , listed the four owners as helena de saro of barcelona , spain galeria duque arango de medellin in medellin , colombia a private collector in miami , and the customs service the next owner will probably be the high bidder at the auction while the customs service reserves the right to reject all bids and has not announced a minimum price , the painting is said to have been appraised recently at up to 500 , 000 the sale is being conducted by egg dynatrend of burlington , mass , which is the propertydispersal contractor for the treasury department , and larry latham auctioneers of bradenton , fla potential buyers , including phone bidders , will be required to deposit 25 , 000 cashier s checks the proceeds will go into the treasury department s asset forfeiture fund , which supports the customs service s lawenforcement efforts as described by kristina messner of egg , who researched the painting s history , the centerpiece of the work is the maomarilyn photomontage , which was created for dali by the celebrated portrait photographer philippe halsman the curious blended image first appeared on a vogue cover that dali created for the 1971 christmas issue ms messner said that robert descharnes , dali s last business manager , told her that the montage was dreamed up by the artist as a tribute to the growing ties between the united states and china , and that when president richard m nixon made one of his celebrated trips to china , dali had a copy of the image delivered to the chinese leader the painting was said to have been created in conjunction with etre dieu , which dali began in the 1920 s and later collaborated on with the composer igor wakhevitch and the spanish writer manuel vazquez montalban the characters include dali as the divinity and in various androgynous incarnations , as well as catherine the great and marilyn monroe they do a striptease the opera has been called unperformable , requiring an angel to mutilate five million paintings and the vatican to be flooded by niagara falls it was , however , recorded in a paris studio , ms messner said , and produced in threedisk sets by the german label eurostar the company subsequently went out of business , she said , leaving thousands of the cd s in locked warehouses ms messner said there was still hope for the opera , however dragan matic , a yugoslav collector of dali works who lives in frankfurt , germany , owns the rights , she said , and plans a berlin production with mr montalban in the next few years photo a detail of salvador dali

handel by donald burrows illustrated 491 pages schirmer books 30 the recent film farinelli , a muddled biography of a famed 18thcentury castrato that reeked of late20thcentury sensibility , was memorable in only a few positive senses for one , it did a remarkable job of bringing the great composer george frideric handel to life , in a portrayal by jeroen krabbe remarkable not for any particular historical accuracy but for bringing handel to life at all everyone knows the music the hallelujah chorus , at least , if not much more , from a huge body of work many know the iconic image , with bald pate draped in a periwig bulging , impassive eyes hooded by bold , dark brows , and jowly chin suspended from a sternly set jaw yet few have any distinct feeling for the man and not necessarily for lack of trying studies of the composer s life and works have abounded , occasionally coming in waves , as at the composer s tercentenary in 1985 but modern biographers looking to capture the flavor of the rather secretive person , let alone any real insight into his personality , have been hard put to elaborate on the second or thirdhand memoirs of the life of the late george frideric handel , published by john mainwaring in 1760 , the year after handel s death as appreciation for the composer s achievement has grown over the centuries , handel himself has receded ever further into lonely eminence , to lift donald burrows s words from another context it would be gratifying to report that mr burrows had brought the composer to vivid life it must suffice to say that he has done a better job of it than perhaps any other general biographer , following the tortuous trail of documents \( very few of a personal nature \) as avidly as any sleuth could do in fact , mr burrows is a specialist of the first rank a performer and conductor and the head of the music department at the open university in milton keynes , england , he has carried out original research covering much of handel s mature career and has edited several of his works for publication for good and ill , mr burrows writes like a specialist though lacking the literary flair of , say , paul henry lang , in his handel biography of 1966 , mr burrows exudes authority not only in what he puts forward but also in his prudent refusal to claim too much the book proceeds in periods , discussing first handel s life , then his works , in alternating chapters like most handel biographers , mr burrows makes short work of the composer s early years , in germany \( halle , where he was born , hamburg and hanover \) and italy \( florence , rome , venice and naples \) the narrative grows spirited with handel s arrival in london , in 1711 it is here that mr burrows has the most to offer , and his command of detail is remarkable he guides the reader through an opera or oratorio season almost performance by performance , turning up lovely sidelights along the way his treatment of handel s notorious borrowings from his own works and others' is nothing short of virtuosic the music of cleopatra s final aria in act i , 'tu la mia stella sei , ' he writes of giulio cesare , of 1724 , has an explicit ancestry from handel s earlier works , through an aria for the version of 'radamisto' given in december 1720 , movements from the queen anne birthday ode of 1713 and a cantata written in italy , and thus to a movement from keiser s 'claudius' of 1703 mr burrows is , in fact , so wise and wry on the subject of handel s borrowings that one might hope for a fulllength study of the subject from him it is difficult to separate slight , halfremembered echoes , or wellintegrated petty larcenies , from the common property of musical language in a style so well defined by harmonic and melodic convention as the late baroque , he writes with fine balance but of originality as the last refuge of a scoundrel , in 1713 , he says elsewhere by the time he came to compose 'teseo , ' handel had used up a considerable stock of his selfborrowable music , and this opera owes less than its predecessors to preexisting material mr burrows also brings a sound musicianly sense to bear in reasonable conjecture it seems certain that the organ , pedals and all , was in full view of the audience , he writes of the premiere of an organ concerto at the lincoln s inn fields theater in 1740 , because the initial musical flourish for the pedals could , from the technical point of view , just as well have been played with the left hand , and handel presumably allocated it to the pedals so that he could be seen playing them more often , however , caution reigns , occasionally to an exasperating degree the accumulation of qualifications and indirect locutions can approach the level of parody it seems probable , runs one early tangle of a sentence , that mainwaring s account gives a rather exaggerated portrait of the insensitivity of handel s father , though it may still convey the child s perception of the force of adult restrictions , but we need not doubt mainwaring s reports that handel s father 'always intended him for the study of civil law' \( a profession as safe' in its prospects as medicine \) and , as he approached 70 years of age , found some difficulty in coping with his son s 'uncontroulable humour' toward music , manifested by 'getting at harpsichords' whenever possible pause for a breath , and pick up there is no reason to doubt , also and again , we have no good grounds for disbelieving none of this is to make light of mr burrows s discretion , which for a scholar is truly the better part of valor , and which in its more artful applications can only be admired but the casual reader \( or intrigued moviegoer \) should be warned this is not a quick or light read the book supersedes \( by a long shot \) percy young s handel biography of 1947 in the longrunning series the master musicians , published in britain by j m dent and now edited by stanley sadie , of new grove dictionary fame like other books in the series , it offers extensive appendices , including a chronology of handel s life alongside a calendar of contemporary events , musical and otherwise a list of his works , and capsule biographies of 100 or so prominent figures in the tale mr burrows s book will undoubtedly prove invaluable to serious students and useful as well to general readers who do not expect from it a more rounded picture of its subject than any handel biography can give photo george frideric handel
following is president clinton s state of the union message last night , as recorded by the new york times mr president , mr speaker , members of the 104th congress , my fellow americans , again we are here in the sanctuary of democracy and once again , our democracy has spoken so let me begin by congratulating all of you here in the 104th congress , and congratulating you , mr speaker if we agree on nothing else tonight , we must agree that the american people certainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994 and as i look out at you , i know how some of you must have felt in 1992 i must say that in both years we did n't hear america singing , we heard america shouting and now all of us , republicans and democrats alike , must say we hear you we will work together to earn the jobs you have given us for we are the keepers of the sacred trust and we must be faithful to it in this new and very demanding era over 200 years ago , our founders changed the entire course of human history by joining together to create a new country based on a single , powerful idea we hold these truths to be selfevident , that all men are created equal , endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness it has fallen to every generation since then to preserve that idea the american idea and to deepen and expand its meaning in new and different times to lincoln and to his congress , to preserve the union and to end slavery to theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson , to restrain the abuses and excesses of the industrial revolution and to assert our leadership in the world to franklin roosevelt , to fight the failure and pain of the great depression and to win our country s great struggle against fascism and to all our presidents since , to fight the cold war especially , i recall two who struggled to fight that cold war in partnership with congresses where the majority was of a different party to harry truman , who summoned us to unparalleled prosperity at home and who built the architecture of the cold war and to ronald reagan , whom we wish well tonight , and who exhorted us to carry on until the twilight struggle against communism was won goals of 1992 in another time of change and challenge , i had the honor to be the first president to be elected in the postcoldwar era , an era marked by the global economy , the information revolution , unparalleled change in opportunity and in security for the american people i came to this hallowed chamber two years ago on a mission to restore the american dream for all our people and to make sure that we move into the 21st century still the strongest force for freedom and democracy in the entire world i was determined then to tackle the tough problems too long ignored in this effort i am frank to say that i have made my mistakes and i have learned again the importance of humility in all human endeavor but i am also proud to say tonight that our country is stronger than it was two years ago record numbers , record numbers of americans are succeeding in the new global economy we are at peace , and we are a force for peace and freedom throughout the world we have almost six million new jobs since i became president , and we have the lowest combined rate of unemployment and inflation in 25 years our businesses are more productive and here we have worked to bring the deficit down , to expand trade , to put more police on our streets , to give our citizens more of the tools they need to get an education and to rebuild their own communities but the rising tide is not lifting all the boats tasks still ahead while our nation is enjoying peace and prosperity , too many of our people are still working harder and harder for less and less while our businesses are restructuring and growing more productive and competitive , too many of our people still ca n't be sure of having a job next year or even next month and far more than our material riches are threatened , things far more precious to us our children , our families , our values our civil life is suffering in america today citizens are working together less and shouting at each other more the common bonds of community which have been the great strength of our country from its very beginning are badly frayed what are we to do about it \? more than 60 years ago at the dawn of another new era , president roosevelt told our nation new conditions impose new requirements on government and those who conduct government and from that simple proposition he shaped the new deal , which helped to restore our nation to prosperity and defined the relationship between our people and their government for half a century that approach worked in its time but today we face a very different time and very different conditions we are moving from an industrial age built on gears and sweat to an information age demanding skills and learning and flexibility our government , once a champion of national purpose , is now seen by many as simply a captive of narrow interests putting more burdens on our citizens rather than equipping them to get ahead the values that used to hold us all together seem to be coming apart
helen chadwick 'bad blooms' museum of modern art 11 west 53d street manhattan through july 1 large color photographs , hung at different heights in brightly colored circular frames , seem to float up the walls in bad blooms , an installation by the english artist helen chadwick the suggestion of bubbles continues in the pictures themselves , in which bunches of flowers float atop hair gel , burbling chocolate and other liquids but the photographs , taken from above , look like aerial views of fancy cakes slathered with frothy icings in some pictures floral decorations ring the outer edges like pastry fluting one group of flowers is shaped like a barbell and another is vaguely vaginal none of the rest , though , have a particularly evocative form the contrast between art as an expression of ideal beauty and the messy reality of the body has long been one of ms chadwick s central themes in earlier works , she presented luscious color closeups of animal organs and images of nudes trapped inside large geometrical solids here she seems to be aiming at a similar attractionrepulsion effect , with her dainty floral groupings and frothy liquids but the images tilt too strongly to the decorative to achieve any real tension , and the pictures end up looking simply like tasty illustrations of a baker s wares charles hagen

what began as a relatively minor incident police officers chasing a team of suspected pickpockets into a subway turned the homebound rush into a nightmare for thousands in midtown manhattan late yesterday after a police officer accidently shot himself confusion over the shooting brought swarms of fellow officers to the scene and subway power had to be turned off as they searched for suspects in dark tunnels the police snared two of three suspects , one outside and one inside the crowded subway station at rockefeller center , at the avenue of the americas between 47th and 50th streets but hundreds of civilians cowered in the station and aboard stalled trains , and more than 100 , 000 subway riders and countless motorists were caught in delays of up to two hours that spilled across midtown the transit authority shut off power on the sixth avenue line in midtown from 5 09 to 6 51 pm the bulk of the evening rush halting the f , b , d and q trains , which carry hundreds of thousands of riders to destinations in upper and lower manhattan and to the bronx , queens and brooklyn ripple effects also hit eighth avenue e trains to and from queens , and transit officials said it was nearly 9 pm , almost two hours after the usual end of the evening rush , before the subways began to return to normal surface traffic on the avenue of the americas also was snarled for hours as police cars and ambulances clogged intersections at the scene only a single gunshot was fired that by the officer who wounded himself in the thigh as he descended into the station the pickpocket suspects apparently were not armed but a police radio report said only that an officer had been shot , and in the timehonored tradition of the police department , scores of officers swarmed into the station to aid the wounded officer in scenes of chaos and panic , hundreds of terrified civilians uncertain what was happening or of the extent of the danger fell prone on the mezzanine and to the floors of several trains as officers with guns drawn dashed through the station shortly after 5 pm the panic displayed yesterday by subway riders may have reflected deeper anxieties prompted by a series of violent incidents in and near the subways a woman pushed to her death by a stranger two firebombings that left scores of riders injured a wild shootout in august on a midtown subway platform in which a transit officer was gravely wounded by another officer even , perhaps , the fatal shooting , also in august , of an nbc stagehand in rockefeller center during yesterday s incident , a woman sustained a foot injury in an unknown manner perhaps from the officer s ricocheting slug , perhaps from the heel of her own shoe , the police said she suffered a superficial wound and was treated at st clare s hospital and health center and released one man was struck in the neck by an unidentified flying fragment , and at least five other subway riders were felled by heat exhaustion on trains whose doors were kept locked , apparently for the protection of riders , while the police hunted for suspects under the trains and in the tunnels the man who suffered the neck wound , marshall beaver , 27 , said he was hit as he walked along a platform the police said , 'everybody down ! ' he recalled as a medical technician wiped blood from his neck , his nose and his hands it was like a movie then i felt my face and there was blood much of the civilian panic appeared to stem from the urgency and size of the police response , which came from the midtown north and surrounding precincts some witnesses told of officers in uniform and in plainclothes who rushed about with drawn guns , shouting at people to flee or get down lairtiya mcnealy , 16 , a long island city high school student , was aboard a q train that pulled into the station just as the uproar started she said she saw police officers instruct the conductor not to open the doors , then heard what sounded like gunfire we all fell on the floor for cover , she said there were people falling all over each other there were 60 cops and some had big guns they were crouching on the tracks after an hour , she said , passengers were let off the train cruz torres , 38 , a bank employee who was caught in the confusion as he headed home to the bronx , said cops were saying to duck , lay down low i 've been riding the train for 15 years i 've never experienced anything like this look how my hands are shaking in the mezzanine , stretching from 47th to 50th streets , scores of civilians huddled against the walls and behind pillars witnesses told of sobbing people crawling on the floor and others seemingly paralyzed by fear a woman trying to run away fell on her face someone got her up and hustled her out several people were treated at the scene for stress a man in his 50 s was given oxygen , and a woman , apparently in shock , was carried away on a stretcher meantime , the arrival of police dogs brought to search the tunnels added to the chaos more than a mile away from the scene , a van carrying officers from the midtown south task force collided with a car at 23d street and third avenue as the officers were responding to rockefeller center five officers were injured , none seriously the police , sorting out the evening s confusion , said the trouble began shortly after 5 pm when five plainclothes officers an anticrime team from midtown north on pickpocket detail saw three suspects approach two elderly couples , tourists from puerto rico , at sixth avenue and 47th street one suspect ripped open the pants pocket of one of the tourists and stole his wallet , which contained 238 the officers moved in quickly and grabbed one suspect , later identified as jeff triggle , 36 , of 1237 stanley avenue , brooklyn two other suspects ran into the subway station entrance at 47th street , with the anticrime officers , and others nearby in uniform , in pursuit one officer , barry neiss , 24 , of midtown south , apparently shot himself in the right thigh as he entered the station he was taken to st luke sroosevelt hospital center , where he was treated and released but as a radio call for assistance went out , citing an officer shot and suspects still at large , scores of other officers rushed to the scene and into the subway station it was a measure of the day s confusion that reports suggested that the woman who was injured was pregnant , and that she had gone into labor inside the subway station these reports apparently were all erroneous the police said one of the suspects , ernest hill , 28 , of 193 albany avenue , brooklyn , was taken into custody on a platform in the station investigators said he was carrying 238 in cash believed to be the robbery loot the two suspects in custody were charged last night with robbery in the second degree , resisting arrest and criminal possession of stolen property the third suspect apparently escaped into the subway tunnels and was not found , the police said photos two unidentified police officers assist a colleague , officer barry neiss , who shot himself in the leg last evening while chasing suspected pickpockets \( the associated press \) ernest hill , of brooklyn , was taken into custody after being chased by the police another suspect was also under arrest and a third was being sought \( chang w lee the new york times \) \( pg 21 \) at least five people were affected by heat inside subway trains that were shut down last evening as the police chased suspected pickpockets in the rockefeller center station a passenger , above , was taken to a hospital \( chang w lee the new york times \) \( pg 23 \)
for the right price , you can have a star named after you , own a chunk of the berlin wall or put a message on the zipper in times square now gilbert dilucia wants to make it possible to own a tiny piece of the new york yankees his plan buy a 31 percent stake in the team for 86 million , then divide it into 20 , 000 shares and sell it at 500 a share , generating 10 million each share would represent a little over one onemillionth of the team just enough , mr dilucia believes , to turn fans into financiers and vice versa the proposal is in a purchase agreement that mr dilucia a lawyer , businessman and longtime new york political gadfly signed last month with a yankees limited partner , harvey l leighton mr leighton , a 62yearold retired steel executive who has been in poor health , has been trying to sell his shares in the yankees for five years he became so desperate that he took out a classified ad in the wall street journal in february on march 6 , shortly before entering the hospital to begin treatments for cancer , he signed a twopage contract , giving the goahead to mr dilucia s plan mr dilucia , 68 , a former fixture in greenwich village politics who now practices law a block from the baseball hall of fame in cooperstown , ny , said that he believes that if every fan could own a piece of the yankees , it would rejuvenate a game wounded by the recent players' strike on wednesday , he said , he drove to albany and reserved a name for his proposed company loyal fans inc fans today have been totally disregarded they 're the ones who are putting the money into owners' and players' pockets and i think they should have a piece of the action , mr dilucia said this would create bornagain fans , they would infused with the conviction almost of a religion once they became capitalistic stockholders of the yankees mr dilucia admits that his proposal faces hurdles , not the least of which is winning approval from george steinbrenner , the club s principal owner and managing general partner experts in securities law also said that such financial arrangements a public entity owning a private partnership asset are rare and can open a partnership to prying eyes and financial liability mr leighton , who has owned a stake in the yankees for 19 years , is now having second thoughts he said in an interview this week that when the agreement was executed , he was about to begin cancer treatments and he signed in haste , without having a lawyer read the final twopage draft i think i signed when i was perhaps at my lowest ebb , mr leighton said , adding that based on his own experience , he does n't envision a rush of people out to buy stock in the new york yankees mr leighton is more optimistic about his health and fears that mr dilucia s deal could undermine his relationship with the other partners , especially mr steinbrenner , who has to sign off on all partnership sales i never sign anything without having a lawyer look at it first , mr leighton said but in this case , i did but mr dilucia said that numerous drafts of the document were exchanged and read by lawyers on both sides and that recent expressions of doubt are being fueled by other potential buyers who have recently come forward for them to come and say , this is not a valid contract simply is not fair , mr dilucia said if anyone wants to come into the picture and try to replace me , they 're going to buy a lawsuit , plain and simple i'm going to fight for this team interest a spokesman for mr steinbrenner , howard j rubenstein , said the yankees' owner has n't had time to really consider this latest turn of events and would have no comment a spokesman for major league baseball , jim small , said that although public corporations own ball clubs notably the tribune company , owner of the chicago cubs a publicly traded corporation owning only a piece of a limited partnership would be a first he said the arrangement had not been presented to the league and he could not say how it would be received the one certainty is that the purchase agreement has set in motion a whole sequence of events under the club s rules , once a purchase agreement is presented , other limited partners can step forward to match the offer if none do , mr steinbrenner s hand will be forced to either buy mr leighton s shares himself , to accept mr dilucia s deal or to turn it down if the sale is denied , mr dilucia , who spent 400 , 000 of his own money running for mayor of new york in 1985 , said he is ready to take mr steinbrenner to court if another partner does matches mr dilucia s offer , the agreement gives him the right to improve his own bid during the sixmonth option period covered by the agreement with mr leighton , mr dilucia also stands to collect a commission if the partnership shares are sold to anyone else the great wild card is how mr steinbrenner will take to the plan but mr dilucia s lawyer , donald snider , said he is already anticipating possible objections and planning his responses mr snider said he thinks the yankees organization might argue , for example , that open sales of stock could allow a professional sports gambler to gain control of a majority of loyal fans' stock , which would embarrass the club and the league , though it would not effect the team s operations one way around such a complaint , mr snider said , is to issue two classes of stock , voting and nonvoting the nonvoting stock could be sold to the public , while the voting shares , and ultimately the control of the company , would be retained by mr dilucia and his associates , who would represent loyal fans in all dealings with the yankees either way , mr dilucia acknowledges that mr steinbrenner is better to have as a friend than an enemy and he believes the yankees' owner will see the wisdom of making the team just a little more public i consider him to be a man of vision , mr dilucia said he had the courage to go in and buy the yankees , and i had the courage to sign this contract photo gilbert dilucia , sitting on old yankee seats at the baseball hall of fame , would sell shares in the team \( michael j okoniewski for the new york

the high schools in eastern bergen county are all good ones they send most of their seniors off to college and , presumably , to good and prosperous lives in many cases , people in these 20 towns choose to live where they do precisely so their children can attend the schools none of the 15 high schools that serve the 20 towns are large the strong penchant of new jersey residents for home rule , for control of what goes on within the borders of their towns , is very much in evidence here also strongly in evidence , in a state with the fourth most segregated school system in the country , are race and prejudice real or perceived and the law at issue is a high school that is 92 percent black and hispanic dwight morrow , in englewood surrounded by largely white ones courts have ordered the state board of education to end the racial imbalance , now and forever because this is about children and their education and future , people in all 20 towns have strong feelings many people in the towns surrounding englewood s segregated dwight morrow high school are furious at any plans to redefine school districts , creating combined or new schools hundreds have attended town meetings , hurling angry protests at educators while many englewood parents favor regionalized high schools , they are equally fervent about preserving dwight morrow a decade of litigation seems to be coming to an end the resolution will directly affect the way the region s 39 , 000 children are educated it could change the way new jersey s public school systems are formed , ushering in bigger regional high schools or magnet schools , with advanced courses in specialties like science or the arts to which children from surrounding towns would be bused it could also be a precedent , in new jersey and even the nation , for integrating schools in mixed communities that whites have deserted the lawsuits began 10 years ago with three towns and three school boards englewood , tenafly and englewood cliffs these last two , like most of the towns in this part of the state , are largely white , with a growing minority of asians englewood cliffs is very small and very welloff , with so few black residents they could be counted on the fingers of both hands tenafly is larger but almost as affluent the third town , englewood , is actually a small city , with an urban range of income , race and nationality like the other two , it is leafy and pleasant the average family income in the last census was 53 , 000 , but residents range from the very wealthy eddie murphy has a house there to about 20 percent lowincome about half its residents are white like other local high schools , englewood s offers a full range of advancedplacement courses and electives its towering redbrick building is especially graceful but unlike the town , the enrollment at dwight morrow is overwhelmingly black and hispanic , up from about 60 percent as recently as the 1970 s almost all of englewood s white and asian parents , including a substantial and growing population of orthodox jews , have simply opted out of the system , sending their children to private or parochial schools that is what the lawsuits are about englewood asserts , and the courts have agreed , that it does not matter whether schools are segregated deliberately or by happenstance whatever the reason , if it is at all practical , schools must be integrated in 1992 a state appellate court ordered a study of regionalization in the 20town area surrounding englewood , tenafly and englewood cliffs regionalization , the combining of several school districts , is sometimes done for racial balance , but more often to create bigger schools with a more varied curriculum and resources the study , being done by applied data services , a private consultant , will show different configurations of demographically varied school districts , as well as suggestions for magnet schools it is to be given to education commissioner leo f klagholz on july 25 he will then decide which option to accept , if any the state has also asked harry galinsky , a respected former superintendent of schools in paramus , to meet with residents in the 20 towns and try to come up with alternatives to involuntary regionalization but whatever the department s final judgment and it , too , will be subject to court review the state s aim is to resolve the segregation problem permanently , says jay doolan , who is overseeing the study for the education department there are people in eastern bergen who think this study is a noble venture that would result in even finer schools that would expose students to many cultures what you 're doing is making history and law , said mayor donald aronson of englewood the evolution of this case may change the face of education in state of new jersey something has to be done to change the racial imbalance in this community and there are people who see the study as an attempt to wreck lovingly tended neighborhood schools , schools that offer a wonderful sense of stability in a volatile world , as one tenafly parent put it
danish researchers say they have found the general site of a gene linked to persistent bedwetting in children , and the experts said their report should lay to rest the idea that the problem is primarily emotional for 10 years the experts have suspected that a gene was a factor in bedwetting but this is the first proof the precise gene has not yet been found , and how it may lead to bedwetting is not known researchers cautioned that they cannot say with certainty at this point if the problem is entirely genetic , or if more than one gene might be involved but the immediate effect of the discovery may be in dispelling the stigma and blame that children are often made to feel for bedwetting much of the psychological turmoil associated with bedwetting is the result of teasing from playmates , punishment or humiliation by parents , or a sense of shame in the child knowing that a gene is causing the problem should alleviate much of the parental blame and a child s embarrassment about wetting , said dr michael jellinek , chief of child psychiatry at the massachusetts general hospital in boston pediatricians also said that the identification of a gene site for bedwetting , or enuresis , might make it possible for earlier identification and treatment of children prone to it there are two patterns of bedwetting in persistent bedwetting , or primary enuresis , children 7 or older wet the bed three or more times a week this type accounts for 75 percent of the cases in secondary enuresis a child wets only occasionally , after having been dry for at least six months a gene is not believed to be a factor in this type while most 2 and 3yearolds sometimes wet the bed , about 10 percent of children wet their bed after they are 6 , at which age it is considered a problem by child specialists of these children , a small percentage are cured spontaneously each year , so that less than 1 percent of 18yearolds still suffer from enuresis in their report , the researchers said a gene for primary enuresis was on the long arm of chromosome 13 of the 23 pairs of chromosomes in human cells primary enuresis affects an estimated five million to seven million american children and teenagers it mainly affects boys , for reasons that are not understood the discovery of the gene site was made by dr hans eiberg and his colleagues in the department of genetics at the university of copenhagen a report on the discovery is in the july issue of the journal nature genetics this may make it easier for children , dr eiberg said the families were very relieved to learn it was genetic , and so beyond the control of parent or child dr eiberg screened 400 families to find 11 in which one parent and at least one child both had histories of primary enuresis the pattern of transmission suggested that the gene was dominant , meaning that if just one parent had the problem , a child would be likely to have it , too there was no pattern of inheritance found for families in which children had secondary enuresis in these children no one knows what the cause is , dr eiberg said it could be anything from epilepsy to psychological tensions in the family previous studies of primary enuresis with larger numbers of families estimated that if both parents were affected , about twothirds of their children would inherit the problem if just one parent had been a bedwetter , a child would have a 44 percent chance of having the problem earlier speculations on the probable site for the chromosome had centered on genes involved in regulating the amount of urine output during the night , or genes that control smooth muscle contraction or sleep stages but none of these genes appear to be in the region identified by the copenhagen researchers while there have long been elaborate psychological explanations for enuresis , dr jellinek said , in the last decade clinicians have suspected that primary enuresis was inherited if you ask a child s father if he had the problem as a child , and he says yes , you know that the child will stop at the same age he did that s a strong indication genetics are at play for that reason , dr jellinek said , the latest discovery is not a huge surprise , though it s good it s confirmed experts in treating the problem say that while the discovery is helpful in understanding what leads to bedwetting in some children , it will have little , if any , effect on treatment approaches there are many , many different factors at play in bedwetting apart from genetics , said dr stanley greenspan , a child psychiatrist at george washington university medical school it may be associated with slow maturation of motor control in some children , or allergies such as to dairy products in others , or outofcontrol behavior in still others you want to design a treatment in view of a full understanding of the overall pattern one common behavioral treatment for bedwetting uses a sensor in sheets that sets off a bell when it detects moisture the bell helps kids with the ability to sense bladder fullness at night , dr greenspan said desmopressin , a synthetic analogue of the hormone vasopressin , which regulates urine production , has been found most effective in children with primary enuresis , and less so with those children who wet the bed only occasionally another medication , imipramine , has also been used with some success , although its main use is as an antidepressant for adults but dr greenspan said , especially with young children you are reluctant to use any biological treatment until you 've tried behavioral and psychological approaches first he also cautioned that the gene for primary enuresis may be part of a bigger behavioral syndrome , noting that for most human behavior there is not just one gene , but multiple ones interacting
for 20 minutes on monday evening , the twoton bell in the tower of the old jefferson market courthouse rang over greenwich village , breaking a virtual silence of 97 years except for throat clearings of a few bongs now and again , the bell , said to be the second largest in new york city , after one at riverside church , had not tolled seriously since sounding adm george dewey s victory at manila bay during the spanishamerican war that was when some battleenthralled graffiti painter had daubed to hell with spain remember the maine 1898 , inside the bell s skirt , where the inscription is still visible but this week s peal had nothing to do with jingo bells instead , what was being marked as tom sharkey , the superintendent of the building , pushed and pulled the clapper was a triumph somewhat more parochial than the dismantling of the spanish empire namely , the preservation and restoration of the courthouse at 10th street and the avenue of the americas , which had been modeled after a bavarian trifle and now houses a branch of the new york public library it s a very lyrical moment , said margot gayle , who 37 years ago set about rescuing the building as it was about to be auctioned to developers coveting the ground it stood on she paused and looked up before joining some 80 people who had gathered to recall a long trail of community action now that the building s renovation has been capped off with a new slate roof i keep thinking of all of us who got involved years ago and i realize that we really did it , said ms gayle , who was sitting next to marvin schneider , the clockmaster of the city s clocks when the bell rang , i felt my spirits rise it was in 1959 that ms gayle began organizing i was working for the department of city planning and living on ninth street i got to know some architects and they pointed out just how spectacular that courthouse was it had been built in 1877 on the edge of what was then one of the city s poorest neighborhood , pushed forward as another of boss tweed s extravagances large sums were appropriated before anything was ever built , and when construction began , no opportunities for kickbacks seemed to have been ignored , with contractors providing stainedglass windows , gargoyles , venetian fountains , intricate ebony door frames , the clock with its four faces and the huge bell among the wealth of details , there is an inscription cut into the circular stairway stipulating that the precepts of the law are these to live correctly , to do an evil to none and to render to everyone his own by the time the building was completed , this third requirement must have been fulfilled with everyone duly rendered unto the new york times observed at the time that putting up so lavish a building in such a rundown neighborhood was like placing a jewel in a swine s snout , and the architects , frederick clarke withers and calvert vaux , one of the designers of central park , were accused by some critics of incompetence , even insanity but 10 years later the courthouse was voted by architects as one of the 10 most beautiful buildings in america the courts moved out in 1927 and by the time ms gayle s interest in the building developed , city agencies had moved out and it was empty it s hard to believe now , but there was absolutely no interest back then in public victorian architecture , ms gayle said plans were made to sell off the property , along with the adjoining women s house of detention that was ultimately razed i thought we should focus on the clock , said ms gayle for years , its hand had stood at 3 20 and i thought everyone would want the clock to move so we named our group the committee of neighbors to get the clock on jefferson market courthouse started we were a small group , but we had this very long name people joined in , among them lewis mumford and jane jacobs , the architectural critics , and e e cummings , the poet who lived across 10th street by 1961 , the group had raised enough money to restart and illuminate the clock that effort spurred greater ambitions , and in response to the committee s appeals , in 1961 mayor robert f wagner announced the building would be preserved as a library since opening in 1967 , the library branch has , according to paul schmidt , the director , become one of the best used in the city it is a gloriously welcoming building , said the librarian , who has been there from the start no , we 've had no reports of ghosts i guess the weirdest thing i can remember is that once a reader left me a note saying that twice the world has been saved because of what had happened in this library i really do n't know what he had in mind ms gayle said that bell s ringing had inspired her do n't you think it would be neighborly if the bell rang out the hours \? said the woman who got the clock to move you could see her thinking

natan sharansky is not a man given to foreboding he suffered in the political cells of the soviet gulag but endured , preserving not only his life but his verve and hope he saw dreams become reality freedom after nine hideous prison years and now a role as leader of a new moderate and fiercely democratic party in israel when the time came , after the gulag , for this man to write what he had learned , he chose three words as title fear no evil but in new york the other day he talked to me of a fear in him now , of an evil he had never contemplated the emotional and political partition of israeli jews now , he said , what israel needed above all was healing and conciliation not with terrorists like the assassin of yitzkak rabin , not with the people to whom the murderer is hero nobody has to lecture natan sharansky about that but within the israeli population , divided about how to achieve peace and security nobody had doubted that conciliation could be achieved by the democratic system the assassin shook that faith now comes a new shock to the system , this time from inside it right after the murder , it became known that a man called avishai raviv was the head of the small rightwing group known as eyal , to which the killer belonged he was arrested for not supplying the police with the suspicions he must have had about the assassin then released , to house arrest now it emerges that he not only headed the group but helped organize it as a paid agent of the secret police , shin beth which reports to the prime minister s office maybe shin beth s idea was to gather some of the fanatics together the better to keep an eye on them if so , obviously they did not eye the murderer very closely and it develops that mr raviv was also an agent provocateur against the leader of the likud opposition , benjamin netanyahu for more than a month mr netanyahu was denounced in israel and america for saying nothing while a poster showing mr rabin as a nazi was displayed at a likud rally he swore he had not seen the poster he denounced it instantly when he heard about it but after the murder , the charges became accepted as fact in the us and israeli press after all , the poster appeared in a tv shot mr netanyahu was accused of silently encouraging fanatics at the rally , and so having blood on his hands that poster , israeli sources tell me , was taken to the rally by agent raviv the tv cameraman says that mr raviv showed him the poster and pushed him to take the picture it was seen all over israel , but not at the rally a classic piece of propaganda frameup , lying by lens after the poster appeared on tv , the first person the shin beth must have asked about it was mr raviv , their agent why did they or their civilian masters remain silent about the charges against mr netanyahu \? in new york , mr sharansky talked about israelis who use mr rabin s death to make scapegoats of orthodox jews we talked about american jews who used it to warn jews that they had only one choice accept the current plan for peace or begone , befouled , from the company of decent jews and he knew that it had been written in the us that the killer was just an average religious rightwing hardliner who had heard likud logically , we agreed , that would mean that the average person in a substantial segment of the israeli public was a potential assassin then there was another american jewish intellectual who wrote that this was not a time for the sham of healing talk but for reckoning will this continue in the us , scapegoating by some jews of others too religious , or too conservative , or both , for their tastes \? probably , i said politically conservative religious jews were out of fashion even before the assassination since they are being lumped together as distasteful , dangerous clones know one , know all israel cannot afford that kind of thing , mr sharansky said , as heavily as i ever heard him talk and later , when i called him in canada about the shin beth scandal , he said that prime minister shimon peres s priority should be to tear down the walls within israel no peace at home , none with neighbors , he said , and we let it go at that
orlando , fla , feb 16 as major league clubs began spring training with replacement players today , about a quarter of the striking major league players gathered off the field to hear and discuss the threat lenny dykstra seemed to have posed to union solidarity when the nearly fivehour meeting ended , dykstra , the feisty phillies outfielder , was nowhere to be seen or heard , but his fellow strikers said they felt comfortable speaking for him they said he had expressed his concerns about the strike at the meeting but was satisfied the union was handling negotiations properly and was solidly behind it more than 260 players met at the hyatt regency grand cypress hotel , while in other parts of florida , one team , the yankees , formally introduced replacement players to major league baseball with the first pitchers' and catchers' workout of spring training and another team , the st louis cardinals , welcomed 69 players , including minor leaguers and designated replacements , to their daybeforeworkout medicals in arizona , manager lou piniella and his coaching staff showed up at the seattle mariners' complex in peoria for the scheduled first workout of the team s 40man major league roster but they knew none of the players would join them because they 're all on strike instead , piniella and friends ate breakfast , swapped the usual spring training battle tales , then departed , awaiting the actual start of camp next monday with minor leaguers and replacements at their meeting here , when they were n't flailing at dykstra or listening to him , the players also heard a report from the negotiating committee that they were prepared to end the strike on five different grounds through an agreement , binding arbitration , president clinton s factfinding plan , the hatchmoynihan bill to repeal part of the clubs' antitrust exemption , and the clubs' honoring their agreement with the national labor relations board to restore the work rules that existed before their implementation of a salary cap it was the first time donald fehr , the union leader , had said the players would return to work under the previous work rules i would recommend to the board at that point there is no reason to continue the strike , at least now , he said but fehr also noted that the owners have said they would consider locking out the players if they decided to return to work without a new agreement whether they would do it remains to be seen , fehr said after their union session ended , the striking players expressed nothing but disdain for the strikebreaking players basically their careers are probably over , andy van slyke , a free agent , said noting that the owners' strategy in using replacements is to lure strikers back to work , he said , if the people on the other side of the negotiating table think that we 're all of a sudden going to have an urgency to get back playing because we see nonqualified major league players on the field , they have miscalculated how we feel about how much pride we put into our jobs the meeting that had just ended drew what union officials believed was the biggest turnout ever for one workstoppage meeting the signin list contained 260 names , and one union official said 10 or 15 players more came in after the list was passed around many of them perhaps were attracted by the knowledge that dykstra would attend he gained instant attention on both sides of the bargaining table last week by questioning , in a television interview , the union s stance in negotiations he suggested the players should rethink our position , what s best for us , and some people inferred that he was hinting he would consider going back to work in april even if the strike continued when today s meeting ended , dykstra did not emerge from the ballroom where they players had lodged themselves all afternoon he had exited out of view of reporters and television cameras according to people who were in the room , many players were upset with dykstra s televised comments some hammered him during the meeting , they said , not for the views he had expressed , but because he spoke without being informed on the issues he spoke about he asked for and received a chance to air his views today , reading a prepared statement , and player members of the negotiating committee responded with one player out of approximately 1 , 100 expressing such views , union officials were not concerned that dykstra would create discord among union members but they did suspect that the owners viewed his words as a crack in the players' solidarity , therefore slowing down a negotiating process that already was crawling there s 1 , 100 players out there on 40man rosters , fehr said we seem to be focusing on one some of us never paid attention to the suggestion of discord as related by others at the meeting , dykstra s biggest concern was whether or not the two sides would reach agreement and how they might reach one a lot of guys were upset with what he did , one person said but afterward no one spoke critically of dykstra i play with lenny i know lenny , curt schilling , a phillies' pitcher , said lenny dykstra will not cross the picket line lenny just had some valid concerns that every other player in the union has about where we 're headed , and after today s meeting we all know we 're headed somewhere together bob tewksbury , a freeagent pitcher , said dykstra was totally behind the union , adding there s no suspicion or even a thought that he is n't going to be behind us as long as this thing takes to be resolved he made a firm statement with regard to that in a later session , union officials and players met for close to three hours with a dozen managers , plus assorted coaches and trainers , to clear the air on whether or not the union would take any action against people in those groups who work with replacement players those groups pay union dues and are members of the union s benefit and productlicensing programs we cleared a lot of debris out of the way , gene orza , a union lawyer , said fehr said there was no change in the relationship inside pitch president clinton will not throw out a ceremonial first pitch if the season opens with replacement players , his office said it s impossible to imagine that he would throw out the first pitch of a game that did n't represent the best that major league baseball has to offer , michael mccurry , his press secretary , said and it certainly is n't representing the best to use replacement players in another step linked to the strike , the executive council of the american federation of teachers , meeting in bal harbour , fla , adopted a resolution urging its 875 , 000 members to boycott games with replacement players and not to watch them on television photos two philadelphia phillies , dave hollins and lenny dykstra , arriving at a players meeting in orlando , fla , yesterday \( associated press \)

washington the cia is defending the indefensible and failing to defend the defensible when the columnist mary mcgrory of the washington post criticized in passing their most egregious and expensive blunder about the soviet economy , the acting director , adm william o studeman , huffed the most objectionable piece of fiction is the canard that the intelligence community s analysis of the soviet economy was wrong the facts have been on the public record for any journalist who cares to do her homework the homeworkskipper is the admiral in 1988 , when the cia made public its estimate that the soviet gnp was about half of ours , and that less than 16 percent of the soviet economy was devoted to arms production , academics like harry rowan , charles wolf , anders aslund and richard ericson took sharp issue i went across the river to director of central intelligence bill webster s office armed with their opposing view that the soviet gnp figures were phony , that its economy was half its ciaestimated size , and that the portion going to arms was an unsustainable 30 percent , compared with 6 percent in the us that would mean moscow was on the brink of economic meltdown the assembled cia experts poohpoohed this when i suggested a team b to challenge the cia evaluation , director webster looked toward his deputy , robert gates , who scornfully said , it s the same different view no independent assessment was permitted might hurt community morale , you know and the projections in judy sheldon s book the coming soviet crash were brushed aside result the cia failed to alert the president and congress about the inexorable soviet collapse the present dci , in his starched white outfit wishing it all away , is in a curious state of institutional denial now shift gears after the fallout from the ames affair and the resignation of director jim woolsey , the agency faces months of headlines about its support of the guatemalan government especially its payments to an informant within the government who has been linked by a democratic congressman to the deaths of an american citizen and an insurgent leader the new york times promptly thundered editorial condemnation of the cia s disgraceful covert relationship with guatemalan military thugs president clinton is displeased with the agency s apparent end run spookbashers are salivating at the prospect of stories about abuses of secrecy , opening the way to whacks at the intelligence budget this has deep roots two generations of liberals have been infuriated by our support of anticommunist regimes in central and south america from the coup in 1954 that threw out arbenz in guatemala to the defeat of leftists in el salvador and nicaragua in the late 80 s , cia agents carried out their assignment of helping stop the spread of castro s communism in our neighborhood thanks partly to those cia covert operations , we won often messily , sometimes undemocratically , on occasion scandalously but real war was being waged , and the alternative outcome sovietcuban hegemony up to our mexican border would have been far worse for democracy and human rights us policy was the opposite of imperialism , and most cia operatives were not the villains or blunderers many in the media made them out to be now , as the next wave of revulsion rolls in , we have to ask should we ever hire informers , none of whom would be played by victor mclaglen \? do we hold ourselves responsible for all that these sleazy characters subsequently do \? easy to say stay clean but if a cia operative claims he can recruit an informant inside the hezbollah or buy a line into the presidential palace in pyongyang or asks permission to guarantee safe haven to a military clique in baghdad if a coup fails should the next dci insist that such inside sources not be describable as thugs \? good ends do not justify evil means , but such dirty tricks that would save thousands of lives gain some moral coloration reform the cia , but do n't reform away its covert capacity
storrs , conn , feb 25 at the end , the ball belonged to nantambu willingham this has not been a frequent occurrence in his career at the university of connecticut , so it did n't seem to matter that time had run out , the horn was sounding and his final game at gampel pavilion has just come to an end tonight , when the huskies clinched a tie for the big east regularseason championship with a 7561 victory over seton hall , willingham provided an exclamation point that was as emotionally resounding as it was unofficial , even if he did not score a point connecticut \( 222 , 151 \) secured the no 1 seeding in the big east conference tournament because of an advantage in the tie breakers in the event that the huskies lose their final two games another victory , or a villanova defeat , would make connecticut the first team in the 16season history of the conference to finish alone in first for two consecutive years a lot of people underestimated us , said donny marshall we were n't so sure we could be where we are with donyell gone , either donyell marshall now plays for the golden state warriors , but his mother , stephanie , took part in the pregame ceremonies honoring connecticut s seniors seton hall \( 1610 , 79 \) lost an opportunity to take a major step toward a national collegiate athletic association tournament bid the pirates were ahead by 2 points before the huskies outscored them , 2812 , over the last 13 minutes connecticut , which made 56 percent of its secondhalf shots and held seton hall to 26 percent , had six scorers in double figures donny marshall led the huskies with 16 points , and he had 6 rebounds ray allen scored 14 points with 8 rebounds brian fair scored 12 points , while kevin ollie had 11 points with 7 assists and 1 turnover doron sheffer , who was not expected to play because of a sprained ankle , had 11 points and the 7foot center travis knight had 10 points with 11 rebounds i thought in the beginning , i hope they would n't need me , but the game was really tough , sheffer said after a while , i forgot about it that s what i need to do it s behind me , i hope adrian griffin led the pirates with 15 points on senior night , the last home appearance of the class that enrolled in the fall of 1991 , the capacity crowd of 8 , 241 stood and cheered for the group of players that elevated connecticut s program to the national level the huskies reached the final eight of the ncaa tournament when members of the class of 1995 were juniors in high school this group , attracted by the attention connecticut received during its big east championship season and tournament run , extended the reach of the program from coast to coast so when the members of that highly publicized recruiting class were introduced tonight marshall from federal way , wash , ollie from los angeles , willingham from atlanta and fair from phoenix they had a rare chance for their parents to experience in person the feelings they have known for years willingham , the 6foot11inch senior whose sense of humor stood out from the beginning , became a starter for the first time in his 100game college career willingham s appearance in the center circle marked the first time coach jim calhoun chose to start a seldomused senior in the last home game and then the game started , and the mood in the building changed quickly connecticut did not score for the first 2 minutes 50 seconds even after a 152 husky run , with five players scoring , established a 156 lead , connecticut appeared tentative , particularly at the defensive end seton hall s danny hurley , a junior , did not play because of a case of gastroenteritis sheffer , a sophomore who sprained his right ankle during the victory over boston college last tuesday , came off the bench and brought a sense of stability that had been missing still , given that significant advantage at the pointguard position , the huskies allowed seton hall to make 15 of 32 shots in the first half and score 11 of the 36 pirate points off the fast break a 154 seton hall run , which created a 3026 pirate lead , included several connecticut breakdowns there were four husky turnovers during the stretch john leahy of the pirates easily lost kirk king , on a pick to make a 3point shot when marshall deflected a pass and chased after it up the right sideline into the seton hall end of the court , none of his teammates followed he could not stay inbounds seconds later , the freshman guard levell sanders stripped the ball from sheffer , scored off the steal and drew a foul from sheffer for a 4point lead with 4 22 to go in the half but the pirates , who have been limited in practice because of a series of recent injuries , could not keep up in the final minutes i think this is as good a team as i 've seen him have as far as understanding what a team is , seton hall coach george blaney said , referring to calhoun and the huskies they respond to anything adverse things , good things that can happen over the course of a season
history is against the knicks momentum is against them and the indiana pacers are definitely against them the knicks have been backed into the darkest corner of their season , and it has happened for a variety of reasons in one game , they lost a 6point lead in the final 187 seconds in another game , they lost a 10point lead in the final five minutes of regulation and in another game , they were badly outplayed so the pacers , after their impressive 9884 victory on saturday , hold a commanding 31 lead over the knicks in their fourofsevengame eastern conference semifinal playoff series game 5 is not until wednesday night at madison square garden will that break give new york enough time to regroup \? or will it simply delay the start of the knicks' vacation \? one thing is certain if the knicks do not recover to win this series , it will be a major disappointment for the franchise after losing in game 7 of the finals last year , anything less than a championship is considered unacceptable by the players , the coaching staff and management but unless they win the next three games , there will be no crown for the knicks , and there will be serious offseason repercussions for a veteran team that could not get past the second round the knicks never dreamed of being knocked out before the conference finals , but that potential nightmare is just one loss away this will be the ultimate test as far as our character is concerned , and our heart as a basketball team , said greg anthony , new york s backup point guard new york s task is daunting only four teams in national basketball association history have recovered from a 31 deficit to win a playoff series , and it has not been done since 1981 , when the boston celtics defeated the philadelphia 76ers in the conference finals even pat riley , who coached the los angeles lakers to four championships during the 1980 s , has never escaped this situation riley coached two other teams that fell behind , 31 , in a series , and on both occasions , those teams were eliminated in game 5 at home in 1986 , the lakers fell behind , 31 , to the houston rockets , and the lakers were eliminated in game 5 and in 1990 , riley s last year with the lakers , they fell behind , 31 , to phoenix , and the suns went on to win game 5 at the great western forum the knicks did not practice yesterday , but when they return to the floor today , riley might need all of his psychological skills game 4 was the knicks' worst performance of the series , at a time when they needed their best that was not a good sign as much as i hate to say it , they had more energy , more fire , said derek harper they came with a determined game , and we did n't match it asked if the pacers wanted the series more than new york did , harper said i do n't think so they 're playing like they want it more saying you want it and making the sacrifice are two different things they 're making a better sacrifice now than we are while the knicks are surprised to find themselves in this situation , perhaps they should not be they had a difficult firstround series against the cleveland cavaliers they were inconsistent at home all season , and they have already lost two home games in the playoffs with patrick ewing hampered by a sore left calf muscle , new york s offensive flaws have been exposed against a strong defensive team john starks has shot 2 for 14 in the second half over the last two games , a carryover from an inconsistent regular season ewing has been the only consistent lowpost threat , and even most of ewing s damage has come from the perimeter hubert davis has been tentative and ineffective , just as he was during the playoffs last year and while harper , charles oakley , charles smith and anthony mason have had moments , none of them is the kind of offensive player who carries a team through a playoff series the knicks can win only by doing what they do best defending and rebounding but a troubling aspect of this series for the knicks is that they have been beaten at their own game indiana has outrebounded new york in every game the pacers have the muscle to bang with the knicks , and they have rik smits , an offensive threat at center who has kept constant pressure on ewing while the knicks came into the series focused on stopping reggie miller , smits has been the leading scorer in the series , averaging 225 points ewing is being asked to do a lot to defend against smits , to carry new york s offense , to rebound all while not healthy ewing equaled smits with 25 points in game 4 , but somebody else will have to step forward offensively for new york to win meanwhile , the knicks hoped that the break until wednesday would help ewing s health it will help us , and it will help him dramatically , said riley but the knicks need some drama of their own starks boldly predicted after game 4 that the knicks would still win the series told of that comment , ewing said you 're supposed to think that way we 're still confident if we start doubting ourselves now , we might as well pack it up and just go home we still have one more game to play we 're going to take it from there actually , ewing hopes the knicks have more than just one more game if they can win game 5 , the knicks will trail , 32 , the same position they were in last year against the pacers and the knicks recovered from that deficit to win the conference championship , 43 yet , the pacers remember losing that series , and they remember being eliminated by the knicks the past two years the pacers have wanted revenge all season and they are one victory away from getting it now we realize we can take them , and that s what we 're going to do in new york , said mark jackson , the former knick point guard , who did not make any friends among the knicks for doing a hipwiggling , armpumping dance after making a 3pointer in game 4 we have them where they 've never been , down 31 now we want to finish them if that happens , then the knicks will have a lot to think about during the off season and some major changes would be almost certain to follow rebounds the pacers' dale davis , who dislocated his right shoulder in game 4 , remained questionable for wednesday s game photo the inconsistency of john starks , front , has put added pressure on patrick ewing \( mary ann carter for the new york times \)
washington , june 29 in a bitterly contested decision that could erase some of the recent electoral gains made by blacks in congress and state legislatures , the supreme court ruled today that the use of race as a predominant factor in drawing district lines should be presumed to be unconstitutional the 5to4 decision declared unconstitutional georgia s 11th congressional district , now represented by a black democrat , cynthia a mckinney , which the georgia legislature drew in 1992 to satisfy the justice department s insistence that a third majorityblack district be created for the state s 11member congressional delegation but while justice anthony m kennedy s majority opinion was phrased in quite sweeping terms , it left many important questions unanswered about how the new standard should be applied in other cases among the most pressing questions is how the lower courts are to decide when race has been the predominant factor as opposed to one factor among others in the ethnic , geographic and partisan stew of electoral politics underscoring the remaining uncertainty , the court announced only hours after issuing its decision today that it would hear and decide two more redistricting cases , from texas and north carolina , during its new term that begins in october today was the last day of the 199495 term in his majority opinion today , justice kennedy cited a long series of supreme court rulings from the era when the federal courts were desegregating public facilities throughout the south he said that just as the state may not , absent extraordinary justification , segregate citizens on the basis of race in its public parks , buses , golf courses , beaches , and schools , the government also may not separate its citizens into different voting districts on the basis of race while the new cases the court accepted today also present white voters' constitutional challenges to the creation of majorityblack and , in the texas case , majorityhispanic districts , they contain additional elements that could require the court to explain itself further for example , the texas case , bush v vera , no 94805 , raises the question of whether drawing district lines to protect incumbents can serve as an independently valid explanation for drawing districts along racial and ethnic lines adding further to the confusion today was the court s oneparagraph , unsigned order upholding california s 1992 redistricting plan that had created nine new majority black and hispanic congressional districts that plan , ordered by the state supreme court and upheld by a threejudge federal district court , had been challenged by two white voters as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander since race was clearly a factor in the creation of the new districts though the district court found it was only one factor among others the justices' action upholding the plan indicates that race may continue to play a role in redistricting also today , the court dismissed a suit by four voters who had successfully challenged louisiana s fourth congressional district , a majorityblack district in which none of the plaintiffs live in an opinion by justice sandra day o'connor , the court said the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the case because they could not show that the district harmed them in any way this outcome , with which all nine justices agreed , avoided a ruling on the validity of the lower court s approach to the louisiana case in striking down the majorityblack district last year , a special threejudge federal district court in new orleans had ruled that any consideration of race made a district presumably unconstitutional while justice o'connor s opinion , united states v hays , no 94558 , wipes that decision off the books , new plaintiffs who live in the district are expected to file another lawsuit within days taken as a whole , the court s actions today certainly supported an observation that justice ruth bader ginsburg made from the bench this morning as she delivered a strong dissent from the court s opinion in the georgia case the court has not yet spoken its final word on the role of race in redistricting , she said the georgia district the court invalidated today follows a 260mile corridor from the outskirts of atlanta to savannah , connecting black population centers along the way but significantly , it was not the district s configuration that the court found to be illegitimate , but rather the goal of those who created it the georgia legislature , prodded by the justice department , was motivated by a predominant , overriding desire to assign black populations to the 11th district , justice kennedy wrote , in rejecting such action without extraordinary justification the decision today , miller v johnson , no 94631 , went considerably beyond the court s 1993 ruling in shaw v reno , a case from north carolina , which held that a district s bizarre shape required searching inquiry into whether the district was the result of an impermissible racial gerrymander shape is not the only problem , the court made clear today

given his habit of hanging on to the camera like a puppy with a rag toy , the best questions seem to be ones that ricochet back to him seated in his fort lee office between tapings , the movieactorturnedhost , now 59 , looks frozen in time , at about age 40 his brown hair devoid of gray , his skin tighter than it was when he starred in the heartbreak kid , in 1972 it was then that he began appearing frequently on talk shows his stock in trade became hurling insults at david letterman and johnny carson he once told ed mcmahon that it was a shock that he could still stand at his age along the way , mr grodin cast his net over so many fields that he may have missed making a solid mark in any of them , despite acclaimed performances in movies like heaven can wait and midnight run now , with his wife , elissa , and their 7yearold son , nicholas , he says he wants to stay put in connecticut \( he wo n't say exactly where he lives \) and make this new venture last forever \( he signed a twoyear contract , but cnbc can drop him after a year \) he also wants to do it his way , so no suggestions , please roger ailes , the president of cnbc and one of mr grodin s champions , says mr grodin will ask for suggestions , but then he 'll say , 'of course i only want you to tell me i'm brilliant' mr ailes has responded by saying he also knows something about what works on a show but his host feels that he does , too after 40 years in show business , he has accumulated enough opinions , stories and neuroses to fill several analysts' logs instead , he fills his show with them each hour opens with 10 minutes of vintage grodin a monologue in which he settles an old score or cocks an impatient eyebrow at politics , movies , whatever is irking him in january he talked back to a replay of the president s state of the union message , mocking the rhetoric that drew standing ovations nobody wants fear and paralysis and terror good ! standing o clean up toxic dumps \?

come the cold winds of winter , the lifeguards will still be talking about the summer of 1995 none of them can remember ever pulling so many people in from the sea on the busiest day of all , aug 13 , a hot sunday , the 24member beach patrol in seaside heights alone hauled 150 swimmers out of churning riptides before late afternoon , and then they stopped counting on a wall of the lifeguard shack on the seaside heights boardwalk hangs a proclamation from the mayor congratulating them for that day , but beach patrol members do n't make a big deal of it actual ocean lifeguards , it seems , are n't like the hotshots on baywatch or in beach party movies they 're as taciturn as firefighters ask a firefighter about heroism and you 're apt to get a lecture on careless smoking ask a lifeguard never underestimate the ocean or overestimate your skills , said sam britton , who is a fulltime police officer when he is n't working as a lifeguard but how did they feel making all those rescues \? rescuing is all based on teamwork , mr britton insisted patiently you 're trained well , you perform well it took some prodding before he conceded , well , there s no greater satisfaction than saving a life al aires , a high school teacher who is captain of the beach patrol , then spoke up i remember seeing sam with a grown man crying in his arms one time that day it was a beautiful sunny day , mr britton said long trails of waves coming in , said joe gomulka , a lifeguard captain in neighboring seaside park who had stopped by on a break the waves were building , mr aires said then suddenly , all hell broke loose it was one of those days when you looked forward to school starting , said mr gomulka , who also teaches high school nodding , they sat back that was all they had to say about it they did what they were trained to do beyond the courage and skill of hundreds of lifeguards who worked like rented mules all season from cape may to sandy hook , there is one other important thing to remember about this summer at the jersey shore , however ten people drowned all of them off monmouth and ocean county beaches , most often in the hours when lifeguards were not on duty last year , there was one drowning on the whole shore there would be clamor for a congressional investigation if we had such a huge increase in shark bites or poisoned clams , but there has been remarkably little said about why so many drowned yes , there were storms at sea , including the hurricane off the carolinas that churned the atlantic for two weeks yes , it was hot but 10 people did not drown on any other stretch of the atlantic coast violent riptides claimed all those lives on a single 30mile length of coast north of seaside heights more than any other in the country , that section of coast is distinguished by jetties and sea walls that have been built and expanded over many decades to keep in sand its shore drops off sharply , unlike the gently sloping barrierisland beaches of central and south jersey according to a duke university coastal geologist , orrin h pilkey , shoreline armoring building walls and jetties to temporarily hold in sand worsens the effects of waves on beaches even in minor storms and makes shoreline dropoff steeper dr pilkey said he had not studied the relationship to riptides , but with so many drownings , he said , it certainly cries out for being looked into in the meantime , as the season ends , let s hear it for the lifeguards way to go , jason varano , 23 and just out of rutgers , who wo n't even guess how many lives he helped save on aug 13 , let alone all summer who knows \? he said , watching swimmers from his chair on the beach you 'd go in for two and a sandbar would give way , and you 'd have 15 more attaboy , chris amato , 20 , who works two jobs to pay for college lifeguard at seaside , butcher at a point pleasant supermarket all i remember is at one point i had three kids in my arms , he said they 're modest many are in school , young men and women still trying to define who they are and for many winters to come , they 'll have the quiet comfort of knowing how they handled themselves when the going got rough in the summer of 1995 drawing
during the boom of the 1980 s , marcus i lehmann and morris wolfson heard the siren call of real estate and followed it to harlem mr lehmann , 27 years old in april 1987 , seemed to be brimming with confidence when he explained in an interview then his formula for success in the lowincome housing market a property purchased for less than four times its annual rent revenues will show a bottom line , he said when you get above that , you 've got to squeeze with banks footing most of the costs , mr lehmann and mr wolfson went on a buying spree in the mid to late 1980 s and among the halfdozen properties they purchased was the sixstory building on 140th street in harlem that partly collapsed last week , killing three tenants and injuring seven but well before that crash early tuesday morning , the real estate business they had built with borrowed money and rundown buildings became mired in debt and poor management mr lehmann and mr wolfson declined to be interviewed last week the story of their business was pieced together from interviews with associates and a review of government and court records just as the enterprise of mr lehmann and mr wolfson floated on the euphoria of the 1980 s , it was swept away in the economic downturn that followed the bank that had been so generous to them collapsed in 1990 , a victim of its own poor lending practices unable to sell their devalued properties , mr lehmann and mr wolfson fell behind in tax and mortgage payments and began not paying suppliers of goods and services like heating oil and plumbing parts they owe the city at least 400 , 000 in back taxes , a spokesman for the department of finance said they were either unable or unwilling to maintain their properties , and the buildings began attracting housing code violations from the city and lawsuits from tenants claiming injuries from unsafe conditions in 1991 , when the family of a boy sued , saying he had been injured in a rundown apartment , mr lehmann said he had no insurance and offered to settle the case by giving the family free rent , said maurice sieradski , a lawyer who represented the boy s family now , prosecutors are investigating whether the landlords should be charged with criminal negligence in the collapse of the building officials at the department of housing preservation and development have asked a judge to impose jail sentences and a 1 million fine because the men ignored a past court order on code violations unrelated to the collapse lawyers for the two men say they have struggled against significant odds to be responsible landlords they said the decline of the building is partly the fault of tenants involved in a rent strike and squatters who have taken over and torn up some of the 30 vacant apartments there they did as good a job as humanly possible , bernard brafman , a lawyer for mr wolfson , said in a court hearing last week problems like these are recurrent in nature it would be hard to find a building in a high crime area that is free of violations mr brafman also said that mr wolfson recently sold his interest in the 140th street building mr brafman said that none of the violations at the building pertain to its structural integrity and therefore cannot be blamed for the collapse he said city housing inspectors repeatedly visited the building and never reported any warning signs of the disaster to the building department my strong feeling , said mr brafman , is that when the dust finally settles it will be seen as a terribly unfortunate tragedy that is no one s fault although mr wolfson is the stepson of a new york developer and philanthropist , zev w wolfson , and mr lehmann is the son of an engineer , oscar lehmann , associates of the men say they knew little about real estate when they formed the mount wilson partnership in 1986 they struck me as young , slightly arrogant , but not villainous , said a lawyer who represented tenants against them and spoke on the condition he not be identified not too different from other landlords we deal with when they first came into a building , they said they would be different , but they 're not the pair bought six properties in harlem in quick succession , beginning in 1986 within two years their harlem portfolio alone included the 70unit building on 140th street , for which they paid 525 , 000 three adjoining properties on 140th a building on st nicholas place , and a property at 112 west 138th street named invincible court that building , with 53 apartments , was acquired in 1988 for about 600 , 000 for all of those buildings , they spent 3 million with gentrification sweeping many parts of the city , investors and institutions were eager to lend to real estate buyers you had people fighting to give you money because the market was hot , said ira kellman , a property owner in harlem there are very few people in the real estate industry disciplined enough not to take it when someone is throwing it at them that s what was happening then uptown , downtown , everywhere harlem looked like a good bet there was talk that middleclass manhattan might creep farther uptown city and state renovation money for lowincome housing was relatively plentiful
ledyard , conn , may 2 the tiny , immensely wealthy mashantucket pequot indian tribe , owner of foxwoods casino , the most profitable casino in america , could finance this town s entire annual budget of 91 million on less than a week s worth of gambling revenues tribal leaders jet around the world meeting international leaders and giving away millions of dollars in charity members of the tribal police patrol the reservation in new ford explorers , while officers on the town force ride in battered cruisers as the 320member tribe has expanded its wealth and holdings here , town officials say their communities have been repeatedly outmaneuvered , outgunned and overrun , leaving many residents angry and frustrated today , they are even angrier the tribe has won again with a ruling late monday by the federal department of the interior granting the pequots the right to expand their reservation by 247 acres , or more than 20 percent you ca n't print my true reaction , mayor jospeh a lozier of ledyard said of the federal annexation ruling the annexation , scheduled to take effect next week , will remove the 247 acres in perpetuity from all local control , including environmental regulation , zoning and taxation you can almost see how militias get started , said dr del knight , a member of a group called residents against annexation dr knight , a research investigator at pfizer pharmaceuticals , is angry at the federal government for what has happened town officials said today that they planned to join with the state attorney general , richard blumenthal , in a lastditch appeal in federal court to block the annexation but it is clearly an uphill battle at town hall , mayor lozier , tie loosened at 10 am , placed calls to hartford and to his lawyers in washington and said he would fight the good fight and never surrender but in the end , he said , smalltown ledyard and its neighbors are pretty much on their own against a savvy , politically connected tribe that appears to have nearly unlimited resources to fight back last year , the pequots' casino , which opened in 1992 , made an estimated 800 million to 900 million before expenses dr knight said that if the annexation order stands , the imbalance of power between the tribe and nonindian residents will grow dramatically because of the laws governing tribal sovereignty , the pequots can not even be sued unless they consent first we have no recourse , dr knight said we ca n't take them to court we ca n't do anything tribal officials today tried to calm the waters the tribal council , the pequots' governing body , issued a statement saying the tribe wants to reassure all citizens of this region that it will continue to manage and control its land under processes that are as strict and responsible as any in the country the statement concluded we are going to be living together forever and it is the tribe s sincere desire that we live together in harmony a spokesman for the tribe , joe letellier , said that no decision had been made about a use for the 247acre parcel , which adjoins a 1 , 200acre site also owned by the tribe both properties are near the casino , which is on the reservation and both are outside the boundaries established for the reservation when the tribe received federal recognition in the 1980 s that made it all the harder for the towns to accept the annexation mr letellier said that no further applications had been filed to annex any more land and that none was contemplated but that s subject to change , he said to be sure , the pequots have won many friends with more than 9 , 000 workers , they are one of the largest private employers in connecticut through a voluntary arrangement , they give more than 130 million a year to the state in exchange for a monopoly on slot machines in washington , they have become one of the largest single contributors to the democratic national committee , with donations of more than 300 , 000 , and they have donated at least 150 , 000 more to individual state party committees here in the tribe s backyard , however , nonindian residents say that what they mostly see is the exercise of power some speculate that there is a connection between the tribe s political contributions and its success with the federal and state governments asserting tribal immunity from local taxation and control is the most visible symbol i do n't care what they are , they should be subject to state and federal taxes , said fred austin , a retired police officer who now lives in nearby griswold they are claiming that they are a sovereign nation , but i believe we settled that question in 1865 in a thing called the civil war they cannot secede from the union and you ca n't have a nation within a nation some nonindian residents in town said they believed the pequots had earned the trust of the community , and that people should ease up on their criticism patti cohn , who lives several miles from the casino , said that foxwoods' muted turquoise design and absence of glare and glitz had convinced her that the pequots had good taste she said she believes that what they will do on their new lands will be similarly well thought out it s the development itself , the erosion of the woods that troubles her we take the kids up there in the summer and go blueberry picking , she said of the annexed lands i'm sorry from a nature standpoint , to see all this land get built up and built up map of connecticut showing locations of the casino , existing mashantucket pequot reservation , the 247acre parcel to be annexed , and other lands owned by the tribe
portauprince , haiti , july 9 haiti announced today that it would delay until tuesday releasing the results of the first national elections since president jeanbertrand aristide was restored to power , and tensions grew over how the losers might respond to the announcement the ninemember provisional electoral council initially had said it would release on saturday the results from the june 25 elections for parliamentary and local offices after working round the clock all week , the electoral council said on saturday that it was prepared to release the results from seven of the country s nine geographic areas reports had been circulating , however , that losing political parties would respond with violence once the results were made public the lavalas party , closely allied to president aristide , is expected to win a sweeping victory on saturday evening , the united states ambassador to haiti , william l swing , and the head of the united nations mission in haiti , lahkdar brahimi , persuaded four members of the electoral council to withhold the results for another 72 hours , electoral officials said none of the parties would comment on the precise content of the discussion it was a good meeting and we are hopeful that they can move ahead , a united nations official said people in the democratic camp are concerned that this delay is due to pressure from those who , knowing they have already lost , would like to manipulate the election results in their favor , a haitian government employee said much of the tension is focused on the portauprince mayoral race the incumbent mayor , evans paul , was a founder of the national front for change and democracy , which supported the 1990 presidential campaign of mr aristide he is expected to lose to a popular folksinger , manno charlemagne his party publicly called for a cancellation of the elections early last week , changing significant fraud when questioned , haitian and western government officials implied that mayor paul was trying to negotiate a deal for his political future i 've spoken with them but that s different from negotiating , he said today , referring to meetings with government officials we spoke of a lot of things but we have n't had a formal discussion yet technical and logistical problems marred the june 25 vote , but the haitian and american governments , along with the organization of american states , have said they believe the results are credible there were significant logistics problems and administrative foulups , which we admitted from the beginning , said stan schrager , spokesman for the united states embassy here but we do n't believe that a total cancellation of these elections furthers the cause of democracy in the country runoffs for the parliamentary seats where candidates did not win by a majority were originally scheduled for july 23 the electoral council is expected to release a new calendar that will push back the runoffs to august it announced today that it would hold partial elections on july 22 in areas where it said irregularities had distorted the vote the council also said it would publish a list of candidates who have been disqualified because they have been linked to electoralrelated violence or intimidation

after several weeks of speculation about his future , howard stringer announced yesterday that he was leaving his position as president of cbs to accept a job as chairman of a new media venture created by a consortium of three large telephone companies the network immediately named peter lund , who had held the secondhighest management position at cbs , to succeed mr stringer , who has been president since 1988 the transition comes at a time of uncertainty about cbs , with the network suffering from a sharp downturn in its primetime ratings and persistent rumors of a possible sale mr stringer , who is 53 , will end a 30year career at cbs to take a position with a stillunnamed mediatechnology company formed by bell atlantic , nynex and pacific telesis the company plans to send video programming to consumers through phone lines , thus becoming a competitor to cable companies in providing both phone and video services to homes it s a big leap of faith , mr stringer said in a telephone interview yesterday , but the possibilities are very compelling the new venture plans to bring seven to nine different kinds of services into homes , including existing television channels , interactive channels and video on demand a service that will allow customers to select from a library of movies and other programs because the telephone companies cover six of the country s seven largest cities , including new york , and reach 40 million homes , the new venture will begin with an enormous base of potential customers it is expected to begin service in some homes late this year mr stringer is leaving his job as president of the cbs broadcast group , which oversees virtually all of the network s holdings , including the television network and cbs s radio and television stations mr stringer , who was born in england , recalled that he came to new york in 1965 looking for a career in television i gambled once before , he said i remembered that i was bold and vigorous when i left that boat you do n't often get chances at this age to do something new and exciting he also said the financial strength of the companies he will be working for was a factor in his decision these companies have a cash flow second to none , he said , and that s not something i 'd been used to indeed , coworkers close to mr stringer say he has been unhappy with the course of cbs in recent years , especially because the company , under its chairman , laurence a tisch , has been so reluctant to invest in the emerging technologies now altering the television industry the whole architecture of this new business is up to howard , one executive close to mr stringer said he brings talent and expertise with all that s been happening at cbs , he s been creatively idle for the last while all he s been doing is trying to get on with less alone among the networks , cbs has no investments in cable with cbs so frequently the subject of rumors of a possible sale , the network s executives have felt a loss of corporate momentum last summer mr tisch came to an arrangement with barry diller for a merger with qvc inc , the operator of the home shopping channel , but the plan fell through i got all revved up about the opportunity to move into barry s brave new world , mr stringer said when that fell through i started to think what s next \? mr tisch declined to comment yesterday , but in a statement he praised mr stringer warmly as a man whose creative talents and management skills are matched by his intelligence , eloquence and wit shares of cbs closed unchanged yesterday at 62375 on the new york stock exchange mr stringer , who had to secure the approval of mr tisch to get out of the remaining two years on his contract , has agreed not to raid cbs for any executives and not to write a book about the network the uncertainty about the network s ownership clearly gave mr stringer reason to explore other opportunities this one was brought to him by michael ovitz , the head of creative artists agency , who is a consultant to the phone company consortium still , it is a difficult leavetaking for mr stringer he started at cbs as a news producer and eventually became an emmy awardwinning executive producer of cbs reports , executive producer of the cbs evening news and president of cbs news he said he had tried several times yesterday to speak to his colleagues and staff members but had failed because he became so emotional i could n't complete a sentence , he said coworkers praised him for leading cbs back to a position of preeminence after the network had fallen sharply in the late 1980 s in particular , they cited his ability to create a collegial atmosphere among managers mr lund , 54 , who said he would like to be able to do as well as howard did , may find that difficult cbs has fallen from first place to third in prime time this season and has lost important stations and coverage of national football league games to the fox network mr lund acknowledged that he was the point man for the negotiations on football , but said it was not fair to say i lost football to fox he said that after losing hundreds of millions of dollars on baseball and football contracts , the network was unquestionably gunshy about stepping into another sports deal photos howard stringer \( cbs \) peter lund \( cbs \) \( pg d2 \)

bayville , li for 30 years , steve karathanos was a faithful customer of the long island lighting company , paying his bills promptly , never questioning what he was charged to illuminate the chandeliers or operate the airconditioners or pump sea water into the vast lobster tanks of his beachfront restaurant , steve s pier 1 the indecipherable numbers and abbreviations on his electric bill , which in peak months came to as much as 11 , 000 , mr karathanos left to the meter readers his expertise was clam bisque , not energy who has time to doublecheck the kilowatt hours when there is a party of 24 waiting in the queen elizabeth room \? then , in september , came a revelation that made him wish he had spent more time reading the bills than paying them a salesman trying to sell him an electric generator looked over his lilco bills and noticed something strange mr karathanos was being charged for seven highintensity floodlights attached to poles in the two parking lots of steve s pier 1 the salesman , walking all over the lots , could locate only six mr karathanos went to his files poring over years and years of old electric bills he may not have read them , but he saved them he found the discrepancy repeated again and again six lights in the parking lots , seven on the bills ! mr karathanos was beside himself it had been hard enough paying for the power he used now , he discovered , he was paying for a light that never lit i went crazy , mr karathanos said as he sat at a table in the main dining room , with its panoramic view of long island sound i thought my god , what have i been doing \? to the restaurant owner , it was not the principle of the thing it was the money the floodlight was no dim bulb mr karathanos had been paying the utility about 34 a month for each of them the lights which were installed shortly after mr karathanos opened for business in 1965 on the site of an old fishing station and clam bar were not monitored by the restaurant s main electricity meter they were regulated separately , by individual light meters mr karathanos and his bookkeeper , marina davis , could not even begin to calculate how much he might have been overcharged for 30 years' use of a light that never existed but it seemed to them it might be quite a chunk of change they decided there was only one thing to do demand a full refund in late september , a lilco field worker came to investigate we count the lights , the 59yearold restaurateur said in an accent that , nearly half a century after his arrival in this country , retains traces of his native athens we count the poles only six lights the field worker , mr karathanos said , seemed puzzled by the discrepancy , but even more troubled by his lack of attention to his bills she turns to me and says 'you 're calling us now \? where have you been all these years \? ' i tell her , 'i have been in the kitchen , cooking lobsters ! ' about six weeks after the visit , mr karathanos received a fax from lilco that he found even harder to decode than his electric bills titled details of overbilling and interest credit , the twopage fax included dozens of calculations under columns with headings like as billed without tax , corrected bill without tax and tax on overpayment but one thing was clear lilco had determined that mr karathanos was entitled to a credit for his phantom light but only back to 1988 since then , according to lilco , he had paid 1 , 81523 for the light with tax and interest , he was owed 3 , 73048 mr karathanos was not mollified he wanted every nickel he had ever put into that light in cash after weeks of leaving messages on lilco answering machines , mrs davis received a letter from the utility , explaining that in cases of billing errors , utilities are only required by state law to make refunds for the previous six years suzanne halpin , a spokeswoman for the utility , said the company may have come up with an explanation for the phantom light a check of survey maps for the restaurant turned up a light pole right next to the shoreline that may have blown down during a 1992 storm , she said , adding that lilco was still willing to give mr karathanos a sixyear adjustment to his bills in the interest of good customer service told of lilco s explanation , mr karathanos scoffed , saying that while there had been light poles on the nearby public beach , none were on his property the parrying with lilco has only made mr karathanos feel even more the aggrieved party , and he finds it hard to accept that the utility will not give him satisfaction but one thing is certain no bill will escape his scrutiny , no matter how busy he is with the lobsters now , he said , i question everything
albany , aug 17 the invitations for the political fundraising event came with an offer and a price spend friday afternoon at saratoga race course with gov george e pataki , for either 250 or 1 , 000 per person but those invitations also carried a subtle prod for the corporate officials and horseracing people being invited to contribute included on the printed roster of fundraising chairmen were two senior government officials whose jobs are to regulate or grant benefits to many of the people on the guest list the two are joseph neglia , a member of the state s threemember racing and wagering board , which regulates horse tracks and parimutuel betting , and clarence d rappleyea jr , the new chairman of the state power authority , which provides lowcost electricity to businesses the practice of having senior government officials solicit campaign donations from the very people they regulate was prohibited during the cuomo administration because of the potential for ethical conflicts and indeed , when mr rappleyea , who started his power authority job this week , was questioned by a reporter today , he acknowledged the problem i wo n't be doing this again , he said a spokeswoman for the governor said the administration now recognized the problem asked about the invitations this afternoon , zenia mucha said no commissioner or board member will have their name on an invitation or serve on any fundraising committee again but she added that friday s fundraiser will go off as scheduled the involvement of the two officials has drawn sharp criticism from democratic lawmakers and government watchdog groups , although it is not expressly prohibited under state ethics laws the critics contend that fundraising by officials who have regulatory powers pressespeople doing business with the state to contribute money it creates the appearance , at best , that regulated industries are currying favor for future important decisions for them , said blair horner , legislative director for the new york public interest research group it clearly smacks of a conflict both mr neglia and mr rappleyea said they had distributed tickets and made phone calls to encourage people to come to the event mr neglia said he had talked to friends about attending , some of whom are in the horseracing business mr rappleyea said he had spoken only to loyal republican contributors , none of whom have had business with the power authority both said they had done nothing to press people to contribute mr rappleyea , whose annual state salary is 185 , 000 , said he had been asked to be a cochairman for the event several weeks before he knew that mr pataki would name him to the power authority still , it has been widely known in albany since the spring that mr rapppleyea , formerly the assembly minority leader , was being considered for the position in any case , he said , he would not put his name on future fundraising invitations i got caught in one of those time flips , he said ms mucha , too , said mr rappleyea s name had been added to the list while he was still assembly minority leader she said mr neglia had been included because he is a longtime supporter of mr pataki she added that the practice would end there mr neglia , whose annual state salary is 76 , 421 , is listed on the invitation as a general chair of the event , a job that carries the responsibility of raising 10 , 000 though originally appointed to the racing board by former gov mario m cuomo , he is a republican who supported mr pataki in last year s race asked whether some horse owners might attend the event to improve relations with him and his board , mr neglia said i do n't see it at all i think it s just a reason to get together and meet with the governor , to get the governor to help the industry to thrive new york state law prohibits state officials from demanding contributions in exchange for government favors but it does not otherwise restrict their fundraising activities by contrast , deputy mayors and commissioners in new york city are prohibited from soliciting campaign contributions for city candidates for state officials , nothing is proscribed under state law as regards political fundraising , said richard rifkin , executive director of the state ethics commission there is a line somewhere , and i wish i could better define it , but i ca n't because the commission has n't drawn it , he said state senator franz s leichter , a manhattan democrat , has proposed legislation to prevent top state officials from participating in campaign fundraising he said of the saratoga event it s a way to put the arm on people in the industry it s going to attract people who say , 'i better come if i'm going to have a good relationship with the racing and wagering board the democrats have also raised questions about the political activities of other pataki administration officials with backgrounds in campaign fundraising , including economic development commissioner charles a gargano , who helped raise more than 14 million for mr pataki last year , and general services commissioner peter w delaney , who did fundraising for westchester county republicans the event friday was timed to coincide with the 136th traver s stakes race on saturday , which historically draws huge crowds of horse owners , corporate officials and wellheeled fans from around the state for a 250 contribution to mr pataki s campaign account invitees can partake of an allday buffet under white tents at the racetrack s paddock area for 1 , 000 , contributors will attend a more intimate evening reception with mr pataki in a private room the event is just the latest in a string of large and small fundraising gatherings this year for mr pataki , who does not face reelection until 1998 as of july 11 , the governor had raised more than 1 million and had 937 , 891 on hand the list of chairmen for the saratoga event also includes several corporate officials and lobbyists , including michael smith , president of the new york state bankers association allan dragone , president of the new york racing association james featherstonaugh , a lobbyist whose clients include soda companies and race tracks , and kenneth shapiro , a lobbyist whose clients include hospitals and health insurance companies photo clarence d rappleyea jr , chairman of the state

washington , march 31 republican governors and the republican leaders of congress are negotiating major changes in medicaid that would limit the soaring cost of the program and vastly increase the states' power over it the proposal , if adopted , would give the states new authority in deciding eligibility , benefits and methods of paying doctors and hospitals for the care of 36 million lowincome people the governors , having designed much of the welfare bill passed by the house earlier this month , are seeking a similar but far more ambitious reconfiguration of medicaid combined federal and state costs for medicaid are expected to exceed 150 billion this year the proposal , though not part of the contract with america , has emerged as an important objective for congressional republicans as they try to reduce the federal budget deficit while cutting taxes the republican proposal would end the entitlement status of medicaid , which guarantees health insurance to anyone who meets eligibility criteria based on financial need and other factors each state would receive a lumpsum payment , or block grant , for the general purpose of providing medical care to the poor there is no guarantee that current medicaid recipients would get coverage under the proposal nor is there any assurance that doctors and hospitals would be paid for treating these people on the other hand , states could provide coverage to some people who do not qualify for medicaid under current law the approach taken in welfare reform is the right approach , said gov jim edgar of illinois , the republican governors' chief negotiator with congress we 'd like to see that same flexibility with medicaid , which is a much bigger expenditure for most states with more flexibility , we could control the cost the idea of block grants for medicaid has been endorsed by speaker newt gingrich of georgia and by senate republican leaders like bob dole of kansas and pete v domenici of new mexico , the chairman of the senate budget committee the clinton administration is ambivalent it is committed to state flexibility , but determined to preserve the safety net for poor people alone among republicans in congress senator john h chafee of rhode island opposes block grants for medicaid in an interview , mr chafee , who helped expand medicaid to reach millions of children and women in the 1980 s , said i do n't want to get into a situation where we 're reducing the number of people covered that could happen if medicaid is no longer an entitlement medicaid pays for one 1 of 3 births , finances care for more than a fourth of the country s children and pays for 2 of 3 people in nursing homes on any given day it is much more complex than the main cash assistance program , aid to families with dependent children , and costs about six times as much in the last 10 years , federal spending on medicaid quadrupled , to 82 billion in 1994 , and the congressional budget office estimates that the cost will rise an average of more than 10 percent a year in the next five years , reaching 148 billion in 2000 medicaid has become a huge financial burden for the states , which must put up their own money to get federal medicaid money on average , the states contribute 75 cents for each federal dollar , but those with high percapita incomes , like new york , new jersey and connecticut , must match the federal contribution dollar for dollar representative john r kasich , the ohio republican who is chairman of the house budget committee , and senator domenici said they had told the governors that they intended to cut medicaid s current growth rate by half if the federal government held the growth to 5 percent in each of the next five years , it would spend 97 billion less than it now expects to spend how could such savings be achieved \? governors and congressional leaders say more medicaid recipients must be enrolled in health maintenance organizations and other forms of managed care they assume that the federal government will reduce or eliminate special payments to hospitals serving disproportionate numbers of indigent patients ultimately , they say , states may have to impose new limits on eligibility or cut coverage james d bentley , senior vice president of the american hospital association , said he feared that in negotiating with congress on block grants each state would pursue its narrow selfinterest seven states have received permission from the federal government for statewide experiments to control medicaid costs or expand eligibility , and 10 other states , including new york , have applied for such waivers but the state experiments are modest by comparison with the block grants being devised in congress none of the state programs eliminate the individual entitlement to medicaid , the bedrock of the 30yearold program mr gingrich describes medicaid as welfarerelated health care , and since its creation , the program has indeed provided care to welfare recipients but in the last decade , as congress has expanded eligibility , medicaid has also become an important source of health insurance for children of the working poor , including many people not on welfare more than half of all children on medicaid now have working parents for their part , the governors are making a virtue of necessity they say they cannot cope with cuts of the magnitude contemplated by congress unless they have much more freedom to manage the program new york , new jersey and connecticut have republican governors who express similar views on medicaid block grants general support but caution and uncertainty about details in an interview , the lieutenant governor of new york , betsy mccaughey , said our administration views the concept of block grants very positively because it implies the flexibility states need but any block grant must recognize the special needs of new york state s population , the thousands of people with hiv , severe mental illness and substance abuse problems new york is in the unusual position of having a decreasing population but an increasing number of medicaid recipients democrats are divided gov howard dean of vermont , a democrat who is chairman of the national governors' association , said i have an open mind on block grants for medicaid the flexibility of a medicaid block grant is extraordinarily appealing , but we need to work out some protection for children under the republican proposal , medicaid programs would be subject to the same limits in all states there might be adjustments for population growth , but the annual limit would apply to the total cost of a state s medicaid program , not the percapita cost this causes problems for states like florida and texas where the population is growing rapidly the republican governors would not have required states to continue spending their own money on medicaid but republican senators insisted on such a requirement mr domenici said the states' level of effort ought to remain constant in negotiations with congress , state officials are demanding an end to a section of the medicaid law that says payments to hospitals and nursing homes must be reasonable and adequate to meet the costs of efficiently operated institutions many states have had to increase their medicaid payments as a result of lawsuits filed under that provision in negotiations with congress , state officials said , they are seeking an explicit guarantee that states could no longer be sued by medicaid beneficiaries , hospitals or doctors graph a closer look spending on medicaid tracks spending from 1967 through a projected 1995 and shows breakdowns of who get benefits and their share \( sources congressional budget office spending , kaiser commission of the future of medicaid benefit breakdowns \)
yves congar , who died in june at age 91 , was one of a handful of scholars who utterly changed roman catholicism and , with it , the religious landscape of the world father congar was the last of the thinkers linked to what became known , because they were almost all french , as the nouvelle theologie , or new theology the story of the new theology contains a profound lesson about religious renewal , first for catholicism , but also for other christian confessions and world faiths as so often happens , the label itself began as a term of opprobrium in the mouths of the movement s opponents , only to stick as a tag of honor in the catholicism of the 1940 s , simply to use the word new in connection with theology suggested something amiss in august 1950 , the papal encyclical humani generis officially dated exactly 45 years ago today seemed to cast suspicion on thinkers like father congar or his fellow dominican priest father mariedominique chenu , or the jesuit scholars fathers henri de lubac and jean danielou , or the swiss maverick father hans urs von balthasar in different ways , they were all trying to break through the rigid and lifeless categories of catholic theology by returning to the bible , the church fathers of the early christian centuries and even medieval thinkers like thomas aquinas whose ideas had been reduced to textbook dimensions the standard explanations of church and sacraments , nature and grace , ministry and the work of theology itself had become tightly structured and legalistic the new theology challenged this mental framework with its retrieval of ancient but now fresh images and metaphors and ways of thinking , often more mystical , more communal and more ecumenical none of this was explicitly condemned by humani generis , but the shadow of suspicion was enough to set in motion a vast machinery of distrust those associated with the new theology were stripped of teaching positions some were forbidden to write or lecture , or ordered to submit even the least manuscript to church censors , who frequently delayed publication for years or banned translations or new editions some were given obscure assignments overseas or had their movements and activities restricted in demeaning fashion isolated and silenced , they were unable to reply to attacks on their ideas or their loyalty to the church in kafkaesque fashion , there were accusations that the accused were never told about except in hints and glimpses superiors who had encouraged or defended them were often abruptly sacked from the beginning of 1947 to the end of 1956 , father congar recalled of his dealings with the vatican , i knew nothing from that quarter but an uninterrupted series of denunciations , warnings , restrictive or discriminatory measures and mistrustful interventions the new theology could not be extinguished , however , and it was triumphantly vindicated with the coming of a new pope , john xxiii , and the second vatican council \( 196265 \) , where its proponents played crucial roles in shaping documents that , in turn , reshaped catholicism ultimately fathers congar , de lubac , danielou and von balthasar were named cardinals indeed , within catholic theology this story of repression and vindication has achieved a kind of mythical status like the tale of impressionism s initial rejection and eventual triumph in the art world the danger , of course , is that every catholic theologian rebuffed by church authorities can imagine himself an yves congar just as every painter who cannot sell his paintings can imagine himself a vincent van gogh but it would be misleading to view the new theology through the modern notions of avantgarde and rebellion its leaders were as unhappy with the word new as its adversaries its religious power came precisely from its twofold nature its combination of a profound immersion in the centuries of christian tradition with an equally profound engagement in contemporary life starting in the 1930 s , father congar and father de lubac oversaw a series of scholarly works exploring classic christian writings at the same time , father congar was close to groups involved in social reform and became a theoretician for the workerpriest movement during world war ii , when father congar was a german prisoner \( and preacher against nazism \) in various camps , father de lubac was editor of a clandestine resistance newspaper , where he dedicated himself to combating antisemitism these theologians were convinced that the church had enfeebled its own ability to speak to contemporary society but the problem , they believed , was not that the church was traditional it was that the full , rich tradition had been narrowed to a set of polemically defensible but pastorally ineffective formulas it was , in sum , that the church was not traditional enough of course , it is an oversimplification to attribute all the changes that the second vatican council initiated in catholicism and all its reverberations in everything from jewishchristian relations to latin american politics to this one band of scholars but whether one looks to them or to parallel influences in catholicism , or even when one contemplates likely sources of renewal in protestantism , eastern orthodoxy , judaism , islam and other great faiths , nothing seems more promising than the same approach a reverential , though not uncritical , recovery of the full depth and breadth of tradition married to an impassioned concern for the issues of the day
with all the touching , talking and soothing , the gesticulating and the restless dashing about , public school 64 s new boss , felix polanco , seemed like an anxious conductor whose orchestra was threatening dissonance at any moment it was no accident that at a contentious parents' meeting last month , the bronx school s chief administrator cried out , with some desperation , harmony ! harmony ! it has become his daily preoccupation and a utopian one indeed at one of the city s worst schools mr polanco is on a radical mission on feb 1 , schools chancellor ramon c cortines sent him to take over ps 64 , a school with an abysmal record in school district 9 , which has the most notorious history of corruption in new york city not only was he given five months to turn the school around , but he also took on a new role created for the occasion chief administrator there was no falling back on a model , only falling forward two months into the job , the verdict on mr polanco is still out the teachers union reports dissatisfaction , though members refused to be interviewed several parents have praised mr polanco s changes , and he himself proclaims undiminished and constant enthusiasm from the outset , the stakes have been high ps 64 , a 1920 s brick building in the middle of drab tenements in morrisania , spent more than five years on the state s list of the worst schools it was monitored by the central board of education for more than six months and given every chance to reform itself finally , mr cortines gave up the ax fell on ps 64 at the end of january the school met exactly none of the minimum state and city standards in reading , math and attendance of its 870 students , only 16 percent read at or above grade level last year , compared with a systemwide average of 447 percent in a school where nearly 80 percent of students are hispanic , almost half were classified as having limited english only 286 percent of students scored at or above their grade level on a standardized math test , compared with 542 for the rest of the city the suspension rate was more than three times the average for elementary schools almost a year ago mr cortines identified ps 64 as one of six schools in serious need of help , and announced that school board representatives would work at the schools to help in teacher training and instruction in december , ps 64 s performance was examined again and found wanting drastic action is called for , mr cortines wrote in a curt letter to district 9 s leaders the following month ps 64 then became one of only two schools in the city the other is in queens singled out for the most drastic treatment the chancellor bypassed the local school board and appointed a troubleshooter to take charge but unlike the school in queens , ps 64 kept its principal , making the task even trickier the chancellor s office warned mr polanco , 45 , the son of dominican immigrants , that it would be tough a report prepared by the chancellor s office in december spoke of extensive conflicts and distrust within the school s administration , and among the leadership of the school , the district and the school board in the last seven years , nine members of the district 9 school board have been arrested , accused of grand larceny , bribery and signing phony invoices a board president was found guilty of taking kickbacks a school principal was arrested on charges of buying crack , and district employees were found to have spent thousands of dollars on calls to erotic telephone services after the report came out , hundreds of parents held a rally on jan 19 to denounce ps 64 s poor performance in interviews , parents complained that their children routinely came home unable to understand the reading , and that the school s administrators were aloof after she comes home , i have to teach her , said ivelisse flores , whose 9yearold daughter attends the school i do n't know what they do in school the teacher says she is an astudent , but when i sit down with her , she does n't understand anything five days after the protest , mr cortines announced that mr polanco would be leaving his job as assistant principal at a school in hell s kitchen in manhattan and going to the bronx mr polanco s mandate was both broad and vague school board officials talked of wanting him to work on improving reading brenda bravo , the board s administrator of curriculum initiatives , saw his job as including putting together a reading program mr polanco himself said his role would be at least partly diagnostic , to answer the question why is the school not functioning as effectively as it should be \? but school officials were as indistinct as he was in defining exactly how this mission would be judged it would not necessarily be a question of improving test scores , ms bravo said a complication for mr polanco was that the principal , millie t perez , would now report to him after years of being in charge opting for tact , mr polanco allowed her to stay in her large secondfloor office while he took a smaller , more isolated office at the end of a thirdfloor corridor
beyond the overheated debate last week about whether connie chung has a future now that cbs has dropped her from its nightly newscast is a larger question likely to be asked more and more frequently in the coming months is there a future for anybody on the networks' nightly newscasts \? despite declines in the newscasts' ratings and revenue , executives at the three broadcast networks insist the answer is an enthusiastic yes the enthusiasm is based not on the prospect that the newscasts will stage a ratings comeback , but on the prospect of finding new ways to turn news into cash among the potential revenue sources cited by executives are international distribution , videoondemand programming and when someone figures out how to make money from it delivery of news and information on the internet purely on the basis of the number of people tuning in every night , the evening newscast appears to be a business of diminishing returns for all three networks abc s world news tonight has fallen from an average rating of 107 a year ago to a 102 this year nbc nightly news is down to an 86 rating from a 96 , while cbs evening news has dropped the most , to an 85 from a 96 \( each rating point represents 954 , 000 homes \) a good part of the reason for the falloff has been the o j simpson trial , which has drawn many news viewers to cnn at newscast time , when court is still in session in los angeles and even before the simpson trial , there had been evidence of a slow erosion in the newscasts' ratings whatever the reason , the declines have been costly andrew lack , president of nbc news , said nbc nightly news had lost several million dollars this year nbc has reacted to the drain by quietly adding an extra 30second commercial inside the newscast that has n't helped answer questions about the content , however these shows have n't changed much in 20 or 30 years , mr lack said evening newscasts on local television stations , meanwhile , have expanded to 90 minutes or longer , during which many of the same stories that now appear on the networks' newscasts are covered , at least in passing the traditional evening recitation of the big stories of the day is increasingly open to criticism for being outmoded and even irrelevant still , none of the networks have even dropped a hint that their evening newscasts are about to be eliminated or radically changed instead , they apparently intend to reinforce the institution , at least for now the reason , said david f poltrack , executive vice president of research for cbs , is that the programs still represent the image , the identity of the network that was never clearer than it was last week , when the decision by cbs to drop ms chung from her job as coanchor with dan rather of cbs evening news prompted a frenzy of attention the reaction to the decision did not seem consistent with the program s declining ratings and uninterested audience but , as mr poltrack put it the anchors are still the face of the network when people think of cbs they think of dan rather for that reason alone , he said , the newscasts are a very important economic component of the network and the possibilities offered by emerging forms of media hungry for news programming make those economics more promising in the future , mr poltrack added both cbs and abc have appointed former news executives to head their efforts to expand into new media services mark harrington at cbs and steven weiswasser at abc the reason is simple news programming is an asset that the networks own outright the networks produce it themselves and whatever uses they can come up with to repackage it means additional revenue in fact , the networks increasingly refer to the result of their news gathering as their news product news can be catalogued and retrieved and sold , mr poltrack said he said that in the course of a day the network s news division collected an enormous amount of material , some of which is sent out to the affiliated stations for use on their local newscasts and some of which is used by the network itself but twothirds of what we collect ends up nowhere , mr poltrack said at least some of that material may be able to generate revenue for the network in the future , he said mr lack of nbc is not so sure i'm less sanguine about putting news on a computer service and trying to find a way to make money , he said instead , he said he was considering a different way to find new profits from the newscasts the network is trying to create the first international evening newscast in the short term , the economic prospects for the networks' evening newscasts are actually improving , even without international expansion or new media the simpson trial has to end sometime more important , the bullish advertising market for all of network television is driving up the prices for commercials on the newscasts , even with their diminished ratings there is a flood of money in the marketplace that will probably mean the prices the networks get for their news programs will be up by 20 to 25 percent , said bill croasdale , president of national broadcasting for western international media mr lack suggested that despite the positive shortterm gains , the newscasts would have to change substantially in the next three to five years he said it might be possible to combine local and network newscasts , perhaps creating an hourlong or even longer news program similar to nbc s today show the drawback to such a drastic change , he said , goes back to the strength of the network newscast its lingering reputation as the front page that provides coverage of the most important news of the day
washington , july 21 days after the house of representatives passed an amendment aimed at cutting off the bailout funds for mexico , senator alfonse m d'amato said today that he would introduce similar legislation in the senate that would prohibit the president from acting on his own in the future to rescue a country on the brink of bankruptcy mr d'amato , the new york republican who is chairman of the senate banking committee and an outspoken opponent of the mexican bailout , has tried and failed in the past to cut off much of the 20 billion that the clinton administration drew from a special treasury department account for loans and guarantees that backed mexican securities the proposal he is now floating , while not expected to interfere with the current disbursement , would effectively seal off the option of drawing funds from that account again it appears likely to pass in some form by the time the new government budget goes into effect on oct 1 , mexico will have already drawn down most of the american bailout money that it needs the house amendment , which passed earlier this week , was a less direct attack on the use of the bailout fund neither proposal would take effect until the new budget year the announcement by senator d'amato came after he abandoned an attempt to block a key administration official in the mexican bailout , lawrence h summers , from being promoted to deputy secretary of the treasury he is currently the under secretary for international finance at a confirmation hearing today , mr d'amato accused mr summers of describing mexico s financial health last year in glowing terms , even though internal treasury memos show that he and other officials had become increasingly alarmed about the country s trade deficit and heavy borrowing mr summers served as the principal architect of the bailout key administration officials , including secretary summers , were not candid and forthcoming about the true condition of mexico s economy in 1994 , mr d'amato said , repeating accusations he has made before he and other administration officials repeatedly painted a rosy picture of the mexican economy that picture was distorted and not accurate and not true the senate finance committee , however , approved mr summers overwhelmingly only senator bob dole , the majority leader and the leading candidate for the republican presidential nomination , and senator frank murkowski , the alaska republican , joined mr d'amato in voting against the nomination in retrospect , mr summers said , he would have issued statements that left less room for ambiguity in describing mexico s economic condition last year he said he should have separated mexico s longterm financial prospects which he maintains are good from the country s shortterm problems , which treasury documents were describing in somewhat dire terms earlier this year mr summers told a congressional committee that any public comments casting doubt on mexico s prospects last year could have touched off mass flight by investors exactly what happened in december , when the peso went into a free fall there has not been and will not be any attempt to deceive , mr summers told the committee the proposal by mr d'amato , which he said he would submit next week as an amendment to an appropriations measure , would bar the president from drawing on the treasury s exchange stabilization fund to help foreign nations , unless the amount is less than 1 billion or the time period is less than six months mr d'amato , saying he was open to negotiation on the amount and the time limits , said his overall objective was to fix the fund so it ca n't be used as the president s piggy bank the fund is ordinarily used to smooth out exchangerate fluctuations , though it has been used dozens of times to make shortterm loans to foreign countries none of those loans , however , were anywhere near the size of the mexican bailout the administration s use of the fund earlier this year to sidestep congress was widely criticized on capitol hill lawmakers of both parties , however , expressed relief that the president s move allowed them to avoid a vote on the mexican bailout issue the d'amato bill could prove popular because it allows members of congress to have it both ways , voting against mexicanstyle bailouts without actually threatening mexico s financial stability but administration officials hope that time will cool such passions i do n't think there has been any presentation of the good things the fund has done , a senior administration official said photo senator alfonse m d'amato \( reuters \)

the 400 , 000 they were able to withdraw we think we have the right level of security citibank said that none of its depositors lost any money in the fraud but banking experts said similar breakins were bound to occur with more banking business being done electronically at a time when more powerful personal computers are available i'm worried that there are more people with computers and more savvy people trying to break in , said the head of technology at a large new york bank who insisted on anonymity we have to keep raising the bar of our security until more details emerge , it is difficult to assess the the potential threat of this kind of breakin court documents say the transfers were made from the citibank accounts of three banks invest capital and banco del sud of argentina and bank artha graha of indonesia and done with identification numbers and passwords that would have been available to employees of those banks experts said they could not recall a similar fraud

executive vice president of the new york clearing house , which runs the chips interbank wiretransfer system banks protect cashmanagement systems that corporate customers use to move millions of dollars with the best security methods available typically , several people , each with separate passwords , must authorize transfers , and they must also have other information there are further protections , like computer programs that generate special security codes since the breakin , which occurred last year , citibank has required customers to use an electronic device that creates a new password for every transfer , ms dates of citibank said banking experts said that the degree of penetration into citibank s systems would typically require the cooperation of someone with inside knowledge ms dates said there was no evidence of involvement by a current or former citibank employee , but she noted the investigation was continuing the complaint , filed in february , was released yesterday by the united states attorney s office in manhattan against vladimir leonidovich levin , a computer expert who works for ao saturn , a trading company based in st petersburg , russia mr

of several citibank customers into accounts opened by accomplices at banks in california and in israel the bank noticed the activity after several of the customers complained about unauthorized transfers from their accounts in early august of last year , 522 , 000 in funds was transferred to the bank of america into two accounts controlled by yevgeny and yekaterina korolkova after citibank notified bank of america of the suspected fraud , the accounts were frozen on aug 17 and 18 , mrs korolkova opened checking accounts at five banks in san francisco , and a total of 199 , 000 was transferred into them from the account of a citibank customer in buenos aires on aug 26 , she was arrested by the fbi and found to be in possession of a oneway ticket to russia court documents quote mr korolkova s landlord as saying that mr korolkova left the united states to go to russia in october 1994 , telephone company employees in russia , working with citibank , identified the source of the transfers as ao saturn , the company where mr levin was identified as the head systems operator it is unclear how mr levin was located for his arrest in london a hearing on his extradition is

private transcription service the speeches by acting prime minister shimon peres and eitan haber were translated from the hebrew by the times and by official translators president clinton to all the people of israel , the american people mourn with you in the loss of your leader and i mourn with you , for he was my partner and friend every moment we shared was a joy because he was a good man , and an inspiration because he was also a great man leah , i know that too many times in the life of this country , you were called upon to comfort and console the mothers and the fathers , the

humility and honor , offer you our strength may god comfort you among all the mourners of zion and to israel yitzhak rabin lived the history of israel through every trial and triumph , the struggle for independence , the wars for survival , the pursuit of peace and all he served on the front lines this son of david and of solomon took up arms to defend israel s freedom and laid down his life to secure israel s future he was a man completely without pretense , as all of his friends knew i read that in 1949 , after the war of independence , david bengurion sent him to represent israel at the armistice talks at rhodes , and he had never before worn a necktie and did not know how to tie the knot so , the problem was solved by a friend who tied it for him before he left and showed him how to preserve the knot simply by loosening the tie and pullin it over his head well , the last time we were together , not two weeks ago , he showed up for a black tie event on time , but without the black tie and so , he borrowed a tie and i was privileged to straighten it for him it is a moment i will cherish as long as i live to him , ceremonies and words were less important than actions and deeds six weeks ago , the king and president mubarak will remember , we were at the white house for signing the israelpalestinian agreement and a lot of people spoke i spoke the king spoke chairman arafat spoke president mubarak spoke our foreign ministers all spoke and finally , prime minister rabin gotup to speak and he said , first , the good news i am the last speaker but he also understood the power of words and symbolism take a look at the stage he set in washington the king of jordan , the president of egypt , chairman arafat , and us , the prime minister , and foreign minister of israel on one platform please take a good hard look the sight you see before you was impossible , was unthinkable just three years ago only poets dreamt of it and to our great pain , soldier and civilian went to their deaths to make this moment possible those were his words today , my fellow citizens of the world , i ask all of you to take a good hard look at this picture look at the leaders from all over the middle east and around the world who have journeyed here today for yitzhak rabin and for peace though we no longer hear his deep and booming voice , it is he who has brought us together again here , in word and deed , for peace now it falls to all of us who love peace and all of us who loved him to carry on the struggle to which he gave life and for which he gave his life he cleared the path and his spirit continues to light the way his spirit lives on in the growing peace between israel and her neighbors it lives in the eyes of the children , the jewish and the arab children , who are leaving behind a past of fear for a future of hope it lives on in the promise of true security so , let me say to the people of israel even in your hour of darkness , his spirit lives on , and so you must not lose your spirit look at what you have accomplished making a once barren desert bloom , building a thriving democracy in a hostile terrain , winning battles and wars and now winning the peace , which is the only enduring victory your prime minister was a martyr for peace , but he was a victim of hate surely , we must learn from his martyrdom that if people cannot let go of the hatred of their enemies , they risk sowing the seeds of hatred among themselves i ask you , the people of israel , on behalf of my nation that knows its own long litany of loss from abraham lincoln to president kennedy to martin luther king do not let that happen to you in the knesset , in your homes , in your places of worship , stay the righteous course as moses said to the children of israel when he knew he would not cross over into the promised land be strong and of good courage fear not , for god will go with you he will not fail you he will not forsake you president weizman , acting prime minister peres , to all the people of israel , as you stay the course of peace , i make this pledge neither will america forsake you legend has it that in every generation of jews from time immemorial , a just leader emerged to protect his people and show them the way to safety prime minister rabin was such a leader
major league baseball clubs in search of replacement players need no longer call agents asking if they have any to offer the players association s executive board is in the process of voting to decertify any agent who represents a replacement player the board , which is expected to announce its decision today , will take the action by amending the regulations governing the union s agentcertification program the union certifies agents to represent players and can decertify them for various practices the purpose of the rule , gene orza , the union s associate general counsel , said , is to make sure no one authorized to represent players gets involved in the business of trying to do away with the very institution that s giving them the authorization the board is acting just as clubs have begun calling agents seeking players to fill rosters for what the owners say will be a 1995 season in spite of the players strike the owners' operations committee hopes to have a plan for recruitment and employment of replacement players by the end of the week i 've had some clubs ask me if i have any guys who want to come in as replacement players , craig fenech , whose clients include erik hanson and bill swift , said from his new jersey office but i told them we 're not in that business and we 're not going to be furthermore , fenech added , the retired players whom i have spoken to have no intention of doing it jeff moorad , an agent in california , said he received calls from several general managers at the end of last week inquiring about our policy position on the issue of replacement players my response , moorad related , was clear in each instance i made the point that although in the end the individual players would make their final decisions , our role would be active in discouraging them from serving in the role of replacements even before the union s executive board adopted its amendment , all of the several agents who were contacted yesterday said they would not represent replacement players we 're not going to do it , said jim bronner , who represents lee smith and larry walker , among many others under no circumstances will i represent any replacement players , said tony attanasio , the agent for todd stottlemyre , tony phillips and others i 've had calls from several of the guys i 've represented in the past , former major league players and players with major league experience who are still playing triplea , asking me what the situation is my response was you have to do what you have to do it s a difficult decision , but should you decide to go ahead and play , i do n't care what you do with my number but do n't use it again agents have an obvious reason for not representing replacement players by lining up jobs for players who would be strikebreakers , they would be hurting their striking clients of course , some agents could find themselves with strikebreakers as clients if striking players decide to report to spring training when clubs open camps next month if there are such players , they have n't advertised their intentions they certainly have n't informed their agents bronner and attanasio said none of their clients have said they would play one guy with some major league experience , attanasio said , indicated it would be a difficult decision to make , but if he decided to play , once the strike ended they obviously would send him out and he did n't know how he would handle playing in triplea with guys who chose not to play moorad said that across the board , from a young jeffrey hammonds to a veteran like matt williams or will clark , the players we work with have been unanimous in their feelings about not crossing a picket line then moorad cited a player who would fall in one of the categories of players the clubs might try to use he explained that eric fox , an outfielder with between one and two years major league service , signed with the texas rangers as a nonroster player this winter and could make close to 200 , 000 in salary and bonuses playing in the majors next season he has fought hard to make the big leagues and stay there , moorad said he called and asked for guidance on the issues we talked it through philosophically and practically at the end of our discussion , eric agreed he was not interested in putting himself in a position that would stand out from the rest of the union the union , meanwhile , received a reply from the clubs on its declaration last week that more than 800 unsigned players who were tendered contracts dec 23 are free agents because the tenders were made under unlawfully implemented new terms in a letter to donald fehr , head of the union , chuck o'connor , management s chief labor lawyer , said the union s contentions simply reiterate its previous challenge to the clubs' right to implement a new system the clubs are quite confident , however , o'connor wrote , that their implementation of revised terms and conditions of employment is entirely lawful furthermore , o'connor wrote , the clubs' right to reserve players stems from the reserve provisions of their lawfully implemented terms and conditions

no doubt the advent of title ix is partly responsible for the number of girls involved in high school athletics increasing from 200 , 000 in the 1970 s to 2 million today no doubt this increased participation has trickled down into elementary schools , neighborhoods and summer leagues by next summer , america may learn if it s ready for a trickleup effect for the sixteam women s professional fastpitch league is scheduled to begin play in june , with a series of 15 to 18 exhibition games , some to be televised on espn2 by the summer of 1996 , the wpf will inaugurate a full 70game regular championship season and postseason playoffs the league is hoping to cash in on what has become the no 1 participation sport in the land and convert some of the 40 million participants approximately half of them women and girls into fans it will begin in states such as wisconsin , illinois , michigan and indiana , the same midwest region where professional women s baseball thrived half a century ago that league , emulated just last summer by the barnstorming silver bullets women s team , was born during world war ii it provided women a league of their own , as a recent movie title suggested world war ii ended 50 years ago and shortly after , so did interest in that league of their own but the war for equality of opportunity , quieted after such initial skirmishes , never quieted completely the dearth of opportunities really kept it alive , in people like rayla j allison , the wpf s vice president and league director allison played in the shortlived international women s professional fastpitch league in the mid to late 1970 s , a farflung national league doomed by travel costs and an unaccepting public it is the public whose attitude traditionally condemns female athletes to the sidelines or overseas after college simply because the same professional team sport opportunities enjoyed by men are n't available in this country still , allison hopes that attitude is dwindling , because of the two decades of title ix i remember once in elementary school , the teacher was going around asking students what they wanted to be when they grew up , the 41yearold allison recalled i said i wanted to be a doctor or i wanted to be cowboy jim and the teacher said , 'well , rayla , i'm sorry , but little girls ca n't be doctors , they have to be nurses and they ca n't be cowboys , they can be cowgirls allison pictured dale evans with fringed skirt riding a horse and knew she did n't want that she also knew that the society did n't expect or want much else from her on any level , including the playing field fortunately , for allison and other girls growing up in benbrook , tex , allison s parents fostered greater expectations they started a softball program , borrowing what little league equipment they could , to assure their daughter a physical fitness outlet that allison s mother as well as father coached the softball players offered a defining point within a defining moment in allison s life allison s love for sport and an inherited penchant for nurturing such love in other girls led her to play softball at the university of texas at arlington , then professionally in the 1970 s league , first with the chicago ravens and then the fourtime champion connecticut falcons in meriden , from 1976 until 1979 that allison was one of a relatively few american women who can claim to have earned a wage playing a team sport was not lost on her , even as she moved on to coach on the college level and serve as executive director of the national softball coaches association as a coach and executive , allison was instrumental in creating more than 8 , 000 playing opportunities for girls and women but none were at the professional level until now as the wpf starts up , allison is convinced america just may be ready this time what has occurred in the last 15 to 20 years is the american culture accepting and embracing girls and women in sports and respecting their athleticism and their involvement , she said that was not the case when i played in the earlier league of course it will take more than a philosophical embracing of a women s right to access to professional levels to make the women s professional fastpitch a success it will take more than the financial support of business leaders like jay cowles 3d , the wpf president and chairman of the cowles media company more than the involvement of a former baseball commissioner , bowie kuhn , or major league baseball properties inc to help map out marketing strategies a paying public is needed , too so all women like rayla allison are asking is , if they build the league , will the american public come \? perhaps this time the answer will be a resounding yes
lakewood , nj the suburbs have long been places where people are divided by barriers as concrete as walls and as subtle as class they have also been places where institutions like the public school system , the little league and the pta have helped to breach those barriers but lakewood , in central new jersey , is a town divided by creed and culture , obstacles that are proving resistant to change on one side of this divide live lakewood s 18 , 000 strictly orthodox jews , members of a yeshiva community that grew up in the last 40 years around beth medrash govoha , the country s bestknown religiously rightwing rabbinical college for reasons of habit and cultural integrity , the yeshiva community lives apart , attends school apart and worships apart the community is not withdrawn in politics , however the orthodox vote as a nearly solid bloc , making them the dominant political power in lakewood , and a power that can only grow leaders of the yeshiva community , which had about 400 members in 1968 , expect their numbers to top 27 , 000 by the turn of the century on the other side of this divide live the rest of lakewood s 45 , 000 residents , a more conventional suburban mix of middleclass homeowners of many faiths and ethnic backgrounds , and a community of the poor that struggles with crime and joblessness on the streets east of downtown what ties these groups together is criticism of the yeshiva community s social isolation and political domination lakewood is a dying community in terms of diversity , said michael rush , the principal of south toms river elementary school and a leader in black civic affairs minorities , and i mean blacks and hispanic people , are treated unfairly in the political system , in the schools and in employment in lakewood the yeshiva community s leaders acknowledge the problems , but caution against accepting the complaints at face value we are sympathetic to the concerns of the rest of the community , said rabbi moshe weisberg , the yeshiva community s unofficial spokesman , but we also feel that there are undercurrents of antisemitism and antiorthodox feeling in some of the things we hear into this atmosphere of mistrust came tragedy earlier this year , when jasmine kirkland , a 4yearold black girl left momentarily unattended in a parked car , bolted into the street and was killed by a car driven by an orthodox woman from highland park , nj although there was at least one protest march after jasmine s death , lakewood experienced none of the turmoil that followed a 1991 accident with frightening parallels in crown heights , brooklyn there , the traffic death of 7yearold gavin cato was followed by three nights of rioting by black youths and the murder of a yeshiva student member of the lubavitcher hasidic movement what jasmine s death brought out to people on both sides here was an awareness of the need for communication before the gulf in the community grows too great and so about 30 community leaders , representing different ethnic and economic factions in lakewood , sat down together last month at georgian court college , a catholic women s school that adjoins the rabbinical college we have begun a dialogue because , really , we must be able to talk about our difference or we will simply move further apart , said claribell williams , a professor of history at georgian court , who moderated the invitationonly meeting the talks are only a beginning , however , for if anything came of the first two meetings of the lakewood coalition , as it is known , it is that the anger here is more out in the open than before jasmine died patricia crews , jasmine s aunt and a founding member of african americans in action , lakewood s most militant black group , accused the police of ignoring traffic violations by orthodox drivers while harassing black drivers for the smallest infractions suzanne margolin , whose car struck jasmine , was ticketed for reckless driving , but she did not face criminal charges mrs crews , an office worker , spoke in blunt ethnic terms of the movement of orthodox families out of their traditional concentrations west of madison avenue into the more rundown areas to the east of the town s main highway see that house \? mrs crews said , pointing to a newly refurbished , powderblue clapboard home surrounded by older , more worn ones on second street , that s a jew house , and that one over there , that s a jew house , too it s getting to be all jew houses back in there if mrs crews is angry about jasmine s death , rabbi weisberg is angry over the imputation of guilt on his community the death of this unfortunate little girl was tragic , but it was not a part of our community , he said the woman who was driving the car was not from here , she was from highland park and she was only shopping in lakewood we thought it was an affront to our community that we should even be linked to it rabbi weisberg also thinks the complaints about the yeshiva community s expansion are unfair we ca n't win , he said if we stick to ourselves , we are segregating ourselves if we move into new places , we are taking over state senator robert w singer , a republican of ocean county and former mayor of lakewood , said the yeshiva jews are clannish to protect their cultural identity their belief is that once you let down the gate , you have people leaving the society for an easier way of living outside , mr singer said

ithaca , ny , nov 14 a computer email message listing 75 reasons why women should not have freedom of speech , which was sent as a prank by four freshmen at cornell university to 20 friends , has ricocheted through the internet , provoking thousands of angry messages to cornell from campuses around the country cornell has charged the students evan camps of bethesda , md , rikus linschoten of newport beach , calif , pat sicher of san juan , pr , and brian waldman of massapequa , li with sexual harassment and misuse of computer resources , said the university s judicial administrator , barbara krause ms krause said the charges stemmed from lines like , if she ca n't speak , she ca n't cry rape , and , of course , if she ca n't speak , she ca n't say 'no' the message also contained vulgarities about oral sex , she said david lambert , the university s vice president for information technology , said that this was not the first time offensive material had appeared on the cornell network , but he added that the university had never before had such a wide response to the message that the four students sent last month students and faculty members at many colleges , from harvard to stanford , have contacted cornell s administration to lodge complaints the four students said they had been receiving 50 to 60 threatening responses a week cornell s vice president for university relations , jacquie powers , said , there were threats from various groups to try to crash our system mr lambert said his department had been virtually overwhelmed by phone calls and email after receiving nearly 1 , 000 messages , he said , he stopped reading his email by treating the incident as a case of sexual harassment , the university has run into an escalating debate about free speech on the internet many private universities have speech codes that prohibit racist or sexist language and have applied these codes to campus computer networks but cornell does not have such a code , nor does it control the content of its computer network ms krause said the university brought charges against a student only if his or her speech constituted harassment against a specific individual who complained that the message was directed at him or her the sexual harassment complaint might be difficult to pursue , she added , because it was not made by any of the 20 original recipients the university s sexual harassment guidelines require that for a violation to be found , one of the original recipients must file the charge none of the original 20 has filed a complaint cornell would not name the complainant a cornell spokesman , henrik n dullea , said in a statement last friday that the university regretted the incident and that cornell s good name and reputation have been damaged in the process the students made a formal apology , which was published on nov 3 in the campus newspaper , the cornell daily sun

los angeles , aug 29 judge lance a ito s courtroom reverberated today with the voice of the former police detective mark fuhrman , the witness who swore under oath that he had not said nigger for the last 10 years , uttering the epithet more than three dozen times in taperecorded remarks to an aspiring screenwriter that both riveted and revolted those who heard them , mr fuhrman , around whom prosecutors have built much of their case against o j simpson , emerges not just as a racist and perjurer , but also as a rogue police officer who boasts of arresting people without probable cause , tearing up exculpatory evidence , concocting incriminating evidence , ignoring legal precedent , beating confessions from people and tailoring testimony probable cause \? he asked sarcastically at one point you 're god judge ito , saying he was confronted by dozens of issues , made no decision today on whether the jury will hear any of the excerpts there will be no testimony tomorrow while he ponders the issue but rejecting at least one prosecution argument , he said it appeared that in some instances , mr fuhrman was speaking from conviction and not feeding dialogue to a screenwriter in essence , the judge must decide whether the comments , made to the screenwriter , laura hart mckinny of north carolina , reveal darkness and dishonesty at the heart of the case against mr simpson , or if letting jurors hear them would be , as prosecutors assert , a colossal and cynical descent into irrelevancy the big question now concerns what mr fuhrman told one of mr simpson s lawyers , f lee bailey , in march that he was as certain that he had not moved a glove as he was of never saying nigger in the previous 10 years one of mr simpson s lawyers , gerald uelmen , urged judge ito to allow into evidence all 41 instances in which mr fuhrman called blacks niggers , or , short of that , at least 17 references , or short of even that , at least 7 collectively , mr uelmen argued , they proved that mr fuhrman was a liar , a bigot and a lawbreaker he called mr fuhrman los angeles s worst nightmare , the greatest liar since ananias he implored judge ito to allow in a panoply of violent , profanityladen statements in which mr fuhrman boasts of misconduct that the defense argues is germane to the simpson case , including fabricating evidence , covering up afterwards and perjuring himself on the stand mr uelmen said jurors could be trusted to evaluate such information , insisting that they are not some dithering nincompoops brought in from some pumpkin patch in one statement , mr fuhrman speaks of tearing up driver s licenses to incriminate people in another , he talks of picking and squeezing the scab on an addict s scar to prove him guilty of a fresh drug offense now if that is n't planting or fabricating evidence , i do n't know what is , mr uelmen said in a third statement , mr fuhrman brags of supplying prosecutors with whatever they want to hear deputy district attorney marcia clark said , as a citizen i am deeply offended , and i'm shocked , and i'm disgusted with what i have heard but she added that it would be a travesty to let mr fuhrman s comments into evidence , thereby derailing the case paraphrasing a recent newspaper cartoon , ms clark argued that the real n word in the case is not nigger , but nicole this is a murder trial where none of this is relevant , she said she also said that mr fuhrman was peripheral to her case given the mass of evidence pointing to mr simpson s guilt and that however twisted mr fuhrman s beliefs , he had no opportunity to plant evidence the admission of this evidence is telling the jury 'disregard the case look somewhere else , ' she said looking worried , even pained , and speaking in a formal , gentle voice , ms mckinny told mr simpson s lawyers that mr fuhrman was offering his observations of police work rather than playing a part the voice of mr fuhrman s that echoed through the courtroom was casual , chatty , confident and conversational it was a voice filled with swagger and profanity from a man who was at ease and enjoying himself it was , in fact , much the same voice with which mr fuhrman jauntily declared in march that he had not used what some in a futile attempt to keep the simpson case genteel called the n word in the last 10 years all of ms mckinny s sessions with mr fuhrman occurred after february 1985 , though some only barely so but ms mckinny said that while she realized that mr fuhrman had lied under oath , she had not produced the tapes earlier both to protect her sources and because she considered them to have minimal evidentiary value the information on the tapes does not directly exonerate mr simpson and therefore i did n't have the responsibility to come forth with the information , she testified later , she added there was nothing to me that made me feel that officer fuhrman could have planted evidence in this particular case , no mr fuhrman , who found the bloody glove behind mr simpson s house and streaks of blood on mr simpson s white ford bronco , had his own views of his role in the case , according to the transcript of his final interview with ms mckinny , who had agreed nine years earlier to pay him 10 , 000 if her screenplay were ever put into production
mexico city , may 10 a former state prosecutor who helped to investigate the killing of a roman catholic cardinal in 1993 and other drugrelated crimes was shot to death today in the western city of guadalajara the former prosecutor , leobardo larios guzman , 50 , was shot nine times by one or more gunmen who were waiting outside his home as he left to teach a morning class at the university of guadalajara law school , jalisco state officials said he had stepped down as the state s attorney general after the conservative opposition swept the governing institutional revolutionary party from power in elections there in february the killing was the latest in a series of incidents that have shaken jalisco since the killing of juan jesus cardinal posadas ocampo outside the guadalajara airport in may 1993 last week , 7 inmates were killed and 58 people were wounded during a twoday riot at the main state prison the attack also rattled the financial markets in mexico city values on the mexican stock exchange fell slightly after the shooting , and the main market index closed at 2 , 024 points , down about 1 percent radio reports from guadalajara quoted government officials as saying the investigation into mr larios s death was focusing on a wellknown hitman who worked for two of the several major drugtrafficking organizations based in jalisco but a spokesman for the state attorney general s office , sergio villa , said in a telephone interview that none of the four men seen leaving the scene in a silver nissan sedan had been apprehended and that there was still nothing clear about their identity one of the hypotheses is that this was done by people tied to drug trafficking , mr villa said drug traffickers were involved in the killing of cardinal posadas , and there have been any number of clashes among traffickers in the state but it may also have been that he was killed by some other criminal whom he affected in one of his investigations a former senior federal official who worked with mr larios on the joint statefederal investigation into the killing of the cardinal described the former prosecutor as a serious man with a good reputation but as the senior lawenforcement official during one of the more turbulent periods in jalisco s recent history , mr larios did not make a name for himself as a particularly aggressive prosecutor drug trafficking continued to flourish during his tenure , and state police officials were repeatedly implicated in cases of drugrelated corruption mr larios was particularly criticized for a series of irregularities in his inquiry into the death by strangulation of a major suspect in the cardinal s shooting , ramon \( spunky \) torres mendez , who was being held in the guadalajara city jail opinion polls have shown that few mexicans have been persuaded by the official account of cardinal posadas s killing , which was jointly investigated by jalisco state officials and the office of the federal attorney general yet after a flurry of recent newspaper reports predicting a major break in the case , the attorney general , antonio lozano gracia , suggested last week that an intensive reinvestigation of the case had produced nothing to overturn the early conclusion that drug traffickers had confused the robed prelate with the leader of a rival band who was also at the airport at the time
it is rare if not unprecedented for someone to witness his own burial but that s what the st john s basketball team did last night after choking off its dwindling hopes for a respectable season by losing , 7862 , to the 19thranked villanova wildcats last night at madison square garden , the red storm immediately bused back to campus for a team meeting where it watched its defeat on film perhaps it was fitting punishment why not force the red storm players to watch what a crowd of 13 , 374 paid good money to see a secondhalf collapse that saw a 5point halftime lead turn into a 16point rout that was worse than the score indicated we 're going to try to get together and find out what the problems are and over the next couple of days try to correct those problems , brian mahoney , the st john s coach , said said red storm guard james scott we 'll probably get to bed about 2 or 3 in the morning mahoney ordered the meeting after st john s suffered what he called a total breakdown in the second half st john s , playing efficiently at both ends the floor , had to be pleased with a 3530 lead at halftime but villanova scored the first 12 points of the second half and went on to pound the red storm with a barrage of 3pointers and dunks kerry kittles scored 24 points and eric eberz totaled 23 as the wildcats won their sixth straight game and improved to 145 over all and 72 in the big east st john s , which shot only 29 percent in the second half , got 18 points from scott and 14 from felipe lopez , who again struggled with his outside shooting in losing its seventh straight conference game , st john s dropped to 98 on the season and 27 in the league it has lost 13 of 15 big east games over the last two seasons none was more stunning than its loss last night riding the momentum from sunday s victory at michigan , st john s , behind 13 points from scott , led by as many as 9 points on two occasions before settling for the 5point lead at the break i thought we gave a good effort offensively and defensively in the first half , mahoney said i thought if we did a little better job of rebounding , we 'd have a shot but that did n't happen it was all villanova in the second half kittles , a 6foot5inch junior , and eberz , a 67 junior , dominated the game with their torrid outside shooting , which dazed the red storm to the point were it was flustered eberz made 6 of 9 shots in the second half , including 4 of 5 from the arc he made 12 consecutive villanova points during one stretch where the wildcats' lead went from 5648 to 6850 kittles , the big east player of the week , hit 9 of 14 from the field and slammed through several dunks off transition as the wildcats made 53 percent of their shots in the second half after making only 40 percent in the first we came out in the second half and played the way we have been playing , said villanova coach steve lappas we were running our offense well and got the motion going eberz s shooting gave the red storm little chance for a comeback i struggled in the first half , he said but coach told me to keep shooting and i did after i hit the first one , it felt good and i kept on shooting scott , coming off a careerhigh 28 points at michigan , carried st john s in the first half but no one did much of anything in the second lopez struggled with his shot , making only 5 of 18 attempts st john s made just 9 of 31 of field goals in the second half we rushed our offense and did n't pick our spots , scott said we did n't make them play defense there were a lot of things that went wrong out there mahoney said offensively , we just did n't do a good job of taking shots we did n't show any patience or poise there was just a total breakdown on our part in the second half in the second half , we were just not there at all while mahoney hopes the latenight film session will force the red storm to take a hard look at itself , time is running out fourthranked connecticut comes to the garden on saturday night and will be heavily favored to hand st john s its eighth straight conference loss this was a tough loss , scott said but we just have to stay focused and continue to work hard photos felipe lopez of st john s reacted to a missed free throw in the second half last night during the red storm s loss to villanova \( pg 13 \) kerry kittles of villanova dunking for 2 of his gamehigh 24 points last night against st john s \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg 18 \)
paris , june 3 at an emergency meeting called to deal with the hostage crisis in bosnia , defense ministers from 15 western countries agreed today to set up two separate rapidreaction forces in the region to protect united nations forces there the two brigades the 5 , 000 strong british 24th airmobile brigade and a new international force made up of british , french and dutch troops could be operatingby the end of the month , said defense minister charles millon of france no united states troops would participate directly , in keeping with the clinton administration s promise to keep american troops off the ground in bosnia except to assist in any forced withdrawal of the 22 , 500 united nations troops there but the united states would provide important logistical assistance including air support from jet fighters and gunships flown by american pilots , said defense secretary william j perry , who attended the threehour session he said washington would also provide cobra attack helicopters , help with a strategic airlift to the region , set up an intelligence coordination center and provide special equipment including artillery locating radar , night vision goggles and a sophisticated navigational system mr millon said a group would go to new york early next week to inform secretary general boutros boutrousghali of the decisions here a vote by the security council would be required to carry out the changes , he said mr perry successfully sidestepped calls from the european allies for the united states to send troops as the only way to contain the threeyear conflict , which threatens to spill over into the rest of the balkans he told reporters traveling to paris with him that washington would not be sending in troops , although president clinton had indicated four days ago that some american forces might help out with a major redeployment within the country but the steps announced by mr perry marked an advance in united states participation in the peacekeeping effort this was especially true of the agreement to have planes flown by americans later , mr perry said american pilots would also fly ac130 gunships , which are slowmoving , lowflying aircraft that are more vulnerable to ground fire missile sites would have to be immobilized if they are to be used , he said the downing of an f16 by bosnian serbs over northern bosnia on friday underlined the risks in flying over a region where the bosnia serbs have surfacetoair missiles gen john shalikashvili , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said there was no new information on the missing pilot we still do not know for sure the whereabouts of the pilot or his condition , he said at a news conference a searchandrescue operation over the spot where the plane went down is continuing , he said none of the defense ministers from the 14 other countries criticized the united states , at least publicly , for refusing to commit ground troops the us position is well known and it s a position we understand , said malcolm rifkind , the british defense secretary the logistical support was welcomed unreservedly , he added the two brigades will come under the command of the bernard janvier , commander of united nations forces in the former yugoslavia , who could delegate control to lieut gen rupert smith , commander of united nations troops in bosnia either officer could order the rapid reaction force to undertake a mission to shore up remote united nations outposts or even rescue united nations personnel facing a threat without referring the decision to headquarters in new york or a civilian united nations representative in the region the problem of a twotiered chain of command on such decisions as ordering air strikes has been a major impediment to taking bold military action , especially when united nations ultimatums are flouted the defense ministers emphasized today that the reinforcements and the two new mobile brigades are not intended to put the united nations troops on a war footing , after their deployment to bosnia three years ago on a relief mission asserting that the recent taking of united nations hostages by bosnian serbs had has done nothing but strengthen our resolve , mr millon said the goal was to broaden the capability of the forces already there the mission is not to establish a military force but to establish a peace force to escort food convoys and protect civilian enclaves , he said britain s 24th airmobile brigade , a wellequipped force that uses light tanks and helicopters , was placed on alert to go to bosnia last monday , a day after 33 british hostages were seized the brigade would be based in bosnia the other brigade , consisting of 4 , 000 to 5 , 000 , would probably be located in croatia , and be supplied with equipment and support from spain , norway , turkey and the netherlands the decisions on reinforcement by the defense ministers from nato , sweden and finland would raise the total number of united nations troops in bosnia to about 32 , 000 mr rifkind emphasized that the united nations mandate had not changed the un is no closer to being a combatant than it was before , he said this capability will give very significant enhanced protection to the un to enable it to carry out its task a french proposal to open up a land corridor to insure supplies to the besieged capital of sarajevo , was discussed but no decision was made , mr millon said the british are known to oppose the idea , regarding it as something that would probably force the united nations into fighting the bosnia serbs photo gen john shalikashvili , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , and defense secretary william j perry prepared yesterday for the meeting in paris with officials from 15 western countries at which an agreement was reached to create a force to protect united nations peacekeepers in bosnia \( agence frencepresse \)

zagreb , croatia , dec 31 leaders of the muslimled bosnian government and their bosnian serb enemies signed an agreement today to stop fighting for four months , during which they would seek to negotiate a permanent peace the senior united nations envoy to the former yugoslavia , yasushi akashi , announced the signing in sarajevo mr akashi said the bosnian president , alija izetbegovic , signed the accord at his office there the envoy then took the agreement to bosnian serb leaders at their headquarters in nearby pale , where they signed it i had some moments of doubts this afternoon , mr akashi told reporters in sarajevo but we finally managed to agree on a comprehensive cessation of hostilities under the accord , units from the two armies are expected to pull back from confrontation lines when the ceasefire takes effect at noon on sunday local time \( 6 am eastern time \) in some areas , troops from the united nations force are to be interposed between them this gives a structure and establishes procedures for the process of separation of forces under unprofor monitoring and supervision , mr akashi said , referring to the united nations force by its diplomatic shorthand name there will be very close supervision of the process by which the parties agree to separate from each other mr akashi said the agreement also included a plan for the administration of utilities and joint economic cooperation although the text of the agreement was not immediately released , the fact of its signing appeared to improve prospects for an end to the war that has been raging in bosnia and herzegovina for nearly three years none of the dozens of ceasefires that have been reached during that time has committed the sides to stop fighting for such a long period the signing came after a week of talks conducted by the commander of united nations troops in bosnia , lieut gen sir michael rose of britain he was seeking to strike a balance between the bosnian serbs position , which was that the agreement should be limited to a cessation of hostilities , and bosnian government demands that it be broadened to include other commitments government negotiators had been seeking pledges that bosnian serb forces would stop fighting around the besieged northwestern town of bihac and allow free passage of relief supplies along corridors known as blue routes , which are roads used by united nations aid convoys without a complete ceasefire in bihac and the opening of the blue routes , there will be no cessation of hostilities agreement , bosnia s prime minister , haris silajdzic , said a few hours before the signing government negotiators had also been seeking a commitment for the demilitarization of sarajevo , which today marked 1 , 000 days under siege by bosnian serb forces the negotiations that led to today s agreement was set in motion a week ago , when the two sides signed a ceasefire accord brokered by former president jimmy carter the accord committed the sides to open talks for a fourmonth truce with the intent to conclude the agreement by jan 1 , 1995 bosnian serb leaders had been more anxious to sign the agreement that was finally reached today they have achieved most , if not all , of their military goals and now control about 70 percent of bosnia in a war that began in april 1992 and has left at least an estimated 200 , 000 people dead or missing the bosnian government , however , felt that it has been gaining military momentum and was worried that a truce agreement would freeze serbian gains the onset of the harsh balkan winter was an important incentive for both sides , since fighting would be difficult for the next few months although today s signings were regarded as an important step toward peace , daunting obstacles still confront mediators who are seeking to negotiate a final treaty the process set in motion by mr carter envisioned three stages the first was the weeklong ceasefire that expired today , which was widely respected throughout bosnia except in the bihac area the second was the signing of the accord reached today the third stage is to be the final treaty outside mediators insist that a final treaty be centered on the plan devised by the socalled contact group , which includes the united states , britain , france , germany and russia the bosnian government has reluctantly accepted the plan , but bosnian serbs have refused , saying the 49 percent of land allotted to them under it does not meet their needs talks aimed at resolving the substantial issues still dividing the two sides will be conducted by the two international mediators the united nations envoy , thorvald stoltenberg , and the european union representative , lord owen in belgrade , president slobodan milosevic of serbia , which had been the prime backer of the bosnian serbs , expressed optimism about the prospects for peace in the balkans speaking on serbian television hours before the signings in sarajevo and pale , mr milosevic predicted that in the coming year we will reach a permanent peace for the entire territory of the former yugoslavia map of bosnia and herzegovina showing locations of

for an ambitious prosecutor , somerset county , a suburb of freshly developed homes and hightech office parks , seems to offer little material for glory but a succession of highprofile cases and a relentless pursuit of drug dealers have made nicholas l bissell jr perhaps the bestknown county prosecutor in new jersey just this year , mr bissell has handled three very different cases that reverberated beyond his county and the state although none of the cases went to trial , they underscored his reputation as an aggressive prosecutor who wins wary admiration even from adversaries in some counties , you can go in , sit down and work out a deal within two minutes , said richard hurley , a criminal defense lawyer who has faced the prosecutor many times in court over the last 11 years it s not that easy in somerset i have had clients tell me they 'll sell drugs in middlesex county in a minute but they wo n't sell in somerset but mr bissell s tactics have also drawn complaints and two government investigations into his office with an unresolved federal civil suit against him and a federal investigation into his conduct , governor whitman has yet to renominate him for a third fiveyear term and although the state bar association does not publicize its recommendations to the governor , it has become widely known that the organization voted against his reappointment the county bar was in favor of his reappointment , said assemblyman christopher bateman , a somerset republican but somebody down in the state bar recommended that he not be reappointed that s almost unheard of for a sitting prosecutor the 48yearold mr bissell \( pronounced bissul \) , who has been serving as a holdover since his term expired on oct 28 , 1993 , is the only republican county prosecutor mrs whitman has not renominated rita manno , a spokeswoman for the governor , says there is no timetable for a decision lawyers and elected officials in somerset say they think the governor , who knows mr bissell from her days as a somerset freeholder , is simply waiting for the results of the suit and the investigation the lawsuit stems from the 1990 arrest of a warren township builder , james giuffre , on drugdealing charges involving 700 of cocaine under a law allowing the civil confiscation of a drug defendant s assets before conviction , mr giuffre deeded 174 , 000 in land to the county , and the property was later sold , for much less , to acquaintances of mr bissell s chief detective mr giuffre , who denies that he sold drugs , said he had been coerced into turning over the property , and is suing mr bissell and five of his investigators to recover it mr giuffre s lawyer , frank arleo , says federal prosecutors are investigating mr bissell s office and have asked the judge three times to postpone the start of the trial in the suit it is now scheduled for july though the most prominent , it is not the only case in which mr bissell has been criticized for seizing the assets of drug defendants somerset county is the 13th most populated county , but it ranks near the top in the amount of property and money confiscated an investigation by the state attorney general found no criminal misconduct by mr bissell in the giuffre case but in 1992 the attorney general s office issued more restrictive assetforfeiture guidelines to prevent what it called past mistakes by some lawenforcement agencies mr bissell who did not return phone calls seeking comments for this article but in the past , he has dismissed criticisms of his office as coming from drug defendants , all a bunch of of liars and thieves in recent months , he has not commented on the suit or his renomination , speaking in public only on cases , which have included three in a national spotlight the franklin township jewelrystore owner who fatally shot his wife during a botched robbery the bernardsville man who was arrested for taking nude photographs of his 6yearold daughter for an art class , and allegations that the television star kelsey grammer sexually assaulted a 15yearold girl in warren township \( mr bissell decided not to prosecute the jeweler the photographer , who vigorously denies that he did anything wrong , was allowed to take part in a 12month probation program and a grand jury declined to indict mr grammer \) assemblyman bateman says mr bissell has retained wide popular support despite his problems he s been very zealous in the prosecution of big cases , he said when you do a job the way he s doing it , naturally he s going to make enemies photo in the spotlight prosecutor nicholas l bissell jr at a news conference in february \( frank c dougherty for the new york times \)

three and a half years ago , as a 30yearold woman lay dying after being stabbed with an 11inch carving knife near central park , she lifted her head and identified her attacker , the prosecution told jurors yesterday in opening arguments in the murder trial of kevin mckiever yesterday in state supreme court in manhattan , jurors heard that as the woman , alexis ficks welsh , lay on the sidewalk , she told a neighbor who came to her aid who the killer was the assistant district attorney , john g martin , described a trail of witness accounts that he said pointed to mr mckiever s guilt , including one from a resident of west 69th street , where the attack occurred , who said she saw the stabbing from her bedroom window the defendant has pleaded not guilty to killing mrs welsh , a former rockette , on june 8 , 1991 the trial had been delayed twice when mr mckiever , 37 , was found mentally incompetent to stand trial he has since been determined competent mr mckiever s lawyers called the charges against their client , who is black , a case of mistaken identity and said that one black man looks like another on an allwhite block mr mckiever is forgoing an insanity defense despite a history of mental illness his lawyers , william m kunstler and ronald l kuby , have zeroed in on a palm print on the knife handle that does not belong to mr mckiever , as well as the point that none of the victim s blood was found on him the ferocity of the attack shattered the sense of security in one of new york city s wealthiest neighborhoods and raised questions about the way mentally disturbed people are treated by both the mentalhealth and criminal justice systems fifteen months before the killing , mr mckiever , who was known to have used crack cocaine , had served 30 days under a plea bargain for attacking a former neighbor with an ice pick just one month before the murder of mrs welsh , he had sought help from bellevue hospital s psychiatric emergency room but was sent away four hours later with the phone number of a cocaine help line in recent years , several other highly publicized cases have turned attention to failures to deal effectively with the mentally ill christopher battiste , a mentally ill homeless man , is now on trial in the murder of an elderly woman on the steps of her bronx church earlier this month , reuben harris , an escapee from manhattan psychiatric center , was arrested on charges of pushing a woman to her death under an oncoming subway train the prosecution in mr mckiever s case said that a neighborhood resident , bob pellitieri , heard the screams and within seconds was by mrs welsh , who lay with the knife still in her back the prosecutor told jurors that mr pellitieri saw a black man in a red parka the only other person on the street 15 to 20 feet away , walking calmly toward the park he asked mrs welsh if the man was her attacker , and she told him yes , the prosecution said another witness , patricia mulvey , watching from her bedroom window , saw a man in a red parka standing over ms welsh , his arms making a sawing motion , as if stabbing , although she did not see a knife , the prosecution said her eyes stayed on the man as he crossed the street and as another neighbor pursued him into the park and flagged a patrol car the police then picked up mr mckiever , clad in a red parka , his hand cut and bleeding the defendant was seen committing the crime and was never lost sight of , mr martin said the prosecution also revealed that the police found a homemade cardboard sheath in mr mckiever s satchel that fit the carving knife the prosecution dismissed the lack of mrs welsh s blood on mr mckiever although she was stabbed repeatedly , her arteries did n't rupture , mr martin said , and the length of the knife enabled him to avoid contact with her skin as for the lack of mr mckiever s fingerprints on the knife and the palm print on the handle , mr martin said doctors had to leave the knife in her body during surgery , sterilizing it with a solution , and that it was later handled by investigators but mr kuby , in his opening argument , said the palm print was later matched against 22 individuals who had contact with the body , from emergency medical technicians and doctors to detectives , as well as the victim , and that no matches were made the palm print belonged to the man who killed alexis welsh and who ran off in another direction , he said , while everyone s attention was directed at kevin mckiever , who walked slowly toward central park photo kevin mckiever is accused of killing alexis ficks welsh in 1991 \( associated press \)
washington , aug 15 about 800 people in west virginia , a state so ravished by waning factories and dying mines that it always leads the nation in unemployment , will be splitting 115 million from the maytag corporation of newton , iowa , which left them in the lurch when it closed a vendingmachine plant and opened a new , lowerwage factory in south carolina in one of the lushest settlements of a plantclosing dispute ever , some longtime employees at the plant , where maytag built cocacola vending machines , stand to get more than 100 , 000 in west virginia , that buys a car and a goodsized house with a pool some newer , young workers will receive less than 10 , 000 early this month , the big appliance company agreed to settle a class action brought by workers at the plant , who said that maytag broke years of promises to keep its plant and workers in the little city of ranson in eastern west virginia the 165 million settlement , of which lawyers will receive 5 million , came after three days of the first of three trials , which were expected to last six months judge david h saunders of the jefferson county circuit court approved the preliminary agreement today , leaving only a hearing for workers on the fairness of the settlement , scheduled for october i think we all feel very good about it , said joann henry , 62 , who earned 1145 an hour as a machinist at the plant and who now works in a liquor store it s like the little person really tried hard , and the little person won the workers did not claim that maytag had violated the federal plantclosing law four years ago when it closed the ranson plant and moved production to williston , sc maytag had given workers the required 60 days notice but the workers argued that the company had broken its years of promises they lied , said nancy fritts , another plaintiff who earned 1435 an hour installing wiring in vending machines mrs fritts , 45 , and her husband , gary , 48 , who lost his job at the plant , too , used to drive seven miles to work now they drive 30 miles to jobs at an automotive brakeshoe plant that pays them 1256 an hour when a manager tells you , you ai n't going no place , she said , you believe them the company fought back there was a perception on their part that we had promised not to close the plant , said tom schwartz , spokesman for maytag they interpreted things we said to imply lifetime employment a lawyer for the company , roger a wolfe , said the settlement was simply a question of risk avoidance maytag maintains very strongly that it did not do anything wrong paul c sprenger of washington , the lead trial lawyer for the workers , called this the biggest classaction settlement ever of a factoryclosing lawsuit but despite the big numbers , the case was , as the worker said , pulled off by the little guys none of the usual big institutions a government agency or a labor union took part just one worker , victor roberts 3d , decided to fight the company in may 1991 , when it disclosed its plan to close that july mr roberts went to paul g taylor , who had just finished law school at the university of richmond and begun practicing in martinsburg , wva mr taylor filed a suit on mr roberts s behalf an item about the case appeared in a local newspaper and then others started calling it got to where i was speaking with hundreds of people , mr taylor said another lawyer , christopher janelle , joined the case in 1992 after graduating from the same law school they refiled the case as a class action maytag , too , started small , using local lawyers but then it turned to jackson kelly , the state s biggest law firm i knew they could overwhelm me in paper and wear me down , mr taylor said so three months ago , when he came across a mention of mr sprenger in a law journal , he turned to his firm , strenger lang the issue in the case was the workers' 14 claims of breach of contract and misrepresentation west virginia , like many states , gives employers freedom to hire and fire at will , without explanation but the employmentatwill prerogative can be modified by assurances of job security , and mr taylor said maytag made many in the year before the closing , maytag began remodeling a plant in williston to make vending machines there , it would pay 900 workers an average of 7 an hour , 6 less than in ranson the workers' lawyers say the company said it wanted to expand production and would operate both plants but in october 1990 , it laid off 150 workers , and people started to worry at periodic plant meetings , however , management assured the workers that the rest of their jobs were safe , the lawyers said the company s employee handbook also was phrased in a way to imply that if workers followed the rules , their jobs were safe the first of three trials , two on the claims , one for damages , had entered its third day when the company proposed the 165 million settlement mr sprenger speculated that his plan for his next witness helped bring the company around he had taken a fourhour videotape deposition of leonard hadley , maytag s chairman and chief executive what mr hadley would say , mr sprenger would not disclose we were going to play it on bigscreen tv , he said
under rules that took effect jan 2 , the drives in central park are closed sometimes and open the rest of the time or is it vice versa \? to some , the park s rules seem to change daily and by whimsy willie bly , managing director of the league of mutual taxi owners , said , my men keep coming in here and saying , 'willie , it s ridiculous , what can we do \? ' in fact , access is a little hard to pin down , partly because the rules have changed over the last two years , and partly because of human error and sabotage in the last gasp of the dinkins administration , when the parks department decreed that summer closing hours , which are stricter for cars , would be enforced from january until midnovember for the remaining month and a half the holiday season the park would be open to traffic continuously this is only the second january in which the summer rules apply , and many people have n't had the chance to adjust for the record for the moment the rules say this the drives are closed to traffic from 10 am to 3 pm and 7 pm to 10 pm on weekdays , and all weekend but there s a longstanding hitch park workers can be late in moving the barricades and carhaters sometimes move barricades to block off drives when they 're supposed to be open with reconstruction on columbus avenue clogging traffic on the upper west side , drivers and passengers are increasingly frustrated we love the park , and we ca n't use it , mr bly said it s like somebody being given a toy and told , 'do n't play with it' the parks commissioner , henry j stern , agreed that the system has kinks he said he is considering a new system of automated gates that would create greater punctuality and flexibility in park closing hours , but that no changes are imminent we 're constantly getting suggestions for alterations of the clock for specific hours , but when you change it , it stirs up too much of a fuss , he said harriet williams , vice president of the new york road skaters , said the more closings , the better we are drafting a letter to the mayor to ask that the park be closed for additional hours in the early morning , she said our position is that people bike and skate all year long they do , depending a parks department survey this month arrived at the nonetoosurprising conclusion that recreational use of the park was tied to the weather if it s a rainy day in winter , there s nobody using the park , there s incredible congestion on the street , and there s nobody on the park drives , mr stern said the problem is , how do you adjust the schedule for each day \? jennifer kingson bloom map of central park
just this year , interscope records has ushered into the mainstream three upandcoming rock acts the british grunge band bush , the taut , postpunk toadies and the blueeyed pop group deep blue something and none of them are controversial , ted field , the label s owner , says with a chuckle but it is interscope s gangsta rap roster that has drawn the most attention to the fiveyearold los angeles label several of the rappers have had legal troubles , including snoop doggy dogg , whose murder trial just opened in los angeles last may , william j bennett , head of the conservative group empower america , and c delores tucker , chairwoman of the national political congress of black women , began pressuring interscope s financial partner , time warner , to dissociate itself from the label singled out were rappers like dr dre , tupac shakur \( a k a 2pac \) and snoop dogg , who , mr bennett and ms tucker say , produce music with vulgar and misogynistic lyrics that glorify violence and promote it among children \( technically , these rappers are on an independent label , death row records that is distributed exclusively by interscope interscope includes death row s in its own sales figures \) in september , time warner severed ties with interscope by selling its 50 percent stake back to mr field and the label s president , jimmy iovine , for a reported 115 million controversy seemingly has n't hurt sales of the latest rap release from death rowinterscope , tha dogg pound s dogg food , which entered the billboard chart on nov 18 at no 1 , though it had fallen to no 11 by last week still with lyrics on its hit single , let s play house , like i play the daddy and you can play the momma so we can get down upon the living room floor , it is conceivable that some parents may be disturbed by them while lyrics may have been the most obvious cause of controversy , interscope s executives acknowledge that its management philosophy may have also contributed to it our charter was to make deals with people that we really respect and give them complete and absolute control over their lives , mr iovine says we felt that if we did that , that we would bat really high as such , the death row deal was business as usual for interscope it currently has similar arrangements with the labels for nine inch nails , teddy riley and bush its management style apparently did n't endear it to time warner michael j fuchs , who was the chief executive officer of the warner music group when it parted ways with interscope , says that while interscope delivered the kind of cuttingedge music it promised , time warner became increasingly unwilling to defend music its executives had not signed off on both mr field and mr iovine are undeniably passionate about the music they produce , yet neither had any experience as a label executive before joining interscope mr field , 42 , an heir to the marshall field retail fortune , made his mark in real estate and in hollywood his film production company , also called interscope , was responsible for 80 s hits like outrageous fortune and three men and a baby in 1990 , he created interscope records as a joint venture with warner music s atlantic group one of his first hires was mr iovine the son of a brooklyn longshoreman , mr iovine , who is also 42 , made his name as a music engineer and producer for the likes of bruce springsteen , tom petty , patti smith and u2 in the 70 s and 80 s i 've been in a room with the real thing , he says i know what it smells like from the outset interscope operated differently than most record companies instead of putting lawyers and promotion people in charge , interscope gave decisionmaking authority to artists , producers and those who sign talent it never had a head of marketing to shape careers the label allows artists to market themselves i really wanted to throw out the rule book as far as what other people in the record business believed was the right thing to do with a record label , mr field says although interscope s first success was rico suave , a novelty hit by the hispanic rapper gerardo , it soon established its reputation as an industry firebrand les claypool , the singer and bassist for the wry jazzrock trio primus , which early on signed with the label , says the group was looking for a record company that had broader distribution than the small independents it had worked with previously but was unwilling to sacrifice creative control in return because of interscope s handson approach and its ties to time warner , he says , we were getting the best of both worlds when most major labels had trouble distinguishing two san diego bands , rocket from the crypt and drive like jehu , who shared one performer , interscope solved the problem by signing each act separately teddy riley , a 28yearold singer , songwriter and producer who had shepherded successful projects for michael jackson , bobby brown , and wreckxneffect , had been languishing at mca interscope considered mr riley a sure thing commercially and offered not only to release the 1994 debut album by his group blackstreet \( it sold 16 million copies \) but also to give him his own production company , life of riley to sign nine inch nails , an aggressive rock band also cited by mr bennett and ms tucker for its graphic lyrics , interscope offered the group an unusually large advance and its leader , trent reznor , his own label , nothing records , for which he may sign up acts independently as part of the deal , tvt , the band s previous label , received a generous profitsharing arrangement
fourteen people charged with welfare fraud have been in jail for more than a week without a bail hearing or legal representation because of a series of legal missteps , legal aid lawyers said yesterday legal aid lawyers sought their release yesterday , saying the defendants mostly women on welfare had been improperly arraigned without defense attorneys present in addition , the lawyers said , the defendants were denied a chance to seek bail until as late as the end of the month so the court could check their criminal records and assign lawyers acting supreme court justice arlene silverberg ordered prosecutors to bring to court on monday those defendants who have yet to meet with their attorneys or have a bail hearing even the judge who presided over the initial arraignment last week acknowledged that the defendants had remained in jail far longer than they should have but he blamed courtappointed private lawyers for not moving swiftly in seeking bail hearings for their clients some of them may not make bail when it is ultimately set , said acting justice herbert adlerberg of state supreme court but they are entitled to bail of some amount all things being equal , the system did fail to that extent the 14 defendants were among scores of people charged in a vast welfare fraud scheme in which the authorities say three city welfare clerks programmed computers to send out unauthorized payments totaling 22 million susan hendricks , the deputy director of litigation for the legal aid society , which usually represents indigent defendants , characterized the may 11 arraignment as an assembly line in which the defendants briefly appeared before a judge and were not fully informed of their rights what happened in this case is much closer to a star chamber , or a tribunal without jury , she said it s a scary thing to be arrested and held incommunicado like they have i find what happened to them is stunning defense lawyers not involved in the case said the court s behavior appeared to be unusual , especially if defendants were consigned to wait for weeks until a bail hearing it s odd that there was no defense lawyer there , ' said stephen gillers , a law professor at new york university who specializes in legal ethics it s odd that there was no bail set , it s odd that legal aid did n't step in and fill the void and it s oddest of all that this has remained in limbo for a week' a number of unusual circumstances in the case apparently contributed to the defendants' plight first , to prevent their flight , they were indicted before being arrested and were not aware of the impending charges they were taken directly to court for their arraignment , which meant that many had no chance to arrange for counsel before arraignment , and that the police had not taken their fingerprints or checked their criminal records where are they going to get lawyers at the drop of a hat like that \? justice adlerberg said i do n't have 24 lawyers in my hip pocket and even if i did , i could n't do it that way nor could he set bail until each defendant was fingerprinted and his criminal record checked , the judge said he had no choice but to schedule another hearing at which each defendant could seek bail and because there were so many , some were not scheduled for a new hearing until may 31 ms hendricks said legal aid had begun looking into the matter on word from prisoners' family members although her office was not representing the defendants in the criminal cases , they decided on principle to seek a speedier bail hearing it looks like something you hear of happening in another part of the world , ms hendricks said they were brought before a judge who committed them to custody without bail or a lawyer a spokesman for the manhattan district attorney , wayne brison , defended the initial arraignment as proper , adding that cases had been adjourned over a period of weeks through the end of the month so as not to swamp the judge who would hear them it had to be done when we got attorneys for them and to accommodate the court calendar , he said it s not that unusual to have cases that take that long to get attorneys assigned when you have a large number of defendants mr brison said the courtappointed lawyers have the chance to raise the question of bail immediately after they are assigned to their clients but according to legal aid attorneys , the courtappointed private lawyers routinely do not consult with their clients until the next scheduled court date and even where lawyers were appointed , some could not locate their clients during the hearing yesterday , one such lawyer entered the courtroom in the midst of proceedings , complaining that corrections officials had been unable to help him contact his client after a week none of the other private lawyers involved could be reached last night new york s system of using courtappointed private lawyers , rather than legal aid lawyers , to represent indigent defendants in some cases has been plagued by problems some lawyers have been criticized for shoddy work , inattention to clients or overloading themselves with cases in order to bolster their incomes ms hendricks said other defendants in the same case who had been able to retain lawyers on their own had already been released on bail or personal recognizance the people who are still in jail are the poor people , she said if somebody had n't said something it would have gone on for two more weeks the district attorney s spokesman as well as justice adlerberg said the courtappointed attorneys could have speeded up the process had they been more aggressive any lawyer worth his salt would have had this case advanced , justice adlerberg said i'm only one facet of the system the system is supposed to operate where lawyers are assigned the fact that no lawyer came forward and did the right thing is really not my fault

east meadow , li , april 28 long island s only public hospital , the nassau county medical center , could lose 25 million a year in state aid under gov george e pataki s proposed budget , putting new pressure on the county to sell or lease the hospital , county officials say the loss in aid would result from the governor s plan to cut medicaid costs by 12 billion health industry analysts said the county may soon discover that it can no longer afford the hospital or attract the patients of managed care providers that would help it pay its bills a onetime influx of 35 million in back medicaid payments helped the hospital balance its current 222 million operating budget , ending a string of deficits averaging 10 million a year since 1986 the positive result led county leaders to halt their search for a private nonprofit group to buy , lease or contract to manage the 615bed medical center , even though it was still costing county taxpayers about 17 million a year for capital and interest costs on its 60 million debt we received 14 separate proposals from interested parties , but we rejected all of those made for the hospital , said david a vieser , a spokesman for the nassau county executive , thomas s gulotta a little over a year ago , mr gulotta appointed a task force to consider takeover bids , not only for the hospital but also for the county s a holly patterson geriatric center and nine public health clinics in february , the panel concluded that none of the proposals for the medical center were acceptable except for a possible takeover bid for the freeport health clinic , one of the nine clinics , by a nonprofit group , mr vieser said the plan to sell the hospital appeared dead until governor pataki released his budget proposal for 1996 county officials were suddenly again faced with a medical center about to be overwhelmed by deficits mr gulotta sent a letter to the task force , asking it to review the possible impact of the proposed state budget and to determine whether a new search was warranted for proposals to sell , lease or manage the medical center , mr vieser said the committee met early last month but decided to hold off further action until the situation with the state budget had crystallized , mr vieser said mr gulotta , a republican , has not yet taken a position on the issue of privatization , but a number of democrats have expressed strong opposition among them is richard m kessel , who sought to oust mr gulotta as county executive in 1993 and made privatization an issue in his campaign i think that the whole notion of privatization is one that probably would not benefit the taxpayers of nassau county , said mr kessel , chairman of the long island power authority ultimately , it would result in lower quality medical services for the middle class among those waiting for albany to act is nassau health care system , a nonprofit group representing the 230 doctors who work at the hospital and one of the bidders for the medical center we 're the people who are already there and take care of all the patients who come to the door , said gary roth , a health care consultant and a spokesman for the group we 're all waiting to see how bad the cuts in state aid or going to be , mr roth said a key issue all along has been how to pay for the medically indigent population , which now costs the county 50 million a year as a private operator , we could better shift that cost away from the county back to the state and federal government , he said we would have access to a baddebt charity pool to which private hospitals all over the state must contribute to pay such costs the county has no access to that pool although the long island civil service employees association , which represents hospital workers , is opposed to the sale of the hospital , mr roth said that the transfer of tompkins community hospital in ithaca , ny , from municipal to private hands 14 years ago had gone smoothly and had been well accepted by the csea there we would use the successful negotiations with the union there as a model , mr roth said the union , however , remains adamantly opposed to any privatization of the hospital , said sheryl c jenks , a spokeswoman we do not believe that privateers can do it better or cheaper than county employees , she said and if there is more of a profit to be made , then the county should be doing that and keeping the hospital in house
the arrivals were grand ones , befitting an unprecedented confluence of world leaders sedan after sedan glided up to a whitetented entrance at the united nations , delivering presidents and prime ministers , who stepped inside and strode down a royal red carpet , past an honor guard of whitegloved officers , to receive a firm handshake or prim kiss from secretary general boutrous boutrosghali it was the epitome of quiet dignity , and could not have been more different from the hullabaloo a few hundred yards away , at the corner of first avenue and east 47th street there , thousands of protesters represented an alphabet soup of countries , waving a kaleidoscope of flags and presenting an encyclopedia of grievances with rawthroated roars this is amazing , said bruce soloff , who ventured out to walk his dog and stumbled upon demonstrations as vociferous , and a police presence as huge , as any he had ever encountered then again , this is new york as the formal sessions commemorating the 50th anniversary of the united nations began yesterday , many of idiosyncracies of new york city suddenly loomed larger than life , from its talent for pomp to its tolerance of protest , from its multiethnic energy to its labyrinthine traffic detours more than 140 heads of state and heads of government , along with their delegations , filed into the general assembly for the first of three long days of speeches by them president clinton was the first to step up to the gray marble podium , and although world leaders had just been reminded to keep their comments to 5 minutes , he was given extra time and spoke for 14 many others stayed closer to the time constraints , and the atmosphere inside the general assembly was orderly and subdued , as it was earlier during the taking of a group photograph of world leaders in a nearby room the photographer , paul skipworth , arranged the leaders on about five levels of a banked auditorium and used a special wideangle lens to fit all of them into the frame thrust into the awkward position of commanding the world s loftiest commanders to scoot an inch to the right or shuffle a foot to the left , mr skipworth adopted an almost apologetic tone and defended his painstaking approach i'm going to take four or five pictures , he explained , because i do n't know when i will get all of you together in the same room again this being the largest gathering of world leaders in history , the telltale signs and effects of it rippled through the city because it was a sunday , though , the street closings did not cause much traffic congestion , even in the early evening , when a slice of midtown was closed for president clinton s cocktail party at the new york public library police officers began arriving on the east side of midtown before sunrise , closed a broad swath of streets in the east 40 s and east 50 s to all traffic except official motorcades , and occasionally led bombsniffing dogs through the area as the sun rose over the east river , it illuminated a flotilla of more than 20 coast guard and new york police department vessels , some of which had been used to dispatch scuba divers to check for underwater security breaches above , helicopters kept vigil outside the waldorfastoria hotel , where 22 diplomatic delegations were housed , the scene looked like the opening ceremonies for the secret service olympics six indonesian security officers stood alongside a limousine , chatting with three agents from belarus two chinese agents fiddled with a walkietalkie under the watchful gaze of agents from india at one point , a man with a video camera approached four tall , darkskinned agents wearing doublebreasted suits and demanded that zaire s president be overthrown we 're from angola ! shouted back one of the agents brian f gimlett , who headed the secret service operation , said the opening day had gone better than we expected he said his agents had responded to several hotline reports about people who had expressed an unusual interest in particular leaders , but none proved to be legitimate threats detective dwight cunningham , a police spokesman , said there were no arrests by late yesterday afternoon elsewhere around the city both yesterday and on saturday , various immigrant groups bedecked meeting rooms , spread out banquets and commandeered restaurants for social events honoring individual world leaders for every party , however , there was a protest , so many that more than 100 police officers , many on horseback , dedicated their efforts solely to managing the crowds watching this boisteroius pageant , mr soloff , who was walking his dog , grew confused which group is that \?

seattle now the yankees have done it talk about shooting yourself in the foot lou piniella had no plans to use randy johnson as seattle s starting pitcher tonight in the third game of the playoff series against the yankees the mariners' manager had every intention of saving johnson for tomorrow s game , which would have been soon enough for the yankees to see baseball s most fearsome pitcher when a person has a toothache , he does n't necessarily run to the dentist right away a visit to the dentist can be worse than a toothache so he puts it off as long as he can having avoided facing johnson in the series opener because he had to pitch the playoff game that got the mariners to the postseason for the first time , the yankees should have left well enough alone they should have delayed their visit to the mariners' dentist as long as they could all they had to do was lose the second game , and johnson stays in the dugout and off the mound but nooooooooo , the yankees had to win the second game , and the mariners ca n't afford to lose another game open wide this guy s got great stuff , the most dominating stuff in baseball , don mattingly said yesterday johnson , a 6foot10inch lefthander , was at his dominating best against the california angels last monday , retiring the first 17 batters and pitching a threehitter while striking out 12 it was that performance that catapulted the divisionchampion mariners into the playoffs against the wildcard yankees , but it was also that game that changed the complexion of the series we were all pretty happy when they had that extra game to play and had to use him , mike stanley , the yankees' catcher , said not to slight the other guys , but that s a big advantage not having the top pitcher in the league going at you twice if johnson had been able to start and win the first game , the yankees , at best , would be 11 with johnson in position to wield the drill a second time that would have made it mandatory for the yankees to win the other two games in the kingdome if johnson had been able to start , he himself said , referring to the pitching order , it puts people in a more comfortable position than where i think we 've been i would have liked to have been the guy , but it did n't work out that way at this point , it looks pretty huge , said david cone , winning pitcher in game 1 that playoff game could be the difference but if he comes back and beats us friday night , that s a momentum swing for them and this series could change in a hurry piniella , looking to give johnson an extra day of rest , had been willing to gamble that the yankees would win the third game against tim belcher and take a 21 lead but johnson has pitched only slightly less effectively this season working with three days' rest instead of the customary four or more the playoff victory over the california angels was the sixth game he had pitched with abbreviated rest he has won four and lost none , compiling a 278 earned run average and a strikeout ratio of 117 per nine innings in his other 24 starts , johnson had a 240 era and a 125 strikeout ratio his teammates easily noticed that johnson turned up his performance a notch against the angels can he do it again \? do i have any choice \? johnson said , answering a question with a question early yesterday morning but , he said it s not a pressure game by any means , but it s a game if we do n't win , obviously we 're done some people look at that as pressure i do n't i just have to rise to the occasion and pitch well what s the worst that s going to happen if i do n't \? is everybody going to hate me if i lose \? if this was a perfect world , i would 've pitched against cone that would 've been a good battle but that s the way it goes as he was in the first game , johnson was a mere spectator in the second game that role was n't as rewarding as pitching , but he liked it nevertheless , even though the yankees won for a person who s never been in the playoffs , he said , i think that was everything i anticipated great plays , home runs , great pitching , a lot of theatrics i enjoyed it i was down at the end of the dugout near where lou was he goes , 'this is pretty exciting' it was extremely exciting that play with fernandez and velarde , where they did the shuttle pass the wade boggs play at third base that s exciting stuff johnson would have been even more excited if the mariners had tied the series in the wednesday night game that ended yesterday morning i think it would have been good for my arm , he said , but at this point it does n't matter i'm going to be pitching on adrenaline so we 'll see what happens the yankees should be thankful that s all he s pitching on they may want to try playing on novocain

linguists and experts on american dialects generally agree that new york , among its many claims to excess , appears to be the most foulmouthed city in the nation , rivaling only prison and the armed forces in its penchant for profanity the evidence is only anecdotal , but from the floor of the new york stock exchange to the schoolyards of the bronx , the tshirt word resounds so frequently that many natives fail even to register it as a curse life in new york is so much trouble that we need some expletive to fill the need , said leonard r n ashley , an english professor at brooklyn college who has studied the language of the city s underclass there s a kind of operatic aspect about life in new york the plot is unbelievable and the characters are exaggerated and the language has to rise to express this the city , boiling over with the stress of highpressure jobs and tootight living , inspires profanity , linguists say at the same time , its shrugging tolerance for all kinds of behavior and the anonymity its residents feel provide an atmosphere where expletives multiply unchecked the anonymity allows you to curse without fear of retribution , said timothy jay , author of cursing in america there are still parts of the country with small communities and standard christian values where people are intolerant of it you can go into restaurants in the south , in ohio and in massachusetts and see signs saying , 'no profanity' but in new york city , even if listeners are acquainted with foul talkers , they tend not to object , said prof william stewart , a sociolinguist at cuny there s a whole level of permission for swearing in the city , he said the people who do n't swear do n't censure the people who do there s a high level of overtolerance in the city for a lot of things the bigger a city , the fouler its language , linguists say but new yorkers the constituents of a mayor who likes the slogan we can kick your city s ass add new dimensions to tough talk unsuspecting visitors are often shocked by the language prescribed on the tshirt despite previous exposure to dirty talk from gangsta rappers and characters in film and fiction i have never heard more people say it , said suzanne dieter , a senior at columbia university i was struck by it when i moved here from baltimore it was always a very taboo word in baltimore i mean , it was n't a taboo among youth , but you never heard grownups use it new york s tolerance for gutter words represents an intensification of the increasingly widespread use of profanity across america over the last generation and its resulting loss of punch , linguistic experts say even that ultimate fourletter expletive from the tshirt has largely lost its sexual meaning and much of its shock value , particularly for new yorkers , said prof lewis allen , author of the city in slang it s become just an intensifier , you know , like shucks and golly and darn that people used to say , he said and its ing form , he added , has become for many simply a substitute for very as a sign that the word has lost much of its effect , professor ashley pointed to its disappearance in slum and bathroomwall graffiti it was supposed to shock people , but since it wo n't shock people anymore , it s no use , he said so you put up , soandso loves somebody' again profanity has become more commonplace all across america since the movie industry got its rating system in the late 1960 s and onscreen expletives in films for adults began to multiply they now average about 70 or 80 per film , mr jay said the vietnam war and the classleveling ideology of the 1960 s brought speech patterns formerly considered lowerclass to the educated class , and the feminist movement led to the spread of oncemacho cussing among women , linguists say they also point to the increasingly casual style of american life professor ashley said some sneakerwearing students reach college age never having owned a pair of leather shoes some relatively profanityfree bastions remain most newspapers and radio stations with notable exceptions allow virtually none of what the federal communications commission considers the big seven swear words but overall , americans across the board tend to be much freer with foul language than a generation or two ago , and new yorkers stand out as having some of the loosest lips around one additional reason the city may bring out the expletive in people is the highpressure environment of its workplaces , be they in high finance , television or supercompetitive retail , linguists say
pittsburgh , oct 25 first on his schedule today was a quick call to a local radio station , so when michael a stegman got off the plane from washington this morning , he dashed for the nearest pay phone in a moment , he was back , standing in the middle of the terminal the number they gave me was disconnected , he said if it was an ominous sign , the assistant secretary of housing and urban development ignored it eager for his first appearance , mr stegman left the pittsburgh airport for duquesne university to give a speech , explaining how severely the clinton administration thinks the proposed republican budget cuts would affect families and children it is a message the administration has decided americans this week need to hear and need to hear with highlevel clarity with the house moving closer to passing a budget bill and republicans standing firm on their intent to close the deficit in seven years , the administration is dispatching cabinet members and two dozen other highranking officials around the country to preach the gospel of republican budget folly through public appearances and media interviews their itineraries includes big cities like miami , philadelphia and new york and smaller ones like utica , ny , des moines and lincoln , neb they are visiting hospitals , schools , community centers and newspaper offices , and the message is the same the size and speed of the republicans' cuts would devastate the health care , education and housing programs on which millions of american children depend the strategy has been used before by the white house , to garner support for major initiatives , like the north american free trade agreement , the clinton healthcare plan and the assaultweapon ban legislation but as mr stegman learned over his several hours here today , it is one thing to trumpet administration views , and quite another for them to be heard while other administration officials have played this week to larger audiences and wider coverage , mr stegman , the assistant secretary for policy development and research , found himself caught in a nexus of hasty planning and bad luck with plans to send out administration surrogates completed only last friday , mr stegman made both of his appearances before largely sympathetic audiences , at duquesne and a nearby community center , with only modest media coverage and with no senior local elected official accompanying him both mayor tom murphy , who had joined another hud official delivering the same message here on monday , and william j coyne , who represents pittsburgh in congress , were in washington today i got the call wednesday night , asking if we could put something together , said g evan stoddard , duquesne s associate dean for the college and graduate school of liberal arts he professed to being slightly embarrassed about what greeted mr stegman in the small auditorium , maybe 100 students , half of whom left in the middle of mr stegman s speech they had an 11 o'clock class , mr stoddard said , shaking his head nor was the room overflowing with representatives from the local news media none of the city s television stations were present after lunch with duquesne officials , many of whom work with the school s community programs that have been expanded with hud grants , mr stegman delivered his same somber assessment of the republicans' plans to a group of 20 at the hill house association , an innercity community center by midafternoon , mr stegman was heading back to the airport for a flight to washington , satisfied , he said , that he made his points but uncertain how much impact they might have had in terms of what can be expected by families and children , i was able to do a reasonable amount of reaching out to the public , and i'm pleased with that , he said how many people will get the message \? that s a tougher question photo at a meeting in pittsburgh yesterday , michael a stegman , secondfrom right , an assistant secretary of housing and urban development , talked with ralph proctor , executive director of the kingsley association , a human services agency , as darnell hopkins got a hug from a friend mr hopkins had just told mr stegman how he had benefited from a program threatened by republican budget cuts \( steve mellon for the new york times \)
concussions are down , shoulders are up that s the conclusion to be drawn so far from the national football league s attempt to provide its quarterbacks with more thoughtful care and feeding this season boomer esiason of the jets is the only quarterback to miss a start because of a concussion he missed five john elway of the denver broncos and rodney peete of the philadelphia eagles were knocked woozy , then were sanctioned by their team doctors to return the following sunday but nine quarterbacks , notably steve young of the san francisco 49ers , have suffered serious shoulder injuries , partly because of the nfl s reaction to last year s concussions quarterbacks are still being taken down in ways that are unnecessary , but legal , said gene washington , the nfl director of player development who is also its dean of discipline when they 're driven into the ground , that s when their shoulders can go once the ball is in the air , there s nothing a pass rusher can do to affect that pass , but some try to punish the quarterback unnecessarily that s the mindset we 're going to have to change it s a mindset for mayhem , sometimes a coach s mindset as much as the passrusher s hit that quarterback put him on the ground , or on the carpet when that happens , a quarterback s shoulders are vulnerable young will start against the st louis rams today after having missed five starts since his throwing shoulder was unhinged by tony mccoy of the indianapolis colts heath shuler will finally return as the washington redskins' starter today after having been crushed by clyde simmons of the arizona cardinals in the opener glenn foley \( jets \) was lost until next season after suffering a dislocated shoulder when leveled by aaron jones of the new england patriots jeff hostetler \( oakland raiders \) , slammed by chad hennings of the dallas cowboys last sunday , wo n't play tomorrow night drew bledsoe \( patriots \) and stan humphries \( san diego chargers \) each missed one game chris chandler \( houston oilers \) , john friesz \( seattle seahawks \) and paul justin \( colts \) also have had damaged shoulders none of the pass rushers was penalized , but bryce paup later was fined 12 , 000 because justin was deemed to have been virtually defenseless when the buffalo bills linebacker descended upon him that s the passrushing philosophy that the nfl competition committee needs to address with a tighter rule interpretation , just as it tightened the rules this season on blows from the crown or face mask of a tackler s helmet to a defenseless player s head in enforcing that rule , 10 different players have been fined up to 12 , 000 for illegally assaulting a quarterback hardly a nocrime area , but there have n't been any repeat offenders yet greg lloyd complained that the game would be changed , washington said , referring to the pittsburgh steelers linebacker who was fined 12 , 000 for mugging green bay packers quarterback brett favre in the preseason but the game has n't changed that s the problem no other game resembles a hospital emergency ward with athletes stretched out , then helped to the sideline or carted off life s like that in the nfl , especially for its marquee men quarterbacks pass rushers ca n't be expected to swerve away in midair , but they often have time to pull up unless you 're out there , esiason said recently , you do n't understand how ferocious and violent and what velocity the game is played some teams are not advocating injury , but they are advocating violence no other game is played that way by the nature of pro football , it s open season on quarterbacks and it always will be only 15 of the 30 teams have had the same quarterback start every game so far this season but the survivors are sore , if not battered the giants' dave brown , for example , is wearing a knee brace he has also had a sore shoulder and a sore jaw every quarterback is only a mindset away from the xray room or the operating room , a mindset that needs to be changed before quarterbacks are an endangered species photo steve young \( associated press \)
grozny , russia , nov 21 there was actually a time this summer when malkha agayava thought she might die in peace the nights grew quiet in her mortarscarred , eighthfloor apartment she found a man willing to carry water up the broken stairs each day the red cross fed her , and the dull ache of fear started to fade away then the war came back first it came back at night , the deep rumble of artillery shaking her awake then it came during the day , with car bombs and daring attacks on the guard posts of sadeyed , frightened russian soldiers now it is here all the time , and like many people in chechnya , the 72yearold mrs agayava believes that it is back for good there is going to be no end until we are dead , she said , large tears welling up in her dark green eyes the russians will never leave , and we will never let them stay i thought everyone was tired of all the killing but in chechnya nobody ever gets tired enough to stop it is a dark view , but history , both recent and distant , seems to bear her out a year after 40 , 000 russian troops rolled brutally into this secessionist southern republic , chechnya has become a cynical , desperate land , a place only of fear , anguish and broken promises despite many ceasefires and one peace treaty , the fighting particularly in the small villages outside grozny where rebel soldiers often seek shelter grows worse by the day the region is run by a political puppet , doku zavgayev , installed by moscow he is despised , but so , increasingly , is his rival , the man who calls himself the president of chechnya , gen dzhokhar m dudayev russia plans to hold parliamentary elections on dec 17 , and because moscow nearly destroyed chechnya to keep it in the country , that means that there will be elections here too but representatives of mr dudayev s selfdeclared government have made it clear that they will not welcome the elections and that the vote will only bring more death to the ravaged cities and mistcovered hills of the region they signed an agreement that only we have honored , said shirvani basayev , the senior rebel commander in the mountain region of vedeno , where the hills echo constantly with mortar fire and where men often wear bandoliers strung with bullets there can be no possibility of a free or fair election here mr basayev s brother , shamil , led the most infamous raid of the war , a guerrilla assault on the southern russian town of budyonnovsk on nov 23 , mr basayev struck again , directing reporters from his mountain hiding place to a radioactive container buried in moscow s izmailovsky park , and threatening to explode other containers if the war continued after a year of war and tens of thousands of casualties , there is still no government strategy for ending the most violent conflict on russian soil since world war ii president boris n yeltsin and his defense minister , gen pavel s grachev , often voice contradictory strategies in the same week one day mr yeltsin speaks of granting chechnya a special status within the russian federation that would give the people here autonomy the next day , mr grachev says there is only one way to end this war with guns when my nephew went to war last year , he told us all he hated dudayev , said javus z akhmadov , the minister of information for the moscowbacked government here he said 'i hate him because he made me poor he stole my future but i just cannot support the russians i would rather die fighting them than live with this' three weeks later the nephew got his wish in the last year , filled with grand words , big meetings and picturesque displays of weapons being destroyed , only one thing has really changed here the lives and outlooks of the people where once they stood defiant on the broad boulevards of grozny , they now live in blackened buildings surrounded by roads carpeted in spent shells , twisted metal and rags both for the naive russian soldiers and the fiery chechen militants , the swaggers are gone , replaced by the stiff gait of reality with winter rushing on , there is little food for either civilian or soldier tens of thousands of homes remain in ruins , more than 15 , 000 people still live in basements , and only a third of the city has heat or electricity money promised by moscow for renovation has already been withdrawn there is almost no running water outside grozny almost no village remains unscarred by the lethal bombing of the last year this is a very hard place to help people , said thierry dalimier , who runs the local office of doctors without borders , the belgian relief agency , which has been robbed four times in the last two weeks and like many similar groups , is seriously considering giving up on grozny there are chechen bandits who steal from us and russian soldiers who wo n't let us do our job obviously the only people who really suffer are all the innocent residents of this horrible city most days are quiet here the market , which sold only balls of string and candle wax in march , is alive again fish , chickens , car parts , even new sony trinitron 27inch televisions are on sale street disc jockeys play

the latest new york premieres from the san francisco ballet , presented on thursday night , are vastly different helgi tomasson s sonata , set to rachmaninoff s music , was an evocative dancedrama without a plot but with plenty of passion in its use of classical technique val caniparoli s lambarena , danced to a mixture of bach and african music , was an exuberant experiment that set off an audience ovation there was also a spectacularly danced performance of con brio , a neoromantic nosegay created by mr tomasson in 1990 it rounded out this third program of the company s season at city center \( 131 west 55th street , manhattan \) in an alltoobrief week , which ends with tomorrow s matinee , the san francisco ballet has shown off highly personal signatures from five working choreographers and an increasingly distinctive manner of classical dancing what is on view is , in the best sense , style without stylization an unmannered , vibrant classicism that explains why the san francisco dancers can work so easily with so many different choreographers and why these choreographers seem eager to work in a variety of genres con brio and sonata could not be further apart the first work alludes to the conventions of 19thcentury romantic ballet and uses the lilting italianate music of the 19thcentury ballet composer riccardo drigo \( denis de coteau conducted with brio himself here \) this outright divertissement has a 20thcentury twist it brings its two men into play as much as its three ballerinas in long tutus designed by jensjacob worsaae no longer does the romantic ballerina reign supreme instead , this exquisitely fashioned quintet becomes a chamber ballet that goes beyond its surface prettiness and that is because the choreography , sometimes more difficult than it seems , is intended to show off technical brilliance this season there are two engaging newcomers vadim solomakha , a baryshnikov lookalike from kiev , is a polished dancer who needs only to look more confident about his impressive unforced technique minghai wu , trained in shanghai , has a remarkable spring and textbookperfect style the women , joanna berman , kristin long and katita waldo , are less conventional , and they engage the heart with their breezy freedom in sonata , mr tomasson moves into a darker 20thcentury mood lea vivante has costumed the dancers in modern dress elizabeth loscavio is in white as the beloved of yuri possokhov , who wears a yellow shirt , while the rest of the cast is in black with vivid trim a high platform behind a transparent curtain at the rear is used by roy bogas at the grand piano and michael mermagen on the cello they play rachmaninoff s sonata for cello and piano \( 1901 \) , which has all the turnofthecentury angst of its time mr tomasson has said he created the ballet after the death of a female friend of his family the action onstage is nonetheless deliberately oblique , although it is clear that it is a flashback , with ms loscavio as the dead love recalled by mr possokhov amid a highly turbulent atmosphere this kind of meditative ballet could easily become a cliche but mr tomasson s choreography rides the shifts of the music with such sophistication that it is astonishing to realize that he has expressed so much emotional fervor through pure dance this is mr tomasson in full maturity as a choreographer , as he shows in the neoclassical pas de deux , danced to the sonata s third movement , dominated by the cello s melody ms loscavio , an eyeriveting dancer on all accounts , sinks from mr possokhov s embrace into three difficult slides into arabesque finally rolling up his back and over his neck , she floats out from his grasp the heroine s family , which includes sherri leblanc , jais zinoun and julia adam , is none too welcoming to mr possokhov , who comes naturally to his role of yearning hero but there are even more telling performances that show how dance values are expressive in themselves a competitive duet , possibly for two brothers , erupts with the bravura of two exciting dancers , david palmer and christopher stowell energy is even more basic to lambarena , which is led with stamina and sparkle by evelyn cisneros and features fine work from eric hoisington and stephen legate one can understand why the audience was turned on by the physical drive of the choreography and the brilliant colors of sarah woodall s costumes but essentially , this suite of eight sections merely reiterates its initial point an attempt to meld african dance idioms with ballet technique the dubious inspiration was a recording by a group called lambarena , for which pierre akendengue and hughes de courson mixed fragments of bach with african music photo elizabeth loscavio , david palmer , rear , and christopher stowell \( sara krulwich \)
green bay , wis on the giants' sideline tommy maddox was flipping a football , holding it , cuddling it under his left arm but he never warmed up although the giants have now generated only one touchdown on offense during their 03 start , coach dan reeves never even looked at his backup quarterback never even considered inserting him in yesterday s 146 loss to the packers i 've never felt a quarterback is like a relief pitcher , the giants' coach was saying now you have to have enough confidence in him , meaning the starter , and he has to have enough confidence in himself but would reeves consider inserting maddox as the starter instead of dave brown against the new orleans saints on sunday at giants stadium in a sorry showdown of two 03 teams that desperately need a victory \? he shook his head from side to side no , he said i just got over this game and you ask me about next week give me a break reeves s annoyance was understandable no coach wants to provide the ammunition for a public quarterback controversy that could divide the allegiance of the team , the fans and maybe even the coaching staff but if the giants do n't win next sunday , like it or not , their coach can expect more questions regarding maddox in the national football league , that s the nature of the beast in the giants' situation , that s the nature of an 03 start especially since reeves cut last season s backup , kent graham , to bring in maddox , once the denver broncos' firstround draft choice in 1992 , which was reeves s last season as coach there for now , at least , dave brown will apparently remain the giants' starter , for better or for worse and in the 03 start , it has been for worse if the giants lose to the saints , they wo n't have much hope of averting an 05 start because they will be in san francisco the next sunday against a packer pass rush , led by reggie white , that sacked him only twice but harassed him constantly , brown s numbers were mediocre again he threw 50 passes but completed only 23 for just 199 yards with 1 interception , by safety mike prior on a third and 20 at the packer 40 with only 24 seconds remaining when the giants needed a touchdown and a 2point conversion to force overtime but a touchdown seems all but impossible for this giants offense , especially when it needs one in losing three games to the cowboys , chiefs and packers by a combined 7923 score , the giants' only touchdown on offense came in kansas city , when brown hit on a 26yard touchdown pass on their opening drive but even that touchdown had an asterisk chris calloway was all alone in the end zone after cornerback dale carter fell down in looking at a quarterback s stats , some coaches first check his average yards per attempt otto graham s career average was 863 yards per attempt joe montana s was 752 yards brown s average of 516 yards is well below those even so , brown is still one of pro football s youngest starting quarterbacks although this is his fourth season , he s only in his second season as a starter and say this for him he does n't sound discouraged i 've been down this road before , he said , thinking of last year s sevengame losing streak during which graham was inserted as the starter after the sixth defeat i learned more in one year than some quarterbacks learn in three years i think i'm playing a lot better than i did last season during the losing streak it s just not showing up on the scoreboard brad daluiso s field goals were all that showed up on the lambeau field scoreboard yesterday until the packers' prevent defense helped the giants put together two tediously slow drives , each with four first downs , in the final quarter , the giants never produced more than two first downs during any of their 10 possessions in three of those possessions , they had none it s been hard for us to get more than two first downs at a time , mike sherrard said the type of offense we have , we need things to work perfectly and the giants do n't have many players who seem capable of performing perfectly after missing the chiefs' loss with bruised ribs , sherrard returned with 7 receptions but for only 74 yards herschel walker was used more often 6 receptions for 32 yards but only 3 rushes for 14 yards rodney hampton remained the workhorse , with 16 carries for 86 yards but in a game in which their defensive unit stormed packer quarterback brett favre , sacking him four times \( three by michael strahan \) , the giants' offense could n't produce a touchdown and until it produces enough touchdowns to win a game or two , dan reeves can expect to be asked about tommy maddox , the quarterback he brought in to be dave brown s backup

delhi , ny in 1955 , when he was 23 , david taylor watched his grandfather s 200acre farm in delaware county vanish beneath the rising waters of new york city s newly completed pepacton reservoir he had planned to take over the farm , and until last year had pursued a claim against new york city for the loss of the dairy business the claim , locked in 1950 s economics at 2 , 500 , had become virtually worthless now 63 , mr taylor has choked back the deep bitterness he feels toward the city 100 miles to the southeast in a remarkable turnaround , he and other farmers have become unlikely allies of new york environmental officials as they feverishly seek ways to keep the 19 upstate reservoirs clean mr taylor is helping administer a pioneer program , paid for by new york city but run almost entirely by farmers , in which farmers are finding ways to cut the flow of pollution and parasites from their pastures , milkhouses and barns into the reservoirs in recent years , federal officials have become concerned that new york s water , although still safe , is being significantly degraded by runoff from barnyards and faulty sewage treatment systems forged from the grass roots , the 352 million program is one of the nation s first field tests of the theory that local , flexible efforts to cut pollution can be far more effective than topdown , bythebook regulation it is also being held out by federal agricultural officials as a national model for urbanrural cooperation we 've proved that a city can sit down with a bunch of hill farmers and cut a deal , said dennis rapp , a former state agriculture official nobody believed that new york city , of all places , would be able to deal with farmers if it can be done here , it can be done anywhere for farmers , the incentive is an average of 75 , 000 per farm for improvements that cut pollution and , in most cases , improve production , like cement liners that keep the manure in barnyards and grassy buffers that absorb nutrients from animal waste as thomas hutson , a farmer from the cannonsville watershed , put it , we 've made some changes here that are not only an improvement environmentally , but hopefully will help my bottom line even more significant , perhaps , the farm program has become a major talking point in the negotiations among officials from new york city , the state , and upstate communities over the city s efforts to protect its water and avert a federal order to build a 6billion filtration system the meetings have been organized by michael finnegan , the general counsel to gov george e pataki , who has previously been viewed as favoring upstate development over the city s efforts to protect the watershed the talks are aimed at generating consensus by tuesday so that state officials can approve the city s water protection plan by a sept 15 deadline set by the environmental protection agency several participants in the meetings have said that the early success of the farm program has provided a crucial stepping stone for rebuilding trust between new york city and the watershed communities that , for generations , have felt bullied and betrayed the improbable partnership between city environmental officials and upstate dairy farmers nearly began as open warfare in september 1990 , under pressure from the epa , the city issued a 104page discussion draft of proposed revisions to its watershed regulations many rules focused on farms , which were seen as contributing a significant portion of the unwanted nutrients and intestinal parasites that have threatened water quality in recent years as soon as i saw page 27 , i knew it was going to put us all out of business , mr taylor recalled as he thumbed through a wellworn copy of the watershed plan he was taking a break two hours into a monthly meeting of the watershed agricultural council , the 21member body set up to accept city funds and dole them out for pollution prevention projects twenty farmers are on the panel with one representative from the city s department of environmental protection mr taylor is vice chairman grinning wryly , mr taylor pointed out the most untenable regulations in the 1990 draft , which forbade spreading fertilizer or storing manure within 500 feet of any spring or stream in delaware county , virtually every barn was built next to a stream in the past , milk would have been chilled in the running water and the green hills are laced with streams and pocked with springs the very water sources that attracted city engineers in the first place mr taylor , who keeps 120 dairy cows on 368 acres a few miles north of the reservoir that swallowed his grandfather s farm , asked county agricultural agents to help him assess how the rules would affect his property they put out red flags marking the forbidden zones i would have lost 39 percent of my cropland , mr taylor said other provisions gave the city the right to inspect private property , apparently without a warrant our own sheriff ca n't even do that , mr taylor said
fort lauderdale , fla , march 9 there are n't many places on the pga tour where a golfer from new jersey can feel right at home , where the prevalent local accent is heavily laden with traces of hackensack and bergen county , and where fans of the giants and jets are as numerous as those of the local team but weston hills country club is most definitely one of them so it was fitting today that jim mcgovern , born in teaneck and raised in oradell , where he lives now , strolled around the grounds here with one of the biggest galleries and shot the lowest number in the first round of the honda classic mcgovern , 30 , muscled his way through the gusting winds for a sixunderpar 65 , one stroke better than mark calcavecchia and two strokes clear of nick faldo , who won last week at the doralryder open , and dave barr of canada with some 20 friends and family members among a gallery of a couple of hundred , mcgovern birdied six holes and bogeyed none it was his lowest round in nearly a year \( since a 65 in the 1994 mci heritage classic \) and it came as a pleasant surprise to mcgovern i have really been putting poorly for about 10 months , said mcgovern , who has one pga tour victory , the 1993 shell houston open i 've really been struggling i putted bad on the west coast and bad last week on thursday and friday that kind of wears on you it can be especially annoying when , just two years ago , you were in the top 40 in putting on the tour , which is where mcgovern was but last year he slipped to 154th , and coming into this tournament he was ranked 148th something had to be done he decided to go back to the beginning i went back to step 1 , he said that means get over the ball , pick out one dimple , pick out the line , and stroke it it certainly worked for him today mcgovern started on the 10th hole and promptly made a 15footer for birdie after saving par at the next hole , he birdied the 530yard , parfive 12th with a chip and tapin after hitting a 3iron to the fringe in two he nearly holed a 6iron shot at the 14th and made the turn in three under a 25footer for birdie dropped at the fifth hole , a fourfooter went in at the seventh and a 10footer found the bottom of the hole at the eighth he took just 26 putts the turnaround means that mcgovern might have his mind back on his game he has been a little distracted lately his wife , lauren , gave birth to their first child \( daughter melanie sue \) on feb 5 jim s 30th birthday to reach home in time for the birth , mcgovern had to withdraw after three rounds of the att pebble beach , drive 110 miles to san francisco , catch the redeye to newark and hustle to the hospital with his brother jack at the wheel he arrived at newark at 7 15 am and melanie sue was born at 10 23 am , precisely 30 years and five minutes after her dad was born i wanted to be a dad before i was 30 , said mcgovern , who is one of nine children six brothers , two sisters she whiffed her tee time mcgovern is n't the only local favorite here this is the tournament where it really all began for mark calcavecchia , eight years ago he was a struggling 27yearold pro then , a paunchy kid with a teeth that veered off at angles that were as unpredictable as some of his tee shots when calcavecchia won the 1987 honda classic , it was like caddyshack without the laughs a local guy from west palm beach , who had caddied for a friend in the tournament the year before , comes from out of nowhere and beats payne stewart and bernhard langer by a stroke \? right send that one back to rewrite and come up with something a little more believable now , three ryder cup teams , six pga tour wins and 44 million in earnings later , calcavecchia , 35 , is trying to write a script of his own he has n't won since the 1992 phoenix open , which broke a drought of three years i want to get my name back up in those world rankings again and be a player to be reckoned with , he said mcgovern has the same idea and anyone who winds up on top of this world class leader board at the end of the day on sunday will have no trouble attracting notice anywhere in the golf world
first in his class a biography of bill clinton by david maraniss illustrated 512 pages simon schuster 25 there is a recurrent scene in first in his class , a new biography of bill clinton , that gives the reader a vivid glimpse of the president s ambition and political instincts as a young man , david maraniss reports , mr clinton assembled a cardboard box filled with alphabetized and annotated index cards listing the names and telephone numbers of classmates , professors , political organizers and other acquaintances who might be useful to him in a future political career while running \( unsuccessfully \) for congress in 1974 , mr clinton , mr maraniss writes , spent time each night combing through the file , placing telephone calls , and writing notes to friends who might help his campaign he would return to the file many times in the years to come by 1980 , when mr clinton lost a reelection bid for the arkansas governorship , the card file included more than 10 , 000 names each card , mr maraniss observes , recorded important interchanges mr clinton had had with the individual , and another row of dates noting when that person had received a letter from clinton or his aides known as a gtmy for glad to meet you by 1982 , the card file had been computerized , resulting in a sophisticated campaign machine that ran around the clock , churning out gladtomeetyou letters , fundraising solicitations , special letters for black supporters , for firsttime supporters , for teachers , for the elderly letters to friends of bill went out in an endless stream , mr maraniss writes indeed , the portrait of mr clinton that emerges from this biography is not one of a visionary leader or statesman , but of an indefatigable , instinctual politician , driven throughout his life to seek the approval of friends and strangers alike by now , of course , none of this is exactly news although mr clinton is only halfway through his first term in office , three other books on him or his presidency \( the agenda , by bob woodward , on the edge , by elizabeth drew , and highwire , by john brummett \) have already appeared in addition , countless articles including a pulitzer prizewinning series written by mr maraniss for the washington post in 1992 have chronicled and rechronicled his life and political career those newspaper articles by mr maraniss provided the basic armature for this book , though a curious shift in tone seems to have occurred along the way whereas the campaign pieces tended to stress the positive aspects of mr clinton s political stamina , ambition \( or sense of purpose \) and faith in the principle of reconciliation , first in his class often looks at those same qualities through a darker lens in his first few chapters , mr maraniss seems distinctly uncomfortable writing in the longdistance form of the book , doggedly describing mr clinton s feelings and other people s impressions of him without pulling the material together into a coherent pattern of meaning the second half of the book is decidedly less myopic , though its assessments can sometimes verge on the obvious for instance , mr maraniss concludes that the part of mr clinton that is indefatigable , intelligent , empathetic and selfdeprecating coexists with the part of him that is indecisive , too eager to please and prone to deception mr maraniss s attempts to situate the president within the larger context of the babyboom generation are highly simplistic , and his occasional efforts to wax poetic can result in unfortunate sentences like this one luck and fate always seem to appear at the edge of the road as bill clinton drives along his highway of ambition , two friendly hitchhikers , thumbs out , ready to be picked up for stretches here and there when other passengers appear less attractive when mr maraniss sticks to straightforward reporting , the results are decidedly better he sets down a minutely detailed account of mr clinton s convoluted dealings with the draft during the vietnam war , and he agilely demonstrates how mr clinton s tenure as governor of arkansas prefigured many of his problems as president , including a reputation for overly expedient decisions , a penchant for blaming others and a tendency to displease everyone by trying to please all the overall narrative , which ends with mr clinton s announcement in 1991 that he is running for president , is fairly comprehensive , though highly selective in its points of emphasis while considerable space is devoted to mr clinton s alleged marital infidelities mr maraniss writes that the clinton aide betsey wright was convinced that some state troopers were soliciting women for him , and he for them whitewater is dealt with only glancingly , and mr clinton s early friendship with lani guinier is shrugged off in a single aside along the way , mr maraniss enlivens his narrative with lots of casual anecdotes , the sorts of anecdotes that can seem , in retrospect , like epiphanic gestures mr clinton hearing that great men require less sleep than ordinary mortals and deciding then and there to sleep only five hours a night mr clinton shocked that a child has beaten him at pinball and staying up till 2 in the morning in an attempt to reclaim his record mr clinton driving himself and a friend to an important political meeting in arkansas and swerving wildly into oncoming traffic so intent is he on talking and gesturing what emerges most forcefully from first in his class is just how deliberately mr clinton went about fashioning his political career , just how willfully he set about fulfilling the great expectations placed on him by his mother and his early peers his pursuit of student office in high school and college his political apprenticeship in a variety of campaigns his stints at oxford and yale law school his efforts to maintain his political viability within the system throughout the debate over his draft history , and his assiduous cultivation of a growing network of friends , colleagues and potential supporters all of this flies in the face of the president s perpetuation of the myth , in mr maraniss s words , that his life progressed in a series of accidents and uncalculated events indeed , mr maraniss s suggestion that mr clinton embraced the notion of the permanent campaign \( a phrase first used by sidney blumenthal in his 1980 book of the same name \) during his second term as governor of arkansas might well provide an alternative title for this book the permanent campaigner , the eternal politician photo bill clinton in 1974 , when he ran unsuccessfully for congress \( gary settle the new york times \)
