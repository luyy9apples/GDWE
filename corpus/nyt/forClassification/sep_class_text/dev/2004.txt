president vladimir v putin flew to chechnya for a rare visit on sunday after a night of fierce rebel attacks in the republic that , according to official russian accounts , killed at least 30 people , including 12 federal and local security officers mr putin s trip , along with the fighting , came a week before chechnya is to hold an election to replace akhmad kadyrov , the president of the chechen republic who was killed in a bombing in may both events appeared intended to influence the outcome of the vote , another ambiguous milestone in the long , violent conflict there mr putin did not visit the capital , grozny , which was the scene of heavy fighting in several neighborhoods beginning saturday evening , but rather the cemetery where mr kadyrov is buried in the village of tsentoroi mr putin , dressed in black , appeared with alu alkhanov , the interior minister , who was chosen by the kremlin as its candidate and is expected to defeat the other six candidates to win the election in a fairly unsubtle display of support during the choreographed and televised meeting , mr putin praised mr kadyrov s legacy , promising to carry out all his good deeds and initiatives , and associated mr alkhanov with that effort mr putin spoke as his helicopter s engine continued running , and within hours he was back in sochi , the black sea resort where he is spending most of august given the intense secrecy surrounding mr putin s travels his trip on sunday was announced only after it ended the fighting on saturday night appeared coincidental but the kremlin s political and military strategy in chechnya , now focused on mr alkhanov , has done little to end the grinding violence and destitution in chechnya , which is entering a sixth year of war several groups of rebels struck in grozny and other parts of chechnya in what appeared to be coordinated attacks similar to , if less deadly than , the raids in neighboring ingushetia in june , in which nearly 100 people were killed the rebels attacked polling places and police headquarters in grozny , including one on minutka square , in the heart of the city , according to news agencies and official statements a convoy of interior ministry troops also came under fire as it tried to reinforce federal and chechen forces another attack was reported at a school that houses a polling place in samashki , west of grozny , for the voting next sunday accounts of the death toll varied and could not be independently confirmed a spokesman for federal forces in the region , maj gen ilya shabalkin , said 12 soldiers and police officers had died , along with at least 18 of the insurgents other reports cited higher figures , as well as deaths among civilians an official in chechnya told the associated press that more than 30 people had died , including civilians and 23 police or security officers russian officials played down the significance of the attacks , saying the rebels had failed to seize control of any buildings , as they had done for several hours in ingushetia in june before retreating with caches of stolen weapons but the raids underscored the ability of chechnya s separatist rebels to operate in force , even in the heavily militarized capital on sunday , even as mr putin visited tsentoroi , about 30 miles to the southeast , russian and chechen forces continued to search grozny for rebels involved in the attack in a statement on sunday evening , general shabalkin said the bodies of eight rebels had been found , while seven other rebels had been captured , along with weapons and ammunition the main road to ingushetia was closed general shabalkin s statement said helicopters had attacked a group of fighters in the hills the kremlin has rejected proposals to postpone the election , and there was no talk of delay after the latest raids the election has shaped up as a repeat of the one that elected mr kadyrov last october , which was widely viewed as being rigged none of mr alkhanov s opponents receive the attention of state agencies and news organizations , let alone that of mr putin mr kadyrov has become lionized in death , most recently in a featurelength profile on sunday night on one of the state television networks , rossiya , that included images of mr alkhanov

very few artists thrive in a vacuum they tend to gather in bands of likeminded individuals , many of whom are also artists josef and anni albers belonged to such a band the bauhaus , a legendary art schoolcumthink tank that flourished in germany between the world wars with founders and faculty members like walter gropius , paul klee , wassily kandinsky , mies van der rohe and lazlo moholynagy , the bauhaus helped establish the basic tenets of modern design and architecture but the alberses were also a band of two their marriage was a remarkable meeting of minds , souls and sensibilities that enabled each to sustain a long and fruitful career through the most turbulent of times taking separate paths , they pursued identical principles by different means their shared credo boiled down to the bauhaus catch phrase less is more , which they followed as devotedly in their lives as in their work josef and anni albers designs for living , an enlightening , quietly excellent show at the cooperhewitt national design museum , almost reverberates with a sense of this devotion it could be called the incredible fullness of less the exhibition , which was organized by nicholas fox weber , executive director of the josef and anni albers foundation , and matilda mcquaid , the cooperhewitt exhibitions curator , is the first to juxtapose the design works created by these two remarkable artists it is eyeopening josef is known primarily as an abstract painter whose glowing images of nesting squares presaged minimalism here you see the nesting tables with bright paintedglass tops that he designed in 1927 anni was the first designer to be given a solo show at the museum of modern art , in 1949 , and her textiles are not unknown but she has only recently begun to receive her due as the premier innovator , experimenter and conceptualizer of modernist textiles in her field , she stands as high as josef , if not higher using many littleseen textiles from the collection of the albers foundation , the selection here expands upon the retrospective held at the jewish museum in 2000 the cooperhewitt display includes handsome \( and durable \) plaid bedspreads designed for harvard dorms room dividers made of jute , cellophane and metallic thread and a nubby , intermittently transparent curtain fabric with a wavy pattern , a result of the unlikely combination of moir and boucl they met at the bauhaus in 1922 , arriving from markedly dissimilar places and seemingly headed in opposite directions she was a cosseted yet rebellious daughter of wealthy german jews from berlin , who was determined to be a painter but was deflected , at first unwillingly , into weaving \( despite the egalitarian fervor of his 1919 bauhaus manifesto , gropius closed most other courses of study to female students \) josef was born a catholic , the son of a house painter and general contractor near d sseldorf who taught his son an array of manual skills he worked in glass , furniture design and typography while at the bauhaus , and took up painting only gradually they married in 1925 and emigrated to the united states in 1933 , where josef taught painting and color theory , first at black mountain college near asheville , nc , then at harvard and finally at yale he died in 1976 at age 88 anni died in 1994 , at 94 their last home was a splitlevel ranchstyle house with white walls devoid of art , a living room with a few bauhaus prototypes and a kitchen table from sears with a white formica top their one indulgence was a mercedes there is , strictly speaking , no art in this exhibition , certainly no pure art everything has a purpose , an application in everyday life but the show is infused with a sense of aesthetics that creeps up on you with delicious stealth the objects here confirm that design can rise to the level of art , through formidable concentration on its own purposes , materials and techniques this is , of course , the signal lesson of the bauhaus it is a question of rigor and ruthlessness we are inclined to look at and think about things that have come into being through a process of unsparing care and thought the alberses possessed this kind of ruthlessness , an ability to think through a design to a solution that seems both inevitable and interesting , locked in yet still breathing \( josef designed bedside tables whose drawer and knobs face sideways , toward the bed s inhabitant \) at the same time , their work in design was inflected by their interest in painting , either thwarted or not yet realized the little foundglass reliefs that josef made at the bauhaus in 1921 are restrained riots of greens , yellows , blues or reds that announce his love of strong colors and diverging tones of the same hue his furniture introduces his faith in clear lines , crisp corners and simple geometry as strongly as his paintings he liked to use close , but different , tones of wood , especially evident in a monumental armoire made of contrasting surfaces of walnut and maple whose contrasting squarish and narrow doors are punctuated with a few somewhat large spherical pulls the examples of his furniture are few and unique none of his designs ever went into production the major pieces that survive were intended for the berlin apartment of close friends , fritz and anna moellenhoff , both psychoanalysts , who transported it to the united states in 1935 but he claimed to be the first modern designer to use bent wood , and his chairs may cause some reconfiguring of the origins of modernist design other pieces may also alter views of minimalist sculpture and furniture a boxy wall shelf from the 1920 s could almost be an early work by donald judd or robert morris , while some of josef s thinlegged tables and desks \( including one with a doubledecker top \) point directly to judd s furniture , examples of which are on view upstairs at the cooperhewitt anni , who cited paul klee as one of her primary influences , was an equally sensitive colorist , expert at contrasting shades and also at shifting weaving techniques so that one color could read as two as an extended vitrine of 24 textile samples suggests , she sustained over decades the ability to make handsome , restrained fabrics the different kinds of threads and weaving techniques involved can mesmerize when studied closely she had a genius for making every thread count and for making structure seem both intelligible and mysterious this is a teaching show in which learning is a pleasure , perhaps because the alberses' sense of form was implicitly , almost luxuriously didactic their designs prove that while form is clearest when it follows function , it also emanates from dozens of small decisions about structure , materials , scale and color form is the finale , the culminating chord , created by these choices looking at it is a matter of picking out the constituent notes , listening to each individually to gain a fuller appreciation of the whole josef and anni albers designs for living remains at the cooperhewitt national design museum , 2 east 91st street , manhattan , \( 212 \) 8498400 , through feb 27

a record surge of potential new voters has swamped boards of election from pennsylvania to oregon , as the biggest of the crucial swing states reach registration deadlines today elections officials have had to add staff and equipment , push well beyond budgets and work around the clock to process the registrations in montgomery county , pa , the elections staff has been working nights and weekends since the week before labor day to process the crush of registrations some 32 , 000 since may and counting today is the deadline for registering new voters in pennsylvania , as well as ohio , michigan , florida and 12 other states , and election workers will go on mandatory overtime to chip away at the thousands of forms that have been arriving daily to help in the effort , the montgomery office has also added 12 computers , 15 phone lines and 12 workers from other departments as well as one of the technicians whose usual job is fixing voting machines at the warehouse across the county line in philadelphia , overtime and weekend duty began in july to deal with what is now the highest number of new voter registrations in 21 years the office says it is still six days behind the flow , and the last two days have brought about 10 , 500 new registration forms at 204 , 000 , the number of new registrations has already surpassed that of the last big year , 1992 , which had 193 , 000 the vote was so close four years ago , people are now thinking , hey , maybe my vote does count , said joseph r passarella , the director of voter services in montgomery county al gore won in pennsylvania in 2000 by 204 , 840 votes officials across the country report similar patterns everything we 're seeing is that there has been a tremendous increase in voter registration , said kay maxwell , president of the league of women voters in the past , we 've been enthused about what appeared to be a large number of new voters , but this does seem to be at an entirely different level registration numbers are impossible to tally nationwide , and how many of the newly registered will vote is a matter of some debate but it is clear the pace is particularly high in urban areas of swing states , where independent democratic groups and community organizations have been running a huge voter registration campaign for just over a year the parties have been registering as well , with republicans especially active in critical states in an effort to counter the independent groups in cleveland , the cuyahoga county board of elections has spent 200 , 000 on temporary workers this year to deal with a wave of 230 , 000 new registrations , more than double the number in 2000 the number of registrations in tallahassee , fla , is up 20 percent since the presidential primary in march and st louis is reporting the largest growth ever in potential new voters we are moving toward having the largest number of registered voters in the history of st louis county , said david welch , one of the directors of elections las vegas added 3 , 000 to 4 , 000 voters a week in 2000 but is doing triple that this year , forcing the office to hire 30 additional workers the elections director said he was getting 3 , 000 new cards a day last week eight states reached registration deadlines over the weekend , although some allow voters to register in person for a while longer by the end of the week , registration will end in 31 states new jersey s deadline is today , new york s friday the registration deadline in connecticut , oct 19 six states allow registration on election day a coalition of nonpartisan groups called national voice announced last week a push for an additional 200 , 000 registrations in the last days project vote , the nonpartisan arm of the association of community organizations for reform now , which claims more than a million registrations in ohio , pennsylvania , washington and other states , planned to have its largest force of paid workers on the streets over the weekend registering people to vote these nonpartisan community groups , as well as democratic organizations like america coming together , have driven most of the increase , registration officials say in florida and ohio , republicans have mounted moderately successful campaigns that have increased registration in suburban communities , but the huge gains have come in areas with minority and lowincome populations in some of those areas in ohio , new registrations have quadrupled from 2000 president bush won in ohio in 2000 by 165 , 019 votes it is harder to say what is driving the registration increase in montgomery , which is still considered a republican town even though it went for mr gore in 2000 and bill clinton before that one of the wealthiest counties in pennsylvania , it has had a lot of new building in recent years but it also has workingclass communities and is about 10 percent minority , and the community organizations say they have worked hard to register people here some people registering have lived here for years but have not voted
early this year , the independent commission investigating the sept 11 attacks played four minutes of a call from betty ong , a crew member on american airlines flight 11 the power of her call could not have been plainer in a calm voice , ms ong told her supervisors about the hijacking , the weapons the attackers had used , the locations of their seats at first , however , ms ong s reports were greeted skeptically by some officials on the ground they did not believe her , said bob kerrey , a commission member they said , 'are you sure \? ' they asked her to confirm that it was n't airrage our people on the ground were not prepared for a hijacking for most americans , the disbelief was the same the attacks of sept 11 seemed to come in a stunning burst from nowhere but now , after three weeks of extraordinary public hearings and a dozen detailed reports , the lengthy documentary record makes clear that predictions of an attack by al qaeda had been communicated directly to the highest levels of the government the threat reports were more clear , urgent and persistent than was previously known some focused on al qaeda s plans to use commercial aircraft as weapons others stated that osama bin laden was intent on striking on united states soil many were passed to the federal aviation administration while some of the intelligence went back years , other warnings including one that al qaeda seemed interested in hijacking a plane inside this country had been delivered to the president on aug 6 , 2001 , just a month before the attacks the new information produced by the commission so far has led 6 of its 10 members to say or suggest that the attacks could have been prevented , though there is no consensus on when , how or by whom the commission s chairman , thomas h kean , a republican , has described failures at every level of government , any of which , if avoided , could have altered the outcome mr kerrey , a democrat , said , my conclusion is that it could have been prevented that was not my conclusion when i went on the commission while the commission was created to diagnose mistakes and to recommend reforms , its examination has powerful political resonance the panel has reviewed the records of two presidents , bill clinton and george w bush mr bush , who is in the midst of a campaign for reelection , said last sunday that none of the warnings gave any hint of the time , place or date of an assault had i known there was going to be an attack on america i would have moved mountains to stop the attack , he said in an intense stretch this month , the commission pried open some of the most closely guarded compartments of government , revealing the flow and details of previously classified information given to two presidents and their senior advisers , and the performance of intelligence and law enforcement officials the inquiry has gone beyond the report of a joint panel of the house and senate intelligence committee in 2002 , which chronicled missteps at the midlevel of bureaucracies urged on by a number of families of people killed in the attacks , the kean commission has used a mix of moral and political leverage to extract presidential communications and testimony among the new themes that have fundamentally reshaped the story of the sept 11 attacks are al qaeda and its leader , mr bin laden , did not blindside the united states , but were a threat recognized and discussed regularly at the highest levels of government for nearly five years before the attacks , in thousands of reports , often accompanied by urgent warnings from lowerlevel experts presidents clinton and bush received regular information about the threat of al qaeda and the intention of the bin laden network to strike inside the united states each president made terrorism a stated priority , failed to find a diplomatic solution and viewed military force as a last resort at the same time , neither grappled with the structural flaws and paralyzing dysfunction that undermined the cia and the fbi , the two agencies on which the nation depended for protection from terrorists by the end of his second term , mr clinton and the director of the fbi , louis j freeh , were barely speaking even when the two agencies cooperated , the results were unimpressive mr kean said that he viewed the reports on the two agencies as indictments in late august 2001 , george j tenet , the director of central intelligence , learned that the fbi had arrested zacarias moussaoui after he had enrolled in a flight school mr tenet was given a memorandum titled islamic extremist learns to fly but he testified that he took no action and did not tell president bush about the case during the clinton years , particularly at the national security council , the commission has found , there was uncertainty about whether the threat posed by al qaeda and mr bin laden justified military action much of the debate was provoked by richard a clarke , who led antiterrorism efforts under both mr clinton and mr bush and argued for aggressive action former officials , including an nsc staffer working for mr clarke , told us the threat was seen as one that could cause hundreds of casualties , not thousands , according to one interim commission report such differences affect calculations about whether or how to go to war even officials who acknowledge a vital threat intellectually may not be ready to act upon such beliefs at great cost or at high risk in the first eight months of the bush administration , the commission found , the president and his advisers received far more information , much of it dire in tone and detailed in content , than had been generally understood the most striking came in the aug 6 memorandum presented in an intelligence briefing the white house says mr bush requested titled bin laden determined to strike in us , the memorandum was declassified this month under pressure from the commission after referring to a british tip in 1998 that islamic fundamentalists wanted to hijack a plane , it went on to warn nevertheless , fbi information since that time indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks mr bush has said the briefing did not provide specific details of when and where an attack might take place mr kerrey said that mr bush showed good instincts by asking for the material , but said the call from ms ong , the flight attendant on american airlines flight 11 which crashed into the north tower of the world trade center in the day s first attack showed that the threats and alarms did not get passed down the line i do n't see any evidence that our airports were on heightened alert , he said a hijacking was not a bolt out of the blue the clinton response a growing priority , hamstrung by process throughout president clinton s eight years in office , law enforcement and intelligence agencies tracked al qaeda through a succession of plots in the united states and overseas the commission found new evidence that counterterrorism became a priority for the clinton national security team but the panel said the effort was stymied by bureaucratic miscommunications , diplomatic failures , intelligence lapses and policy miscalculations on the intelligence side , the commission discovered confusion about crucial issues white house aides believed , for example , that president clinton had authorized actions to kill mr bin laden , but cia officers thought they were legally permitted to kill him only during an attempt to capture him throughout the 1990 s , the panel found , law enforcement and intelligence experts , often in lowerlevel jobs , repeatedly warned that mr bin laden wanted to strike inside the united states the threat was plainly stated in documents disclosed by the commission one , in 1998 , was titled bin laden threatening to attack us aircraft , and cited the possibility of a strike using antiaircraft missiles another 1998 report , referring to mr bin laden as ubl , said , ubl plans for reprisals against us targets , possibly in us a 1996 review of a plot to blow up airliners over the pacific uncovered evidence of the qaeda interest in crashing a hijacked plane into cia headquarters in langley , va but the cia s efforts to thwart mr bin laden s network through covert action were ineffectual , the commission found the agency s issue station , which was set up in 1996 to hunt down mr bin laden , had a halfdozen chances to attack the qaeda chief , but each time agency higherups balked a plan to kill him in february 1999 was called off at the last minute because of concerns that he might be with a prince from the united arab emirates , regarded as a useful ally in counterterrorism , the commission reported president clinton tried diplomacy , but that too failed in 1998 , mr bin laden issued a public call for any muslim to kill any american anywhere in the world that april , bill richardson , the united states representative to the united nations , went to afghanistan and asked the taliban government to surrender mr bin laden to the united states simultaneous qaeda bombings in august 1998 at american embassies in kenya and tanzania galvanized talk of aggressive efforts , but brought no tangible results president clinton ordered cruise missile strikes against a terrorist training camp in afghanistan and a suspected chemical weapons plant in the sudan the missiles hit their intended targets , but neither mr bin laden nor any other terrorist leader was killed in december 1998 , mr tenet announced in a memorandm to his senior staff at the cia that they would henceforth be at war with al qaeda i want no resources or people spared , he wrote in practice , the commission concluded , mr tenet s declaration of war , which the cia director has frequently cited in his public testimony since the attacks , had little overall effect the federal bureau of investigation , the country s other principal counterterrorism agency , struggled to repackage the tools of an interstate crimefighting organization against a highly unconventional foreignbased threat to the united states one interim panel report described the fbi as a bureaucracy suffocated by outmoded rules and legal barriers that barred criminal investigators from obtaining intelligence data agents worked on an aging computer system that kept them from knowing what other agents in their own offices , much less those around the country , were working on some fbi analysts hired to assess terror threats were assigned to jobs entering data and answering telephones throughout the 1990 s , the bureau focused on investigations of specific terror attacks to bring criminal cases to court the most successful were handled by its new york office , whose agents were among the most knowledgeable in the world about al qaeda by late in the decade , the fbi recognized the need to improve its intelligence collection and analysis , but the report said that mr freeh had difficulty reconciling that with its continuing agenda , including the war on drugs as a result , the bureau s counterterrorism staff was thin on sept 11 , 2001 , only about 6 percent of the fbi s agent work force was assigned to terrorism in october 2000 , two qaeda suicide bombers in a small boat packed with explosives attacked the navy destroyer cole in the yemeni port of aden , killing 17 american sailors president clinton did not retaliate , but samuel r berger , mr clinton s national security adviser , warned his successor , condoleezza rice , that she would be spending more time on terrorism and al qaeda than any other issue the bush review alerts , but breaks in chain of command warned of the qaeda threat during the transition , president bush s national security team started work in march 2001 on a comprehensive strategy to eradicate the terror network but the effort seemed to plod ahead almost in isolation from the urgent notices by the cia most of the threat warnings , but not all , pointed overseas at the end of may , cofer black , chief of the cia s counterterrorism center , told ms rice that the threat level stood at 7 on a scale of 10 , as compared to an 8 during the millennium , the period around january 2000 in response , american embassies were warned to take precautions the state department warned americans traveling overseas the cia intensified operations to disrupt terror cells around the world mr tenet took his terror warnings directly to mr bush ms rice said that at least 40 meetings between the cia director and the president dealt in one way or other with al qaeda or the al qaeda threat mr tenet later said the system was blinking red , adding that no warning indicated that terrorists would fly hijacked commercial aircraft into buildings in the united states on july 5 , ms rice and andrew h card jr , the white house chief of staff , asked mr clarke to alert top officials of the country s domestic agencies let s make sure they 're buttoning down , ms rice said the faa issued threat advisories , but neither the agency s top administrator nor norman y mineta , the secretary of transportation , was aware of the increased threat level , said jamie s gorelick , a commission member , at a hearing last week on july 27 , mr clarke informed ms rice that the threat reporting had dropped but white house officials said that mr bush continued to ask about any evidence of a domestic attack in august , cia officials prepared a briefing about the possibility of qaeda operations inside the united states , including the use of aircraft in terror attacks the briefing paper was presented to mr bush on aug 6 at his texas ranch the memorandum , declassified on april 10 by the white house at the commission s request , included some ominous information it said that qaeda operatives had been in the united states for years , might be planning an attack in the united states and could be focusing on a building in lower manhattan as a target mr bush said the aug 6 report was not specific enough to order new actions i am satisfied that i never saw any intelligence that indicated there was going to be an attack on america at a time and place , an attack of course i knew that america was hated by osama bin laden that was obvious the question was , who was going to attack us , when and where and with what \? the president noted that the memo said the fbi had 70 investigations under way related to al qaeda in addition , the fbi had sent messages to its field offices urging agents to be vigilant thomas j pickard , the fbi s acting director from june to august , said he telephoned top agents to advise them of the threat but the commission found that most fbi personnel did not recall a heightened sense of threat from al qaeda the commission found several previously undisclosed intelligence reports to mr bush , vice president dick cheney and national security aides dating back to april and may , when the volume of warnings began to increase mr bush was given briefing papers headlined , bin laden planning multiple operations , bin laden threats are real and bin laden s plans advancing in august 2001 , the fbi and the cia came as close as the government ever did to detecting anyone connected to the sept 11 plot that month investigators finally made progress in the fractured effort to track down two men , khalid almidhar and nawaq alhazmi , who on sept 11 were aboard american airlines flight 77 , which crashed into the pentagon the cia had investigated the pair off and on since they had been seen at a qaeda meeting in malaysia in january 2000 but they were not placed on a state department watch list until aug 23 , after they already were in the united states moreover , the cia failed to tell the fbi s primary investigators on the cole case of a key connection between the two men and a cole suspect until after sept 11 no one apparently felt they needed to inform higher level of management in either the fbi or cia about the case , one commission report said in midaugust , after the arrest of mr moussaoui in minneapolis , the commission disclosed , mr tenet and his top deputies were sent a briefing paper labeled islamic extremist learns to fly but they took no action on the report the commission found several missed opportunities in the moussaoui investigation that might have detected his connection to a qaeda cell in hamburg , germany , that planned the sept 11 attacks a maximum us effort to investigate moussaoui could conceivably have unearthed his connections to the hamburg cell , one commission report said the report added that publicity about mr moussaoui s arrest might have disrupted the plot but such an effort would have been a race against time it was not until sept 10 that mr bush s national security aides approved a threephase strategy to eliminate al qaeda the plan , which was to unfold over three to five years , envisioned a mission to the taliban in afghanistan , where al qaeda was based increased diplomatic pressure and covert action military strikes might be used , but only if all other means failed
elizabeth , nj , sept 10 juan espinosa said he was relieved nine years ago when authorities asked him to wear a concealed recording device to help convict fellow correction officers who had brutalized 25 illegal immigrants held at the union county jail here mr espinosa said he had seen the guards punching the immigrants , forcing them to strip , pinching their genitals with pliers and throwing them around like sacks of potatoes he said the guards chanted , america is no 1 , as the prisoners were abused now mr espinosa is suing the county in federal court , claiming that he was removed from his job after he assisted in the successful prosecution of 10 out of 12 guards who were indicted after promising him a new job elsewhere after the trials ended in 1998 , he contends , county officials demanded in 2000 that he return to work at the jail or be dismissed i was used and then thrown out into the street , said mr espinosa , 46 , who now holds a job in florida that pays a third of his former 52 , 000 salary his attorney , thomas d shea jr , said in court papers that investigators had once described mr espinosa as a star witness and a knight in shining armor a 1995 letter from the acting county prosecutor said it would realistically no longer be possible for him to return to his correction officer s job because of the threat of retaliation , and it promised help in finding him new employment in law enforcement but court papers filed by union county officials maintain that there was no firm or written agreement to find mr espinosa another county job threats to his safety , they said , have long past kathryn hatfield , the lawyer representing union county in this suit , said that mr espinosa s refusal to abide by an august 2000 letter from the county ordering him to return to his civil service position at the jail amounted to abandoning his post , a firing offense mr espinosa continued to be paid through the 1995 investigation , the 1996 indictments and the 1998 trials , as well as two years after , but ms hatfield said that the payments after the trials were a result of clerical and administrative oversights the county has filed a countersuit against mr espinosa to recover 153 , 000 , the value of the salary and benefits he received between the end of the trial and his dismissal the dismissal , she said , was upheld by a civil service hearing officer who ruled on the case in 2001 it is a very simple case that has been made complicated , she said the determination was made in 2000 that so much time had gone by that it was safe for him to go back to the jail they are hanging their hats on the view that he should not be financially hurt because of his testimony , but that obligation expired after the prosecution , and there is no obligation to pay him indefinitely judge william j martini of united states district court is expected to rule monday on a motion to dismiss the case at issue is whether mr espinosa is a whistleblower who had a legitimate fear of returning to his post his attorney contends that his dismissal amounted to retaliation by the county for exercising his first amendment rights in testifying against fellow guards he also argues that mr espinosa s civil service standing entitled him to an automatic transfer to a comparable county post emotions ran high during the trials , especially among the relatives and friends of the indicted guards when the guilty verdicts were announced , 30 armed court officers cleared the courtroom , and one supporter spat in the direction of the prosecution table the abuse of the immigrant detainees followed the rioting that occurred at the esmor federal detention center , operated by the esmor correctional services corporation , now defunct the esmor center , in elizabeth , nj , was closed after the riot , and immigrants were transferred to the union county jail the riots and the complaints of the detainees led to reforms nationally in immigrant detention , parole and asylum procedures , as well as a contract with a different private corrections company but it was just too long ago , and i do n't think it resonates at all in the county anymore , said henry w kurz , a former union county freeholder the prosecutor then has died , and now they are on the third one since him i even have trouble remembering who juan espinosa was jim roche , the current president of the policeman s benevolent association , who was vice president at the time , said none of his members had any desire to harm mr espinosa he said , however , that mr espinosa a former internal affairs investigator for the county correction department was never well liked , adding that he was viewed as manipulative , ambitious and someone who acted like he was too good for the place he said six other correction officers testified against their colleagues , and all of them returned to work without any problems but mr espinosa and his lawyer said the other guards were facing similar assault charges from the prosecutor and testified under a grant of immunity , while mr espinosa faced no such charges i was glad to tell them what happened , mr espinosa said in an interview he said he had not gone to investigators before prosecutors approached him because he wanted to ensure that there was a real accounting in the judicial system and not some rinkydink disciplinary action once assured , he volunteered all he knew without seeking immunity , returned to the job wearing a wire and , he said , gradually embraced the reality that his safety would be compromised and his career in corrections was over his said he received threatening calls , including some from callers claiming to be selling burial plots , he said he had to be transported to grand jury appearances in the courthouse just across the street from the jail wearing a ski mask and hiding on the back floor of a car he said that he always carried his gun and that he , his wife and two children were constantly looking over their shoulders he said he was nervous during three days of testimony he remembered the prosecutors describing him as the only voluntarily cooperating witness among the guards and cited him for keeping his head and maintained his integrity since then , at least one prosecutor , cited in court papers in the lawsuit , has said that he was just pure fluff thrown in for the jury
coincidentally , but appropriately , the terrorism alert level was taken down a notch in new york as yasir arafat lay dying in paris tighter security arrangements explain why federal officials lowered the level slightly on wednesday at financial buildings here and in new jersey and washington the threat itself has hardly disappeared it is also obvious that al qaeda , not mr arafat and his crew , is responsible for america s fears these days still , there was symbolic justice in the confluence of two unrelated events yasir arafat , the godfather of modern international terrorism , was in death s clasp , and new yorkers were told they could breathe a bit more easily the timing was a fluke but that made it no less intriguing such was the long shadow cast by mr arafat that it fell even on this city , its politics and its collective view of world affairs new york politicians have always reserved the right to their own foreign policy , whether or not it dovetailed with washington s but in modern times , no issue has dominated the city s rollerderby approach to diplomacy like the israelipalestinian conflict mr arafat was often at the center of the storm if you are a new yorker middleaged and beyond , you may have etched in memory his appearance before the united nations general assembly in 1974 there he stood before this peacetalking organization with a holster brazenly strapped to his hip nobody told him to take it off he did not actually carry a gun but that did not stop him from threatening everyone i have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighter s gun , he said do not let the olive branch fall from my hands that moment solidified the contempt many new yorkers had already begun to have for the united nations , where the flag flew at halfstaff yesterday in mourning for mr arafat it remains , at best , a likehate relationship one reason is the organization s passion for passing antiisrael resolutions while it does next to nothing about wholesale death in rwanda and sudan , or while it ignores china s attempts to destroy religion and culture in occupied tibet indeed , it was not lost on many new yorkers that while embracing mr arafat , the united nations has wanted nothing to do with the dalai lama , the tibetan spiritual leader , who only won the nobel peace prize in 1989 \( then again , the palestinian leader also won that prize , in 1994 so much for the nobel , some would say \) mr arafat gave new york politicians ample ammunition for sustained attacks mayor edward i koch , ever delicate , called the united nations a cesspool mayor rudolph w giuliani went even further on the united nations' 50th anniversary in 1995 , he had mr arafat tossed out of a citysponsored concert for world leaders at lincoln center washington clucked its disapproval israelipalestinian peace talks were then in high gear , and looked promising , illusorily so in retrospect but the mayor stood firm in his days as a federal prosecutor , he investigated terrorist acts by mr arafat s palestine liberation organization as is often the case with mr giuliani , this was personal , not strictly business that may help explain why he had no problem in 1994 shaking hands at city hall with gerry adams , the sinn fein leader he had no personal stake in irish bomb throwers and their political spokesmen the alchemy of politics seems ever able to turn yesterday s terrorist into today s emissary of peace the islamic terrorism that now frightens americans is different in scope and style from that which mr arafat sponsored or , at a minimum , tolerated nonetheless , a line runs between the violence he long encouraged to the mayhem that engulfed new york three years ago for that reason , and others , few flags in the city beyond those at the united nations were at halfstaff yesterday politicians talked of terrorist threats at a veterans day ceremony , but none bothered to mention mr arafat , even in passing after prime minister yitzhak rabin of israel was murdered by a jewish fanatic in 1995 , the city named second avenue at 42nd street for him that corner also bears a sign honoring former president nelson mandela of south africa and his former wife , winnie who knows \? new york s population is changing rapidly someday , politicians responding to this transformation may decide that yasir arafat , too , deserves a street sign of his own do n't bet on it happening any time soon , though nyc
despite all their assurances to the contrary , the nets might have been more preoccupied with business than basketball wednesday night many players learned before the game that a deal had finally been struck to sell the franchise to bruce c ratner , who plans on moving the nets to brooklyn if ratner saw his new acquisition at the sbc center , he might have asked for a markdown the nets made their first trip to san antonio since the nba finals , and jason kidd made his first visit since taking a freeagent recruiting trip over the summer once again , they left with nothing the crowd welcomed kidd with a smattering of boos and the spurs kicked the nets out of texas with a secondhalf surge and a 9976 victory the nets have not shown their prospective new owner much value recently , losing four games in a row and five of six way to get off to a good start , guys , richard jefferson said in a way , they did get off to a good start kerry kittles scored 24 of his seasonhigh 30 points in the first half , made his first four 3pointers and gave the nets a 1point halftime lead then the nets stopped getting back on defense and communicating with one another , earning a scolding from coach byron scott we made a ton of mental mistakes in coverage , scott said we gave them i do n't know how many layups we just fell asleep they were understandably exhausted , having been whipped in dallas on tuesday in the second half here , the nets lost their legs , shooting 282 percent and scoring 29 points the spurs were almost twice as good , shooting 553 percent and scoring 53 points one team was getting easy shots and the other was giving them the nets were obliterated in the paint , 5218 , and their starting front line of kenyon martin , jason collins and jefferson finished 4 of 24 from the field martin at least had a legitimate excuse back spasms that pained him whenever he moved as usual , none of the nets could match tim duncan , who spoiled kidd s return to san antonio with his usual stat line 21 points and 17 rebounds the nets were reminded of the nba finals , with one important exception in the finals , the games were a lot closer , said kidd , who also scored 21 points wednesday the nets could only act competitive even when they were behind by 20 points near the end of the fourth quarter , scott instructed his players to foul the oddball strategy could not prevent the inevitable blowout heading into wednesday , the nets and the spurs had each dropped four of five games , but the spurs turned themselves around for one night while the nets tripped over another elite opponent the nets thought they were finished with fourgame losing streaks in early december now , as they near the midpoint of the season , they are forced to cope with another rebounds the nets are one of six teams that have inquired about hubert davis , the former knicks guard who was waived this week by the detroit pistons the agent for davis , steve kauffman , indicated that the nets were one of two leading contenders to land him earlier this month , the nets pursued another former knicks guard , charlie ward , but he chose the spurs ward said wednesday that he held no bitterness toward the knicks , who dealt him to phoenix in the stephon marbury trade after nine years with the club davis will clear waivers on thursday and is expected to sign with a new team by the weekend the nets are interested in him because he is an accurate outside shooter and because lucious harris has been bothered by injuries

no one is more thrilled with the republican club for growth than arlene wohlgemuth , who is seeking to oust chet edwards , a sixterm democratic congressman in a texas district that includes president bush s crawford ranch more than 337 , 000 in donations have already come into ms wohlgemuth s campaign from all over the country , thanks to the club for growth , a conservative group that has solicited its 16 , 000 members on behalf of ms wohlgemuth and the club has already spent 75 , 000 on television advertisements praising ms wohlgemuth as one of the most conservative politicians in texas , well to the right of her two republican primary rivals and , of course , mr edwards none of this financial largess was sought by ms wohlgemuth it fell into her lap without her having to lift a finger and has already helped her dispatch one of her republican primary rivals we 're getting checks from florida , michigan , ohio and other places , said todd smith , a campaign spokesman , who said that onethird of all ms wohlgemuth s recent donations have come from outside the district that s the great thing it s been very , very beneficial one of the controversial 527 committees so called for the section of the tax code that created them club for growth is this election year s new twist on the old practice of getting large amounts of soft money into campaigns by skirting federal election rules so far , most of the attention has been on 527 committees set up by democrats , especially several supported by george soros , the billionaire businessman but , as a voice for the right , club for growth rivals its liberal counterparts both in size and in the passion of its cause at the moment , like santa claus at christmas , the club has been making a list of those candidates it considers to be naughty and nice nice are conservative , antitax , antibiggovernment candidates and naughty are those who veer from this line moreover , to the consternation of mainstream republicans , the club is not shy about pouring millions into primary races and attacking moderate republicans with the same ferocity it reserves for democrats in general elections ms wohlgemuth is one of about a halfdozen conservatives the club is supporting perhaps the best known is representative patrick j toomey , the republican conservative who is challenging a republican incumbent , senator arlen specter of pennsylvania our donors are very ideologically driven , more than party driven , said stephen moore , who cofounded the organization in washington in 1999 they are antitax and they feel the republican party has dropped the ball special disdain goes to republicans whom club members call rino s or republicans in name only that list features 21 republican members of congress who the club feels have gone soft on economic issues we have no loyalty to the republican party , david keating , the club s executive director , said in an interview we 're willing to get involved with candidates that no one else would touch with a 10foot pole the group s donors include some of the conservative movement s biggest names richard mellon scaife , the house majority leader tom delay and the columnist brent bozell , as well as businessmen like the pharmaceutical executive dan searle , the cosmetics executive ronald h lauder and the financiers charles schwab and richard gilder the conservative economists arthur laffer and lawrence kudlow advise on policy in the 2002 election , mr moore said his group dispersed 8 million he claims to have triumphed in 17 of 19 races this year , the club has raised 46 million toward its goal of 10 million , mr moore said , to be used mainly for television advertisements in addition , the club has a political action committee that has raised 817 , 000 , and its members have sent checks to the club totally 21 million to be passed on to the club s favored candidates in the form of bundled direct donations while conservatives within the republican party might be thrilled by the club s political involvement , some moderate republicans are outraged i'm adamantly opposed to their activities , said sarah chamberlain resnick , executive director of the republican main street partnership , a 527 committee that supports moderate republican candidates why are they splitting the republican party \? they 've got a funny name for a group that is trying to shrink the republican party the republican main street partnership is pouring money into republican primaries to defend moderates against the club money it says it would have preferred to use to attack democrats in this intraparty combat , no group exemplifies establishment republicans more than the main street partnership so far it has raised 12 million in soft dollars and 200 , 000 in a political action committee now we have to go in and defend arlen specter , said ms resnick , whose group has been running prospecter advertisements , and that is money we would have put in other races in pennsylvania , the club has already spent over 1 million in television advertisements attacking mr specter saying his voting record was as liberal as that of senator john kerry and has sent 800 , 000 in bundled donations from its members to mr toomey s campaign in response , the specter campaign filed a complaint with the federal election commission , asserting that the club illegally coordinated campaign expenditures with the toomey campaign , an accusation the club denies frankly , we do n't know where this money is coming from , said william reynolds , a spokesman for mr specter we do know it is coming from out of state these are individuals who are bucking the whole party apparatus the club may be bucking the party , but it claims to be winning , both at the ballot box and in pushing the party to the right for instance , mr moore asserts that without the club s pressure on wavering republicans , president bush s tax cut plan in 2003 would not have passed congress feeling the sting were two republican senators , olympia j snowe of maine and george v voinovich of ohio the club called them francorepublicans and ran advertisements in their home states questioning their patriotism both senators initially said they were concerned about the impact of the tax cuts on the growing federal deficit but , after the attack , senator voinovich voted for the tax cut plan we threatened to fund a primary opponent against senator voinovich , mr moore said i honestly believe that the tax cut would not have happened without the bad cop role of the club mr keating , the club s executive director , said , having the club s backing is the next best thing to having the president come out for a fundraiser then , on reflection , he said the club was actually even better with a presidential fundraiser , money is split between the party and the candidates and there is a lot of hassle in dealing with the secret service and setting up an event for our candidates , they just have to open an envelope , mr keating said and 50 , 000 in checks will fall out
stamford , conn , nov 11 two contractors who helped renovate the house owned by the mayor of stamford received city contracts without going through the formal bidding process , city records show the companies , shapter construction and gunzy electric , were awarded the city work during or after renovations on the home of the mayor , dannel p malloy shapter construction received two nobid contracts from the city totaling 38 , 385 , while gunzy electric was awarded 6 , 940 in nobid city work mr malloy , a democrat who has run connecticut s fourth largest city since 1995 , is the focus of what state prosecutors have described as an official investigation by connecticut s public integrity unit , which is reviewing improvements made to mr malloy s house between 1997 and 2001 , during his first and second terms mr malloy , a leading candidate for governor in november 2006 , has consistently denied any wrongdoing he has said that he paid full value for the work on his house , and has provided prosecutors with 505 , 000 in canceled checks for the renovations those include 97 , 645 in checks to shapter construction and gunzy electric but he has also said that no contractor who did work on his house received city work without going through competitive bidding , which requires sealed bids , or by responding to a request for proposals , or rfp , a process that allows city officials to consider factors other than price in awarding work whoever gets contracts in the city , the mayor said last month on news12 , a local news channel , gets contracts which are the result of bidding or an rfp process , and they get those contracts because they comply with that process a july 2000 internal audit of the city s purchasing process found , however , that city officials frequently obtained waivers that allowed them to award work without the usual formal bidding processes waivers , which are allowed in emergencies and other special situations , were used by city officials 112 times between july 1 , 1997 , and dec 31 , 1999 , according to the audit that amounts to more than 20 percent of the contracts that qualified for a formal bid process during that period in many cases , the need for waivers was poorly documented , the audit noted the city s outside auditors also criticized the city in a compliance audit in the fall of 2001 , saying waiver procedures were not followed in all instances city records and the 2000 internal audit show that shapter construction and gunzy electric were awarded city work without going through either of the formal competitive processes in two instances , the companies received nobid contracts in september 1999 , for joint work at westhill high school that was described by city officials as a critical emergency shapter was paid 23 , 960 gunzy , 6 , 940 shapter got an additional 14 , 425 in nobid work at stamford high school the next month the bid waiver that was obtained lacked adequate documentation , the audit said calls to the two companies seeking comment on thursday were not returned in an interview on thursday , mr malloy said that any waivers the city sought were executed appropriately he also noted that whenever formal bidding processes could not be observed , city employees took other steps to assure a fair outcome , such as soliciting verbal bids from multiple suppliers a bid waiver does not necessarily mean that a process was not followed in selecting that party , said mr malloy , whose signature generally is required on bid waivers he said that no one he knew received any favoritism from the city people have the right to seek work from any entity regardless of where they have worked in the past , he said i do not get involved in the procurement process he added , none of these people would have been shown any courtesy or favoritism as a result of having worked on and having been paid for their work on my house both shapter and gunzy had worked on the mayor s house before landing the nobid city jobs in the fall of 1999 shapter did 80 , 039 in carpentry work on the house in 1998 , and gunzy was paid 17 , 606 for electrical work between june 1998 and september 2001 sitetech excavating , a contractor that did irrigation work on the mayor s property , also received more than 100 , 000 in nobid work from the city between 1997 and 2001 some of that work was for small jobs below the 7 , 500 threshold that requires the city to solicit bids a big chunk , however , was a 70 , 000 assignment that the mayor and other city officials now say was improperly awarded they blame a former official of the board of education for the error but the associated press has quoted the former school official as saying that the city s engineering department , which ultimately reports to the mayor , recommended sitetech the internal audit also described a bid waiver that benefited afb construction of trumbull , clearing the way for afb to receive a 24 , 685 job without formal competition afb is not known to have worked on the mayor s house but its lead principal , alfonso barbarotta , has contributed heavily to the mayor s fundraising committees and afb now oversees maintenance at the city s parks , municipal buildings and schools as an outside contractor to the city anthony iadarola , the city s head engineer , said in a july 2000 letter responding to the internal audit that year that many of the departures from practice were due to his department s assumption of responsibility for many capital projects from the board of education those , he wrote , are the most difficult to administrate due to the fact that timing is of the most critical nature he also said that his department struggles every day with the poor planning of other departments all the same , he reported that he had distributed copies of the audit to his own staff and promised to conduct refresher training regarding the city s purchasing requirements a second internal audit completed on aug 4 , 2004 , shows the city made some progress between january 2000 and march 2004 in reducing the use of bid waivers from 45 a month to 31 a month but it noted that of the 159 bid

polls are to washington what box scores are to cities that have a baseball team they are scrutinized obsessively by partisans this week the news has been especially startling after weeks of accusations of bush administration negligence \( or worse \) before the 9 11 commission and bloody unrest in iraq , george w bush has ticked past john kerry in three new national polls an abc news washington post survey released on tuesday recorded a fivepoint lead among registered voters for mr bush over mr kerry when ralph nader was offered as a choice \( 48 percent to 43 percent to 6 percent \) and a onepoint lead when the matchup was narrowed to president bush and senator kerry \( 49 percent to 48 percent \) in a usa today cnn gallup poll released the same day , mr bush led mr kerry 47 percent to 44 percent , with mr nader drawing 5 percent without mr nader it was mr bush over mr kerry 50 percent to 46 percent the next day , a poll from investor s business daily confirmed the trend , showing mr bush at 44 percent , mr kerry at 40 percent and mr nader at 4 percent the reaction was predictable mr bush s chief campaign strategist bragged that the president had defied the pundits with his strong position , while democrats were crestfallen if mr kerry ca n't hold onto a lead during one of the worst stretches of the incumbent s presidency , they whispered , how can he defeat mr bush when things get brighter for the president \? but democrats should pause before they give up and republicans should n't celebrate quite yet president bush s vulnerabilities remain , even if they were not as apparent in this week s polls as they were in previous surveys the question is whether mr kerry can exploit them in none of the polls this week that purported to show the bush surge does the president have majority support any politician running for reelection sweats when a poll shows him under 51 percent voters who say they are undecided almost always end up opposing the incumbent they know him well , and if they were going to vote for him , they would have already decided thus support for mr bush should be seen more as a ceiling , while support for mr kerry , the lesserknown challenger , is more like a floor president bush s overall job approval rating should also be cause for concern he is trailing behind the last two presidents to be reelected ronald reagan was at 54 percent at about this point in 1984 , while bill clinton clocked in at 56 percent in april 1996 mr bush is hanging by his fingertips with a 51 percent and 52 percent rating in two polls released tuesday and remarkably , after one of the most concentrated television advertising campaigns in political history , mr bush has seemingly failed to shift a single voter s view of him personally what pollsters call his favorability rating is almost exactly where it was before his ads began the other numbers that keep presidents awake at night are the socalled right direction wrong track figures , which ask voters about the general direction of the country and often serve as a leading indicator for a politician s overall health here , the news must be worrying to the white house even as mr bush s numbers against mr kerry and his job approval rating have risen slightly , the percentage of americans who believe that things have gotten pretty seriously off on the wrong track has climbed to 57 percent from 46 percent last april growing concern about mr bush s iraq policies is also evident according to one poll , 54 percent of voters disapprove of the way mr bush is handling the situation in iraq , and a record 65 percent believe the level of american casualties in iraq is unacceptable why , then , did these same polls record a small increase for mr bush over mr kerry \? mr bush s 50 million ad campaign probably had a small impact , as did americans' tendency to rally to his side during a particularly trying period of the war whatever the explanation , these polls are neither as dismaying \( to democrats \) nor as encouraging \( to republicans \) as they appear in fact , given the margin of error in this week s surveys it hovers between 3 percent and 35 percent the only safe conclusion is that the race is a dead heat at least until the next round of polls is released
south africa s new national party , the political force that ran a dictatorship during four decades of apartheid and then ceded power peacefully in democratic elections in 1994 , announced saturday that it was folding for lack of voter support the leaders and members of parliament from the party will be offered immediate membership in the african national congress , the majority black party that trounced it in the 1994 elections , the new national party s spokeswoman , carol johnson , told the sapa news service the new national party will exist in name until september 2005 , the next time the parliament allows its members to switch loyalties but it will effectively cease operations in the next few weeks when its chairman , marthinus van schalkwyk , applies for african national congress membership it was unclear how many of the party s politicians and supporters would follow mr van schalkwyk , but ms johnson said its leaders would begin a national campaign this month to urge them to join the african national congress for south africans , the announcement on saturday was in some ways a turning point during most of its unbroken rule from 1948 to 1994 , what was then called the national party ran a dictatorship devoted to preserving white minority power by suppressing black majority rights from 1960 to 1990 , the national party outlawed the african national congress , then a nonviolent blackrights organization , forcing its members into an increasingly violent underground movement it is of huge symbolic significance , said robert b mattes , a political analyst at the university of cape town , that the party which for a long time was the champion of afrikaner nationalism and later of white nationalism is now bound for the dustbin of history in political terms , however , the announcement has scant practical importance since 1994 , when it commanded a fifth of the electorate , the new national party has steadily lost support in national elections in april , the party won only 17 percent of the vote and held a mere seven seats in the 400seat parliament most of its rank and file have defected to the democratic alliance , a liberal and predominantly white party that attracted about one in eight voters in 2004 , or the freedom front , a largely afrikaner party that got about one percent of the vote in april at its end , the new national party had shed all vestiges of its racist , dictatorial past its scion , former president fw de klerk , shared the nobel prize with nelson mandela for their joint efforts to dismantle apartheid but south african political analysts say mr de klerk s party was never able to negotiate the difficult transition from 40 years of ironfisted rule to a role as a loyal democratic opponent from 1994 to this year , the leadership moved from holding cabinet posts in a unity government run by the african national congress , to independent opposition , to a marriage of convenience with the democratic alliance , to a purely political affiliation with the african national congress none of the changes drew new voters and , analysts say , might have accelerated the loss of support by leaving voters confused about what the party stood for dirk kotze , a political science lecturer at unisa university in pretoria , said the party s moves in and out of government made voters uncertain about whether it was cooperating with the african national congress or opposing it mr mattes said that the party might have broadened its support among blacks in the early 1990 s by speeding up the pace of democratization , but that the fouryear delay between legalizing the african national congress and holding a democratic vote dissuaded many black voters who might otherwise have given the party the benefit of the doubt internally , he said , the party was divided over its direction and the extent to which it needed to reach out to the majority black population a lot of people felt that the only way they would win votes was by cozying up to the anc , he said and a lot of others felt that the only way they would win votes was by becoming much more aggressive there was no reason it had to end up this way , he said
when the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states set to work early last year to prepare the definitive history of the events of sept 11 , 2001 , it seemed that much of its hard work was already done , because so much of the horrifying story seemed to be known at the time , it was understood that all of the hijackers had entered the country legally and done nothing to draw attention to themselves osama bin laden had underwritten the plot with his personal fortune but had left the details to others american intelligence agencies had no warning that al qaeda was considering suicide missions using planes president bush had received a special intelligence briefing weeks before sept 11 that focused on past , not current , terrorist threats from al qaeda but 19 months later , the commission has released a final , unanimous booklength report that , in calling for a overhaul of the way the government collects and shares intelligence , showed that much of what had been common wisdom about the sept 11 attacks at the start of the panel s investigation was wrong in meticulous detail , the 567page report , including 116 pages of footnotes in tiny , eyestraining type , rewrote the history of sept 11 , 2001 , correcting the historical record in ways large and small and shattering myths that might otherwise have been accepted as truth for generations the commission s report found that the hijackers had repeatedly broken the law in entering the united states , that mr bin laden may have micromanaged the attacks but did not pay for them , that intelligence agencies had considered the threat of suicide hijackings , and that mr bush received an august 2001 briefing on evidence of continuing domestic terrorist threats from al qaeda our work , we believe , is the definitive work on 9 11 , said thomas h kean , the former republican governor of new jersey who was chairman of the commission , and whose consensusbuilding talents are credited by other commissioners as the reason the panel s report was unanimous if there are unanswered questions , mr kean said , it is mostly because the people who were at the heart of the plot are dead the hijackers for the commission of five democrats and five republicans , the work of correcting the record began with an understanding of how 19 young arab terrorists managed to enter the united states unnoticed , hiding in plain sight in the weeks and months before they joined in an attack that left more than 3 , 000 people dead this was the subject of the first of what would be series of riveting public hearings held by the commission this year the first factfinding hearing in january showed just how wrong and selfserving much of the government s information about the sept 11 plot had been and it suggested just how aggressive the commission intended to be in setting the record straight immediately after sept 11 and in the months that followed , the fbi , the cia and other agencies involved in counterterrorism defended their failure to detect the plot by insisting that the hijackers had gone out of their way to enter the united states legally and to avoid detection in the months preceding the attacks each of the hijackers , apparently purposely selected to avoid notice , came easily and lawfully from abroad , louis j freeh , the former director of the fbi , testified to congress in october 2002 while here , the hijackers effectively operated without suspicion , triggering nothing that alerted law enforcement but in its final report , the commission found that as many as 13 of the hijackers had entered the united states with passports that had been fraudulently altered , using criminal methods previously associated with al qaeda the commission found that the visa applications of many of the hijackers had been filled out improperly in several cases , the hijackers had provided demonstrably false information on the forms the names of at least three of the terrorists were found after sept 11 in the databases of american intelligence and counterterrorism agencies after entering the united states , several of the hijackers should have drawn the attention of law enforcement agencies but did not mohamed atta , the plot s egyptianborn ringleader , overstayed his tourist visa one of the terrorist pilots , ziad aljarrah , attended school in 2000 in violation of his immigration status , which should have been enough to block him from reentering the united states he left and reentered the country at least six more times before sept 11 imagining the unimaginable in trying to explain why the nation had left itself so vulnerable on sept 11 , the leaders of the nation s law enforcement and intelligence agencies have insisted publicly that they never considered the nightmare of passenger planes turned into guided missiles i do n't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the world trade center , condoleezza rice , mr bush s national security adviser , said in may 2002 as recently as this april , in testimony to the sept 11 commission , mr freeh said that he never was aware of a plan that contemplated commercial airliners being used as weapons but in its investigation , the commission found that an attack described as unimaginable had in fact been imagined , repeatedly the commission said that several threat reports circulated within the government in the late 1990 s raised the explicit possibility of an attack using airliners as missiles most prominent among those reports , the commission said , was one circulated in september 1998 , based on information provided by a source who walked into an american consulate in east asia , that mentioned a possible plot to fly an explosivesladen aircraft into a us city a month earlier , it said , an intelligence agency received information that a group of libyans hoped to crash a plane into the world trade center the north american aerospace defense command had gone so far as to develop exercises to counter the threat and , according to a defense department memorandum unearthed by the commission , planned a drill in april 2001 that would have simulated a terrorist crash into the pentagon bin laden and iraq american intelligence agencies had known for years that the united states had much to fear from osama bin laden , but it was fear based more on mr bin laden s power as a global symbol of islamic fundamentalist rage than as a terrorist logistician a senior state department official testified to the senate in 2001 that the bin laden terror network was analogous to a multinational corporation , bin laden as ceo , leaving the details of the terrorist attacks to others but the commission found that far from being the disengaged leader of his terror network , mr bin laden was described by captured qaeda colleagues as a handson executive who wanted to be involved in almost every detail of the sept 11 plot , choosing the hijacking team himself and selecting targets he was reported to have been eager to hit the white house the report describes information obtained from the interrogation of khalid shaikh mohammed , mr bin laden s former chief of operations , who said that bin laden could assess new trainees very quickly , in about 10 minutes , and that many of the 9 11 hijackers were selected in this manner american intelligence analysts had long believed that mr bin laden had a vast personal fortune that bankrolled al qaeda news accounts described the bin laden fortune as totaling as much as 300 million , with real estate holdings in london , paris and the c te d'azur but the commission reached a far different conclusion , finding that mr bin laden was cut off from his family s wealth after the early 1990 s and that he financed al qaeda s operations through a core group of wealthy muslim donors , mainly in the persian gulf the report said that from 1970 to 1994 , mr bin laden received about 1 million a year from family funds a sizable sum , but not nearly enough to finance such an ambitious terrorist network the bush administration has long maintained that there was a close working relationship between al qaeda and iraq in october 2002 , with the invasion of iraq only months away , mr bush said in a speech in cincinnati that highlevel contacts between iraq and al qaeda go back a decade , and that we 've learned that iraq has trained al qaeda members in bombmaking and poisons and deadly gases as recently as last month , vice president dick cheney said there was reason to believe a disputed czech intelligence report that mohamed atta had met with a senior iraqi intelligence officer in prague in april 2001 , suggesting a tie between iraq and the sept 11 plot but in its most contentious effort to set the record straight about the origins of the plot , the bipartisan commission s final report found no evidence of close collaboration between saddam hussein and al qaeda , appearing to undermine a justification for the iraq war the commission found no credible evidence to suggest that the prague meeting took place and no evidence of any kind to show iraqi involvement in attacks by al qaeda against the united states while there had indeed been periodic contacts in the late 1990 s between al qaeda representatives and iraqi officials , principally in sudan , the commission found , those contacts did not amount to much to date we have seen no evidence that these or the earlier contacts ever developed into a collaborative operational relationship , the commission wrote a footnote on page 470 of the commission s report provided a clue to some of the false claims although there have been suggestions of contacts between iraq and al qaeda regarding chemical weapons and explosive trainings , the most detailed information alleging such ties came from an al qaeda operative who recanted much of his original information the commission tried to lift suspicion that the leaders of another arab government , that of saudi arabia , had underwritten al qaeda , and to knock down widely circulated theories that the bush administration had improperly assisted the saudis by allowing members of the extended bin laden clan to flee the united states on charter flights at a time when all commercial air traffic was shut down after the attacks the commission found that saudi nationals , including relatives of mr bin laden , had indeed left the country on special charter flights after the attacks but it found that no one at the white house above the rank of richard a clarke , then the white house counterterrorism chief , had approved the flights , and that none had occurred before the morning of sept 13 , when national airspace reopened the evidence in the first hours after the sept 11 attacks and ever since , the white house has consistently insisted that mr bush and his deputies had no credible evidence before the attacks to suggest that al qaeda was about to strike on american soil but the assertion has been questioned as a result of the commission s digging after its most heated showdown with the bush administration over access to classified information , the commission pressured the white house to declassify and make public a special intelligence briefing that had been presented to the president at his texas ranch on aug 6 , 2001 , a month before the attacks the existence of the document but not its detailed contents had been known since 2002 , when the white house confirmed news reports that mr bush had received an intelligence report before sept 11 warning of the possibility that al qaeda might hijack american passenger planes in testimony this april to the sept 11 commission , before the report was made public , ms rice insisted that it was historical it did not , in fact , warn of attacks inside the united states , she testified it was historical information based on old reporting there was no new threat information but there were gasps in the audience in the hearing room when she disclosed the name of the twopage briefing paper bin laden determined to attack in us the document was made public several days later it contained passages referring to fbi reports at the time of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks , including recent surveillance of federal buildings in new york it noted that a caller to the united states embassy in the united arab emirates that may had warned that a group of bin laden supporters was in the us , planning attacks with explosives the commission s final report revealed that two cia analysts involved in preparing the brief had wanted to make clear to mr bush that , far from being only a historical threat , the threat that al qaeda would strike on american soil was both current and serious
in the past year , two landmark reports have provided stark evidence that the oceans are in a serious biological decline both reports have also provided plausible road maps for recovery as a rule , reports like these , however exhaustive and worthy , cause a momentary stir and then sink from view it is thus heartening to find that several bills inspired by these reports have recently been introduced in congress there is not enough time left for congress to pass them this year , but their very existence should provide momentum heading into next year and , who knows , they may even persuade a presidential candidate or two to talk seriously about a matter that deserves far more prominence than it now has the reports one underwritten by the pew charitable trusts and the other by congress identify three main threats to ocean health the bills , taken together , address all three one is the deterioration of coastal wetlands and estuaries caused by pollution from agricultural runoff and relentless residential development a second and more familiar problem is industrial overfishing in less than a century , it has essentially stripmined the oceans , wiping out 90 percent of the large ocean fish , like tuna and swordfish , while imperiling many other commercially valuable species the third problem is bureaucratic chaos what passes for ocean policy today is a patchwork of 140 laws administered by dozens of agencies , none of them really in charge the broadest of the bills known informally as oceans 21 and sponsored by a group of house members would make it a national policy to protect and restore the oceans' ecosystems specifically , it would prevent government agencies from proceeding with actions like a corps of engineers dredging project or a new highway if the work was likely to damage an ocean ecosystem significantly senator barbara boxer of california is preparing to introduce a companion measure in the senate another bill , offered by nick rahall of west virginia and certain to be controversial , would impose new discipline on an essentially selfregulated fishing industry , giving independent scientists the ultimate authority to set limits on how many fish could be caught the responsibility for managing fisheries in a sustainable way now falls to eight regional councils dominated by people whose livelihood depends on catching as many fish as possible a conflict of interest a third measure , sponsored by senator ernest hollings , would make the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , now buried in the commerce department , an independent agency mr hollings would also establish a white house office to coordinate federal policy the bush administration has yet to be heard from , though it is obliged by law to respond to the congressional report at some point down the line but it is reassuring to see a burst of legislative interest in an issue of paramount importance
the justice department sued the metropolitan transportation authority and new york city transit yesterday , charging them with discriminating against muslim and sikh employees who wear turbans and head scarves for religious reasons but in a statement , transit officials declared the lawsuit totally without merit , arguing that no one in the justice department s civil rights division had discussed the issue with them and that they had already changed their policy on uniforms to allow religious head coverings provided by the authority the lawsuit stems from a series of incidents dating back to 2002 since then , four muslim women all bus drivers for new york city transit have been barred from operating buses on the road and reassigned to work inside bus depots because they refused to wear regulation caps over their head scarves , known as hijabs more recently , transit managers briefly reassigned kevin harrington , a sikh train operator , to a railyard because he refused to take off his turban at work after his case drew public attention , he was allowed back on his old job in june taken together , the actions constitute a pattern and practice of religious discrimination , says the lawsuit , filed in federal district court in brooklyn it calls for the transit authority to provide accommodations for muslim , sikh and other employees whose beliefs require them to wear the head coverings , as well as compensation for those who claim that they lost overtime opportunities because of their transfers transit officials pointed out that charges brought by the bus operators were dismissed after an investigation by the united states equal employment opportunity commission an independent arbitrator also ruled against the women , concluding that the transit agency had properly accommodated them by giving them alternative jobs union leaders , however , argued that the jobs inside the depot were not equivalent because they provided fewer opportunities for overtime , a significant part of bus drivers' income , said arthur schwartz , a lawyer for local 100 of the transport workers union the justice department s lawsuit makes the same case even if the jobs were equivalent in pay and other benefits , reassigning them placed an unfair stigma on them , mr schwartz said , adding that one of the women had been wearing her head scarf while driving a passenger bus for more than 10 years without any problem three of the muslim women are once again in arbitration , he said , because they have been trying to change depots , but the transit agency has refused to allow them to do so none of the employees have decided yet whether they will wear the alternative head coverings that the transit agency presented to them last week , he said , scarves made out of blue cloth that match their uniforms and bear the mta s logo some of them may not be able to , mr schwartz said , if their religious leaders say they cannot the union has supported the rights of these individuals to wear religious headwear from the beginning , and we 're excited that the government is coming in on the side of the employees and their right to exercise their religious beliefs , he said
two dollars for a gallon of gas \? get used to it high fuel prices are here to stay , at least for the near future , because no relief is in sight for tight oil supplies most oilproducing countries and the major oil companies already produce all they can smaller companies and wildcatters are reopening some mothballed wells , but their combined output is not nearly enough to affect the global supply what little spare capacity there is is almost entirely in saudi arabia , which is willing to pump more but the extra oil it could produce quickly is too heavy in sulfur for the main consuming nations the world economy has learned to roll with oil price spikes , so long as they are shortlived but sustained high fuel costs will strain its ability to cope , experts say , and the current runup is already starting to bite walmart stores , for example , said last week that higher gasoline prices in the united states had taken an average of 7 a week out of the pockets of its customers , leaving them less to spend on other goods sales of some of the largest and most gashungry sport utility vehicles were down last month , compared with a year earlier the nation s trade deficit widened to 46 billion in march , largely because of oil imports and in britain , the government is making contingency plans in case of mass protests against high fuel prices , the trade journal platts oilgram news reported friday the oil industry is constantly looking for new supplies , and with crude oil closing at a record high of 4138 a barrel in new york on friday , producers have plenty of economic incentive to step up output but developing a new oil field takes time , and energy companies can do little to rush projects , industry experts said marathon oil , a large independent company based in houston , is pumping its fields flat out the equivalent of 365 , 000 barrels a day , counting crude oil and natural gas that includes new fields in russia that produce 15 , 000 barrels a day those fields have the potential to yield an additional 45 , 000 barrels , but only after five more years of investment and work , said paul weeditz , a company spokesman marathon s new projects in west africa will take even longer companies are always under pressure to grow production , so they are always trying to bring new wells on , mr weeditz said many people may think it s a matter of turning the tap on and off , and that there s excess capacity , but that s just not the case major oil producing areas like the north sea and nigeria , which produce the most desirable type of oil , known as light sweet crude for its low sulfur content , are operating at capacity so are many of the refineries that turn the oil into usable fuels united states refineries were running at 96 percent of maximum output in april , the energy department said as a result , wholesale gasprices reached record highs last week , and those prices are quickly passed along to consumers at the pump the worrying part is that no end is in sight for the oil price rally , said jan stuart , director of energy research at fimat usa , the brokerage unit of soci t g n rale whatever is driving this upward , those factors are not changing high demand , lower inventories , supply that is constrained , and only in part by opec decisions , and turmoil in the middle east those price records are not adjusted for inflation several times in the 1970 s and 1980 s , prices hit what would be higher levels if converted into today s money but those spikes occurred when supplies were disrupted by the arab oil embargo and the iraniraq war with world demand so strong today and spare capacity so slim , the oil market is highly vulnerable to any new supply disruptions many oil traders worry that terrorists may sabotage oil facilities , sending prices to new highs that could throttle the economic recovery since the situation in iraq flared up last month , oil has become a prime target there suicide bombers tried to attack an offshore iraqi oil terminal in late april , then blew up a major pipeline near basra last week even more troubling , industry experts say , was the killing of foreign and saudi oil workers at the yanbu oil hub in saudi arabia this is the only spare capacity you have in the world , said fareed mohamedi , chief economist for pfc energy , a washington consulting firm , referring to the saudi oil industry so you 're going to be nervous if there is any hint of disruption oil traders estimate that unrest in the middle east has added a risk premium to the price of oil of 4 to 8 a barrel yet even without that turbulence , the price of oil would probably still be higher now than it has been in years , given global demand , industry experts said the unexpectedly sharp rise , to more than 40 a barrel today from less than 30 a barrel just 18 months ago , has not noticeably slowed the economic recovery in the developed world most industries over the last two decades have found ways to improve efficiency , producing far more goods with the same amount of energy , and the united states has had a major shift from energyintensive industries toward the service sector even so , the world s appetite for oil is growing at its fastest rate in 16 years , according to the international energy agency , which tracks oil markets and stockpiles for industrialized countries it forecast that the world would consume two million more barrels a day this year than in 2003 , or 806 million barrels a day in all china s great economic growth is behind much of that increase , and few analysts foresaw that either china s boom or america s recovery would be quite so robust , said lawrence j goldstein , president of the petroleum industry research foundation in new york that roaring demand has eaten deeply into oil supplies despite lower official quotas , nearly all the members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries are producing as much oil as possible to cash in on the high prices , and most major nonopec producers are doing the same russia , which is not an opec member , is something of an exception , but it is constrained by how much oil it can export through its pipelines and railways , all of them running at or near their limits venezuela , an opec member , is theoretically able to produce more oil , but its state oil company was crippled last year by a strike and an unsuccessful attempt to oust the country s president , and it has not recovered fully analysts say that at most 2 million to 25 million barrels a day of spare capacity could sustain production for any length of time nearly all of it is in saudi arabia the rest is mainly in kuwait and the united arab emirates for years , whatever the markets needed to stay on an even keel , the kingdom of saud provided but since the late 1990 s , the country has started to pursue a more independent oil policy to increase its oil revenue and support a growing population and a generous welfare state , saudi arabia has chosen to hold back some production and let the price of oil rise , said leonidas f drollas , chief economist with the center for global energy studies , a london consulting business opec as a whole , led by saudi arabia , tried to cut output and make it hard for refineries to build oil stocks , driving prices higher but with the price of oil at 40 a barrel and more , the saudis are clearly unnerved mr goldstein said they are trying to sell more oil now , but have found few takers , because of the high sulfur content of their crude instead , refineries in china and the united states are competing for the more limited pool of lowsulfur oil there is no sweet crude spare capacity anywhere in the world , mr goldstein said there is no cushion for the next surprise major oil companies are not bringing on new wells now to take advantage of high prices , said annlouise hittle , head of macro oils at wood mackenzie , a consulting firm in edinburgh burned in the past by price spikes that proved ephemeral , the oil industry has become extremely reluctant to invest in wells that would be unprofitable at low prices , so it has none to reopen now increasingly , the best prospects for new oil have proved to be in places that are off limits to major foreign oil companies , said edward d porter , research manager for the american petroleum institute , a lobbying group in washington while production is declining in areas like the north sea and the lower 48 states , many of the most promising fields are in the middle east oil companies have shelved hopes of even looking around iraq soon because of the violence there and uncertainty about the future elsewhere in the region , most notably saudi arabia , domestic political infighting about foreign involvement in the national oil patrimony has kept out major western companies the oil companies will keep hunting , but a significant easing of tight supplies may be several years away , industry experts say you ca n't change this overnight , mr goldstein said we need investment in sweet crude production or in refineries to process high sulfur crude , but there s a gestation period oil producers did n't think high prices were sustainable , but now they are coming to think they are
rob little looked up from his copy of kant prolegomena to any future metaphysics , a tome he characterized as the philosophy of immanuel kant for dummies josh childress smiled , and the corners of his mouth seemed to reach the top of his piledhigh dr jera afro little and childress stood outside their temporary practice site and the trailer that is now their locker room their stanford basketball team had been displaced , or at least sent across campus to the ford center , so the 30 million makeover of maples pavilion could begin neither was complaining , especially when the man they now call pops came bounding down a campus pathway , his eyes spinning with delight they edged closer to nick robinson , wanting to hear about the baby who would sit in the high chair that the team had given robinson at a recent baby shower annie lee , robinson said with a shiver she s 7 pounds 14 ounces and 19 1 2 inches long it was awesome at the moment , those numbers were far more important than stanford s 250 record and no 1 ranking in college basketball polls still , robinson , a 6foot6 forward , had his warmups on just six hours after the birth of his first child , he was ready to practice meagan wanted to take a nap , said robinson , 24 , explaining how his wife urged him to leave the hospital nothing in my life is ever going to compare to what happened this morning but basketball is a

unbeaten unlv was the last team to do so , in 1991 it will take two victories at washington state on thursday night and at washington on saturday as well as a perfect run through the pac10 tournament

buzzer by any measure , the team has overachieved beyond childress , the cardinal is not as athletically gifted as stanford s 1998 final four team , which boasted eight players over 67 and was led by the relentless banger mark madsen , who is now with the minnesota timberwolves this team is not as prodigiously talented as 2001 s 313 team , which sent casey jacobsen and the collins twins jason and jarron to the nba but they are mature and share a great chemistry , coach mike montgomery said it s kind of like how you hamandegg it on a golf course throughout the season everyone has contributed at different times , in ways big and small , so we could win none of them care about statistics , and they all like each other the golfing metaphor is apt at this private university , where excellence in the countryclub sports has been rivaled only by stanford s academic rigors john mcenroe , tiger woods and summer sanders are among those who have contributed to an athletic legacy that includes 70 ncaa team championships since 1980 and nine consecutive directors' cup trophies as the best overall collegiate athletic program in the country i liked the fact that this place was not all about basketball , said childress , a junior who had his pick of programs as a high school senior in los angeles this campus is full of special people doing all kinds of things childress s oldschool coif belies a newage sense of responsibility he is a leading allamerican candidate who volunteers with the young black scholars , a mentoring and tutoring group stanford has not won a national basketball championship since 1942 but in montgomery s 18 seasons , he has won 20 or more games 12 times , and in two weeks he is heading for his 12th ncaa tournament appearance with the cardinal that is quite a feat considering that stanford is among the toughest universities to get into and that no special consideration is given to athletes it is easier for montgomery to maintain the basketball program s 100 percent graduation rate than it is for him to attract mcdonald s allamericans , although he landed one in childress josh is the exception what we usually get are pretty good players with high expectations for themselves and who are willing to work at it , montgomery said they are all bright they have to be but they also seem to be curious and are capable of doing more than one thing little , for example , is pursuing a dual degree in political science and philosophy but he has also remade his body by first studying , then adopting , a disciplined approach to diet and exercise last year , he was a hulking 610 , 290pound center who could not keep up with connecticut center emeka okafor in a secondround tournament loss now , 30 pounds lighter , little is running the floor like a small forward in our system , you have to be interchangeable , said little , because we 're going to make four , five or six passes , and everyone is expected to be able to score last season , i was worn out by the time the tournament came around , and i did n't want to feel that way again five players average in doublefigure scoring for stanford , but it is the one who is averaging just 6 points and 3 rebounds a game who embodies the team s versatility and maturity robinson he came to stanford in 2000 after spending two years on a mormon mission in macei , brazil as one cardinal player after another has gotten injured , robinson has been moved from small forward to point guard to shooting guard he is now playing power forward for the injured davis he s started , he s come off the bench and now he s had a baby , little said with a smile the balance he has in life shows up when he s on the floor he helps all of us keep our heads whether stanford is the best team in the country remains to be seen but montgomery is obviously fond of this unselfish group and wants it to finish the regular season undefeated , win the pac10 tournament and play to its no 1 ranking right through the national championship game going 270 would be a tremendous accomplishment , montgomery said winning the pac10 tournament and heading into the tournament undefeated would be something to be really proud of they can handle the pressure of knowing their first loss will be their last loss no matter what happens , they can all be proud that they came to school here and did a lot more than just play basketball

senator john kerry denounced an advertisement by the liberal group moveonorg questioning president bush s vietnamera service in the air national guard yesterday , a move likely to raise pressure on president bush to condemn a recent commercial accusing mr kerry of lying about his war record the new moveon advertisement , running in three states , accuses mr bush of using family connections to get into the air national guard to escape combat in vietnam and revisits accusations that he did not adequately meet his service requirements charges that he denies mr kerry s statement came hours after surrogates for his presidential campaign made similar accusations and was prompted by a plea from senator john mccain , republican of arizona , a friend of mr kerry and a fellow combat veteran in vietnam earlier this month , mr mccain similarly called on mr bush to denounce the advertisement criticizing mr kerry , by a group called swift boat veterans for truth that spot , in which fellow vietnam war veterans said mr kerry lied about the incidents for which he won his combat medals , stopped running last week but the group says it plans to run another one soon the bush campaign has declined to denounce the swift boat advertisement , saying it had nothing to do with the spot that decision created an opening for moveon , whose spot ends with a quotation from mr mccain about the swift boat commercial earlier this month i think the bush campaign should specifically condemn the ad in an interview with the associated press yesterday , mr mccain said mr kerry should condemn the moveon spot because it s the same line of scurrilous attack leveled against mr kerry by the swift boat veterans shortly afterwards , mr kerry s campaign released his statement i agree with senator mccain that the ad is inappropriate this should be a campaign of issues , not insults yesterday , mr bush s campaign again refused to repudiate the swift boat advertisement democrats say that spot was largely paid for by bob j perry , a texas homebuilder with longstanding ties to mr bush s top political aide , karl rove mr perry has donated 200 , 000 , the group said the bush campaign and the group say they have had no contact and are not working in coordination , which would be a violation of campaign finance rules the campaign has not questioned and will not question john kerry s service in vietnam , said steve schmidt , a campaign spokesman the president made clear on national television that he honors john kerry s service in vietnam mr schmidt painted mr kerry s repudiation of the spots as disingenuous , given that at a campaignsponsored news conference earlier in the day gen wesley k clark , who competed against mr kerry in the democratic primaries earlier this year , and adm stansfield turner , the director of central intelligence for president jimmy carter , echoed moveon s accusations that mr bush used family connections to avoid combat kerry s condemnation reeks of hypocrisy given the fact that his campaign surrogates are on the attack echoing the same baseless charges , mr schmidt said echoing a line that the swift boat veterans have used , mr kerry s campaign said general clark and admiral turner had earned the right to speak their minds with their service , they 've more than earned the right to speak out , mr clanton said we 're still waiting for the president to condemn the smear campaign against john kerry s military service as of last night , it did not seem as if mr kerry s condemnation of the moveon advertisement would have any effect on the group s plans eli pariser , the head of the moveon political action committee responsible for the spot , said of mr kerry , we feel he s entitled to his opinion but mr pariser said he did not believe that the moveon spot and swift boat veterans' one were in the same league the swift boat veterans for truth has provided affidavits for the men making claims against mr kerry in its first and last advertisement but while some of the men served near mr kerry s swift boat , none in the advertisement served on it
cheat and charmer by elizabeth frank 543 pp random house 2595 inside this jiggly fat book , a thinner and more serious book is struggling to get out not long enough , not hard enough elizabeth frank is the author of several distinguished studies of artists and a biography of the poet louise bogan that won a pulitzer prize in 1986 all along , though , she has been working on something quite different a novel about the mccarthyera blacklist of film writers , directors and actors in the early 1950 s , america was in peril of subversion , or so the charge went , by former communist party members \( and a few who still belonged \) who were sneaking its ideology into innocuous comedies and dramas under a thin guise of social concern as congress investigated , those who failed to name names lost not only their jobs but their careers many of those who cooperated felt privately and , years later , publicly the shame of what they had done perhaps it s a case of artistic osmosis frank s subject has been infiltrated by the bloat , sentimentality , quickstep melodramatics and disposable puppetry of a 1950 s vintage hollywood soap opera quarts of canned fruit punch have diluted a tot of decent brandy the brandy parts of cheat and charmer dramatize the painful choices , hesitations , justifications , recriminations and exquisitely mixed motives of its assortment of film people frank s novel may not offer much new insight into the period , but it does succeed in capturing the moral jitters that beset a supremely privileged community forced briefly to experience doubt is selfprotection selfbetrayal \? and trying uncomfortably to squelch it frank s protagonist is dinah lasker , wife of the vastly successful producer , writer and director jake lasker years earlier , she had been a peripheral member of a largely communist hollywood set whose queen bee and butterfly was her sister , veevi , hollywood s most beautiful actress now , at a party in honor of jake s latest triumph , dinah studies the pink subpoena served on her earlier in the day will she testify or not \? she consults her conscience and jake in turn , jake consults irv engel , the studio boss to cooperate with the committee feels despicable to refuse will endanger jake s career and the wellbeing of their two children , not to mention the comfortable life dinah has won after struggling up from a modest background dinah s hesitations are genuine , but they are n't especially remarkable as she tries to do the right thing , she may be the one figure in this gallery of assorted hollywood archetypes who s capable of uncertainty and change the uncertainty is pallid , though , and the change is passive more a matter of being gradually shoved than of really moving suffice it to say that dinah does testify , that she names her sister without quite meaning to and that she spends the remaining 500 pages of the novel sincerely believing she was right , sincerely doubting , sincerely regretting sincerity is not one of the great fictional engines and though dinah is endlessly , painfully selfaware , this is not enough to make a reader aware of her in any useful way far better are some of the archetypes , particularly in the scenes leading up to her testimony and in the repercussions just afterward engel , the studio head , is infinitely understanding when jake consults him he loathes the blacklist and hopes that someday his fired writers will return to do a scathing comedy on the subject he also makes it clear , after consulting his new york bankers , that jake s job is at stake sentimental and coldly scheming , devoted and flagrantly unfaithful , jake plays dinah like a hooked fish when she insists that she must testify , he tells her let the line out to be sure this is what she wants when she wavers reel the line in he muses on the consequences of refusing after she testifies , dinah endures a gamut of reactions , ranging from contemptuous accusation to the silent treatment to sympathy , which frank \( whose father was the hollywood writer , director and producer melvin frank \) calibrates very skillfully particularly vivid is renna schlossberg , the agent who gives the investigators dinah s name at first , with a blithe , we 'reallinthistogether air , renna dismisses her predicament when i think of myself as a communist it s like trying to remember a time when i was a virgin but tears soon come , and the reader is moved as well not to testify , renna had been warned , would mean pressure on her adoption agency to refuse her a baby the steeliest yet most nuanced reaction and the best scene in the book comes from dorshka albrecht , an elderly european actress who has refused to bend to political pressure she hugs dinah and feeds her homemade sacher torte and is unsparing why did dinah do this terrible thing \? when the younger woman mentions her family , dorshka turns on her do n't you see \? you say you do n't want to hurt your children but you already have , by doing what you did ! you will say to your children i was an informer i named names because i did n't want you to suffer do you honestly think they will be grateful \? that they will thank you \? and then she tells dinah that , having made a devil s bargain , she should simply try to be happy no irony there dorshka has none left , not after the iron torments that have taught her a hard lesson life would be impossible if our judgment were to rule our affections so far , so good but we 're only a fifth of the way through from here on , frank plunges through wild tangles of plot filled with writing that often seems merely hurled on the page it s as if cheat and charmer had been submitted to that hollywood process in which a small script with some real character is given successive treatments by teams of writers aiming for a blockbuster , all impelled by different ideas of what angle might work true , there s a wisp of a theme dinah s testimony about her sister represents a larger hollywood culture of betrayal , but the connection is too frail to withstand the melodramatic stampede of vicious personal and professional backstabbing most vicious is that perpetrated by veevi , an outlandish cross between the wicked queen in snow white and cinderella s dreadful stepsisters living in france with her writerhusband , michael , she has n't been especially harmed by dinah s testimony she maintains a punitive silence , though , until michael leaves her for a younger woman and she returns to california to take refuge with her sister there she drunkenly gropes dinah s teenage son and carries on a protracted affair with jake it s not as if she has n't had practice in wounding people years before , she 'd quickly married a glamorous european director when she noticed his interest in dinah then she seduced and later married michael , her director husband s illegitimate son by dorshka \( when michael told her about his father , veevi brightly replied then we 're committing incest and not just adultery \? \) steamy is hardly the word you hear the clank of pipes about to be ruptured by overload as for jake s own betrayals , they 're less vicious than greedy he sleeps around , therapeutically , romantically , while regularly docking at the mother ship dinah takes him back until the very end , and perhaps beyond there is far too much jake in cheat and charmer , far too much veevi and \( even if she is nicer than they are \) far too much dinah frank s epic hollywood frieze turns out to be just wallpaper the patterns repeat over and over by the last page , you feel like you 're departing an empty room rather than finishing a long story
from beginning to end , this election was about george w bush , and he can claim that an apparently insurmountable lead in the popular vote vindicated his policies , his persistence , his personal qualities and his political strategy he bet that voters who had shared a traumatic terrorist attack and two wars on his watch would stand by him , and they appeared to a president who won by a whisker four years ago , then governed as if he had a landslide , was within striking distance of an electoral vote mandate for a second term he picked up republican , and conservative , seats in a stilldivided senate , and support for his stance against gay marriage in states where ballot measures banning it won approval in an election marked by divisiveness to the bitter end , much remained clouded early this morning john kerry s camp maintained that he could yet win pivotal ohio and close the gap , and that uncertainties in iowa and new mexico might be resolved in his favor but in sweet redemption , mr bush exorcised the ghost of the florida recount by winning a decisive victory in that state where his brother is governor and bid fair to become the only son of an american president ever to be elected president himself , then win a second term , and thus escape the curse of john and john quincy adams i 've given it my all , mr bush said after voting yesterday morning , and millions of republican voters returned the favor , outperforming the party s past margins in crucial counties and states from florida to ohio divided as the nation was and remains , democrats apparently failed to realize their highest hopes that tens of millions of dollars and anger at mr bush could galvanize enough voters to defeat him so what next \? if even a onevote margin is a mandate , as john f kennedy once said , what might a real mandate look like for mr bush \? will he pursue his course undaunted , whatever the opposition may do \? or once again seek , as he promised four years ago , to change the tone in washington , and reach out to the onequarter of voters in the electorate who described themselves as angry at his administration \? the evidence is mixed , and second terms are notoriously unpredictable and disappointing but mr bush has never been a man to shrink from a fight , and he may well have a hot one on his hands soon enough , if there is a confirmation battle in the senate to replace the ailing chief justice william h rehnquist perhaps no issue is more important than the judiciary to mr bush s conservative base , including the 2 in 10 voters who yesterday told pollsters that moral issues mattered to them more than any other and because victory would mean that the president would have a chance to nominate a clear conservative majority to the supreme court , no issue would be more contentious among mr bush s liberal opponents , and democrats seem all but certain to filibuster any choice they see as too extreme mr bush would become the 12th of the 17 incumbent presidents who have sought reelection since 1900 to win a second term already , through his aggressive handling of terrorism and foreign policy , he has made himself not only the most polarizing president since richard m nixon but also guaranteed himself a prominent place in the history books , and historical debate , for years to come this is a latterday wilson presidency , said richard norton smith , a scholar of the presidency and director of the abraham lincoln presidential library in springfield , ill , invoking woodrow wilson s impassioned intervention in world war i to make the world safe for democracy it s going to matter , it s going to be pointed to pro and con for a long time but any success for mr bush was also very much mr kerry s failure if mr bush struggled all year to post job approval ratings of 50 percent or better , a classic danger sign for an incumbent , mr kerry failed all year to open a clear lead in the national polls mr kerry was counting on millions of firsttime democratic voters to carry him through , and millions apparently did turn out , but probably not enough to make the difference many of those who chose mr kerry said they considered their vote to be against mr bush , not for their candidate , according to surveys of voters leaving the polls only about half the voters yesterday had a favorable view of mr kerry , about the same as for mr bush , and he dueled mr bush only to a draw on who would best handle the economy an issue that mr kerry had once hoped to make his signature voters who cited honesty as the most important quality in a candidate broke 2 to 1 in mr bush s favor , despite mr kerry s relentless accusations that mr bush had misled the public into war mr bush s chief political adviser , karl rove , had long believed that if he could draw out conservative and evangelical voters who stayed home four years ago , he could make the pie higher , as mr bush once memorably said of his goals for economic growth differences in the wording of exitpoll questions between this year and 2000 made a definitive early assessment of how well that succeeded difficult , but a third of all voters yesterday identified themselves as evangelicals , according to surveys of voters leaving the polls there were at least some signs that state ballot measures on gay marriage had helped boost conservative turnout while domestic issues like health care seemed to resonate with voters more than questions of foreign policy , the war in iraq was a drag on mr bush s support , as it has been all year while a bare majority of voters said the decision to go to war against saddam hussein was correct , a majority also said that it was going badly and had jeopardized the nation s longterm security it s not vietnam , but it stands in the shadow of vietnam , and as a consequence , people see this as similar , said robert dallek , a presidential historian and biographer of lyndon b johnson there is no question bush could have rallied the whole country to his side in the wake of sept 11 , and kept it there but he has been divisive and this is a knock on him mr bush s last presidential election may be over , but the first election in the postsaddam hussein iraq has yet to be held in his convention acceptance speech this summer , mr bush himself acknowledged that when he campaigned four years ago , none of us could have envisioned what these years would bring once again , mr bush and a divided nation may well have a chance to find out
the stecher and horowitz school of the arts in cedarhurst was a fixture in the five towns for 39 years , training more than 15 , 000 young musicians from throughout long island and metropolitan new york but in 1999 , its owners , melvin stecher and norman horowitz , sold the property still , the two , who are pianists and who performed together , did not have retirement in mind they became pianocompetition impresarios by founding the new york piano competition for musicians ages 14 to 18 we decided to expand our horizons into a national project , mr horowitz said in a telephone interview but it would not be a replica of existing competitions , mr stecher continued the two , who admit to hovering around 70 , set about creating a different model it would not , they said , eliminate contestants along the way , but instead would allow all the youngsters to continue performing , thus benefiting from accompanying coaching and master classes it would also reward every participant with at least a 1 , 000 scholarship , with more substantial amounts going to six major prize winners more than 125 pianists applied twentytwo from as far away as washington state and texas , but none from long island , were asked to contend the first competition , held in the summer of 2002 , is the subject of speaking with music , a documentary that will receive its world premiere today at 3 pm on channel 21 the film was made by lucy bruell , a former student at the music school whose previous films include a visit with the big apple circus clown care unit , which won the grand award at the new york international film and video festival besides detailing the performing and teaching careers and goals of mr stecher and mr horowitz , and the thinking of the judges , the film about the competition explores the motivations and aspirations of the 22 young competitors and the mothers who came to new york with them ms bruell s involvement stemmed from an accidental meeting on broadway in manhattan , mr horowitz recalled walking in the city , we 're often stopped by former students , which is what happened with lucy , who was mel s most brilliant student , not necessarily in piano , but certainly intellectually , he said when ms bruell , 51 , told them that after a career in broadcast journalism , she had become a filmmaker specializing in professional educational material , they invited her to document their competition but not just the performances , she said i wanted to find out from the kids and their parents why it was classical music over mtv and rock what drove them to do this \? over five days of filming , she said , she found some answers to those questions the youngsters , she said , were articulate , focused and passionate about what they are doing the camera often vividly captures these answers for example , there is the mother who points out her son s shaking hands and says competitions are a training ground for performances then , there is her son , adam golka , who says , i always have music going through my head this youngster did not win one of the major prizes , but mr stecher said he recently won first prize in the shanghai competition for pianists ages 17 to 32 , and will be performing throughout china performing , that s the important thing about the competition , mr horowitz said when mel and i were just starting out , there were 3 , 500 professional venues for young musicians today there are maybe 300 and it s important for young people to perform , for when you perform you learn the new york piano competition is currently accepting applications for its second event , to be held in june information \( 212 \) 5818380
the republican party opened its convention yesterday with a searing evocation of the sept 11 attacks that leveled the world trade center three years ago , as former mayor rudolph w giuliani of new york asserted that senator john kerry did not have the fortitude to lead the nation through a war on terror a procession of speakers including a former new york city police commissioner , the current mayor of new york and a former terrorism prosecutor invoked mr bush s leadership after sept 11 , 2001 , in the city where the attacks took their greatest toll to recount the tragedy that the president s aides view as the linchpin to his reelection three relatives of victims of the terrorist attacks , standing before the words september 11 , 2001 beamed in white on the darkened stage behind them , paid quiet tribute to their lost ones , as television cameras showed delegates , bathed in deep blue light , weeping mr giuliani , who was in the final months of his second term when the two planes rammed the towers , went even further , combining a withering attack on mr kerry s record and character with a description of his first hours at ground zero , and mr bush s visit there three days later , that at times left republicans gathered in madison square garden listening in stunned silence yes , people in public office at times change their minds , or realize that they are wrong i have , others have when they realize they are wrong or circumstances change , mr giuliani said but john kerry has made it the rule to change his position , rather than the exception excerpts , page p10 video , nytimescom the contrasts are dramatic , mr giuliani continued they involve very different views of how to deal with terrorism president bush will make certain that we are combating terrorism at the source , beyond our shores , so we can reduce the risk of having to confront , or run the risk of confronting it , here in new york or chicago john kerry s record of inconsistent positions on combating terrorism gives us no confidence he 'll pursue such a determined , difficult course earlier in the day , the party adopted without dissent a platform that set up a sharp contrast with the democrats , particularly in its strongly worded opposition to samesex unions and legalized abortion the remarks by mr giuliani left no doubt that the gathering would strike a notably different tenor than did the democratic gathering in boston at his nominating convention , mr kerry instructed his loyalists to refrain from excessive attacks on mr bush , though mr kerry s own acceptance speech was laced with attacks on mr bush s record by contrast , republicans have increasingly argued that the best strategy for mr bush s reelection was to use this week in new york to tear down mr kerry , given that voters know so much and have set opinions about their president still , this is complicated terrain , as became clear as mr bush , in an interview broadcast yesterday morning on nbc , said he did not know if the war on terrorism could ever be won after his remarks were broadcast , the white house spokesman , scott mcclellan , said that what mr bush meant was that the war on terrorism could not be won by conventional measures the other marquee speaker at the convention , senator john mccain of arizona , made no mention of mr kerry in his speech , reflecting both mr mccain s friendship with mr kerry and his longexpressed aversion to attack politics but mr mccain offered a spirited and detailed defense of mr bush s invasion of iraq , an issue that polls suggest has contributed greatly to growing doubts about his presidency he said that mr bush s aggressive foreign policy was required at a time when the united states was confronting the threat of chemical , nuclear or biological terror on its own soil our choice was n't between a benign status quo and the bloodshed of war , mr mccain said it was between war and a graver threat do n't let anyone tell you otherwise not our critics abroad not our political opponents and certainly not a disingenuous filmmaker who would have us believe that saddam s iraq was an oasis of peace , when in fact it was a place of indescribable cruelty , torture chambers , mass graves the filmmaker in question , michael moore , in the hall as a columnist for usa today , doffed his red cap and waved as the crowd interrupted mr mccain with prolonged boos at the mention of mr moore s movie , fahrenheit 9 11inevitably , it fell to mr giuliani , the mayor who became the face of the nation s response to the attacks , to make the case for mr bush , and against mr kerry , in the context of that day that led the republican party to hold its first convention in new york in its history he talked of the day with a level of detail he rarely uses , recounting , for example , arriving on west street to see a man hurtling out of a top window of the north tower on sept 11 , this city and our nation faced the worst attack in our history , mr giuliani said on that day , we had to confront reality for me , standing below the north tower and looking up and seeing the flames of hell and then realizing that i was actually seeing a man a human being jumping from the 101st or 102nd floor drove home to me that we were facing something beyond anything we had ever faced before at the time , we believed we would be attacked many more times that day and in the days that followed , mr giuliani said without really thinking , based on just emotion , spontaneously , i grabbed the arm of thenpolice commissioner bernard kerik and i said to him , 'bernie , thank god george bush is our president' and i say it again tonight , 'thank god george bush is our president mr giuliani turned from sober to animated , gesturing broadly as he lampooned mr kerry as a flipflopper the crowd , which shrank in size as the night went on , whooped in appreciation my point about john kerry being inconsistent is best described in his own words , not mine , when he said and i quote john kerry 'i actually did vote for the 87 billion before i voted against it , he said , recalling how mr kerry had tried to explain a procedural vote he had cast on financing military operations in iraq and afghanistan mr giuliani shrugged dramatically , and reminded his audience of the campaign slogan of mr kerry s running mate , senator john edwards of north carolina maybe this explains john edwards s need for two americas one where john kerry can vote for something and another where he can vote against the same thing , he said mr kerry s communications director , stephanie cutter , issued a statement denouncing mr giuliani for his attacks it is shocking that after four years , there s so little to talk about in praise of this president that republicans have to launch such vicious attacks , ms cutter said mr mccain , too , talked about mr bush s leadership of the nation after the sept 11 attacks , speaking in unrestrained and glowing terms about a man with whom he experienced a bitter primary in 2000 and whom he has shown no hesitancy about criticizing since mr bush won the white house i knew my confidence was wellplaced when i watched him stand on the rubble of the world trade center , with his arm around a hero of sept 11 , and in our moment of mourning and anger , strengthen our unity and our resolve by promising to right this terrible wrong and to stand up and fight for the values we hold dear , mr mccain said he promised our enemies would soon hear from us , he said and so they did the opening speeches and events of the convention left little doubt about why the republican party decided to hold its first convention in new york the republicans heard from tara stockpile , the widow of a new york city firefighter who ran through the doors of the world trade center but did not walk out debra burlingame , the sister of the captain of the american airlines plane that crashed into the pentagon and deena burnett , the wife of a passenger of the united airlines flight that crashed into a field in pennsylvania we know that what those passengers did prevented the airline from hitting the intended target , mrs burnett said to cheers at her reference to how the passengers had overpowered the hijackers the speeches competed for viewers with a preseason monday night football game on abc and fear factor on nbc none of the major networks broadcast the convention in prime time the networks decided to cover only three hours across three nights of the democratic and republican conventions and collectively decided that , in addition to the acceptance speeches by vice president dick cheney tomorrow and mr bush on thursday , they would cover tonight , when the first lady laura bush and gov arnold schwarzenegger of california would be the most newsworthy mr bush campaigned yesterday in new hampshire and michigan but several of the nation s best known republicans were on hand , among them mr bush s father , the former president barbara bush and mr cheney the delegates greeted the former president and his wife by waving cowboy hats in the air
they used to call dick pretzinger the land baron of hook creek for 43 years , he made his home in the canyon the creek flows through , raising his children and horses under towering pines to the sound of a rippling stream his 3 , 400squarefoot house was filled with so many mementos an 8 , 000 saddle with silver spurs , a music room full of instruments that his granddaughter named it the museum but when a wildfire roared through the san bernardino mountains in late october , mr pretzinger s home and those of about 350 of his neighbors in and around cedar glen were obliterated , leaving this small community east of los angeles one of the most heavily damaged of all those hit by the blazes that raged across southern california for 10 days mr pretzinger s property , now fenced to ward off looters , resembles a blackened trash dump , full of twisted metal and broken objects lost to the flames the rest of the canyon is no different , forever scarred it looks like a nuclear bomb went off , said charis scanlon , a founder of rebuilding mountain hearts and lives , a new organization in neighboring lake arrowhead that is coordinating assistance for homeowners like mr pretzinger more than two months after the fires , which destroyed 3 , 600 homes and burned nearly 740 , 000 acres across the state , residents of san bernardino county and the eight other affected counties are growing increasingly anxious and frustrated many victims here are demanding to know why firefighters failed to reach the canyons to save their houses some are realizing , too late , that their properties were underinsured , while others are gearing up for a fight with building officials who are trying to enforce codes established long after their homes were built in many cases , the new codes would sharply limit rebuilding in narrow canyons and on steep mountainsides the whole thing is a bureaucratic boondoggle , said mr pretzinger , 76 , a retired civil engineer and surveyor who is leading the effort to get the county building codes relaxed he is also trying to stave off proposed rules for mountain areas that would require new homes to have doublepaned windows , nonflammable roofing and fireresistant materials for walls and decks mr pretzinger and other residents fear the rules would make rebuilding too expensive it s going to take us five or six years to get even close to where we were , said camie pretzinger , mr pretzinger s daughterinlaw , who raised her three boys , now 15 , 13 and 11 , in a nearby house that was also burned to the ground she and other former residents of hook creek are furious that utility companies sent crews with heavy cranes into the canyon to remove damaged trees in the process , they say , further damaging the foundations of some houses without surviving foundations , residents fear , the county will declare the properties a complete loss , making it unlikely that they will be allowed to build new homes there adding to their anxiety , recent rains have swept acres of topsoil off the denuded hills , with the prospect of more rain as the wet season approaches if those foundations are washed out we could be in big trouble , mrs pretzinger said a few miles down the mountain , 14 people , some of them children , were killed when a storm sent mud cascading through waterman canyon on christmas day in the next few days , san bernardino county officials plan to send letters warning 75 , 000 property owners in a 31mile firedamaged area of the potential for more floods and mudslides the prospect of more disasters is hard to take in a county that lost almost 151 , 000 acres and 659 homes in the wildfires across southern california , 22 people died , including one firefighter , and 260 people were injured so far , insurance claims exceed 4 billion in the nine counties affected by the fires in the midst of the uncertainty over rebuilding , survivors of the fire face continuing deadlines for their paperwork about 33 , 000 people have requested disaster assistance from the federal emergency management agency , many of them at an emergency assistance center at san bernardino international airport in san diego county , the pace of reconstruction is not much faster than it is here , with only a dozen or so permits for rebuilding singlefamily houses issued so far county officials say they are trying to speed up the permit review process while making it easier for those with mobile homes to find places to park victims have been scattered far and wide , many staying with friends and relatives or in hotels and rented apartments in scripps ranch , one of the most devastated communities in san diego county , with 341 homes lost or damaged , neighbors are helping one another about 300 volunteers have formed committees to help fire victims with everything from school car pools to house rebuilding the biggest thing weighing on my mind is having to list all the things we lost , said bob younger , who had lived in wildcat canyon , northeast of san diego , for just seven months before fleeing his home with his family as flames approached unlike many other people , mr younger said he was satisfied with his insurance company s response to his claim some people are finding out that they 're only getting 81 a square foot in reconstruction costs , when the real cost is 200 , he said and , of course , some people have no insurance at all in lake arrowhead , terry adams said she was feeling the weight of negotiating with adjustors we are having nothing but problems with our insurance , said mrs adams , a social worker at mountains community hospital who has been living in a little rental since her home in cedar glen burned to the ground her husband , kurt adams , had another target for his wrath our house could have been saved , so we have a lot of anger about that , said mr adams , 51 , who said he was semiretired from the computer industry the firefighters never went back there lake arrowhead , a mountain resort town that gets most of its business from weekend travelers from los angeles and san bernardino , was untouched by the fires , although its boundaries were singed none of us have ever gone through anything like this , said suzanne kushner , the owner of razzbearies' cookies and muffins , a coffee shop in the town s central square though her home was saved , she said , her business lost more than 25 , 000 in the days after the fire because the entire area had been evacuated she was recently turned down for a small business administration loan to see her through what she expects will be a rough winter because , she said , our financial condition looked so bleak that they did n't think we could pay it back business was already off long before the fires , she said , because potential visitors had been alarmed by reports that the mountains posed a fire danger , primarily as a result of infestations by pests that killed thousands of trees the economy up here has just been devastated , ms kushner said bark beetles , fires , the bad economy we 've had it all even though the fire is out , we 're not through this if we have rain , we 'll have mudslides and rock slides , and no business it s going to be a challenging year
nicole thompson had been at columbia university for only a few weeks when she went out drinking with a group of friends downtown last year and became separated from them she had skipped her medication for bipolar disorder now it was 3 am and , crying and in a panic , she called friends she told them , she said , that she just wished the traffic would take me out although she made it back to campus safely , her friends had already notified columbia that they were worried about her for columbia officials , it was the first clue that ms thompson faced any kind of mental health problems i was n't on columbia s radar at all , said ms thompson , who is back on campus now after being forced to take a medical leave increasingly , college officials and mental health experts have come to realize that many of the most vulnerable students the ones prone to selfinjury and suicide are like ms thompson they never go near the counseling centers or reveal anything about their experience before college as a result , colleges are stepping up efforts to find them and to get them into treatment , sometimes forcing them to leave temporarily the goal is to help students like ms thompson but colleges have more at stake suicide the secondbiggest cause of death among college students can be costly , injuring reputations and prompting litigation the suicide of a student at the massachusetts institute of technology , elizabeth shin , in 2000 , and strings of suicides at new york university , george washington university and the university of illinois , have drawn wide attention there has also been a rise in lawsuits involving student suicides ann h franke , a vice president of united educators , a company that insures 1 , 200 universities , colleges and schools , said suicide prevention had risen in priority as claims had risen her company , ms franke said , now has a handful of claims , up from none six years ago they can be very severe claims financially , ms franke said , not to mention the emotional and reputational impact they can have on a school in a closely watched case , the family of elizabeth shin has sued mit for 27 million one study of suicides on college campuses , based on a dozen universities in the 1980 s , found a rate of about 75 per 100 , 000 students , which is about half the rate for young adults not in college and represents about 1 , 100 suicides a year for the entire college population although there have not been comparable studies since then , most mental health experts say they believe the rate has remained at about that level to address the problem , emory university and the university of north carolina are inviting students to fill out anonymous mental health questionnaires duke university is asking faculty members to be alert to changes in behavior noticing , for example , when a student suddenly becomes sullen or quiet , or stays away from class columbia , new york university and cornell now place counselors in residence halls the university of illinois and the university of puget sound in tacoma , wash , are requiring any student who threatens or attempts suicide to attend counseling sessions but the best way to reach these students remains unclear , and students do not always welcome the intervention some experts fear that forcing students to enter treatment or to take a medical leave can dissuade others from asking for help and discourage their friends from sounding the alarm , even though students who take such leaves generally come back and graduate the recent forced withdrawal of a freshman at nyu was frontpage news in the student newspaper , washington square news the student , sue schaller , told the paper that although she had been briefly hospitalized for depression and suicidal thoughts , she felt much better when she returned to campus and wanted to stay in school , but that the university would not let her an editorial in the newspaper called for the university to do everything it can , including requiring therapy and regular checkins , to ensure that troubled students who wish to remain on campus can stay and that they pose as little risk as possible , adding , pushing those students out of the university community is not the answer in retrospect , ms thompson , the columbia student , said she had mixed feelings about how the university treated her she said she still felt wounded by the process she called it a charade that ejected her from school even with things going smoothly , ms thompson , whose dark hair is tinted purple and who speaks with energy and humor , said her mind sometimes wandered to what she missed last year , while she was on leave , and to the possibility of running into new trouble i am so scared about screwing up , she said , and of being sent home again columbia officials declined to comment on ms thompson s case they said that the university did not keep statistics on how many students were forced to go home , but that there were few of them for years , colleges and universities have been grappling with a growing flood of students with histories of mental illness most have expanded the number of counselors and the hours they are available but now they are going further some are turning to the internet as a way to bring troubled students in for help the american foundation for suicide prevention has developed an anonymous online mental health questionnaire and a program to steer troubled students to counseling , which is being tested at emory and the university of north carolina those involved say the initial results seem promising at emory , which started using the program in 2002 , only 8 percent of the students who received the survey filled it out , but 85 percent of those students were deemed at moderate or high risk of suicide or other severe problems based on their responses to the questionnaire they are encouraged to speak to a counselor on or off campus , or to consult anonymously with a counselor online the yield is relatively small , said ann haas , research director for the suicideprevention foundation however , we are absolutely convinced that those kids would not have gotten into treatment we think we are reaching the right kids many campuses , including duke and mit , are asking faculty and staff members and students to tell a dean or the counseling office if they see students who show signs of depression or potential suicide at duke , when faculty members or parents relay concerns about students to larry moneta , the vice president for student affairs , he and members of the residence hall staff check up on the students , sometimes surreptitiously many times i 've called the residence hall staff and asked if they can dispatch a paraprofessional to inadvertently drop by a student s room as if it were a casual encounter , dr moneta said i do that all the time after ms shin s suicide , mit began running training sessions for faculty members , departmental administrators , athletic coaches , dormitory personnel , fraternities and sororities to help them spot people showing signs of problems one of several steps recommended by a mental health task force created after the suicide cornell is making a special effort to reach out to asian and asianamerican students of 16 students there who have committed suicide since 1996 , 9 were of asian descent the university created a task force to explore those students' experience at cornell and how to help them when they have problems , since they do not use cornell s counseling services at the same rate as their classmates , said susan h murphy , the university s vice president for student and academic services often when they do seek help , they are in real crisis , ms murphy said colleges are also leaning more heavily on students who show suicidal tendencies to enter counseling several are examining or adopting a program developed by the university of illinois at urbanachampaign , requiring any student who threatens or attempts suicide to attend at least four counseling sessions paul joffe , the program s director , said the results had been good all but one of nearly 2 , 000 students in the program over 20 years remained at the university during the counseling sessions , and none committed suicide and although the university has had suicides among students not in the program including six in the last academic year it says its suicide rate is about half of what it was before the program started while some college officials question whether students should be forced into counseling , others favor the heavyhanded approach the university of puget sound , one of the campuses that recently began using the illinois approach , bluntly describes the program as a public statement that suicide is unacceptable here we do n't know what it is about that model that is so effective , said donn marshall , director of counseling , health and wellness services at puget sound is it that somebody stands up and says suicide is unacceptable \? or is it that somebody says , 'i care' \? or is it something about what happens in the four sessions with a psychologist \? when ms thompson arrived at columbia last year from nashville , she had been struggling with bipolar disorder and problems with drinking and drugs , and she had a cabinetful of medications she had planned to contact the counseling service to find someone to talk to , but three weeks into the school year , she had not gotten around to it she said she had arrived confident she could succeed there was a big todo before i went to school to ask my doctors if i was ready , she said they all said yes what most put her off about the way columbia handled her case , she said , was the quick interview with a university psychologist that she thought was intended to figure out what she needed to do to stay at school , but that she later learned was to decide whether she should be allowed to remain she said she had been totally candid in talking to him , because i 've talked to a lot of psychologists , and realized that if you tried to butter them up , you do n't get the help you need but she said she did not believe the university had been equally candid he worked for the school , not the patient , she said if they do n't tell you that , you lose trust the kids they are dealing with are smart enough to understand the dynamic after the fact margo d amgott , assistant vice president for health services at columbia , said the university tried to make sure students understood that the interview was for the university s evaluation purposes and even required that they sign a document saying they understood ms thompson said that while she did indeed signed papers , she had had no choice , and thought that the decision to stay or leave would still be up to her and her family but when she and her father talked about lining up support for her in new york , they learned that it was not their call , and she was given four days to move out of her room being sent home to nashville just three weeks into her freshman year made her feel worse rather than better , she said , and she ended up in a psychiatric hospital she said that now that she was back at columbia , she was doing well she is majoring in anthropology and has a latenight radio program , zombies vs ballerinas , that features groups like mogwai and while she is in regular touch with a college adviser assigned to her , she has not sought psychological help , either at columbia or outside last year s treatment was so expensive that it has driven my father into debt , ms thompson said it makes me feel guilty
east rutherford , nj , oct 22 in giants coach tom coughlin s view , he and detroit coach steve mariucci s teams are in the same boat mariucci has simply been steering his for one season longer they took over losing teams with the challenge of turning them around we are in the first stage of this program , coughlin said what our objective was is to be as good a football team as we possibly could , as fast as we could and i think theirs is probably the same way all nfl rebuilding projects , however , are not the same the teams meeting on sunday in giants stadium were languishing last season and now seem to be on the road to a successful rebound the similarities end just about there the giants' 41 start has been achieved on the backs of the team s surviving nucleus from better seasons and freeagent additions , 24 last offseason alone they are being hailed around the league for a remarkably quick resurgence the lions are 32 and lauded largely for the stockpile of talent they have drafted in the past few years they seem to be on the verge of bigger things , but young players seldom produce fast turnarounds in fact , the giants loathe the term rebuilding they consider their 412 record a speed bump for an otherwise successful franchise they also operate in a market with a lot of competition for metropolitan new yorkers' discretionary dollars , and where rebuilding teams do not fare well we are all measured by the yankees' success , giants general manager ernie accorsi said you have to be as competitive as you can as quickly as you can it s 'win or else' here the giants' approach was to keep the top players under contract , if possible , and add buildingblock free agents around them and throw in an impatient , harddriving coach to pull it all together they did the same thing , minus the impatient , harddriving coach , to get to the super bowl after the 2000 season before the 2003 season , when the lions hired mariucci after his successful years shepherding san francisco , they had much less to build on they had not been to a playoff game since the 1999 season , when they lost in the first round and despite a decent run of success in barry sanders s heyday in the 90 s , detroit had not won a playoff game since 1991 the lions had sunk to the bottom of the league and seemed stuck there their management decided to use the high draft picks that came with their misery and build that way they hired matt millen as general manager in january 2001 he snared mariucci two years later , drafted quarterback joey harrington and a fleet of skill players and weathered the bumps that come with that road this year , the lions signed six free agents who have ended up as starters , including offensive guard damien woody from the patriots and cornerback fernando bryant from the jaguars , but none were high profile and they remain the exception rather than the rule the average age of the lions' starters is 27 , and five of them are 25 or younger the giants' starters , in contrast , average 286 years and one of their two rookie starters , safety gibril wilson , is starting only because of injuries to two veteran safeties the lions start three rookies , largely by design nobody said it was easy , mariucci said in a conference call this week you go through ups and downs like crazy , but it s kind of challenging and it s kind of fun we know where we 're heading and we have a plan and we 're sticking to the plan the best example of the giants' and the lions' divergence is at quarterback in 2002 , the lions used the no 3 overall pick to select harrington , who started from his very first game now 26 and playing his third season , harrington has 33 career starts and should be hitting his stride this season the giants used their no 4 pick this year to trade for quarterback eli manning , who was drafted no 1 over all after cutting the veteran kerry collins because of a salary squabble , the giants were not prepared to ride out the adventures of a rookie quarterback so they went out and signed kurt warner , a former twotime nfl most valuable player people said when we drafted eli that we were giving up the season , accorsi said well , we did n't go out and sign kurt warner because we were giving up the season manning now works on his future only in practice , getting a few snaps in the giants' opening blowout loss to the eagles one of the perils of detroit s approach is that developing young players often pays off for another team take linebacker barrett green the lions drafted him in the second round in 2000 and he grew into a fast , aggressive player his coaches loved he became a free agent in 2004 and bolted for the giants although the giants seem on the surer path at the moment , it does not stop accorsi from looking at the lions with admiration and a little envy he said they were doing a good job with their draft picks and he said he believed they would quickly grow into their potential i always wondered what it would be like to take over a team that was really down and have five years to build it , accorsi said i'm not sure anybody really gets five years anymore , but i just always thought it would be fun the giants chose fast over fun
some years ago a young violinist asked pierre boulez why he had never written a string quartet because the string quartet is dead , mr boulez said like most of his notorious death sentences , this one proved spectacularly wrong in recent decades the string quartet has enjoyed an impressive revival , and with good reason throughout its history the string quartet has been a favored medium for classical composers it is an unusually supple vehicle , alternately intimate and orchestral , conversational and introspective a small group that lends itself to big statements the glory of western art music from the classical age to the modernist era was bound up with the great quartet cycles of haydn and beethoven , bartok and shostakovich but by the 1950 s fewer composers were writing for the string quartet , which had been overshadowed by more exotic ensembles it began to seem as quaint as a sunday afternoon chamber concert at the local church it might have continued to languish but for the advocacy of two ensembles the san franciscobased kronos quartet , founded in 1973 by david harrington , its first violinist and the londonbased arditti quartet , founded a year later by irvine arditti , the violinist involved in the boulez exchange passionate , unflagging champions of new music , the two groups have , between them , commissioned nearly a thousand works that achievement alone should earn them a lasting place in music history they have also inspired a wave of young string quartets that specialize in contemporary music , including ethel and the meridian and flux quartets in america , and the brodsky , keller and balanescu quartets in europe not to mention the salutary impact they have had on the classical music scene as a whole , which has become a little less staid and a little more open twenty years ago kronos and the arditti quartet were widely seen as spiritual cousins or , perhaps more accurately , intercontinental rivals they were playing much of the same music and working with some of the same composers john cage , morton feldman , alfred schnittke , conlon nancarrow they still are both groups have recently released excellent recordings of alban berg s lyric suite yet it is their differences one notices these days kronos \( with john sherba , second violinist hank dutt , violist and jennifer culp , cellist \) has won a popular following by emphasizing tonal music , american and eastern european minimalism , and transcriptions of jazz , rock and world music the arditti quartet \( with graeme jennings , ralf ehlers and rohan de saram \) has remained committed to the european postwar avantgarde and coolly indifferent to popular trends kronos s playing , though long on verve , is sometimes short on refinement the arditti quartet s is often as glacial as it is magisterial kronos s performances , theatrical and entertaining , feature amplification , splashy costumes , dramatic lighting and , more recently , videos it wants to give its fans and its audiences are nothing if not adoring an experience , in mr harrington s favorite word in the arditti quartet s nofrills performances , the music is the experience the difference between kronos and arditti concerts is like that between exhibitions at the whitney museum and the museum of modern art some of the difference has to with nationality kronos , a distinctively american ensemble , has sought , in timehonored american fashion , to defy convention by embracing a cheerfully inclusive populism the arditti quartet , in contrast , has sought to extend the tradition of european modernism , with results no less adventurous but far more somber leadership is an even bigger factor like other distinguished groups , kronos and the arditti quartet each benefit from the shaping vision of a strong , determined leader mr harrington , who was born in seattle in 1949 , is an aging hippie with an infectious love of the string quartet and a disarming desire to play the music he loves whether it s meant for strings or not the seeds of his interest in string quartets were planted when , at 12 , he heard the budapest quartet s recording of beethoven s opus 127 quartet those e flat major chords had a wildness to them , and they became my private connection to the world of music , he said on a recent visit to new york i just had to play that music yet his interest was never limited to classical music as a teenager he listened not only to berg , bartok and stravinsky but also to hendrix , coltrane and african music if hendrix were alive today , he said , i would do everything in my power to get him to write for kronos early on , he chafed at the narrowness of the string quartet repertory i remember getting out my globe one day and seeing vienna way over there , he said , and thinking , ok , haydn was from over there , and so were mozart , beethoven , schubert , brahms and , later on , schoenberg , berg and webern a lot of incredible musicians but vienna is one little city how come there was n't any quartet music from africa , from asia , from the middle east \? it did n't feel right to me why should one care whether the great composers and improvisers of the third world are writing for string quartet when one can hear their music arguably at its best on native instruments \? but i wanted to play it , mr harrington said i think that the string quartet is capable of reflecting so many different feelings about life and so many sounds it s a very generous medium , and there s room for so many approaches and possibilities mr harrington has spent much of his career courting musicians who never considered writing for string quartet during the 1980 s he commissioned works from composers outside the mainstream , like terry riley , the california minimalist astor piazzolla , the argentine master of the nuevo tango and john zorn , the new york bender of genres since the 90 s mr harrington has ventured ever further afield from the tradition of notated music kronos has not abandoned composers writing in the western tradition last summer it released a beautiful recording of the fourth quartet by the latvian composer peteris vasks , a wintry , ruminative work with echoes of bartok , shostakovich and p rt but the emphasis has clearly shifted toward what mr harrington calls the space between the notes what excites mr harrington these days \? sigur ros , he said , citing the experimental band from iceland that churns out sonorous , funereal art rock for me these are young musicians , in their 20 s , whose approach is spiritual what they 're doing reminds me of the music of gorecki and p rt what else has he been listening to lately \? bjork , tom waits , godspeed you black emperor and mogwai i spend a lot of time listening to music , he said , but not to string quartet music mr arditti s views on the future of the string quartet could hardly be more different at the end of the day , i think composers who are in the tradition of writing classical string quartet music do it better , he said people have to know what they 're doing when they write for the quartet unlike mr harrington , mr arditti , who was born in london in 1953 and studied at the royal academy of music , never much cared for pop i was always a fanatic for contemporary music , he said recently from boston everyone else was listening to the beatles , and i was listening to wayout music berio , xenakis , ligeti and later boulez none of my friends understood me i never got into jazz i was loyal to contemporary music that s why i do n't like playing crossover pieces by contemporary music , mr arditti has something fairly specific in mind music of formal rigor and originality , music that , as he puts it , extends the sound of the string quartet we do n't want to be pigeonholed as the quartet that plays the most difficult , complicated music , he said but the arditti quartet has made no great effort to dispel that impression to hear it perform xenakis s tetras , a work with dense , coiled masses of sound in no recognizable harmonic language , is to be reminded of the shock of modernism , the forceful , pitiless challenge it still presents to received ways of understanding music as for composers writing tonal music , mr arditti blithely said , they 're less interesting you can imagine what he thinks of kronos twenty years ago we had much more in common , he said now there s very little in common i do n't know what they 're doing now , but i think they 're playing very light stuff they 're very concerned about appealing to people and how many cd s they 're selling we do take our public with us , but those who do n't like to come along we do n't go past a certain point to persuade while kronos has traveled far and wide collecting musical experiences , the arditti quartet has focused on more conventional modernism , recording the complete works of virtually every composer in the tradition , from schoenberg and webern to luigi nono and helmut lachenmann the arditti quartet s vast recorded output is an indispensable library that will be consulted by musicians and fans for years yet it is also a monument to how hermetic modernism can be for if kronos has perhaps paid excessive tribute to popular music , the arditti quartet has all but ignored it does mr arditti take pleasure in the fact that popular bands like radiohead and sigur ros are drawing inspiration from the great modernist composers \? i do n't know much about pop composers who listen to contemporary music , he said but i can understand why they would it s difficult to be original why not learn from someone who s more skilled than you are \? then again , why not learn from someone who is or rather , appears to be less skilled than you are \? when i first started listening to contemporary music , as a teenager , i was a partisan of the arditti quartet s severe , uncompromising aesthetic its fearless devotion to the challenges of modernism , its who cares if you listen \? attitude as much as i loved kronos s recordings of schnittke and p rt , i felt betrayed by its forays into world music and rock , which struck me as cowardly capitulations to commerce these days i'm struck by how much great music the arditti quartet has neglected , works by the likes of mr zorn and steve reich i'm still skeptical of kronos s taste for transcriptions of african music that sounds far better in the original instrumentation yet kronos has also championed some of the most original talents in contemporary music , and its willingness to risk failure for the sake of a piece the players love commands respect though it cannot match the arditti quartet s technical mastery few quartets can kronos plays with poetry , charm , humor and a jazzinflected swing that is rare among classical musicians by the force of their distinctive sound , mr harrington and his colleagues have triumphed over their imperfections in the end , whatever competition exists between kronos and the arditti quartet can only be healthy if you have four dedicated musicians like us and kronos who play together every day , mr arditti said , it s going to be more interesting for composers mr boulez , for his part , still has n't written a string quartet but mr arditti did receive an apology from him recently remember what i said about the string quartet being dead \? i'm sorry , irvine , i was wrong
a pu pu platter is always a dicey proposition there s usually a soggy egg roll or a gristly spare rib involved but the downtown plays , an assortment of small works assembled to inaugurate the first tribeca theater festival , makes a pretty satisfying theatrical meal presented through sunday at the michael schimmel center for the arts at pace university , in a snappy production directed by john rando , the plays are provided by a virtual who s who of name playwrights douglas carter beane \( artistic chief of the drama dept off broadway , who played ringleader and cheerleader for the project \) , david henry hwang , kenneth lonergan , warren leight , jon robin baitz , frank pugliese , neil labute , paul rudnick and wendy wasserstein the cast is a firstclass lineup of familiar off broadway faces , too such glittering grabbag productions , invariably put together for a righteous cause , can often result in a dreary evening of leftovers or nonstarters but most of the participants here are working somewhere near the top of their form there is no need to single out an mvp for the night , but prime consideration must be given to the heavenly combo of mr rudnick and jackie hoffman , who together in pride and joy have created the funniest 10 minutes of theater to be seen on a new york stage in recent memory ms hoffman , the gawky , squawky comedian who mugs gloriously throughout hairspray , plays helene nadler , a matron from massapequa , on long island , addressing a support group for parents of gay offspring she boldly claims for herself the title of most accepting , most loving mother of all time , bar none not for helene the consumerfriendly gays seen on shows like will and grace \( it s as if pottery barn sold people \) no , her balding , flabby son , ronnie , has to announce he s really a woman inside what woman , ed asner \?

to the editor re back to square one at ground zero june 6 the renewed opportunity to consider cultural plans for ground zero would stay narrow if it included only american institutions as part of the mix a grander vision would be to invite cultural institutions and artists from around the world museums , theaters , orchestras , filmmakers , composers , choreographers , etc to participate in studio programs under the aegis of a world art center in downtown new york not unlike ps 1 , the queens museum that began as a studio program for visual artists from many countries , but on a much larger and more complex scale , the world art center would enable artists and producers to inhabit a vibrant network of production spaces works that were developed would be funneled onto stages and exhibition spaces that are intimately linked to the studios an economic formula could be worked out that combines investments by international cultural bodies and governments with a grantmaking program funded by new yorkers in this way , the new cultural nucleus of new york city would avoid becoming a warren of fiefdoms and dependencies , each hampered by the politics of the parent organization and none open to a vision of global cultural exchange peter stastny manhattan
a nationwide survey on the extent and causes of sexual abuse by members of the roman catholic clergy has found that 4 , 450 priests have been accused of sexually abusing minors since 1950 , according to a cnn report about a draft of the survey results that is a higher number than has previously been estimated by any news outlet or by most experts those with knowledge of the survey results would not comment on the accuracy of the cnn report the survey was commissioned by a national review board of prominent catholic laypeople appointed by the bishops at the height of the sexual abuse scandal in 2002 and was conducted by researchers at the john jay college of criminal justice in new york city the survey is based on information supplied by the bishops of nearly all of the nation s 195 catholic dioceses , where tens of thousands of priests have served since 1950 it was designed to be the most comprehensive accounting yet of the scope of sexual abuse by members of the catholic clergy the survey is scheduled to be released on feb 27 at a news conference in washington the same day , the review board is supposed to release a lengthy report examining why the problem of sexual abuse persisted in the church and what factors were to blame the board s report , written by a committee led by the washington lawyer robert s bennett , is based on interviews with more than 100 church officials , experts and victims of abuse neither the john jay report nor the national review board reports are complete , mr bennett said they 're a work in process , and people should wait until the 27th before drawing any conclusions about any of it cnn reported that there were 11 , 000 accusations of sexual abuse by priests and that 6 , 700 were substantiated after investigations the network said that 1 , 000 were unsubstantiated after investigations and that the remaining 3 , 300 were not investigated because the accused priests had died cnn did not say how it learned the survey results or whether it had actually seen a draft none of the bishops have yet seen the survey results , and they are not expected to have the survey in hand until immediately before its public release , spokesmen for the bishops said the only people who have seen the survey results are members of the review board and researchers at john jay , all of whom were expected to keep the results confidential , mr bennett said several board members and a john jay official contacted on monday would not say whether the cnn report was accurate bishop wilton d gregory , president of the united states conference of catholic bishops , said in a statement on monday these reports will be a very sobering and important milestone i have not seen the reports , and so i cannot comment on their substance but i want to reaffirm that the bishops requested these studies so that we could understand as fully as possible what caused this terrible occurrence in the life of our community and to make sure that it never happens again
washington , oct 8 the house adopted a republicansponsored bill on friday that wou \) restructure the nation s intelligence community in response to the recommendations of the sept 11 commission but the measure is so different from a bipartisan senate bill that many lawmakers say it may be impossible to reconcile them the bill , adopted 282 to 134 as many house members prepared to return home this weekend to campaign for reelection , would establish the job of national intelligence director , a central proposal of the sept 11 commission but the intelligence director would have significantly less authority over budgets and personnel than the commission recommended or than the senate bill sets forth the house bill also has a variety of law enforcement and immigration provisions not requested by the commission and opposed by democratic lawmakers and civil liberties groups some of the provisions would make it harder for immigrants to obtain political asylum and would subject them to speedy deportation without judicial review friday s vote came after two days of often starkly partisan debate , with democratic lawmakers accusing the house republican leadership of trying to sabotage final passage of a bill to enact the commission s recommendations in its final report in july , the 10member commission documented a long history of incompetence and turf battles among intelligence and counterterrorism agencies , and urged that the agencies be brought under the control of a single , powerful intelligence director the leaders of the bipartisan commission enthusiastically supported the senate bill , which was adopted wednesday on a 96to2 vote with none of the partisanship evident in the house the commission leaders had urged house members to use it as a model but late thursday night , the house rejected a bill that was similar in many ways to the senate measure and would have been easier to reconcile in a conference committee it s not hard to see what s going on here , said representative carolyn b maloney , democrat of new york some say that the goal of the republican leadership is to pass a bill that cannot be reconciled with the senate bill before the election the republican leadership knows that after the elections , when the political pressure is off , the prospects for reform will vanish speaker j dennis hastert said that for many house democrats opposed to the bill , it is simply their nature to complain mr hastert promised that a housesenate conference committee would quickly agree on a compromise bill that could be sent to president bush for his signature at the end of the day , we will enact a law that will make america safer and the american people proud , he said the new chairman of the house intelligence committee , peter hoekstra , republican of michigan , said the house bill reflected the obligation of house members to put our imprint on the recommendations of the 9 11 commission and to improve on them the committee s ranking democrat , representative jane harman of california , said the house bill was evidence of a highly partisan process devised by republican leaders in responding to the findings of the sept 11 commission in case anybody missed it , the terrorists did n't check our party labels before they attacked us , and they certainly wo n't care whether we 're democrats or republicans when they try to attack us again , ms harman said house and senate leaders have promised to establish a conference committee within days that will negotiate during the congressional recess that begins this weekend the conferees will be asked to reconcile the many differences in the two bills , notably those on the powers of a national intelligence director they will also have to decide whether the compromise bill should retain the immigration and lawenforcement provisions that republican leaders tacked onto the house bill even though they were not sought by the sept 11 commission in the final hours of the house debate , republican leaders beat back two amendments to eliminate the provisions making it harder for immigrants to obtain asylum and speeding up deportation house leaders did agree to amend wording that would have allowed the government to deport foreign terror suspects to countries where they could face torture the amendment , proposed by representative john hostettler , republican of indiana , would allow the department of homeland security to detain the suspects but would bar deportation until after the state department had sought assurances that they would not be harmed it will protect the american people from dangerous aliens while continuing our nation s proud history of providing refuge for the innocent , mr hostettler said but representative christopher h smith , republican of new jersey , a longstanding advocate of human rights causes in the house , said the bill would erect a number of brandnew barriers to asylum claims and would result in bona fide refugees being returned to their persecutors the final house bill would allow speedy deportation , without judicial review , of illegal immigrants who have been in the united states less than five years , compared with two years under current law the legislation would make it easier for an immigration judge to dismiss asylum claims based on a number of factors , including a petitioner s demeanor it would also increase the burden of proof imposed on asylum seekers who are accused of being terrorists by their home governments , which critics said could threaten dissidents fleeing repressive governments opponents of the provisions , including some republicans from districts with large immigrant communities , scoffed at the idea that repressive governments like those of cuba or sudan could be trusted if they gave assurances that their citizens deported from the united states would not be subjected to torture it is unfortunate to diminish the rights of people who are legitimately fearing for their lives , said representative lincoln diazbalart , a republican whose southern florida district includes many immigrants from cuba

in some respects , it is the nominating convention that senator edward m kennedy never had while the week will ultimately belong to the junior senator from massachusetts , the senior senator and his family have left no doubt that this week s gathering of democrats is also the moment to celebrate the patriarch of a family whose name is synonymous with american politics dozens of kennedy family members and friends have assembled in massachusetts in advance of mr kennedy s primetime speech tuesday at the convention he labored to bring to his home state there were weekend clambakes out on the cape a dedication on monday of boston s newest parkland in honor of mr kennedy s late mother , rose followed by a lunch and later dinner for 50 at one of boston s top restaurants a tribute concert tuesday night at symphony hall will feature the boston pops , yoyo ma and bono of the band u2 it is really a celebration of his life , said dr lawrence horowitz , a former chief of staff to the senator and among those associated with his career who have descended on boston it is both emotional for him and i think very rewarding the 72yearold senator is expected to run again in 2006 , probably for the last time so there is a sense among his close allies that the convention is the perfect spectacle to serve as the backdrop to honor mr kennedy s four decades as senator more than 100 assorted kennedy kin of all ages including maria shriver but not her husband , gov arnold schwarzenegger of california attended the dedication of the rose fitzgerald kennedy greenway , the open space and garden replacing the elevated highway that cut through boston before it was demolished it is great , said joseph p kennedy ii , the senator s nephew and a former congressman everybody is together lot of football , lot of sailing , lot of sports down at the cape over the weekend mr kennedy is clearly enjoying himself but the emotion is obvious as well his voice choked as he concluded the dedication of the parkland his pride in his city and his family s role in it was clear i love boston , he declared this is where the roots of all my family are this is where my grandparents entered the united states in 1848 my grandfather was the mayor it is the city president kennedy represented in congress this is where my mother was born i personally draw great strength from the city i am proud of its past , the role that it played in the beginning and the role it played in the last 150 years mr kennedy has closely guarded the theme of his convention speech , which is expected to last 20 minutes or so , though there were hints that the historic leadership role of his state in protecting liberty would be an element despite the celebration of mr kennedy s achievements , there was a bittersweet aspect as well the convention is a reminder that he never was able to grab the presidential nomination for himself , despite his efforts in 1980 and the constant expectation that he would try to follow in the footsteps of his older brother there is a certain nostalgia in this , said representative bill delahunt , a massachusetts democrat who likes to note that he is mr kennedy s representative but mr delahunt said mr kennedy had made a larger mark developing his legislative expertise and pursuing social policy over 40 years in the senate than he could have done even with eight years in the white house with all due respect to president kennedy and robert kennedy , due to the failed presidential campaign , ted kennedy ended up exceeding their contributions , mr delahunt said his legacy exceeds his brothers' lawrence s dicara , a former boston city council member who credits mr kennedy with bringing in federal aid that has helped transform boston over the years , said i have known him for a long time i have never seen him happier with himself and happier with his role one thing mr kennedy is not happy about is the prospect of another bush term despite some work together early in mr bush s tenure and evidence of a friendly relationship , mr kennedy is one of the president s harshest critics he has been relentless in his criticism of the war in iraq , and his allies say he is also disturbed that he helped mr bush enact the no child left behind law , which mr kennedy says was then not given enough money to make it work i have not seen him so motivated and so engaged in a long time , joseph kennedy said republicans believe they may be able to turn that engagement to their advantage if they can keep tying mr kerry to his ally , and some democrats say mr kennedy is best used selectively as a political weapon but even a republican official was not going to rain on mr kennedy during the convention celebration , preferring instead to use him to poke at mr kerry s record unlike john kerry , ted kennedy has actually done legislation , said john feehery , an aide to speaker j dennis hastert and one of the republicans sent to boston to counter the democratic message though some were looking at this week s events as something of a last hurrah , mr kennedy was having none of that he said he wanted to be ready to go on the senate floor when mr kerry moves into the white house i am looking forward to being there in january , said mr kennedy , who listed universal health care and education as his top two issues in waiting it will be a good time
in a little piece of astoria not far from long island city , everything is orderly the lowrise apartment buildings and modest brick row homes cut sharp lines on the treedotted streets the front gardens are bright and fresh , and the parked cars align neatly , none too far from the curb but lately , a wild spirit has come poking its slim snout into this pocket of tidiness it is a stray dog , caramel colored , built like a german shepherd and fairly healthy looking it has no collar and apparently no real home , but it does have plenty of concerned guardians and even a few personal chefs the dog is often spotted by residents in the morning , right around commuting time it ambles up an avenue , sniffing bushes where other dogs have marked checking the mail , as they say in dog parlance the dog seems to have a destination in mind , never looking lost or confused or getting caught in traffic if someone has left the dog a meal , it pauses to eat , but mostly , it stays on the move residents and passersby who cross the dog s path have been known to stop in their tracks , surprised to find this leashless mystery roaming their quiet streets we do n't get too many stray animals around here , mary entress , a resident of queensview apartments for 28 years , said on her way to work one morning recently surely she meant stray dogs , for stray cats are no strangers to astoria theories abound as to where such a handsome animal came from maybe somebody owns him and lets him out , ms entress suggested but i doubt it others say the dog may be lost , or perhaps a careless child opened a gate and set him free inadvertently perhaps someone simply abandoned him but one thing is certain everybody knows about him , said angela ferrini , a neighborhood resident with impressive animal credentials she owns three cats and a dog , a collie and shepherd mix named queenie who , at nearly 17 years old , is the elder stateswoman of the local canine set ms ferrini also helps feed 17 stray cats every day you 're worried when you see him , she said of the stray dog , but more worried when you do n't see him such sightings can be fleeting , though he s calm , chilled out , ms ferrini said , emphasizing what a wellmannered and streetwise dog he seems to be except you ca n't get near him he does n't trust people she has taken to calling the dog babe because she does n't want to keep calling him the stray or the dog , as others do it was always just 'the babe she said as to the himness of this babe , ms ferrini said that the dog at one time seemed to take a shine to queenie when she took queenie for her morning walk , babe would be waiting for them by an old truck outside ms ferrini s apartment most residents ca n't recall exactly when they first began seeing the dog , but they say it was probably at least three months ago mike ibanescu , a cabdriver from romania who lives in astoria and owns a brown and white boxer named jack , often sees babe in the morning he puts food out for him , sometimes boiled beef he gives him dog food too , but says the dogs , they are looking for meat same as the kids you give them the food , they want the cake he said lots of people feed the dog ms ferrini would take babe in if she could , but a recent law in her building forbids new dogs some people visiting friends in the neighborhood recently heard about babe and wanted to adopt him and take him to their farm upstate , she said , but when the friends went looking for the dog , he could n't be found , much to ms ferrini s dismay i think he would make somebody a good pet , she said he would be a good watchdog for an older couple and he looks so lonely , like he s saying , 'i want to come home with you until that happens , astoria is n't a bad place for babe it s a very animalfriendly place here , ms ferrini said everyone s more worried about him than anything else the list of those concerned includes rita , an astoria resident who owns a possibly diabetic cat and who shakes her head at babe s plight , and a woman and two men walking their dogs one morning at rainey park by the east river who said they often saw the dog there i feel so bad for that dog , the woman said he is so stronglooking , so brave an agent who answered the main number at animal care and control , the nonprofit agency charged with caring for the city s lost or unwanted animals , said no dogs fitting babe s description had been reported missing in astoria or long island city as far back as may , the earliest month for which records still exist as for whether the agency received calls from residents who may have spotted such a dog , the agent said that babe s description mediumsized , brown , possibly a shepherd mix was a popular one , and that people called in to report stray dogs all the time edward boks , the agency s executive director , said that if dogs are left on their own for too long , they often become feral , which simply means that they wo n't permit human contact so the longer he s out there , mr boks said of babe , the more difficult it will be to rehabilitate him but he emphasized that dogs are much easier to rehabilitate than cats dogs are absolutely dependent on us for survival , he said , but cats are n't in the end , it may be partly up to babe himself to decide his fate there comes a time in most lives when a bit of freedom must be traded for a bit of security perhaps , in his doggie heart , babe knows this the other day , a fire truck went racing up 29th street in astoria , sirens wailing babe was there too he stopped , tilted his head back , and let out a deep wolfish howl full of the melancholy of those too wise for their own good
prosecutors in new jersey and pennsylvania are nearing a plea agreement with a former nurse , charles cullen , under which he would be spared the death penalty , plead guilty in 14 patients' deaths and help investigators identify his other victims , law enforcement officials said mr cullen has claimed to have killed more than 30 patients the officials said that under the deal , which was sent monday to prosecutors in the seven counties where mr cullen worked in his 16year career , he would also help legislators and government regulators strengthen the oversight of the health care system by explaining how he managed to work for years even after he was fired repeatedly and was suspected more than once in the poisoning of patients if the deal is approved as expected , mr cullen would plead guilty to murder charges in somerset county on thursday and admit intentionally administering fatal doses of medication to 13 patients at somerset medical center in somerville , nj , and one at easton hospital in pennsylvania mr cullen has also agreed to plead guilty to attempted murder charges for poisoning two patients who survived of those 16 victims , 11 were men and 5 were women some were terminally ill , while others appeared near recovery they included retirees , homemakers and a catholic priest according to people with direct knowledge of the investigation , more than half the victims were assigned to other caretakers at the time mr cullen admits he poisoned them as a result , without his cooperation , it would be difficult if not impossible for investigators to prove that he had killed them mr cullen was arrested in december at somerset medical center , where a state poison control expert had warned in july that someone appeared to be trying to harm patients mr cullen s stunning admission that he had killed 30 to 40 patients at various health care facilities caused many people to view his case as a sign that the medical system fails to monitor itself adequately if mr cullen formally admits the killings this week , it will place him among the more prolific medical serial killers in the nation s history aspects of the plea deal under discussion were reported first by the starledger of newark and gannett newspapers of new jersey the decision not to seek the death penalty does not come as a surprise while some victims' families publicly called for the authorities to seek a death sentence , new jersey has not carried out an execution in more than 30 years thus , when mr cullen s lawyer said in december that his client was willing to cooperate with investigators if they would spare his life , plea negotiations began relatively quickly investigations into previous medical killers have shown that without the cooperation of the suspect , the authorities can easily devote years , and millions of dollars , to the inquiry and still find themselves unable to determine who , or how many , people may have been killed this case meant investigators sifting through medical files of thousands of patients at the hospitals and nursing homes where mr cullen had worked , and would have required that dozens of bodies be exhumed for autopsy , at a cost of 10 , 000 or more each the new jersey attorney general , peter harvey , said he hoped that the plea agreement would be some consolation to the victims' families and end the anguish of the hundreds of people who may mistakenly suspect that mr cullen was to blame for the death of a loved one who was hospitalized our first priority was to bring certainty to the families of victims , said mr harvey , whose assistant , vaughn mccoy , drafted the outlines of the plea deal families have the right to know whether or not their loved ones were killed or targeted by charles cullen so they can have some peace of mind , mr cullen s lawyer , johnnie mask , did not return repeated calls requesting comment one person with knowledge of the plea negotiations said mr cullen , the father of two , was apparently worried that a trial or prolonged investigation would make it harder for him to portray himself as a man who sought to relieve the suffering of terminally ill patients but some of mr cullen s apparent victims , like the rev florian gall , were recovering when mr cullen says he gave fatal doses of medication prosecutors thus are eager to ask mr cullen how and why he chose his victims once the court proceedings in somerset county are over , mr cullen will be taken to the six other counties where he worked warren , hunterdon , morris and essex counties in new jersey and lehigh and northampton counties in pennsylvania where he will meet with investigators and review case files of patients who died on his watch , officials said mr cullen has not spoken to investigators since shortly after his arrest , when he admitted during a fourhour interview with detectives that he had intentionally poisoned patients but lawenforcement officials said that during the plea negotiations , mr cullen was able to provide surprisingly specific details names of relatives who came to visit , descriptions of patients' physical appearance , and in one case , a description of a stuffed animal kept near a patient s bed the news that a plea deal appears close brought a mix of emotions to relatives of some of the patients lucille gall , father gall s sister , said her family would welcome an ending to the investigation because it would ease their grief she added that none of her relatives could feel any sense of satisfaction about any aspect of the case it is not happy because none of this is happy , she said
winnipeg , manitoba dec 7 five years ago , a young manitoba pharmacist fresh out of school started selling nicorette chewing gum over ebay from that modest beginning the canadian online pharmacy industry took off , racking up crossborder sales of more than 800 million a year , upsetting united states drug companies and prompting a debate over prescription drug prices in the american presidential election but now an industry that thrived on discrepancies between the country s regulated drug prices and america s higher , largely unregulated prices has run into regulatory , political and economic pressures at home that promise not just to change the business fundamentally , but possibly to drive it out of canada altogether canadian officials , worried about the threat of liability lawsuits and the problem of maintaining an adequate , reasonably priced supply of prescription drugs for their own population , are casting an increasingly wary eye on the industry at the same time , online pharmacies are having an ever more difficult time finding supplies because , they say , the major pharmaceutical companies are threatening wholesalers who do business with them american consumers of prescription drugs , most of whom are elderly , are not likely to notice the changes anytime soon , if at all but as the industry casts about the world to fill its growing orders , the drugs that people think they are getting from canada may actually be supplied by pharmacies in europe , australia , israel and latin america even in manitoba , the birthplace of the business , regulators warned the province s pharmacists that their licenses could be suspended in january if they continued to fill american prescription orders without proper physician oversight currently , before a pharmacy can fill a prescription , a canadian doctor cosigns an american customer s prescription , after reviewing the original doctor s diagnosis and prescribed treatment but the practice of cosigning a prescription without examining a patient may be a violation of professional medical standards stiffening those requirements would remove the threat of lawsuits but , if extended to other provinces as the industry fears , also kill the online industry in canada canada s health minister , ujjal dosanjh , has raised this issue repeatedly and indicated that he would shut down the industry if he felt it was necessary we will do the right thing , and if the consequence is that crossborder internet pharmacies do n't exist anymore , then that s the consequence , he said in a recent television interview the industry has warned the manitoba regulatory agency that it will be held accountable for any damages yet this week mr dosanjh backed the pharmaceutical association s position , saying , the practice by some doctors of countersigning prescriptions without actually having a relationship with the patient and properly assessing the patient is absolutely unethical and unprofessional the provincial health minister of manitoba , tim sale , called this week for compromise , and the internet pharmacists and the regulatory body will meet next week to seek an arrangement the industry s proponents dismiss the liability issue , saying their practices are safe and pointing out that there has never been a problem with a faulty prescription or drug another commonly expressed fear is that the online drug industry may ultimately reduce supplies for canadians , raise prices and jeopardize the financial health of provincial governments , which finance purchases of prescription drugs it is difficult for me to conceive of how a small country like canada could meet the prescription drug needs of approximately 280 million americans without putting our own supply at serious risk , mr dosanjh said in a speech last month canada cannot be the drugstore of the united states a further problem the industry faces is the rapid decline of the american dollar , which is slicing into profits on some drugs by up to 15 percent this year , although prescription drugs are still cheaper here than in the united states because of price controls all of these new stresses have only exacerbated supply pressures on the 270 canadian online pharmacies which are essentially mailorder houses for maintenance drugs for chronic conditions like erectile dysfunction , high blood pressure and high cholesterol after american pharmaceutical firms began threatening to cut supplies to canadian wholesalers last year as an industry we are juggling between ducking fastballs thrown at us , looking at contingencies to survive and constantly upgrading our service , said daniel norman , business development officer at universaldrugstorecom , one of the largest online pharmacies sales are still increasing , though at a much slower rate than in previous years , and several of the largest online companies are making drastic changes in their business models many are opening pharmacies abroad , particularly in britain , to shelter themselves from canadian regulators and drug supply squeezes caused by what they describe as blacklisting by american drug companies they note that american companies would find it much more difficult to put pressure on wholesalers in a dozen or more european countries , where drug prices are also low compared with the united states canadamedscom recently closed its pharmacy in winnipeg , manitoba s capital , but enlarged its operations in calgary , considered to be more businessfriendly it has also formed partnerships with pharmacies in australia , chile , israel and britain this year others simply shop around the world for available drugs the strong will survive and the weak will be gone , said robert fraser , director of pharmacy at canadadrugscom , another industry leader that is diversifying its investments and recently acquired an interest in a mailorder pharmacy in texas the beauty of this industry is you do n't have to be located in a prime area of the world these days to carry on a viable business but there have already been some disruptions canadarxnet of hamilton , ontario , set up a pharmacy operation in freeport in the bahamas during the summer to purchase european drugs for resale in the united states but one of its early shipments of 450 packages was seized at the miami airport by customs agents , whose suspicions were raised by the size and provenance of the shipment while it remains illegal to import prescription drugs into the united states , the food and drug administration continues to take a somewhat relaxed enforcement stance over shipments to individuals no one was arrested in the miami incident , but canadarxnet had to refill the prescriptions for the customers in vermont , wisconsin and minnesota who had purchased the drugs not knowing where they would come from there s pressure from every angle , said david mackay , executive director of the canadian international pharmacy association , a trade group representing most of the major online pharmacies the screws are being tightened the changes promise to overhaul an industry that serves up to 100 , 000 mostly uninsured or underinsured americans and has created more than 5 , 000 jobs for canadian telephone salespeople , administrators and pharmacists it has also brought extra income to scores of canadian doctors who cosign prescription orders originally signed by american doctors as they reconfirm that treatment and dosage are appropriate industry leaders are trying to ease concerns in canada that their businesses could reduce canadian supplies by emphasizing that they are interested only in filling the needs of uninsured and underinsured americans they do not want to overreach and antagonize the canadian government by making bulk sales to american insurance companies , health maintenance organizations and state governments seeking to pass on savings the online businesses remain optimistic about the prospects of their industry , at least publicly i continue to invest heavily in our operations and our future , said andrew strempler , president of rxnorthcom , a company in minnedosa , manitoba , that sold more than 60 million of drugs to american customers in the fiscal year that ended sept 30 , a 10 percent increase from the 2003 fiscal year mr strempler s company last week closed a pharmaceutical facility in niverville , manitoba , which it opened only a year ago to service its growing american clientele , raising fresh fears that the industry was closing down but mr strempler said that he was adding to his call center in winnipeg and that he had just opened an online pharmacy with more than 500 , 000 worth of inventory in england to serve american customers those of us who are innovative enough will get through these challenges , said mr strempler , 30 , who got the industry started by selling the nicorette gum so far , united states officials have expressed skeptical but not wholly antagonistic views on an industry that is saving a lot of americans money and has so far not caused any known harm it s ok at this current level , the ambassador to canada , paul cellucci , recently told reporters representatives of the united states drug industry , which has threatened to cut supplies to countries that reexport medicines , say the greatest threat posed by online pharmacies is from drug counterfeiting , especially in developing countries it opens up the door for counterfeits to enter the united states , said fj fingland , senior director of communications for the pharmaceutical researchers and manufacturers association , and there is nothing health canada can do to regulate these products in a june report on internet pharmacies , the united states general accounting office identified few problems with the canadian operations but the agency found that among the operations it had looked at , none of the foreign pharmacies outside of canada included dispensing pharmacy labels that provide instructions for use , few included warning information and 13 displayed other problems associated with the handling of the drugs health canada , the primary federal health authority , issued a report last month concluding that canadian online pharmacies generally complied with regulations but it did find that some pharmacies were packaging and shipping temperaturesensitive products inappropriately and selling prescription drugs based on prescriptions signed using rubber stamps or electronic prescriptions signed with electronic signatures industry leaders said they were taking action to redress those concerns
the legacy of the lingua franca , a literate magazine for academics and likeminded folks that closed in 2001 and went into bankruptcy , lives on , but perhaps not in the way that its contributors may have hoped the bankruptcy trustee in charge of the case , robert geltzer , has served summons to many freelance writers who collected fees from the magazine when it was in its death throes the demand if the fees are not returned , he is threatening to sue joanna smith rakoff , a writer who worked as a web editor and wrote for university business daily , an affiliated publication , had her first substantial article for lingua franca published just before the magazine folded two years later , she has been told to return the money for the work she did the money is to be directed to secured creditors , rather than freelancers , who are the unsecured kind ms smith rakoff , who has written for the new york times , said she had received a note demanding that her 1 , 550 fee be returned in 10 days or else she would be sued and forced to pay the money back i feel angry and betrayed , she said this thing has taken over my life i ca n't afford to pay it and i ca n't afford not to do anything about it because then there will be a default judgment against me kay murray , the general counsel at the authors guild , an organization that represents the interests of published authors , said she considered the effort to reclaim payments from freelance articles both silly and unprecedented never in the 10 years that i have been here has a debtor attempted to get money back from writers , she said , pointing out that the sums involved are hardly significant none of the fees , to her knowledge , were above 5 , 000 ms murray said that the lawsuits against the writers were in various stages some have been filed and answered , while others are just now being served it certainly seems unfair , she said these freelancers did the work and were paid the fees that they bargained for they delivered what was asked of them lingua franca had a checkered business history the circulation was about 20 , 000 at its peak , but had a literary reputation that belied its size it received a great deal of attention in 1996 when it broke the news that alan sokal , a new york university physicist , had hoodwinked a humanities journal into publishing a bogus essay that was a jargonladen parody of the work of literary theorists a call to the mr geltzer , the bankruptcy trustee , was not returned david carr
though it seems utterly inconceivable now , there was a time in the not so distant past when phrases like talk to the hand and you go , girl were a part of the american lexicon , when tattered flannel shirts and heroin addictions were musthave accessories and stuffed animals like tickle me elmo , that spastic bundle of red fur , were all the rage that time , of course , was the 90 s , and in case you 've forgotten the era \( it did end a whole four years ago \) , vh1 wants to help you remember with i love the 90 s beginning tonight , the 10part series will dash through the decade that brought us dolly the cloned sheep and the spice girls while the 90 s could hardly be considered the good ol' days , brian graden , president of entertainment for vh1 and mtv , said it was never too early to mine the past for laughs something that happened three weeks ago , feels like an eternity , mr graden said it is a very 21stcentury , toomuchmedia phenomenon not content to wait 10 years before looking back on the early 2000 s , in march vh1 introduced best week ever , a halfhour series that invites panelists to reminisce not about the previous decade , year or trimester , but the last seven days trafficking in recycled culture has proven wildly successful for vh1 , which first thrived and then overrelied on shows like behind the music and popup video now , largely on the strength of programs like i love the 80 s , the cable channel once regarded as mtv s significantly older and dorkier cousin has become the destination for hipperthanthou gen xers eager to celebrate and affectionately denigrate pop culture of yesteryear since mr graden and christina norman , president of vh1 , were brought in to resuscitate the fading music channel two years ago , primetime viewers for its target 18to49 demographic have jumped from 243 , 000 to 339 , 000 at a recent best week ever taping in midtown , the show regulars john aboud and michael colton , a comedic duo who bill themselves as modern humorists , were riffing about the previous week in film the only thing that could make michael moore s 'fahrenheit 9 11' more successful was if there was an hour of jesus being beaten , mr colton deadpanned back and forth the jokes flew for nearly an hour to date topics have included j lo s quickie marriage to marc anthony , spidermania and bill clinton s book tour britney spears' topsyturvy life provides endless fodder , and politicians are not safe either more snarky than meanspirited , best week ever \( friday nights \) is made up of several segments , including sizzler , which tackles the week s celebrity gossip , and word of the week , which defines a word , real or made up , that captures a cultural phenomenon blaccent , for example , is the accent adopted by whites desperate to sound urban the brainchild of fred graver , the show s executive producer , best week ever is tightly edited to ensure that the laughs are constant \( the same formula is applied to the i love series \) the classic way of doing this would be to put a bunch of funny people around a table and shoot them , but when you do it that way , there s always dead air , mr graver , a former david letterman show writer , explained this way , we cut out all the dead air and just get the funny stuff michael hirschorn , an executive producer for several of vh1 s nostalgia series , credited with helping shape the channel s new voice , said timeliness was one reason for the success of best week evers i certainly find that after something has been on drudge for four hours it s pretty much old news to me , he said and i think the show really resonates with people that think the same way nearly all of the show s 18 regular panelists have backgrounds in improv or standup rachel harris , an actress , and mo rocca , a selfprofessed fundit and ubiquitous vh1 presence , are both daily show alums most , like paul scheer , a member of the upright citizens brigade , a manhattanbased comedy troupe , were discovered on other talkingheaddriven series for the regulars , best week ever and its sister show , best month ever \( what was that about a dead horse \?

he remembered her asking that question implies that you 've been on television but for no good reason , mr aboud joked vh1 s nostalgia train shows no signs of slowing down i was a teenage metal head and a remake of the partridge family are due by year s end more shows in this vein are in the works , ms norman said still , it s not clear how long the nostalgia trend can last ms harris , who has appeared on curb your enthusiasm , worried that once every macarena joke had been told and every bit of ms spears' life lampooned , there might be too little of the past left to deride we all joke that these pop culture shows will eventually eat themselves , she said chuckling soon we 're going to be doing the 'best minute ever'
it is merely a fourmile stretch of asphalt on this east texas city s outskirts , dotted with some ranchstyle houses , a few decaying trailer homes and a shuttered gun shop , in the distance the rice fields that brought a small group of japanese settlers here a century ago but the name of the country lane , jap road , has long angered many japaneseamericans equally outraged are numerous people who live on jap road , which has 100 or so residences they view criticism of their address as meddling in their affairs i hear 'jap' cars and 'jap' bikes all the time , buddy derouen , 69 , a retired petrochemical worker who lives on the road , in the community of fannett , said in a recent letter published in the beaumont enterprise why not jap road \? the competing positions are set to clash in a meeting on monday at the jefferson county courthouse leading the county commissioners' agenda is a discussion of whether they should change the name advancing the issue this far has been a victory of sorts for sandra nakata tanamachi , whose family settled in beaumont after immigrating from japan in the early 1900 s before moving away to lake jackson , south of houston , ms tanamachi , an elementaryschool teacher , lobbied more than a decade ago to have the road s name changed she was unsuccessful last december , however , she allied herself with thomas kuwahara , a helicopter pilot from lafayette , la , who was stunned to come across the road a few years ago while driving to san antonio to visit a relative they filed a complaint with two federal agencies the department of transportation and the department of housing and urban development trying to keep jefferson county from getting federal money unless the road s name was changed we japanese are often ignored , but we 're still individuals with feelings , ms tanamachi said in an interview , speaking with a thick texas twang i felt i could not stand in front of my students and talk about values like dignity and respect and not fight this thing scott newar , the lawyer representing ms tanamachi and mr kuwahara , said hud had told them that it did not directly finance any housing programs in the county , a circumstance effectively limiting its actions the department of transportation has asked texas state authorities to examine the complaint , mr newar said civil rights organizations , meanwhile , including the japanese american citizens league , the league of united latin american citizens and the antidefamation league , have voiced support for changing the name considerable outside involvement has come in recent weeks from the japanese american veterans association drawing attention to the sacrifices its members made in world war ii , the group will be using the meeting in beaumont to discuss the role of the 442nd regimental combat team , a segregated japaneseamerican unit whose exploits included rescuing soldiers of the texas 36th division , national guardsmen who were trapped by german forces in the mountains of eastern france in 1944 jap road should not be a part of the united states landscape , said kelly kuwayama , 86 , a member of the 442nd who said he planned to travel from washington to beaumont to speak at the meeting and texas is certainly part of the united states , or at least it was the last time i checked the thought of outsiders' descending on beaumont makes many here bristle more than 100 residents of jap road and supporters of their effort to maintain its name gathered at an openair bar on wednesday evening to drink beer , eat barbecue and ponder how to thwart their opponents we 're not here to bash the japanese , wayne wright , a retired petrochemical worker who is spearheading a movement to preserve the name , said in an interview before the meeting how can i be considered a bigot and a racist when i got a puerto rican soninlaw \? mr wright s wife , polly , said she believed the name was originally intended to honor the memory of yasuo mayumi , a japanese farmer who , according to local lore , settled in the area in 1905 before returning to japan in the 1920 s if we change the name , we 're conceding to the idea that it was meant the wrong way and it was n't , said ms wright , pointing to wood on her floor that she said had come from mr mayumi s house nearby we 're proud of the name of our road beaumont still has a small japanese community , numbering fewer than 50 , but none were present on wednesday night at the gathering in opposition to changing the name some opponents said they had japanese friends who were also against changing it , but none of the people whose names they provided responded to requests to speak about the issue i might be in the same boat if i were them , terry shima of gaithersburg , md , vice president of the japanese american veterans association and former member of the 442nd , said of those maintaining silence it s completely understandable it is very japanese , especially in a place where you 're far outnumbered , to bite your tongue and not make waves that is part of why we feel this is so important lj bergeron , a retired pipe fitter and former gun shop owner who lives on jap road , did not bite his tongue when asked about the name if it s offensive to someone , they should either move or stay away from here , said mr bergeron , 62 , leaning on the harleydavidson parked in front of his home a change might focus attention on another stretch of road nearby the town of vidor , in neighboring orange county , has a road called jap lane carl k thibodeaux , who as the county judge is chief among the county commissioners , said officials had no plans to change the name because the residents of jap lane were not inclined to do so ms tanamachi , the retired schoolteacher who brought the issue to the fore again here in beaumont , plans a return monday for the courthouse meeting she said she owed it to her uncle , saburo tanamachi , who was raised in beaumont and died in world war ii fighting with the 442nd if the commissioners vote in favor of a change if not monday , then perhaps later possible alternatives include japanese road or mayumi road anything but jap will do , ms tanamachi said
tap dancer does not get the track all to himself when he trains at philadelphia park there was not a police officer or a helicopter in sight when he departed bensalem , pa , yesterday on his way to belmont park for the belmont stakes today the trainer ned allard does not hold news conferences , but he is agreeable to interviews , if anybody wants to talk to him jockey javier castellano has never appeared on live with regis and kelly and it is a pretty safe bet that no one owns a tap dancer tshirt or baseball cap tap dancer is no smarty jones , and there is not a minute that goes by when allard is not reminded of that the two horses are regularly stabled at philadelphia park , they are chestnutcolored , they will run in the belmont and they have four legs , a mane and a tail the comparisons pretty much stop there is there any jealousy \? allard said of course we 'd all like to have a horse like that that s what makes the world go round there s always somebody with a prettier wife there s always somebody with a bigger house , a bigger car , a bigger checkbook and a better horse that s what makes you get up in the morning and work tap dancer , who has not finished among the top three finishers in his three starts this year , has not done nearly enough to merit the star treatment accorded smarty jones at philadelphia park , he is treated like any other horse should a 5 , 000 claimer get in his way on the track when he is working out for the belmont , so be it that is fine with allard , a bit of a smarty jones fan himself he understands that all horses are not created equal i think them closing the track for smarty jones to train is pretty neat , he said i certainly would n't expect that for my horse the people here at philadelphia park have bent over backwards to keep john servis here and keep him happy if this were belmont or the maryland tracks or someplace else , they would n't close the racetrack down for one horse that s almost unheard of as far as i'm concerned , everything that s being done for smarty jones is all positive over the years , allard has had a few good horses , none better than mom s command in 1985 , she won the new york racing association s filly triple crown , which consists of the acorn , the mother goose and the coaching club american oaks allard picked up tap dancer after his owner , gilbert campbell , took the colt north after campaigning him in florida with the trainer kathleen o'connell sired by sword dance , he has only made one start for allard , finishing fourth in the sir barton stakes at pimlico on may 15 he was ridden that day by stewart elliott , smarty jones s regular rider castellano will replace elliott aboard tap dancer for the belmont i'm taking a wild shot , allard said it looks like he wants to go a mile and a half does he \? i do n't know for sure , but he s always running when the race is over does he belong in a race like the belmont with those kind of horses \? that remains to be seen it will be fun to be there , and if i can get a piece of the purse that will be great should tap dancer be hopelessly out of it by the middle of the stretch , allard could turn his attention to smarty jones and start rooting just like everyone else at philadelphia park , he has found himself caught up in the excitement he will not be wearing it today , but he admitted that he owns a smarty jones baseball cap when you come from a place like philadelphia park , the socalled minor leagues , you 're not accustomed to seeing a really good horse come from your area , he said it s pretty neat because it has generated a lot of attention for horse racing in this area people who have paid absolutely no attention to horse racing before now know where philadelphia park is that s helped us tremendously i was rooting for him big time in the kentucky derby and preakness of course , he would rather have a tap dancer victory than a smarty jones victory , even if that means spoiling the hopes and dreams of the philadelphia park community and the city itself , which has embraced smarty jones i can handle that , he said they did n't run allen jerkens out of town when he beat secretariat at one time or another , he beat just about every good horse around and did it with some pretty ordinary horses it is a problem allard probably does n't need to worry about tap dancer has little chance of winning more likely , he will head back to philadelphia park tomorrow morning after a lopsided defeat once again , a police escort will not be necessary
european antitrust regulators concluded a twoday session on oracle s proposed unsolicited takeover of peoplesoft on thursday , hearing arguments from customers , competitors and from peoplesoft the european commission has until may 11 to make a final ruling a trial over the united states justice department s lawsuit to block the takeover is scheduled to go to trial on june 7 european regulators are concerned that a combination of oracle and peoplesoft would dominate the market for large corporate computer systems , like customer relationship management and financial management software used by multinational companies representatives for companies that are customers and rivals of oracle spoke at the closed hearing on thursday emerson electric of st louis said it would welcome a merger , but the ing group , the dutch banking giant , said the deal raised concerns , according to a person at the hearing both companies use a wide range of enterprise software sap of germany , the biggest business software company in europe , agreed with many of oracle s arguments in defense of the takeover , in particular its insistence that the european commission was defining the market too narrowly by focusing on only the top end of the market for corporate software both oracle and sap argue that by doing so the commission exaggerates their market share suppliers of smaller systems for smaller clients should also be considered as competitors in the same market , they contend a danish subsidiary of microsoft , navision , acquired in 2002 , and baan , a unit of the chicagobased ssa global technologies , compete in the market for enterprise software for small companies other companies , like siebel systems , build specialized software for companies , like customer relationship management tools , but none apart from oracle , peoplesoft and sap make general programs for multinationals
san francisco , oct 17 propelled by google envy , new players and internet industry giants are rushing into the online search market , setting off a burst of activity that contrasts sharply with the lull after the dotcom collapse to fend off its challengers , google has furiously intensified efforts to add new services to its brand last thursday , it introduced google desktop search , a program that is a direct challenge to microsoft s control of desktop computing because it searches for information on a user s personal computer as well as on the web in recent weeks , google has also announced google print , to compete against the searchinsidethebook feature of amazon , and google sms , a new software tool for searching the web from cellphones but despite its push into new areas , some experts say that google may be vulnerable because the search market , one of the internet s most profitable areas , will increasingly be shaped by brand and other nontechnology factors and that shift may play to the advantage of larger competitors like microsoft and yahoo in fact , google s urgency in releasing a desktop search program shows that it knows the fight over search is moving to new ground microsoft will have a meaningful impact , they do n't have to dominate to make a difference , said james friedland , a san franciscobased analyst for sg cowen company , the new yorkbased investment firm if they start to gain share , it will slow down google s growth other analysts argue that there is plenty of room in the search market for both small and large competitors because profits from online advertising , much of it based on ads linked to search results , are growing fast every indication is that corporate advertising budgets are increasingly allocated to the internet , said david garrity , a financial analyst at caris company , a wall street investment firm rising spending means that google could continue to grow , even as more companies enter the field a test of these two views could come soon , perhaps before the end of the year , when microsoft introduces its new search service , which will be broadly available on the web google s smaller rivals have also introduced new services in recent weeks amazon brought out a9 , a search engine that allows users to maintain a running history of their web travels vivisimo introduced clusty , a search engine that uses artificial intelligence techniques to categorize search results and idealab , an investment company based in southern california , has presented snap , a search engine that permits easy sorting of search results while none of the new search services present an immediate threat to google , the competitive pressure is certain to intensify even as its stock soars shares of google closed at 14411 on friday the company will report its quarterly earnings thursday ultimately , google may have the most to fear from microsoft , which could well use its windows monopoly to dominate search functions such concerns have , in turn , caused google to enter microsoft s domain with google desktop for microsoft , providing better access to information stored on a personal computer s hard disk has been a goal for more than a decade microsoft has said publicly it will soon offer a better search function for pc s there is also widespread speculation in the industry that microsoft intends to integrate its pc search functions with a web search engine to combat google apple computer has also become an active competitor in the desktop search wars earlier this year , steven p jobs , the chief executive of apple , showed off tiger , the company s nextgeneration operating system , which will have extensive text and media search capabilities when it is made available sometime next year these industry developments have forced google to go far beyond internet search we really want to make this a photographic memory for computer users , marissa mayer , the director of consumer web products for google , said of google desktop for now , new products like google desktop are not expected to contribute directly to the company s revenue but company executives would not rule out the possibility of eventually offering paid services or ads , using the technology that retrieves data from a user s computer the desktop software , which can be downloaded from the google web site free , will retrieve information both from the internet and the user s computer hard disk for example , if a user searches for the word flowers , he will be able to see web search results as well as any email messages and files stored on his personal computer that contain that word we plan to learn a lot about how our users will use google desktop , ms mayer said she said that it took google 18 months to figure out a way to turn its free web search engine into a profitmaking enterprise by selling ads linked to search terms that business generated about 690 million for google in the last quarter yahoo , google s closest rival in search , reported last week that it had 765 million in advertising revenue for the quarter in the meantime , internet innovations are becoming hot topics of conversations again in silicon valley web 20 , a conference held in san francisco this month , featured a range of new internet startups and technologies we 're entering the period of the cambrian explosion , said john battelle , a prominent internet entrepreneur , in comparing the new ventures taking root in silicon valley to the geologic period when many new species emerged at the web 20 conference , much of the discussion centered on the next phase of internet uses , described as dtod , or devicetodevice , which would direct communications between computers , rather than between computers and human web users future competition for domination of the internet may also mean refighting the battles of the past in particular , the web browser wars there have been reports that microsoft s control of the browser market may be loosening america online , for example , is thought to be preparing to reenter the market with a new browser google is also rumored to be developing a

for this , the boston red sox spent all that time , energy and money last winter \? they built the team for this series \? this is the best they could do \? they throw their best two pitchers two of baseball s best pitchers at the yankees , and they might as well have used bobby sprowl and casey fossum now they go into game 3 tonight with a youngster , bronson arroyo , who has pitched well recently but who has never pitched a game 3 of a majorleague postseason series with his team down , two games to none it is possible , of course , that just when the outlook for the red sox appears bleakest , they will rally themselves to an unexpected triumph get serious the red sox are saddled with a pitcher \( curt schilling \) who wo n't pitch again in the series , or if he does will do it with the same debilitating ankle ailment that undermined him in game 1 , and another pitcher \( pedro mart nez \) who has become a 100pitch pitcher and who has taken to talking about daddies and mango trees before the american league championship series began , it was the yankees that were suspected of having a pitching problem two outstanding performances later \( by mike mussina and jon lieber , one better than the other \) , the yankees look as if they have a staff of cy young award winners kevin brown , their starter tonight , is capable of duplicating the performances of mussina and lieber mango trees \? while pedro waxed poetic and philosophic about mango trees , the yankees looked like redwoods to the red sox they wondered what they could do to turn the series around , or at least make it competitive hey , we 're here , too , the red sox would like the yankees to know jason varitek , the boston catcher , said the red sox scored enough runs to win the first game , but their pitching foiled them in the second game , he added we did n't do it offensively , and we did a good job pitching those things have to match up as in poor pitching and poor hitting , perhaps the red sox seem more likely to achieve that combination than the one they yearn for how , varitek was asked , were the red sox to win this series , or any games , after losing with their two best pitchers \? we won a lot of games with a lot of different guys , he said different people contributed all year we just need a quality outing the red sox will not receive any assistance from history in the 18 years the league series has been best of seven , seven american league teams and six in the national league won the first two games only once in each league did the team that lost those games come back and win the series kansas city did it to toronto , and st louis did it to los angeles , both in 1985 , the year the series went from best of five games to best of seven it has n't happened since , and the red sox and their passionate but bizarre fans would waste their time and brain energy if they engaged in wishful thinking those fans should remember well their team s experience in league series when the red sox lost the first two games in 1988 and in 1990 , the red sox lost the first two games to oakland , then lost the third and fourth games as well those results spelled sweep the word , if they can even say it , terrifies red sox fans but they would also suffer emotional distress if this series repeated the 1999 experience the yankees won the first two games at yankee stadium that year , then won two of three in boston , ending the series on fenway park grass that was heaping insult upon injury the red sox are under a new ownership regime \( the new york times company is part of it think of that \) , and john henry , tom werner and larry lucchino have worked hard to overtake the team that lucchino called the evil empire but it s not working they have to find yet a new way maybe they should try planting mango trees in the fenway park outfield fifteen years ago , mart nez said after his game 2 loss , i was sitting under a mango tree without 50 cents to actually pay for a bus and referring to the fans' frequent chant of who s your daddy \? which referred to mart nez s comment last month that the yankees were his daddy , he said , my biggest daddy is the one that put me out there and the one that brought me over from the mango tree to the biggest stage in the world at this moment red sox fans do n't want to know from mango trees they want a world series championship so that they can eliminate the dreaded term 1918 from their vocabulary what they should do , before it s too late , is go to their windows , stick their heads out \( open the windows first \) and yell , we 're sick and tired of this , and we 're not going to take it anymore
the frenchgerman drug company aventis on sunday night accepted a sweetened offer from oncehostile bidder sanofisynth labo , in a deal that valued aventis at 55 billion euros \( 65 billion \) , sources close to the negotiations said the action came shortly after the swiss drug company novartis said it would begin formal talks with aventis about a merger but then withdrew because none of its conditions for a deal had been met the agreement with sanofi , based in paris , satisfies the french government s quest to make sure france remains home to a large pharmaceutical company the combined aventis and sanofi will be the world s thirdlargest pharmaceutical company , behind pfizer and glaxosmithkline , with about 30 billion in sales in 2003 the deal is expected to be announced on monday the higher offer represented a shift for both sanofi , which had steadfastly refused to alter its 60 billion bid for aventis , made in january , and for aventis , which had insisted that it would be a stronger company if it did not combine with sanofi sanofi is offering five of its shares , plus 120 euros \( 142 \) , for each six shares of aventis stock , said one person close to the negotiations the previous offer was five shares of sanofi stock plus 69 euros for each six aventis shares all 16 members of aventis s board were said to have voted to approve the deal , after a sevenhour board meeting on sunday even as the board was meeting , french government officials , who have been eager to have aventis remain a french company , were promoting the benefits of a combination with sanofi the french health minister , philippe dousteblazy , said in an interview sunday evening with french radio s europe one that he favored a bid for aventis by sanofi over an offer by novartis i would be very happy to see the formation of a very big french group , among the biggest in the world , he said , according to wire reports on sunday night , mr dousteblazy welcomed the deal even before it was formally announced , saying it would allow france to have one of the largest pharmaceutical groups in the world , according to the agence francepresse separately , sanofi s bid for aventis is expected to be approved by the european commission on monday , according to one person close to the situation sanofi has been trying to preempt any regulatory concerns about the combination in recent weeks on april 13 , sanofi said it would sell the bloodthinning drugs arixtra and fraxiparine , as well as the manufacturing plant in northern france that makes them , to glaxosmithkline , if the bid for aventis was successful since sanofi made its original bid , aventis shareholders and executives have claimed that the offer undervalued the company aventis s stock has risen steadily since then , on hopes that sanofi would raise its bid , or a white knight would enter the battle aventis closed friday at 6680 euros on the frankfurt exchange , 15 percent higher than the value of the original sanofi offer the french government may have played an instrumental part in orchestrating the new bid on friday , aventis s chairman and chief executive , igor landau , met with the sanofi chairman , jeanfran ois dehecq , at the behest of the french finance minister , nicolas sarkozy neither the government nor representatives from either company provided any details about what happened , but it was the first time that the two executives have met since sanofi began its hostile offer previously , mr landau has been highly critical of sanofi s prospects markets will be closely watching the european commission s response to the news previously , the commission s intervention in pharmaceutical deals has been confined to asking companies to sell some products speaking during a daily media briefing on april 22 , a spokeswoman , amelia torres , noted that the european commission had never turned down a pharmaceutical merger it has delayed the closing of some pharmaceutical deals , though pfizer said in july 2002 it would buy pharmacia in a 60 billion deal , but the deal closed several months after its target of the end of 2002 , because european antitrust regulators requested more information from both companies ultimately , pfizer was forced to sell an incontinence treatment , darifenacin , to novartis for 225 million , in order to close the deal , because pharmacia already had two incontinence drugs ms torres said in an interview on thursday that if the french government tried to interfere in any deal between novartis and aventis , the european commission would study whether that action was legitimate
growing concerns about truck bombs have prompted the authorities in california to look with new interest at a threeyearold invention designed to disable big rigs hijacked by terrorists , but which critics dismiss as flawed and a waste of money there have been several efforts to require the socalled truckstopping device on vehicles in california that haul fuel , toxic waste and other hazardous materials in june , strong opposition from the california trucking and oil industries killed state legislation that would have mandated the devices on vehicles carrying flammable or combustible liquids but with fresh warnings from the department of homeland security about the use of trucks in terrorist attacks , the commissioner of the california highway patrol , dwight helmick , said he would make an appeal for the device directly to the federal authorities , some of whom have expressed an interest in it i have seen it on trucks and it works , but unfortunately here we are three years later without it , mr helmick said we can get a truck , know where it s headed , and we do n't have the ability to stop it he added , i just hope the day does n't come when we follow one right down the street and see a building come down and people die after participating in a conference call on sunday with tom ridge , the secretary of homeland security , mr helmick became so worried about hijacked trucks that he said he directed his staff to prepare a proposal that would make it a federal requirement for trucks to be equipped with the truckstopping device or an equivalent mechanism identified by the federal government he expects to submit the proposal to the federal motor carrier safety administration , which regulates truck safety , after it is reviewed in the coming days by gov arnold schwarzenegger mr ridge and other federal officials , including president bush s former top terrorism adviser , gen john a gordon , attended tests of the device while on other business at the nevada nuclear test site in 2002 one of the device s designers , dr david mccallen of the lawrence livermore national laboratory , said mr ridge even volunteered to participate in one of the tests like a lot of little kids , they all wanted to pile into the highway patrol vehicle and be involved in an impact , dr mccallen said of the federal officials we let them do that general gordon , who retired this year , said in a telephone interview that he was intrigued i do n't know why it has n't taken off more , general gordon said it is an interesting piece of technology that i think deserves to be continued to be looked at the truckstopping device was developed in october 2001 at lawrence livermore based on a rough schematic by dr bill wattenburg , a research scientist at california state university , chico , and a longtime san francisco radio talk show host the mechanism , mounted at the rear of a truck and not easily removed , activates the emergency brakes when triggered by taps from a pursuing vehicle s bumper or by a remote control signal it is particularly well liked by law enforcement officials because of its low price state officials estimate it would cost about 400 per truck to manufacture and install , and with the bumpertap option , no expensive alterations would be required to police vehicles dr wattenburg , who has turned over patent rights to the university of california , said simplicity was its biggest strength unlike systems that rely on electronics to stop vehicles , it can be operated manually , so jamming devices would not disable it this thing is as simple as the hardened cockpit doors on airplanes , dr wattenburg said stephanie r williams , senior vice president of the california trucking association , which opposed the legislation that would have required the device , said the invention was well intentioned but widely off the mark ms williams said that the association supported antiterrorism measures on trucks but that the device was created by people who did n't understand terrorism and did n't understand trucking it is an idea that just was n't cooked , she said she said it makes it easier for the police to stop a truck , but also makes it easier for the terrorists or any other group of people who thinks it might be fun to stop trucks she said she could see truckstopping becoming a rite of passage at college fraternities she also worried that it could be accidentally activated when a truck backed into a loading dock , creating costly delays other trade organizations have also raised objections , suggesting that the authorities should wait until more sophisticated alternatives could be developed and tested i would n't characterize it as a crazy idea , said jay mckeeman , executive vice president of the california independent oil marketers association what we were concerned about was that it was premature almost everyone associated with the device acknowledges that it has significant limitations , but they suggest that it would give the authorities a needed tool at a relatively low cost assemblyman john dutra , the author of the unsuccessful legislation , said opponents acted absolutely irresponsibly in defeating it this bill should be enacted on an emergency basis , said mr dutra , a democrat from the san francisco bay area the first one of these vehicles that is hijacked , people are going to say , 'john , your bill was brilliant the device has been installed on a handful of trucks in a pilot program at a west sacramento trucking company , beneto bulk transport , which has worked with the california highway patrol on an antiterrorism task force the company s general manager , chet friday , said the device had posed none of the problems raised by its detractors mr friday said he suspected that the device was ready to go to market but warned that it was just one approach it is like your house , he said you ca n't put a light outside and then leave the doors open at night you have to use common sense put the light outside , lock the doors , tell the neighbors this is part of a whole package
the bridge in west islip is as packed as the verrazanonarrows bridge on marathon morning fully booked was the reply we received when calling a week ahead for a saturday night reservation our waiter informed us that diners had to call three weeks in advance to get a table for a saturday night even on a slow tuesday elsewhere , we had to circle the lot before settling for ontheroad parking what s the draw \? one thing is the restaurant itself it s a beauty on a blustery night , a fireplace in the bar , surrounded by loveseats and big , comfy chairs , had cozy appeal large leather chairs were also interwoven with the usual tiny barroom high tables and stools rivaling the fireplace as an attentiongetter was a fullwall picture of the robert moses causeway a massive metal wine rack shaped like the brooklyn bridge kept the theme going the dining room is as stunning as the bar rows of highbacked striped banquettes offer comfortable seating , as do the overstuffed couches that dot the room they turn an ordinary table into a charming nook on the walls are photographs \( from around the 1950 s or '60 s \) of bridges being built black ceiling fans , wood floors and tiny oil lanterns on the tables round out the space the menu invites patrons to join us at 'the top of the bridge' for our fine desserts , pastries , specialty coffee , imported tea and after dinner cordials we were never able to take them up on the offer on the weekend , the upper balcony room was filled with overflow diners midweek , there was a private party the desserts would not have been worth the climb our waiter confided that the pastry chef had left and that the sweets were now made elsewhere only a caramel chocolate praline cake \( a moist chocolate layer cake with caramel frosting \) and an intensely flavored banana sorbet were worthy a double chocolate fudge torte , with the consistency of a gooey candy bar , was toothachingly sweet the other selections on the dessert menu all seemed to be variations of cheesecake the offering described as raspberry cake filled with pastry cream turned out to be an ordinary cheesecake with a gellike raspberry glaze not what we were expecting , nor what our taste buds were longing for get the meal off with a bang by ordering the lightly packed crab cakes with their mixed bean salsa , cilantro oil and spicy r moulade sauce also perky was a vegetable tart special , an individual quichelike affair with assertive seasoning still , a number of appetizers lacked flavor it was hard to tell what the filling was in the chicken and wild mushroom spring roll all its punch came from a tangy mustard sauce served on the side the beef and barley soup and the haricot vert salad with shrimp and plum tomatoes both cried out for salt standard was the verdict for the grilled portobello mushrooms and the caesar salad yet that ordinary salad exploded with flavor when it was chopped and topped with stillhot , crisply fried calamari the pointcounterpoint of hot seafood and cool greens made for a terrific dish at entree time , the boneless shell steak accompanied by a cornpepper relish and skinson french fries was so juicy that none of it was consigned to a doggie bag other crowdpleasers were the succulent rack of lamb and a spirited saut of shrimp , andouille sausage , tomatoes , sweet peppers and roasted onions it was served over basmati rice and garnished with crisp wonton strips the no1 fish pick was the cookedtoorder blackened tuna mated with grilled portobello mushrooms and asparagus the chilean sea bass sported an appealingly crunchy cornflour crust , but it would take an unrelenting sweet tooth to enjoy it the bass came with a ginger plum sauce as well as a pineapplemango chutney also too high on the sweet meter was the raspberry sauce that accompanied the roast duck thank goodness it was confined to a puddle on the plate , not on the bird service was as mixed as the food waiters were personable but needed prompting when it came to the replacement of silver and empty butter dishes runners delivering the food had n't a clue who ordered what dishes like the calamaricaesar salad , shell steak and

energy department officials and two members of congress descended on los alamos national laboratory yesterday to gauge the fallout from security lapses there , including the disappearance of two computer disks of classified information two weeks ago but it remained unclear just what information was lost , what happened to it and whether national security was compromised as a result the visitors were linton brooks , administrator of the national nuclear security administration deputy energy secretary kyle e mcslarrow representative joe l barton , republican of texas and chairman of the house committee on energy and commerce and representative diana degette of colorado , a democratic member of the committee the four received very thorough briefings on the current situation and toured the location involved , jim danneskiold , a los alamos spokesman , said ms degette , after she returned to washington yesterday evening , said i was frankly dismayed after previous security breaches to see how these new problems could erupt it s clear to me the steps the previous leadership took were woefully inadequate i do n't think some of the researchers understand the seriousness of complying with all security procedures she said she and mr barton believed that g peter nanos , the laboratory s director since january 2003 , was committed to fixing the security shortfalls , but she added that the house committee was going to keep a very close eye on this operations at los alamos , one of the nation s two main nuclear weapons laboratories , remained largely at a standstill yesterday on friday , mr nanos ordered the 12 , 000 employees to halt work , with a few exceptions for essential national security projects , and instead review safety and security the security lapses come against the backdrop of a potentially vigorous pending competition for the contract to manage the lab since its founding 61 years ago , it has been run by the university of california under contract to the department of energy and its predecessors after business lapses in 2002 that allowed some employees to buy personal items with laboratory money , the department decided to seek competitive bids for the management contract , which expires in september 2005 the university of texas and lockheed martin are among the potential competitors the two zip disks were discovered missing from the laboratory s weapons physics division july 7 a new issue arose over the weekend when the project on government oversight , a watchdog group , asserted that in recent months , los alamos employees used unclassified computers to send 17 email messages that contained classified information mr danneskiold , the laboratory spokesman , said that none of the messages represented a threat to national security and that none involved the transfer of computer data from the lab s classified network to an unclassified network these emails mostly are connected to the complexities of classification rules , he said under the rules , several pieces of unclassified information can be considered classified if they are combined together an unclassified statement made in context becomes classified , he said
the undressed art why we draw by peter steinhart illustrated 259 pp alfred a knopf 23 when it comes to swimming against the tide , olympic gold medals should go to all representational artists for half a century , they have been almost completely ignored by museums , boycotted by prestigious galleries and scoffed at by critics one of the most influential of these , clement greenberg , flatly declared , the naturalistic art of our time is unredeemable and the abstract expressionist adolph gottlieb chimed in , we 're going to have perhaps a thousand years of nonrepresentational painting now in fact , while it s true that abstract art has already lasted longer than hitler s thousand year reich , gottlieb is today largely forgotten and representational artists are still around what s more , they always will be , because , as peter steinhart reminds us in the undressed art why we draw , there is something innate and human about the impulse to draw what we see steinhart wants us to know that a renaissance of drawing has arrived , not only here but around the world he concedes , however , that you wo n't see signs of it in the galleries around san francisco s union square or new york s madison avenue this is a renaissance led by amateurs , who attend life classes in everincreasing numbers drawing from live nude models , steinhart points out , is now practiced in community recreation centers , art museums , private ateliers and plain old living rooms you can find dropin drawing sessions just about everywhere steinhart , a naturalist and former columnist for audubon magazine who draws at the palo alto art center , says there are more than 80 different drawing groups just in the san francisco bay area there are berkeley housewives' drawing groups and there are gay men s drawing groups even a gaymendrawingnaked group this renewed passion for drawing loses none of its interest just because it is being spearheaded by amateurs and a few professional artists too stubborn to believe reports of their own obsolescence according to steinhart , here s the puzzle in a society that values quick and easy success , at a time when few art schools require instruction in drawing from a live model and when so many galleries and museums prefer to give their space to video art , conceptual art and installation art , why do so many keep struggling to master a skill that art critics insist is anachronistic and old hat \? why this continuing compulsion to draw \? to get answers , steinhart questioned his artist friends one housewife , who has been drawing seriously for six years , does n't regard her figure drawing as art but as scales and arpeggios an art historian who also draws suggests that a drawing is an immediate emanation of personality , and an art restorer explains her steady attendance at her drawing group by saying , it trains your eye and it s like a muscle it gets slack if you do n't use it one artist says simply , we draw to find our own originality yet another is convinced that the chemically induced sensation of pleasure is what keeps many people drawing he believes that the drawing process produces serotonin and endorphins in certain individuals there must be some physical reward for some people otherwise they would n't do it from such diverse explanations , steinhart discerns a kind of consensus drawing is more spontaneous and personal than painting for some it is addictive and those who are obsessed by drawing are less engaged by producing than by practicing steinhart puts it this way we do it not because we 're good at it , but because there is some prospect that if we keep doing it , eventually we may be good he also turns to matisse , lautrec , ingres , van gogh , ruskin , leonardo and even pliny for their take on the art of drawing he comes up with some memorable quotations , although a few are not terribly helpful consider delacroix telling baudelaire , if you are not skillful enough to sketch a man falling out of a window during the time it takes him to get from the fifth story to the ground , you will never be able to produce monumental work steinhart has also unearthed some surprising bits of information from his excavations of the past i did n't know that one of the reasons van gogh considered committing himself to the asylum at montevergues was that he wished to draw the inmates working in the field , or that when matisse saw picasso s demoiselles d'avignon , he called it a hoax a hoax is exactly how many of steinhart s friends regard abstract expressionism their painting is millionaire art , the painter bernard perlin complains who else can afford it \? or live with it \? steinhart harbors the same prejudices , but does n't indulge in polemics he simply wants us to share in the joy and struggle of trying to make a good drawing you get some idea of what he regards as a good drawing from the 31 reproductions in the book , which run the gamut from academic nudes by artists i suspect are his friends to sketches by eakins and matisse and a starry night by van gogh this selection , while certainly catholic , could have profited from the addition of even more approaches the spontaneous energy of felix topolski , the merciless distortions of alice neel or the meticulous observations of james mcmullan , for example if readers of this book , presumably already interested in drawing , are to gain the courage to find their own personal vision , they must be exposed to the many ways there are to draw steinhart is one of those lucky writers who ca n't help being entertaining , even when he s making a serious inquiry i was n't long into the book before i felt i was in the presence of a friend , with both of us kvetching about how difficult it is to do a decent drawing , let alone a good one , and how it s always a surprise when it happens edward sorel s satiric drawings are on exhibit in a retrospective show at the wilhelm busch museum in hanover , germany
four years ago , the governor of new york and leading state legislators gave permission for the metropolitan transportation authority to pay off old bonds by borrowing 14 billion , creating a steep pile of new debt for a transit system filled with ancient structures , middleaged equipment and little money to replace them today , with the mta facing short and longrange financial crises , the public benefit of that decision remains a matter of vigorous dispute yet for two small groups involved in the 14 billion borrowing the seven private underwriting firms commissioned by the mta to raise the money , and leading state political figures who wield influence over the mta the bond issue has been an unambiguous success , an analysis of public records shows the sales of the new bonds generated an estimated 85 million in commissions and fees to the mta s bond underwriters , lawyers and financial advisers in pursuit of a share of profits from those and other mta deals , the underwriters reported that they paid more than 3 million to consultants , among them three men with ties to gov george e pataki , who appoints the mta chairman and even though the securities industry has tried to limit campaign contributions by companies doing bond work for public agencies , the firms hired by the mta gave at least 11 million to state political funds since 2000 , when the decision to borrow the money was announced their political contributions peaked in 2002 , when most of the bonds were issued that year , the firms made 408 , 000 in campaign contributions , twice as much as they gave in the years before and after the largest was a check for 100 , 000 paid to the new york state republican housekeeping fund in 2002 by a political action committee at jp morgan chase , which was the lead underwriter that year on 18 billion in mta bonds a spokesman for the bank , michael dorfsman , would not say what prompted the contribution a spokesman for the mta , tom kelly , said the contributions had no bearing on which underwriting firms were selected all of the mta underwriters work with other new york agencies as well since 2000 , the state s republican party or its candidates received about 2 from the mta underwriters for every 1 given to democrats , the records show in that period , ubs financial services gave 62 , 000 to the conservative party , a small but influential presence in new york that has delivered its spot on the ballot to governor pataki all three times he was elected ubs also contributed 115 , 000 to the democratic party , which controls the state assembly , and 109 , 000 to the republicans , who hold a majority in the state senate , along with the governor s office a spokeswoman for ubs , susan austin , said , all contributions made by ubs financial services inc as a firm and contributions made by the firm s employees are made in compliance with industry rules and state laws the adequacy of those rules has been reconsidered in recent months by the governing body of the public finance industry , the municipal securities rulemaking board , which has expressed concern that government agencies , known as issuers , have pressured underwriters seeking their business to hire certain consultants or make political contributions , according to the board s executive director , christopher a taylor the board members are well aware of what practices are going on , the pressures being brought to bear on them by issuers , mr taylor said we were looking at trends that caused concern on the part of the board increased use of consultants , increased compensation , increased political giving he was speaking , he said , about the industry in general and not a specific agency in the early 1990 s , the board developed regulations to eliminate pay to play , the practice of underwriters making campaign contributions in exchange for public business even so , these rules issued after widely reported scandals in the industry have allowed underwriting firms to continue to make substantial political contributions in new york and elsewhere political money may be given by affiliates of the underwriters not directly involved in public finance or can be channeled into general party housekeeping accounts , mr taylor said the board warned the industry last year that payments to political housekeeping accounts could not be used to make contributions that were otherwise forbidden , he said as for consultants , the board recently proposed banning them but dropped the idea after protests from its members , mr taylor said it is now considering other limitations nixon peabody , a law firm that was paid 812 , 000 by the mta to work on the bond issue and which is not bound by the same nominal limits on political donations as the underwriters has given 91 , 000 to friends of pataki since 2000 , making it the largest corporate contributor to the governor s campaign the firm works with many agencies in new york other than the mta including contributions from some of its partners , the firm gave at least 232 , 000 to public officials and political parties at every level of government in the state , the records show arthur f mcmahon , a partner in the firm , did not respond to a request for comment goldman sachs , which was paid 12 million by the mta to be a financial adviser on the bond refinancing deal , gave at least 136 , 500 to state republicans and democrats the smallest amount given by any mta underwriter was 7 , 000 from a firm then called salomon smith barney in 2000 , when the mta solicited proposals for the underwriting positions , merrill lynch contributed 15 , 000 each to the housekeeping accounts of the state republican and democratic parties in mid2002 , the company hired powers , crane company , a firm that included william powers , the former chairman of the state s republican party mr powers , now in a firm called powers company , is being paid 16 , 000 a month to help merrill lynch gain state business , according to the latest disclosure records he did not return a call requesting a comment on his role mr kelly , the mta spokesman , said that seemingly influential consultants played no role in the choice of underwriters none of the people that you mention were involved in the selection process , met with anyone in the selection committee , or to the best of what they 're telling me , ever discussed it with anybody , mr kelly said at least two of the mta s underwriters , however , stated unequivocally that their consultants helped them get mta business , according to disclosure forms first albany , which did not participate in the 14 billion refinancing but went on to capture other mta work , listed davidson o'mara as its consultant , for a fee that reached 20 , 000 a month john o'mara , the former chairman of the public services commission under governor pataki , is a partner in the firm he is the chairman of a panel that screens judicial candidates for the governor , and also represents him in negotiations over indian tribal land claims , many related to casino development first albany did not reply to a request to discuss the matter , but shortly after it was selected as one of the underwriters for mta work in 2000 , the company reported that mr o'mara had made that happen first albany was recently appointed to the senior manager rotation of the metropolitan transportation authority , the report stated , under the heading municipal securities business obtained or retained by the o'mara firm the report was submitted to the municipal securities rulemaking board similarly , disclosure forms filed by ubs financial services state that douglas rutnik , employed at a fee of 5 , 000 a month , plus bonuses , helped it win mta business beginning in 2003 , he was employed by morgan stanley at 10 , 000 a month , plus bonuses , according to disclosure forms , but these do not list any successes mr rutnik , who did not respond to a request for comment , is solidly grounded in both political parties a prominent upstate democrat , he was a frequent hunting companion of the late erastus corning , the mayor of albany for 42 years , and he has also been the companion of zenia mucha , the former director of communications for governor pataki mark lane , a spokesman for morgan stanley , said the firm would not discuss mr rutnik s services the mta bond sales are described in the industry as the largest refinancing in the history of municipal bonds the amount of money borrowed is more than the cost of the most expensive public works projects ever undertaken by the state yet only a fraction of it will go toward the purchase of tangible new things like subway cars or new track most of the money raised went to paying off existing bonds that were due to be retired within the next decade the interest on the bonds that replaced them will continue until 2034 in effect , the mta has prolonged the payments for equipment bought years ago , and increased the interest costs by 86 billion , according to a report by alan g hevesi , the state comptroller , and kenneth b bleiwas , the deputy state comptroller for new york city gene russianoff , who has closely monitored the transit system for 25 years as a leader of the straphangers campaign , warned in 2000 that the refinancing plan , while granting a short spell of fiscal peace , simply postponed some problems and would cripple the system with debt in a rare alliance , mr russianoff was joined in his critique by a former mta chairman , robert r kiley , and the president of local 100 of the transport workers union , sonny hall , as well as independent budget monitors nevertheless , a capital review board with delegates from the state legislature , the governor and the city gave their approval to the refinancing mta officials said that by refinancing at lower interest rates along with improvements to its bond ratings the agency received about 4 billion in new money that let the agency pay for its capital program for a short period without immediate pressure on the state budget or transit fares that respite has ended the annual interest costs borne by the transit system will double between this year and 2008 , according to the controller by then , payment on the debt will command 21 cents of every dollar collected by the mta even with significant service cuts , mta officials say , fare increases will be needed to pay the mounting debt burden and higher labor costs moreover , the costs of the 2002 bond refinancing will absorb so much money in the coming decades that the mta does not have funds to pay for ordinary replacement of equipment and facilities that have reached the end of their useful lives when mr hevesi issued a report critical of the mta in late october , peter kalikow , the current chairman of the mta , said responsibility for the 14 billion borrowing program rested not just with the mta but across a spectrum of new york public officials he ignores the fact that the entire plan and its financing structure were unanimously approved by the capital program review board , comprised of representatives of both city and state government , mr kalikow said in a written reply to mr hevesi s report , alluding to mr hevesi last week , mr kalikow proposed an array of tax increases to finance the agency s capital needs
bashing federal bureaucracies is a favorite sport among republicans on capitol hill , but their fun should not come at the expense of national security that is what is likely to happen if airport security checkpoints are once again turned over to profitdriven private contractors under a littlenoticed provision of the post9 11 aviation security law that would undoubtedly shock most travelers , airports may soon have that option air travelers find it reassuring that federal employees now guard the front lines in the war on terror , which makes it all the more surreal that a sept 10 mindset could still persist on capitol hill the bush administration and house republican leaders initially opposed the creation of the federal transportation security administration after the 2001 terrorist attacks , arguing that private contractors should continue screening passengers they gave in to the public demand for a federal takeover , but they made sure to plant the seeds of the effort s rollback they set an arbitrary cap on the number of federal screeners and set up a pilot program of five airports that would continue being served by private companies , though their screeners have to meet the agency s standards and are paid the same republican leaders are loath to see the federal government grow on their watch , and security industry lobbyists are eager to get a larger slice of the billions being spent to protect air travelers so both want to see the pilot program expanded under the 2001 law , individual airports will be able to apply to opt out of the federal system later this year , and rely on private contractors overseen by the tsa none of this makes any sense it has taken a herculean effort to deploy the agency s tens of thousands of officers at more than 400 airports in two years the agency has vastly improved airport security , without perfecting it , and is still making progress it s true that the security provided by private firms at san francisco and four lesser airports is a far cry from the lax pre9 11 standard studies claim it is no better or worse than the security provided by the tsa but that has been in a period when the federal agency was just getting up to speed , and when companies knew they were essentially on probation to privatize security at a time of growing complacency would be a dangerous step back air travelers do not want to see airports compromise security for the sake of convenience , or federal standards for the sake of profit margins
kew gardens does not look much like the setting of an urban horror story nestled along the tracks of the long island rail road , 16 minutes by train from pennsylvania station , the queens neighborhood is quiet and well kept , its streets shaded by tall oaks and bordered by handsome redbrick and woodframe houses at first glance , the surroundings appear as remote from bigcity clamor as a farflung westchester suburb forty years ago , on march 13 , 1964 , the picturesque tranquillity of kew gardens was shattered by the murder of 28yearold catherine genovese , known as kitty the murder was grisly , but it was n't the particulars of the killing that became the focus of the case it was the response of her neighbors as ms genovese screamed please help me ! please help me ! 38 witnesses did nothing to intervene , according to reports nobody even bothered to call the police one witness later explained himself with a phrase that has passed into infamy i did n't want to get involved seldom has a crime in new york city galvanized public outrage so intensely newspapers spread the story across the nation and as far away as istanbul and moscow clergymen and politicians decried the events , while psychologists scrambled to comprehend them at a time when the world seemed to be unraveling kennedy had been assassinated four months earlier , harlem was on the verge of race riots , crime rates were suddenly taking off the case quickly expanded into an allconsuming metaphor for the ills of contemporary urban life a psychiatrist speculated that television had rendered the witnesses inactive by making them almost delusional other observers cited a general moral collapse of modern society when you have this general sense that things are going wrong , you look for events that are going to confirm that , said neal gabler , author of life the movie how entertainment conquered reality a society in which people are indifferent to one another a society in which no one cares a society in which we are all atomized here you had a story that confirmed all of those anxieties and fears but for all that has been said and written about ms genovese s murder , important questions persist some kew gardens residents maintain , even now , that there were fewer than 38 witnesses and that many of them could not have seen much of the killing in other words , that there was less coldheartedness in kew gardens than has been commonly portrayed psychologists continue to grapple with the social implications of the neighbors' response and then there is the woman who occupies the tragic center of this landmark case some of the details of ms genovese s life have tended to get lost beneath the appalling circumstances of her death a peaceful life kitty genovese , the petite eldest child of an italianamerican family , grew up in park slope , brooklyn when her family moved to new canaan , conn , she stayed in the city and , in the spring of 1963 , settled in kew gardens with a roommate , mary ann zielonko , she took an apartment in a twostory tudorstyle building on austin street , near the village , as residents referred to the central cluster of shops across the street rose one of the few highrises in the neighborhood , an elegant 10story apartment house called the mowbray tony corrado , an 84yearold upholsterer who has owned a small shop on austin street since the 1950 s , recalls the day a cheerful ms genovese moved in she knocked on his door and asked him to give her help carrying a sofa up the stairs that was my introduction to kitty , mr corrado said i remember saying , boy , gonna be a lot of wild parties up there i thought they were airline stewardesses , which we had a lot coming in in fact , ms genovese worked as manager at a tavern in hollis , queens , called ev s 11th hour , and she and ms zielonko lived a quiet , peaceful life over mr corrado s shop crime rates were still low in the spring of 1963 , and many residents slept with their doors unlocked a cat burglar had recently made the rounds , and occasionally a loud drunk stumbled out of the old bailey bar , but these were minor disturbances i used to say , gee , nothing ever happens in kew gardens , mr corrado recalled and all of a sudden , this nightmare the nightmare struck a year after ms genovese moved in shortly after 3 am on that night in march , she was driving home from ev s 11th hour as she stopped her fiat at a red light , she caught the eye of winston moseley , a business machine operator from ozone park he had been cruising the streets in his white corvair , searching for a woman to mutilate mr moseley tailed ms genovese to kew gardens , to the paved lot of the railroad station when she got out of her car , he followed on foot ms genovese began to run up austin street , but he quickly caught up and stabbed her in the back as she screamed , he stabbed her again , then twice more a window opened in the mowbray and a man s voice called out leave that girl alone ! mr moseley later told the police he was not that concerned about the voice i had a feeling this man would close his window and go back to sleep , he said but he ran off upon hearing it he moved his car to a more discreet location , changed his hat , then returned he found ms genovese collapsed in a foyer in the back of her building and finished what he 'd begun on austin street , stabbing and slashing her repeatedly , then leaving her to die the community as villain kitty genovese s murder did not initially attract much attention from the press the new york times gave it four paragraphs but 10 days later , am rosenthal , then metropolitan editor of the times , happened to meet police commissioner michael j murphy for lunch mr moseley had just been arrested and had confessed to the murders of both ms genovese and another young woman when the subject turned to mr moseley s double confession , mr murphy , who is dead , mentioned the 38 witnesses brother , he said , that queens story is one for the books as mr rosenthal later recounted in his own book about the genovese case , thirtyeight witnesses , he knew he 'd just been handed a startling scoop , and he assigned it to a reporter , martin gansberg , that afternoon a few days later , mr gansberg , who died in 1995 , filed his story , and it soon appeared on the front page for more than half an hour 38 respectable , lawabiding citizens in queens watched a killer stalk and stab a woman in three separate attacks in kew gardens , the article began twice the sound of their voices and the sudden glow of their bedroom lights interrupted him and frightened him off each time he returned , sought her out and stabbed her again beginning with its plain but indelible first sentence , the article suggested that 38 eyewitnesses had seen all , or at least a substantial part , of the killing that they had watched it for half an hour , almost as if gaping at a performance the times was first to describe this horrifying spectacle , but it would soon have plenty of company writing in life magazine , loudon wainwright put it like this for the most part , the witnesses , crouching in darkened windows like watchers of a late show , looked on until the play had passed from their view a pall fell over kew gardens in the months after the murder people had an impression of kew gardens that was unbelievable , said charles skoller , a queens assistant district attorney at the time who would help prosecute the killer at his insanity trial the entire community was villainous slowly , though , life returned to its tranquil ways in kew gardens slowly , the residents began to shake off their stigma and slowly , some of them began to insist that the portrayal of their neighborhood had been unfair , based on exaggerated accounts by police and journalists as mr corrado said , kew gardens got a bad rap in the years since ms genovese s death , this charge has been repeated a handful of times in newspaper articles , including a daily news column by john melia in 1984 and , more briefly , a 1995 account in the times no one , though , has ever undertaken the task of defending kew gardens as assiduously as joseph de may jr a more complex view it was never the intention of mr de may , a 54yearold maritime lawyer , to spend hundreds of hours analyzing a decadesold murder indeed , he had little interest in the subject of kitty genovese s death until two years ago that is when he decided , as a hobby , to create a nostalgic web site devoted to kew gardens , where he 'd lived for almost 30 years if he was going to delve into his neighborhood s past , he reasoned , he 'd certainly have to consider its most notorious episode in the end , mr de may s conclusion about the murder is that , while the behavior of the witnesses was hardly beyond reproach , the common conception of exactly what occurred that night is not in fact what occurred what did occur , he argues , is far more complex and far less damning to the residents of kew gardens yeah , there was a murder , mr de may said yeah , people heard something you can question how a few people behaved but this was n't 38 people watching a woman be slaughtered for 35 minutes and saying , 'oh , i do n't want to be involved mr de may began his research with the seminal times article of march 27 , 1964 i remember reading through it , then putting it down and thinking , 'well , this does n't hang together at all , he said and then i read it again carefully i knew the area i knew the crime scene because i go by there every day mr de may soon found himself poring through legal documents related to the case , scouring books and articles , and interviewing neighbors at one point , he even ran the route of ms genovese s flight up austin street , timing it with a watch he became convinced that his first impression was correct here s something that everyone thinks happened , he said , that is n't so his argument , made in full at oldkewgardenscom , boils down to two claims that the great majority of the 38 socalled witnesses did not see any part of the actual killing and that what most of them did see , or hear , was fleeting and vague to begin , he points out that there were two attacks on kitty genovese , not three , as the times initially indicated the newspaper later acknowledged the discrepancy it was caused by confused police accounts but three is still given as the number of attacks , recently in the tipping point by malcolm gladwell and new york an illustrated history by ric burns and james sanders since the extra attack was supposed to have occurred in full view of surrounding windows , it added to an impression of callous disregard by neighbors of the two attacks that did occur , the first was on austin street , across from the mowbray contrary to what some accounts imply , mr de may , citing courtroom testimony , contends that this first attack must have lasted only minutes before mr moseley jogged off to his car by the time most witnesses heard the screams and made it to their windows , mr de may argues , they saw just a young woman walking or stumbling alone down austin street toward the side of her building , then vanishing around the corner every bit as significant as the brevity of the first attack , mr de may believes , was the location of the second , more sustained attack this occurred in a narrow foyer at the back of ms genovese s building , indoors and facing away from the mowbray toward the railroad tracks this is where kitty had gone to seek safety , and where mr moseley discovered her only one witness , a man who lived at the top of the stairs , could have seen what occurred in that foyer , mr de may said charles skoller , the former assistant district attorney , supports part of mr de may s conclusion i do n't think 38 people witnessed it , said mr skoller , now retired i do n't know where that came from , the 38 i did n't count 38 we only found half a dozen that saw what was going on , that we could use but mr skoller is far less willing than mr de may to forgive the neighbors even if not all saw the crime , mr skoller is convinced they heard it i believe that many people heard the screams , he said it could have been more than 38 and anyone that heard the screams had to know there was a vicious crime taking place there s no doubt in my mind about that many witnesses claimed they thought it was a lovers' quarrel or a drunken argument spilling out of the old bailey mr de may points out that a good number of the witnesses were elderly , and nearly all awoke from deep slumbers , their brains befogged , their windows shut to the cold furthermore , he raises the possibility that several witnesses did call the police after the first attack , but that their calls were ignored and never recorded am rosenthal , who went on to become executive editor of the times , stands by the article he assigned to mr gansberg 40 years ago , right down to the word watched in its opening sentence this questioning of details , he said , is to be expected in a story that gets a lot of attention , there s always somebody who s saying , 'well , that s not really what it s supposed to be , said mr rosenthal , who is retired from the times and now writes a column for the daily news there may have been minor inaccuracies , he allows , but none that alter the story s essential meaning there may have been 38 , there may have been 39 , he said , but the whole picture , as i saw it , was very affecting theory , guilt and loss nowhere was the case more affecting than among america s psychologists it was monumental , said harold takooshian , a professor of urban psychology at fordham university before the murder , he added , nobody really had any idea why people did not help , and conversely why people did help the psychologists were really stunned by their lack of information on this the first major studies prompted by the murder , conducted in the 1960 s by the psychologists bibb latane and john darley , arrived at a counterintuitive conclusion the greater the number of bystanders who view an emergency , the smaller the chance that any will intervene people tend to feel a diffusion of responsibility in groups , the two concluded kitty genovese would have been better off , in other words , had one witness seen or heard her attack , rather than the reputed 38 in the years since these experiments , the study of human altruism has developed into a whole new branch of psychology , now known as prosocial behavior that area did not exist before , professor takooshian said and , still , ms genovese s death continues to haunt the field on march 9 , professor takooshian will host a symposium at fordham to revisit many of the conundrums posed by that night 40 years ago it is psychology that probably offers the best explanation of the issues the case raised a raft of behavioral studies performed over the last 40 years suggests that ms genovese s neighbors reacted as they reportedly did not because they were apathetic or coldhearted , but because they were confused , uncertain and afraid where others might have seen them as villains , professor takooshian said , psychologists see these people as normal normal or not , many of the 38 were consumed by guilt after the crime others simply got fed up with the negative attention , and many of them moved away from kew gardens it was just too much for them , i guess , said mr corrado , sitting in his shop , looking out over the spot where ms genovese was first attacked ms genovese s death hit hardest , of course , among those who loved her this includes mary ann zielonko , the young woman who moved with her to kew gardens and who had the grim task of identifying her remains one of the many littleknown facts about ms genovese was her close relationship with ms zielonko , an omission that perhaps was understandable in 1964 she was actually my partner , said ms zielonko , who now lives in vermont we were lovers together everybody tried to hush that up ms zielonko still becomes emotional remembering the horror of ms genovese s death , but brightens as she recalls what she cherished it sounds trite , she said , but it was her smile she had a great smile william genovese , one of kitty s four younger siblings , offers other memories of his sister he remembers how she would sweep into new canaan to visit the family in her nash rambler , or later in her red fiat , fresh from the city and bubbling with new ambitions and ideas he remembers how the two of them would stay up late into the night talking about subjects as esoteric as solipsism and einstein s theory of relativity she and i had a special affinity , mr genovese said two years after his sister s murder , mr genovese volunteered for the marines , a decision he attributes to his disgust with public apathy i became obsessed with saving people , he said when i got to vietnam , i would have flashbacks of my sister all the time i 'd find myself in situations where i 'd think , 'this is a test' that s the way i viewed it

havana , nov 5 the international festival of ballet here , which ends on saturday , has given some balletcrazed cubans their first chance to savor the choreography of george balanchine lourdes libertad , a bolero singer , saw the work of the man many say was the 20th century s greatest choreographer for the first time on monday night it s very beautiful , she said at intermission it s different it s more contemporary all that is true but is it balanchine \? only one of the seven pieces performed this week is currently licensed by the george balanchine foundation two have expired licenses , and the rest were copied from videotapes the debate over the authenticity of these productions has emerged at a festival already hurt by the united states government s restrictions on travel to cuba nine dancers from the new york city ballet and one from the dance theater of harlem were barred from attending , making this the first time in 30 years that an american has not performed at the festival piracy is rampant in cuba a sampling of the shows offered by staterun television this week includes charlie s angels , law and order and the film the truth about charlie the problem is also acute in dance , a medium whose integrity depends on human contact cuba does not acknowledge the geneva conventions , so we have no control over what they might perform , said ellen sorrin , the director of the balanchine foundation in new york if they lived anywhere else in the world , they 'd have to license the ballets the copyrights are owned none of those ballets are in the public domain the foundation s mission is to preserve the artistic integrity of balanchine s legacy as part of the licensing process , the foundation sends a teacher to present the material on a new company it also charges a fee and , said ms sorrin , vigorously pursues any copyright violations that come to its attention our preference would be to have someone go and not only stage but keep the ballet looking as it should , she added but it s been difficult to do that there used to be a time when there was more opportunity to do that , when the cultural exchange was more open alicia alonso , the director of the ballet nacional de cuba , invited nilas martins and eight other new york city ballet dancers to perform an allbalanchine program at the festival this year , but the treasury department barred their participation , citing a regulation that prohibits americans from taking part in international festivals in cuba in addition , rasta thomas , from the dance theater of harlem , was invited to perform don quixote with one of the ballet nacional de cuba s biggest stars , viengsay vald s , but was unable to attend we do n't license travel to cuba when you could be engaging in similar activities elsewhere , said molly millerwise , a spokeswoman for the treasury department she added , there are countless countries around the world not ruled by an oppressive and dangerous dictator in which americans can participate in and promote cultural exchange at the international level those who travel to cuba illegally can face penalties of up to 65 , 000 two dancers from the houston ballet zdenek konvalina , a citizen of the czech republic , and leticia oliveira , a citizen of brazil arrived in havana late monday and performed a licensed version of balanchine s tchaikovsky pas de deux on tuesday they did not apply to the treasury department for permission because , mr konvalina s agent said , they had been advised by a lawyer that it was unnecessary nilas martins and company \( featuring dancers from city ballet \) was to perform licensed productions of balanchine s sylvia pas de deux , the minkus pas de trois , tarantella and excerpts from who cares \? and chaconne at the festival what cuban audiences are seeing instead are performances of theme and variations and apollo , which have expired licenses , as well as unlicensed performances of agon , scotch symphony , the sylvia pas de deux and the tchaikovsky pas de deux , performed by dancers from the ballet nacional de cuba ballo della regina , which merrill ashley taught to the company in 2000 , is the only authorized production it s a shame in the sense that they would have been bringing to cuba what they 've missed in these last 45 years of dance , said lourdes lopez , a cubanborn former city ballet dancer who is now the executive director of the balanchine foundation they 've been in many ways left behind george balanchine is the greatest choreographer of the 20th century , and they have no access to his work other than through pirated tapes to be sure , ms alonso , the director of the ballet nacional de cuba , is no stranger to balanchine s work she danced in his production of apollo in the american ballet caravan , a precursor to the new york city ballet , and balanchine created the ballerina role for her in theme and variations but neither she nor anyone else in cuba is authorized by the foundation to teach balanchine s ballets , and it is unclear how effectively ms alonso , who is nearly blind , can ensure the integrity of the choreography if the national ballet of cuba is mounting ballets based on film or video or someone s memory of something , there is no question the performance will suffer , ms sorrin said the ballet nacional is known for its careful allegiance to stylistic variations , and miguel cabrera , the company s historian , maintains that the company has been vigilant in its respect for balanchine s work alicia knows there are international regulations for balanchine s pieces , and she respects them internationally , he said but in the national context , she thinks the cuban public has the right to enjoy balanchine s pieces he added here it is considered that balanchine s work belongs to humanity these economic rules civilization has imposed against the spiritual enrichment of human beings , i am 100 percent against ms alonso herself was not available for comment loipa ara jo , a ballet master with the company who spends much of the year teaching abroad , said that she had watched authorized teachers present balanchine s works to european companies and that she brought that knowledge back to cuba the embargo has also made it difficult to maintain ballets by american choreographers , and some say that the quality of even those ballets that were obtained legally has decayed over time in 1978 jerome robbins s production of in the night was licensed for two years to the ballet nacional in 1998 ms lopez went to havana to dance in the international festival of ballet and saw the piece performed the ballet was unrecognizable , she said it had disintegrated the choreography had been changed hard steps were taken out i know this ballet well i had danced it the music was slow it was not the same ballet ms ara jo said the dance had been pulled from the company s repertory alicia thinks it is not done the right way , she said it was something given to her by jerome robbins , and she takes good care of it another dispute involves the costuming in the ballet nacional s production of apollo when it was performed on monday , the three muses , who are usually bareheaded , wore sparkling white caps in the original production , the three muses wore wigs , but balanchine quickly discarded them if for 30 years , 'apollo' under george balanchine had not been danced with the wigs , who are you to put a wig on it \? ms lopez said but the ballet nacional maintains that both early and late versions of a ballet are valid we keep the piece like balanchine created it , ms ara jo said it s not that we invented the wigs it was the first vision balanchine had of 'apollo ' if you want to see how the first 'apollo' was done , she added , come to cuba correction november 17 , 2004 , wednesday because of an editing error , an article in the arts on nov 6 about performances of george balanchine ballets in cuba misstated the name of the organization that licenses them it is the george balanchine trust \( the george balanchine foundation is a separate organization that promotes dance and the balanchine legacy \) because of another editing error , the article misidentified the company in which alicia alonso , director of the ballet nacional de cuba , once danced in balanchines apollo it was ballet theater \( now american ballet theater \) american ballet caravan was a predecessor troupe of the new york city ballet

expanding at an expected rate of 55 percent we are very grateful that the chinese economy is so active , mongolia s prime minister , nambaryn enkhbayar , said noting that china is running short of coal , he said that a chinese company planned to start mining coal in eastern mongolia this year dozens of cranes puncture the summer sky here as chinese construction crews build new apartment and office buildings , softening the old soviet image of the city shedding 75 years of russian economic domination in a decade , mongolia is rapidly becoming china s canada , a northern resource this is my vision of this country mongolia as a canada , sedbazar otgonbat , vice chairman of mongolia s foreign investment and foreign trade agency , said in an interview china and mongolia must work hand in hand , as canada and the usa historically marginalized by its landlocked location , mongolia now finds that the rise of china is giving it a frontrow seat for the biggest economic story in the world today some people say mongolia s landlocked economy is a disadvantage i say that , with china , it is an advantage , said d jargalsaikhan , chairman of the mineral resources authority of mongolia , a state agency what makes mongolia unique is that it has china as a neighbor the chinese market is just like a black hole where everything disappears copper , iron , zinc with china the new point of reference , over 30 chinese language schools have opened here in recent years china is the big brother , you cannot avoid china , said l sumati , director of the sant maral polling group trained in moscow , mr sumati now has his two children , both in their 20 s , studying in beijing last march , 400 mongolian students competed for 10 scholarships offered by beijing to study in china a decade ago , if you wanted to study chinese , you would have had to go moscow , mr wong , the chinese diplomat , said more and more mongolians are studying chinese before , russian was the dominant foreign language here with russian visas rules strict , many mongolians and foreigners based here say they have stopped traveling north this bureaucracy , this oldtime thinking is strangling our economic relations with russia , said ganbold , a local journalist as china pours money into developing its own western regions , mongolia suddenly finds that modern cities and highways are taking shape only a few hundred miles away the chinese government is adopting big plans to develop the west , mr wong said this will be beneficial to mongolia with most mongolians allowed to visit china without visas , a snowbird phenomenon has evolved , with about 400 , 000 mongolians visiting china last year , compared with 182 , 000 chinese who visited here but many of the chinese who came were investors according to the chinese embassy , there are 1 , 100 chinese companies in mongolia we probably have 100 chinese restaurants now , said stephen d vance , executive director of mongolians for open society , a group that received donations from the soros foundation the textile industry is pretty much 50 percent chinese the leather industry is dominated by chinese cashmere is more than owned by chinese to some the chinese economic draw can be destructive mongolia used to have four million deer there are almost none now , said mr otgonbat , the vice chairman of the mongolian government s foreign investment and foreign trade agency why \? the chinese buy deer antlers by shooting them one by one , the whole population has been killed but mining is the big economic attraction for china every day i meet a new chinese company , said mr jargalsaikhan , the chairman of mineral resources authority , an investment office oyun sanjaasuren , an opposition congresswoman , said of her old constituency in northeast mongolia , in my constituency , i saw last spring chinese companies driving around northeast mongolia looking at a lead mine , a zinc mine , a uranium mine and a lowquality coal mine this week , the big news was that jiangxi copper signed a preliminary agreement to study buying a major share in development of oyu tolgoi , or turquoise hill , one of the three largest copper and gold deposits in the world ivanhoe mines , the owner of the mine , in the gobi , is preparing to start work within months on what could be a 1 billion mine world copper prices are running about 60 percent higher than this time last year china is the world s largest consumer of copper however , one foreign businessman warned about the possibility of a nationalist backlash if a chinese company wrests control of the huge mine everyone from the cabinet level to the herders would protest , out of fear of being consumed by china , he said to diversify economic ties away from china , otgonbayar yondon , secretary of the ruling mongolian people s revolutionary party , said that the government wanted to renegotiate free trade treaties with the united states , japan , south korea and the european union down in the gobi desert recently , buyantogtokh delgerjav , a local governor , said that economic diversification was the best policy to follow in mongolia , we say we are a little piece of kidney squeezed between two pieces of fat , he said we ca n't afford to have bad relations with china or russia
stocks are still awfully pricey , at least by historical standards and with interest rates rising , bonds may be primed for a fall that could add up to a nasty onetwo punch for the average portfolio so , many financial advisers say it may be time to start looking into alternatives like hedge funds as well as mutual funds that invest in real estate and commodities at first blush , the idea sounds counterintuitive after all , commodities are not exactly riskfree but the goal is to decrease overall risk by including asset classes that may be dicey in themselves but are unlikely to move in the same direction as stocks and bonds for example , when inflation picks up , stock and bond returns tend to fall , but commodities and real estate tend to do well if you can find an asset that is not highly correlated with the stock market and it has a good shot at delivering decent returns , adding it to your portfolio can increase your overall return without increasing risk , even if the asset is risky on its own , said ben inker , director of asset allocation at grantham mayo van otterloo , which manages 60 billion in traditional and alternative investments in boston alternative investments have worked well for david and karan richardson of tewksbury township , nj in june 2000 , they added realestate funds to their sevenfigure nest egg , on the advice of christopher cordaro , chief investment officer at regentatlantic capital , a wealth management firm in chatham , nj the alternatives cushioned our portfolio very nicely in 2001 and 2002 , mr richardson said we saw a decline in capital , but it was not as bad as the stock indexes last year , the couple added a hedge fund to their investments , and they are now considering commodities that would raise their commitment to alternatives to regentatlantic s recommended 20 percent mr cordaro s firm found that including alternative assets in a basic stock and bond portfolio increased returns and cut down on volatility from 1994 through 2003 researchers compared two portfolios the first held 60 percent of its assets in the standard poor s 500stock index and 40 percent in the lehman intermediate government credit bond index the second kept a total of 20 percent of its assets in the wilshire reit index , the dow jones aig commodities index and the credit suisse first boston tremont hedge fund index , with the remaining 80 percent divided between the sp 500 \( 48 percent \) and the lehman bond index \( 32 percent \) the portfolio using the alternative assets would have returned 101 percent a year , versus 96 percent for the basic portfolio moreover , returns of the portfolio with alternatives were less volatile than those of the traditional one none of the returns included costs of making the investments it s like adding a steam engine to a sailing ship , mr cordaro said alternatives not only provide ballast , but another source of power this view is not held universally some investors , particularly those with less wealth , should avoid alternative investments because they can be volatile and hard to trade , said john ueleke , president of legacy wealth management , an investment advisory firm in memphis commodities like gold , oil and pork bellies are notorious for their violent price swings , while hedge funds , most of which are unregistered investment vehicles , have been known to blow up these nontraditional investments by their very nature are not suitable for individuals , mr ueleke said he limits alternatives to the 20 percent of his clients who have at least 15 million in assets for them , he recommends a 15 percent to 20 percent allocation to alternatives still , in recent years , mutual funds and registered hedge funds have given people with relatively modest portfolios easy access to some of these investments the big benefit of funds , of course , is diversification mutual funds specializing in real estate investment trusts , for example , have returned 138 percent , annualized , in the three years through thursday , according to morningstar inc , versus a loss of 26 percent for the sp 500 given the improved economy and the small supply of new real estate investment trusts , or reit s , real estate funds should continue to provide good income and portfolio diversification benefits , said dan mcneela , senior analyst at morningstar but some advisers worry that real estate funds may be overvalued and they advise caution with funds that provide exposure to commodities including oppenheimer real asset and pimco commodity real return their returns can be very volatile the oppenheimer fund , created in march 1997 , reported a loss of 4485 percent in 1998 , a gain of 44 percent in 2000 and a loss of 3135 percent in 2001 last year , it soared 226 percent the pimco fund , started in november 2002 , also rocketed last year , up 291 percent while commodities can be great hedges against inflation , investors are advised to keep their allocation to such funds to no more than 10 percent , mr mcneela said the benefit of funds of hedge funds , an even newer alternative , is that they are registered with the securities and exchange commission , which makes their operations more transparent , and they invest in as many as three dozen other hedge funds , which helps diminish the risk from any one fund among registered hedge funds that have piqued advisers' interest are the undiscovered managers multistrategy fund , which requires a 40 , 000 minimum investment , and the rydex sphinx fund , which requires a 25 , 000 minimum and is intended to track the s p hedge fund index traditional , unregistered hedge funds may impose minimums of 1 million or more one problem with funds of funds is a layering of fees hedge fund managers typically take 20 percent of returns above a benchmark , plus an annual management fee of 1 to 2 percent generally , the manager of the fund of funds levies its own fees on top of that indeed , while these new investment vehicles provide opportunity for individuals to invest in alternatives , some analysts say that they 're not worth it we are in agreement with people who feel you should be looking outside traditional asset classes , said jeremy degroot , director of mutual fund research at litman gregory asset management , a registered investment adviser in orinda , calif but the reality is there are very , very few funds that meet our standards for investing the problems , he said , are that they have short performance histories , their expenses are high or their managers are reluctant to reveal too much about their strategies eleanor blayney , a certified financial planner at sullivan , bruyette , speros blayney in mclean , va , has also found practical hurdles to investing in alternatives like commodities and hedge funds and she said she was concerned that reit s were overvaluedwhile the idea of alternatives makes a lot of sense , ms blayney said , we find they 're very difficult and expensive she has focused on opportunities in subsectors of the traditional markets like smallcap and emergingmarkets stocks , highyield bonds and foreign government bonds similarly , mr ueleke advises those who are willing to take risks but have limited funds to focus on areas like smallcap international and microcap stock funds , which invest in the smallest public companies that s where people should start , he said then , when their portfolio is large enough , they can move on to alternatives
miscarriages and induced abortions do not increase a woman s risk of developing breast cancer later in life , according to a study of 83 , 000 women worldwide being published today the study s authors , from the university of oxford in england , said it was the largest to examine the issue , which has been highly charged politically and scientifically since researchers began studying the issue in the late 1950 s , some studies have suggested there is a slight risk while others have shown none although there is no scientific explanation for such a link , supporters of the higher risk findings have theorized that the breast cancer somehow resulted from a sudden change in a woman s hormonal balance after an abortion to help resolve the conflict , dr valerie beral led a team of oxford epidemiologists that asked authors of all earlier studies on a link between abortion and breast cancer to provide their original data authors of virtually all studies collaborated , and the new analysis included some previously unpublished studies , the scientists said their report appears in the journal lancet the oxford findings strengthen the opinion of a scientific panel of more than 100 of the world s experts on the issue appointed by the national cancer institute , a federal agency in bethesda , md last year , the panel concluded that abortion did not increase the risk of breast cancer the panel was appointed after antiabortion groups and their supporters in congress asserted that the cancer agency was playing down the link between abortion and breast cancer by applying identical statistical criteria to analyze original data from 53 studies carried out in 16 countries , dr beral s team said it identified a major systematic flaw that accounted for the inconsistency in earlier findings the flaw , which concerns the time when women were asked about whether they had had an abortion , falsely created the impression of an increased risk of breast cancer , the oxford team said earlier studies showed that women with breast cancer were more likely to report induced abortions than women who did not have breast cancer experts say that many people who develop a serious disease seek explanations for it , and acknowledging an abortion is more likely among women with breast cancer studies that reported a link between abortions and breast cancer had not asked women about abortions before they developed breast cancer , dr beral said
the trickle of cars and trucks begins before dawn , dropping below the major deegan expressway and onto a ghostly cobblestone road in the bronx pigeons often flutter in the shade of the steel overpass sleek sedans with embassy plates park alongside clunky family vans other people drift in off city buses day after day , the visitors disappear into graffitiscrawled buildings on exterior street , where some 25 stores a cluster known to many as the african market answer a singular wish to bring back the taste of home , at a bargain pepsodent toothpaste , the kind made in ghana , for 99 cents a tube bull penis , used in a jamaican soup , for 189 a pound goat legs , stacked in plastic bags , 25 each mercy cream , a small yellow pot with a potion prepared to effectively treat most skin diseases , for 199 in the same store , movies from nigeria and ghana , stacked four feet high , sell at 4 per video , but the familiarity they provide to immigrants like elizabeth wilberforce is priceless it keeps us going , said ms wilberforce , a 30yearold ghanaian , as she stood in kk african market watching grainy scenes from three beautiful apples , a movie from ghana this is the last incarnation of the bronx terminal market , a 32acre wholesale and retail market near yankee stadium that has played host to nearly eight decades of change and will soon become extinct related companies , the developer of the time warner center at columbus circle , took over the city lease to the decaying market in april with plans to build a multilevel retail center and garage there , and an esplanade and park along the harlem river once approved , the plans would be another victory in the ambitious quest for reinvention in the bronx , where eyesores are increasingly supplanted by new development but if the bronx s dream of swift urban renewal comes with a cost , it was felt in the hushed mood that passed through the bronx terminal market in the days after the lease changed hands the vendors will be forced to leave in two years for the shoppers immigrants who hail mostly from africa and the caribbean the market s closing threatens a vital link to the lives they left behind here is like a home to us , said michael akamo , 36 , a nigerian immigrant the very thing that makes business thrive for daniel ahenkora , an immigrant from ghana who owns the gold coast trading company in the center of the market , has lured developers to the site for years its unbeatable location it s got a highway , a subway and all those bridges coming over from manhattan , said jesse masyr , a zoning lawyer representing the related companies it s an area that has incredible infrastructure that you ca n't duplicate anymore the market draws shoppers from as far away as ohio , texas and colorado to stock up on goods they cannot find locally or that their local merchants sell at too high a price , vendors say some of the shoppers are those very merchants they own small stores or restaurants in other states , and depend on the market s low prices to make a living those prices allow alberto guzman , a dominican immigrant , to charge less at his restaurant in haverstraw , ny if i have to go elsewhere , i will have to raise my prices , said mr guzman , 42 , as he loaded boxes of orange juice into his van other shoppers act as couriers from immigrant outposts in cities where an african market is hard to find once or twice a month , edward akonor makes the fourhour trek in his dark green plymouth voyager from manchester , nh , carrying a shopping list and advance cash from about 20 ghanaian neighbors mr akonor , 46 , always buys the same things goats' legs , canned sardines , dried fish , indian head corn meal and ghanamade pepsodent for his four children , who prefer it to the sweeter , more popular toothpastes sold in the united states the family immigrated from accra , ghana s capital , to the bronx four years ago by that time , the number of ghanaians in new york city , roughly 15 , 000 according to the 2000 census , was nearly three times what it was 10 years earlier bronx terminal vendors had already tapped into the african market , and the akonors began shopping there they moved to new hampshire so mr akonor could study there for a master s degree in business , but kept coming back to the market i'm not too comfortable with the local dishes here , mr akonor said , referring to the food in manchester i could not enjoy this place if i could not get my local dishes he is among the hundreds of shoppers who cram the gold coast trading company on any given saturday , the busiest day at the market the store , which opened four years ago , sells up to 20 , 000 in food , toiletries and videotapes on saturdays alone we sank in a lot of capital , and we 've built a business , said mr ahenkora , the owner if we have to leave overnight , it s going to be a big loss officials at related companies said none of the stores would be forced to close before two years , and both mayor michael r bloomberg and the bronx borough president , adolfo carri n jr , have promised to help the vendors stay in business it is the city s responsibility to find a home for them that is better , and has friendly business terms , mr carri n said there are better candidates than this dark , dingy place where they are now , under a highway it was mayor john f hylan s idea to build the bronx terminal market in the early 1920 s he wanted to move vendors away from washington market , in the area that is now tribeca the first building , a vast , windowless brick structure erected in 1925 , is now abandoned very few vendors moved in , and the building came to be known as hylan s folly , said the bronx borough historian , lloyd ultan more fruit and vegetable vendors , many of them italian , moved to the market after mayor fiorello h la guardia expanded it along exterior street in 1935 when hunts point opened 30 years later , those vendors moved out and puerto rican vendors moved in the bronx terminal market carved a niche as a tropical fruits and vegetable market and catered largely to the growing hispanic bodega business it came to be known as the largest hispanic wholesale foods market in the country the market s vendors began selling african products about 10 years ago those sales now account for most of the business at latin 17 , one of several stores that once catered mostly to hispanics all of them eat something different , and they have different dialects , said the store s comanager , a 29yearold colombian immigrant who gave his name only as alex when he took the job three years ago , he could not fathom that people cooked with cows' skins or bull penises , which are stored in neat coils , covered in plastic , in a glassdoor refrigerator this is stuff you ca n't get at a pathmark , he said as women in africanprint dresses and head scarves waded through the store on a recent saturday all of this stuff , i had never heard of it i thought cow skin was for leather coats business may be humming for some vendors , but they do not deny that the market has been worn down by decades of neglect and political scandal the story of the market s former landlord is almost new york lore the arol development corporation acquired a 99year lease in 1972 , after the company s family patriarch , david buntzman , delivered 30 , 000 in cash to mayor john v lindsay s presidential campaign in wisconsin the buntzmans spent years in litigation with the city over the market s upkeep , and little upkeep resulted but a site for the vendors that is comparable in location and affordability will be hard to come by the hunts point produce market charges drivers at the entrance and requests identification , a policy that could deter immigrant shoppers bathgate industrial park in the bronx is another option being bandied about by city officials the vendors have met twice since the leasechange was announced and are searching for legal representation all our families live from here , said ari san emeterio , the general manager at new york produce this is all we know how to do
whatever else you might say about it and there is very little , at this point , that has not been said the passion of the christ , both as a movie and as a cultural phenomenon , has battered an awful lot of conventional wisdom and wishful thinking , in hollywood and elsewhere the notion that an unstintingly violent , purposefully controversial film to say nothing of one without a word of english in the script or a major star in the cast could become a blockbuster almost defies belief but the passion , helped by the synergy between mel gibson s shrewd mediabaiting and the media s eager swallowing of the bait , will in all likelihood , by the time you read this , have surpassed crouching tiger , hidden dragon as the highestgrossing foreignlanguage film ever released in the united states on its opening day ash wednesday it came close to earning back its reported 30 million production costs , and by the end of its first weekend had easily passed the 125 million mark those are superhero numbers i realize that this is a decidedly worldly , and perhaps irreverent , way of talking about a film that sells itself as an uncompromising expression of spiritual conviction but in the movie industry , boxoffice numbers are both gospel and grail so one predictable consequence of the financial success of the passion will be the appearance , in the production pipelines of some of the studios that passed up the chance to distribute mr gibson s picture , of more movies aimed at the audience he has attracted not all of these movies will be as bloody as the passion , and their directors will probably not be as bloodyminded as mr gibson but that boxoffice mammon is only the latest and most dramatic evidence of a market that hollywood is unlikely to ignore it has been evident for some time that there exist in this country a large number of people a demographic , in show business parlance who want their cultural consumption to be an expression of their religious devotion , and who will spend money on cd s , movies and dvd s that satisfy this desire the convergence of ancient religious traditions and postmodern pop culture challenges some of the most basic assumptions that many of us who write about popular culture bring to our work to say that the passion of the christ has whipped up a new skirmish in the culture wars is to state the obvious what makes the movie so fascinating , and so unnerving , is that it marches onto a battlefield much older , and much more brutal , than the continuing arguments about the moral direction of contemporary american society mr gibson , brushing aside any pretense of pluralism and interreligious politesse , seems intent on reopening a 2 , 000yearold theological dispute about a radical jewish preacher whose followers believed he was the son of god to the consternation of many , he appears to have succeeded i will stay out of that one for now for it seems to me equally important , even if it has been less widely noted , that mr gibson s film has also landed squarely on the centuriesold fault line one nearly as consequential as the fissure between judaism and christianity between the sacred and the secular let me be clear i'm not talking about the ideological differences between believers and nonbelievers , but rather about the ways that people who profess various faiths \( or none at all \) divide the world into different realms of meaning and experience to say that i , as a film critic , approach movies as secular phenomena is not to describe my religious beliefs , but rather the norms of my professional practice i love movies you might even say that , on some days , i worship them but like most of my colleagues i understand them to be the products of human intention , rather than , say , expressions of divine will what the passion has taught me is that not everyone agrees in the wake of my review , i received , not surprisingly , an unusually large number of phone calls and email messages from readers most of them took issue with my criticisms of what i took to be the film s excessive violence and its vengeful , angry spirit some were abusive \( and startlingly foulmouthed \) rants about the leftwing media \( and also in some cases , predictably enough , the jewish media \) , while others , repeating certain key words and phrases almost verbatim , looked like an orchestrated email campaign the dominant theme among the more temperate and thoughtful reactions was that i had failed to understand the story , and to grasp the truth and meaning of christ s suffering , depicted by mr gibson in such harrowing detail one reader called the passion a realistic portrayal of a true story , and along with many others took my objections to the portrayal as an attack on the truth of the story i take the passion of the christ to be an interpretation of scripture , while some of my readers take it as something very close to scripture itself mr gibson has , if anything , encouraged this conflation , playing the martyr on television and declaring that the holy spirit was working through him as he directed the movie jim caviezel , the actor who portrays christ , has described the cast and crew s ability to overcome various obstacles during the production as miracles of course , the existence of any movie , big or small , devout or profane , can be described that way , but only in a loose , secular sense the bible may or may not be the revealed word of god that is an argument best pursued in a venue other than this one but in the gospel according to the end credits , the passion of the christ is a film by mel gibson he will also , not incidentally , be the one who profits from it and , if the law of blockbusters still applies , the box office will drop off significantly on this and subsequent weekends the passion will subside , and then fox \( one of the studios that declined to release it theatrically \) will put it out on video my last word on the subject is a sentence that , in normal circumstances , should be anathema to a film critic but that here seems both urgent and true it s only a movie
brussels , oct 6 four decades after turkey came knocking on europe s door , the european union on wednesday made a crucial overture toward letting it in the executive body of the 25country bloc ruled that turkey , a poor , large and overwhelmingly muslim country of 71 million people , had made enough progress in reforming its political and economic systems to merit talks toward membership the decision needs the unanimous approval of the 25 heads of member states when they meet in december , although none is expected to challenge it that does not mean turkey s membership into the european union , the world s largest trading bloc , is inevitable talks could last up to 15 years a report on the decision recommending negotiations warned they would be halted if turkey faltered in its democratic changes even then , turkey may never become a full member turkey sufficiently fulfills the political criteria for talks to start , the report said but it added , this is an openended process whose outcome cannot be guaranteed beforehand romano prodi , the departing president of the european union s executive arm , called the decision a qualified yes still , the decision was lauded in turkey as a breakthrough in redrawing the map of europe and narrowing the divide between the largely christian european union and the islamic world in ankara , turkey s foreign minister , abdullah gul , called it a historic decision for turkey and for europe mehmet dulger , head of the parliamentary foreign affairs commission , said , justice has been done we hope the rest will come speaking in strasbourg , france , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan praised the decision as balanced but demanded that the european union apply the same criteria and methods to turkey s membership application it has to others among turkey s supporters , there is a strong conviction that the mere hope of eventual membership in the european union , which would grant turkey enormous economic benefits , has been the driving force in pushing the country to major political reforms in the two years since mr erdogan came to power it would be totally wrong to say , 'turkey , you are not good enough and you have to wait , ' said g nter verheugen , the european union s commissioner for membership , at a news conference here saying no to turkey , he added , would risk that its democratization would come to an end and would finally fail with the exception of the war in iraq , turkey s status is the preeminent foreign policy issue seizing europe polls throughout europe are running against turkey s membership , and several countries , most notably france , have declared that such a momentous decision can only be decided by popular referendum such a move could doom turkey s application to calm fears that turkey s membership will bring waves of unskilled , uneducated , unemployed turks westward , the decision called for the european union to impose strict , permanent limits on turkish migration germany has a large turkish population that has been growing in recent decades to counter arguments that turkey will impoverish the european union , the decision urged special safeguards before the country benefits fully from the generous farm subsidies and regional aid that membership would bestow the rawness of the discussion was underscored in a debate on the report in the european parliament in brussels on wednesday the future of the european union as a peaceful community is at stake , said hansgert p ttering , a conservative german affiliated with the european people s party , who opposes turkish membership he criticized turkey for continued human rights abuses and said that the assertion in the report that systematic torture in turkey had ended was the biggest nonsense we heard in 2004 a number of deputies criticized those who argue that a muslim country like turkey has no place in the european union where in that argument are the 20 million muslims who are already europeans \? asked graham watson , a liberal democrat from britain francis wurtz , a frenchman and leftist deputy , put it more starkly europe , he said , is no longer a europe of white christians he called those who would exclude turkey on the basis of religion irresponsible and loathsome daniel cohnbendit , a onetime student radical who represents germany s green party , argued that turkey should join the european union because , it could increase the strategic importance in an increasingly dangerous world if turkey becomes a member , the border of the european union would extend to iran , iraq and syria turkey itself shares some responsibility in its failure to achieve membership four decades ago turkey signed an association agreement with the precursor to today s european union a decade later , turkey and greece were poised to begin membership talks simultaneously greece moved forward aggressively and became a member but turkey halted its appeal at the time , the country had a rigidly protectionist economic system and was unwilling to embrace a common market system that could hurt domestic industries in addition , some politicians considered the european union a christian club that a country of muslims should not join it was a monumental decision that turkish leaders came to rue turkey applied for full membership in 1987 but then the soviet union fell , and turkey suddenly found itself at the end of a long line of new candidates from the former soviet bloc underscoring that twist , the executive body confirmed wednesday that romania and bulgaria are on track to join in 2007 wednesday s report notes the progress turkey has made in reforming its institutions and curbing undemocratic practices but it also lays bare the problems that remain despite the adoption of new civil and penal codes , it describes turkey s implementation of political reforms as uneven it also notes that despite improvements in turkey s human rights record , there were hundreds of complaints of human rights violations in the first half of 2004 although torture is no longer systematic , the report says , numerous cases of ill treatment including torture still continue to occur the government has curbed the power of the military , but the armed forces in turkey continue to exercise influence through a series of informal mechanisms , the report says corruption is described as a serious problem in almost all areas of the economy and public affairs the report also criticizes turkey for continuing to arbitrarily punish journalists , writers and publishers and restrict freedom of expression for nonmuslim religious communities for example , the training of nonmuslim clergy is still banned the situation of women is described as unsatisfactory ' discrimination and violence against women , including honor killings of women who are judged to have shamed the family is called a major problem

i finally won them over when i told them my son had a punching bag in the basement , said ms nicholas , 59 , a member of financo global consulting , a team of 15 former retail executives led by marvin traub , 77 , the former president and chairman of bloomingdale s the consulting team operates as a division of financo , an investment banking firm in manhattan that specializes in retailing many of the team s members have spent years in some cases , decades at the top of the retailing industry rather than hang up their spurs , they are redeploying their skills for a changing mix of retail clients the consultants make their own rules of engagement , helping businesses that aim to grow , like the maker of boxing gloves that wants to become as big as nike the consultants figure out new marketing strategies and licensing ideas and help in product development they may even be asked how to fatten up a company for market one client , innovative marble and tile , a relatively young brooklyn company that distributes marble and granite , was trying to raise 5 million and to come up with a new way to market its wares the solution includes a slick new display , with graphics and samples of each colored stone , as well a 6 million equity investment by venture capitalists , announced last month most of our companies are midsize companies who are anxious to expand , mr traub said some are easier than others to figure out how to do that last week , his consultants were working with 15 clients ten others are close to signing contracts , and 10 more are having discussions with the group , he said carl levine , 70 , who once ran the home department at bloomingdale s , is working with kelley hoppen , an interior designer based in london who is known for her mix of dark woods and light tweeds and wants to plan a grand entrance into the united states market dick hauser , 69 , a former chairman of neiman marcus , is busy working to expand so smart , which makes interactive toys for babies at least 6 months old along with mr traub , he has been called in to help a moscow department store grow there s 70 years of pentup demand over there , he said taken together , the financo consultants have hundreds of years of retail and apparel manufacturing experience , said gilbert w harrison , the chairman of financo there are things they know and have done that many of us will never know , he said the consultants have varying work patterns some treat their roles as fulltime jobs others work fewer hours , and some are known chiefly for their connections but none are just matchmakers grabbing a referral fee and walking away that would be a waste of their experience , would n't it \? mr harrison asked if they 're referring the business to us , they undoubtedly know a lot about it they sign on as consultants financo has been retained by wilson s leather , which announced in late january that it would close 100 stores , about 20 percent of its total , and eliminate more than 1 , 000 jobs the announcement came after the company tried to secure waivers from its lenders because it could not make its payments wilson s executives retained financo to help restructure the debt by midapril but they also realized that strategic help was needed for the company s retail reinvention , so wilson s has hired one of the company s retail consultants wilson s is a good example of a financo global client it came to the company looking for help with its financial underpinnings and came away with retail strategies , too mr traub started his own consulting company in 1991 after leaving bloomingdale s , where he was known for his fashion and marketing magic he joined financo in 1996 as firm s senior retail adviser the consulting operation then evolved financo global consulting officially opened a year ago not all the consultants are former retailers maggie gilliam was a retail stock analyst at credit suisse first boston , but after more than 30 years on wall street started her own retail consulting company , which , among other things , advises shopping center developers about retail trends like mr levine , she works with financo global on a casebycase basis and keeps her own business independent ann iverson was the former chief executive of laura ashley when mr harrison interviewed her for a job running one of the companies in financo s banking portfolio he ended up asking her to join the team ms nicholas knew mr traub from her days at anne klein , he said when she read about the new firm last year , he said , she called us and we met with her for ms nicholas , who has two children , 12 and 16 , the current job is ideal to some extent , she can choose her hours but , she said , she told financo that she was only interested in 'outside the box' projects i'm not going to be working on signing a license for a luxury handbag line , she added she is now working only with grant boxing , and it is almost a fulltime job a few weeks ago , she produced a hardpunching , fastmoving , fiveminute promotional video featuring clips of laila ali , mohammad ali s daughter , who is also a boxer ms nicholas met last week with a large manufacturer of athletic clothes to license the grant name , hoping to put the brand on the backs of young shoppers who now wear urban brands like phat farm and rocawear mr traub , however , is involved in more than a few of financo global s projects reached a few weeks ago , he said he was flying to moscow to consult with the department store he is advising there besides moscow , this year i 'll be doing business in dubai , london , paris , shanghai and beijing among others , he said that s not bad for a guy who 'retired' more than a decade ago
defense minister sergei b ivanov of russia on saturday criticized nato s expansion into the three baltic states , and said citizens of the western alliance s original member countries should be worried , too , that their tax dollars were being wasted during a weekend visit by defense secretary donald h rumsfeld , mr ivanov said he remained reserved and negative about the entry into nato in march of latvia , lithuania and estonia , three former soviet republics at a meeting of nato defense ministers in colorado springs last october , mr ivanov complained that , if the alliance expanded into the baltics , it would be able to station combat jets a threeminute flight away from st petersburg on saturday , as the host for mr rumsfeld in that city after the baltic states had entered nato , mr ivanov said the alliance risked wasting money and weakening itself by welcoming small states that could not contribute to the collective defense of the members those baltic countries are consumers of security , not producers , he said of course , it is none of our business to be theorizing about how effectively the nato countries' tax money is being spent mr ivanov said that basing a few nato fighters in the baltics would not help stop terrorism we cannot understand how these four planes can intercept al qaeda , the taliban or anything else , he said the only thing they can intercept is a mythical soviet threat in defense of the atlantic alliance , mr rumsfeld said russia s relationship with nato was growing and has been constructive he said russia should understand that nato , likewise , was no threat to russian security of moscow s concerns over the baltic states' entry into the alliance , he said , this is a relatively new issue mr rumsfeld agreed with mr ivanov in noting concerns that russia did not have agreements with latvia , lithuania or estonia , as it did with many other neighbors , aimed at avoiding military clashes mr ivanov broadened his criticism of the baltic states to include their support of the nazis in world war ii russia , he said , was concerned that the baltic states do have inconsistencies with respect to their human rights record , citing monuments he said had been erected in the glorification of baltic support of the nazi war effort rather than have the standard day of meetings in the capital , mr rumsfeld accepted mr ivanov s invitation to spend the weekend in st petersburg , holding talks and touring palaces and museums in a city that peter the great built as russia s window on the west
eventually , after his brain thawed a bit , philippe joncas was able to come up with something positive to say about standing out on fifth avenue in brooklyn all day yesterday , trying to sell christmas trees the trees are easier to cut when it s this cold , he said the sap is frozen , so it does n't stick to the saw blade on the other hand , sawing the bottoms off the trees by hand was just about the only way mr joncas had to keep warm , so a few seconds' labor saved simply meant a few more shivers in any case , with the wind howling and the temperature stuck in the teens , business , on this most christmaslooking day of the season , was as slow as , well , balsam fir sap in december or perhaps as slow as the circulation in mr joncas s nose , which he said was already frostbitten into several painfullooking shades of brown , white and red it does n't hurt too much right now , he said , making another attempt to affect the good cheer for which he and his fellow canadians are famous it s pretty numb as anyone who had the misfortune to poke a nose outside yesterday quickly learned , autumn \( it does not officially end until 7 42 this morning \) went out like a cranky polar bear six inches of snow fell on the east end of long island overnight , and while most of the region , including new york city , received just a dusting , it was wickedly cold 2 degrees above zero in newton , nj , 8 degrees in trenton \( a record for the day \) , and 11 degrees in central park across the region , wind chills stayed well below zero for most of the day in mr joncas s hometown , montreal , the mercury stood at 14 below zero , but somehow that did not console him in montreal , he said , i do n't stand outside for 14 hours a day the cold air blew in from northwestern canada , according to the national weather service it will move out quickly , with temperatures rising above freezing today and reaching the 50 s by thursday , but more cold will follow close behind there s some indication there could be a snowfall event on christmas day on the eastern seaboard , said david wally , a meteorologist in the weather service s brookhaven office on long island it s just a question of how close to the coast it is yesterday s snow was heaviest in connecticut , where more than 100 school districts took the day off , and on long island , according to the associated press in new jersey , the precipitation began sunday night as rain , but quickly froze on the roads and was blamed for at least three fatal accidents , the ap reported in new york city , the temperature did not get near the record low for dec 20 of minus 4 degrees , set in 1942 , according to steve fybish , an amateur weather historian it was , however , the coldest autumn day since 1988 , mr fybish said that s kind of sexy , he added in fact , mr fybish continued , yesterday s daytime high of 19 degrees in central park was identical to the low temperature for the entire winter of 20012 none of which had to be pointed out to mr joncas , 28 , who has been stationed in front of a supermarket parking lot on fifth avenue in park slope since thanksgiving at 11 am , a customer materialized he gave his name as mo , and explained that an acquaintance had mentioned in passing the day before that she had not had a christmas tree for five years mo contacted a relative of the woman s and arranged to be let into her house so that the woman could come home to a decorated tree it s my little gift , he said mr joncas helped mo pick out a tree it was tough , because the tree s branches were frozen tight , hugging the trunk like shivering soldiers at attention when you bring it inside , the needles will let down a little , mr joncas promised as the afternoon sun disappeared behind the buildings and mr joncas dug in for the last few hours of his shift , his business partner , nancy daigneault , 33 , emerged from the van , where she had spent the day trying unsuccessfully to sleep ms daigneault s shift runs from 6 pm to 6 am for most of it , the supermarket is closed , so she cannot duck inside to warm up , as mr joncas occasionally does there are no customers to speak of , and while ms daigneault usually stays warm by unloading the next day s supply of trees , there will be no more deliveries this year i think tonight will be hard , she said ms daigneault , who had piled a sweater and three coats over her pajamas , hopped on her bike and headed off for the ywca to take a shower i'm going to buy myself something to make me feel better , she said maybe a pair of shoes

an expert on plague who caused a bioterrorism scare in january 2003 when he reported plague bacteria missing from his laboratory at texas tech university was sentenced yesterday to two years in prison even though a jury had cleared him of the most serious charges the expert , dr thomas c butler , was also fined 15 , 000 and is to pay 38 , 675 in restitution to texas tech , in lubbock he remains free on bond until april 14 and has 10 days to decide whether to appeal his convictions in december , a jury found dr butler , 62 , guilty of 47 of the 69 charges that emerged from a federal investigation of him after the scare none of the 47 convictions were directly related to the original incident fortyfour involved contract disputes with texas tech dr butler was found guilty of defrauding the university by diverting payments from drug companies for clinical trials directly to his bank account he was also found guilty of three counts related to a shipment of plague samples to his research collaborators in tanzania without the proper permit he had labeled the package merely laboratory materials the jurors acquitted him of charges of lying to federal bureau of investigation agents and university officials about the missing vials , smuggling plague samples into the united states from tanzania and illegally taking them to government laboratories in colorado and maryland after dr butler first reported 30 vials of bacteria missing , the fbi sent 60 agents to search texas tech and surrounding lubbock after hours of questioning , he signed a handwritten affidavit saying he had accidentally destroyed the vials and then declared them missing he was then arrested dr butler testified at his trial that he did not lie to the agents and that while he might have destroyed the samples , he did not remember doing so the case drew the attention of many prominent scientists , including several nobel prize winners , who said that the prosecution would cause scientists to avoid research related to bioterrorism scientists may also be leery of helping fbi agents in an investigation out of fear that they might end up targets like dr butler , they said a presentencing report by probation officers had recommended a sentence of 78 to 97 months , and prosecutors asked for a longer prison sentence , said floyd d holder jr , one of dr butler s lawyers instead , judge sam r cummings of federal district court imposed a sentence that was lower than the standard set by federal guidelines , citing testimony that the bacteria shipment was done for humanitarian reasons and that the department of commerce would have approved a permit had dr butler applied judge cummings also questioned whether texas tech deserved any restitution for the shadow contract convictions
the german beer gardens and singing clubs have long been silent the breweries , from otto huber and kings to rheingold and schaefer , closed down decades ago and the yeastysweet smell of flowing lager and ale saturating brewer s row has been replaced almost entirely with the many odors of contemporary urban industrial life but even though brooklyn is no longer the brewing kingdom it once was , the culture of beer thrives as if it were still the signature beverage in the bars of park slope and south brooklyn , at the festivals and convention stops , in two regional breweries currently operating in the borough take tom tuminello , a brooklyn resident who was enjoying a penn hefeweizen on a rainsoaked wednesday evening at the brazen head , a beer bar on atlantic avenue that is his most regular regular place in downtown brooklyn i can honestly say the only beer i ever tasted that i did not like was the smoked beer , said mr tuminello , who works for a moving and storage company and favors wheat and dark beers for some reason it just turned me off , he said which i find kind of funny , because when you make a regular chocolate stout , if you do n't add the real chocolate , what they do is they roast the barley or the malt so it tastes like chocolate , you know what i'm saying \? so i mean with the smoked beer , i do n't know what they do to it , he added , laughing , but it s horrible it is that sort of fascination with beer that the brooklyn historical society is hoping to , ahem , tap with a new exhibit , 100 bottles of beer on the wall , that chronicles the borough s rich brewing history the exhibit , which opened friday and runs through oct 15 , includes artifacts , photographs , vintage television commercials , information for home brewers and a film about the brewing process the society will also operate a beer garden friday nights through the summer , with a selection of live music and beer , in its lobby essentially , this is about how the confluence of location and immigration and resources came together to produce one of the most important industries in brooklyn , and brooklyn embraced it , said the society s president , jessie mcclintock kelly the first fulltime commercial brewer in brooklyn was an englishman who set up shop on front street around 1822 , according to the exhibit the industry took off with the huge influx of german immigrants fleeing the upheavals that engulfed much of europe in 1848 between 1850 and 1880 , there were 11 breweries owned at various times by at least 33 companies in a 12block area straddling bushwick and williamsburg , said ann meyerson , the curator of exhibitions at the society they did n't all stay in business for very long , she said in 1890 , more beer was produced in brooklyn than in milwaukee , detroit and the district of columbia combined , said wendy aibelweiss , the society s project developer but the brewers made more than just barrels of foaming libation they created beer gardens , poetry and singing clubs and entire communities , too beer production in brooklyn peaked in the 1940 s and 50 s , according to the exhibit , eventually declining as the breweries found it impossible to compete with national brands like budweiser , schlitz , pabst and miller , which could be produced in greater volumes less expensively but if beer is no longer made in brooklyn to the extent it once was , it has certainly lost none of its appeal in the quaffing department , thanks in part to a proliferation of regional and microbreweries like the brooklyn brewery , said the president of the brooklyn chamber of commerce , kenneth adams there may not be 29 beers brewed in brooklyn , but brooklynites are returning to a greater diversity of beers and a lot of specialty beers like we once had , he said nationwide , there are now more than 300 regional and micro brewers and 1 , 300 brewery restaurants in operation , a greater number than in germany , according to stephen k hindy , president of the brooklyn brewery , one of the underwriters of the exhibit new york , a competitive market , is also a thirsty one , particularly for specialty beers just look at all the saloons in manhattan or in brooklyn or in queens , mr hindy said it s a big part of life here what might once have been considered specialty beers , like brooklyn or sierra nevada , are now almost runofthemill tom daly , a coowner of cobble heights distributors on pacific street , said that although he no longer saw the same excitement about microbreweries , highquality beers were still in demand a partner at the brazen head , lou sones , put it this way sam adams , which started the trend almost people do n't consider them microbrew anymore but while new yorkers have developed a fondness for quality beer , said mr sones , who was a bartender in tribeca for 11 years , there has also been a resurgence of interest in oldfashioned beers that have like a cult following , like pabst gaid massed , who tends bar down the street from the brazen head , at pete s waterfront ale house , said that when he started out as a bartender in 1970 , at a neighborhood place called the court terrace lounge , only a few beers were offered and everyone drank budweiser , rheingold or miller at that time , a beer was 50 cents for a bottle , he said a shot was about a buck and half i used to get nickel and dime tips now i get 5 s and 10 s mr massed said that he now drinks hard cider because it does not give him a morning headache , like beer once did at a nearby table , another brazen head patron , rachel jones , a legal aid lawyer , and her colleague laura gitelson identified magic hat 9 , from south burlington , vt , as one of their favorite beers , though ms gitelson was having an amstel light and ms jones was sipping red wine i drink beer all the time , said ms jones , adding that she had consumed so much beer on a recent night that she was on that particular wagon for the moment i'm wearing the patch and i'm drinking wine , she laughed i'm on a health kick

one of the university s greatest players took shots at the program the athletic director declined to offer a vote of confidence to the coach the team needed overtime to beat division iaa furman so what s next at pittsburgh \? well , quite possibly a slot in the bowl championship series the panthers \( 52 , 31 big east \) travel to syracuse this weekend and then play host to west virginia on nov 25 in their remaining conference games if they win both , they 're in a bcs bowl as the big east s representative i'm tremendously proud of our players , coach walt harris said in a telephone interview friday it would have been real easy to fold up our tents after the panthers lost to connecticut , 2917 , on sept 30 , harris bore the brunt of some severe criticism part of it was residual after an underachieving 85 season last year , when the panthers had the allamerican wide receiver larry fitzgerald and the allbig east quarterback rod rutherford much of the criticism this season started with harris s decision in the connecticut game to set up a field goal instead of throwing into the end zone late in the first half on a thirdandgoal from the 12 soon the program was being ridiculed in a local newspaper by tony dorsett , the heisman trophy winner who led the university to a national championship in 1976 when harris s agent called for the university to extend the coach s contract , athletic director jeff long took no decisive action harris has two years remaining on his contract , which pays him about 600 , 000 a year i really do n't want to talk about all that stuff , harris said i made a commitment to myself and the team that i was n't going to get involved in all that stuff it does n't really matter some growing pains appeared inevitable pitt lost fitzgerald , rutherford and five other offensive starters still , the panthers had a chance to tie nebraska on the game s final play , ground out overtime victories against furman and boston college , and scored 21 fourthquarter points to beat temple but winning their final two big east games is by no means a given , and the panthers play at notre dame on nov 13 harris is happy that his team has had a week off to prepare for the game at syracuse on saturday also , as the weeks go by , and west virginia performs the way it did during a 3530 victory at rutgers on saturday , the luster peels away from the mountaineers also , harris knows that his young team is getting better you ca n't say we 're as young of a football team as we were seven games ago , harris said our mistakes are fewer our kids have fought through the negative things surrounding us we 're excited to be at this point , but it does n't mean we 've arrived we 've got a lot of maturing to do the bcs knowing the score the seemingly constant changes in the bowl championship series formula have created different philosophies on how to get to the top of the polls oklahoma coach bob stoops had his team score a touchdown against kansas two weeks ago with 35 seconds left to boost the final score to 4110 utah , on the other hand , has pulled its star quarterback , alex smith , in every game because of lopsided scores stoops said he probably should have gone in from the 1 instead of having his quarterback take a knee against texas tech in the waning seconds of a 2813 victory for stoops , these calls come down to impressing the news media members and coaches who vote in the polls , which comprise twothirds of the bcs formula not everyone out there voting sees everything and has 18 tv s watching all the games , stoops said yesterday in a teleconference all they can do is read box scores or look at scores of the game that being the case , it forces you in a case you may have taken a knee before , you 're forced to try to score utah coach urban meyer said he was still uncertain how the bcs formula worked someone tells me our rank each week , meyer said in a telephone interview yesterday , and then i go worry about our punt protection meyer said that none of his starters played in the fourth quarter of a 4616 victory over north carolina few even played in the third quarter he said he was tempted to keep them in , but he needed to keep his team healthy he said he would never leave his players in longer to pad a score if you 've got a respected coach like bob stoops saying that , the system is a failure , meyer said you 've got to blow it up and start over that s not what college football is stoops said that he would never run reverses or throw the ball while ahead by a big margin , but he saw no harm in running his normal offense i'm responsible for this program , stoops said i'm not sure if it helps us or not in the bcs picture , but you do your best to improve your position top florida teams ca n't bask there are plenty of factors to explain why florida s three division ia superpowers lost on the same day for the first time since 1978 but it is difficult to tie these results together georgia beat florida , 3124 , on a neutral field miami lost at north carolina , 3128 and florida state lost at maryland , 2017 the university of florida is an emotional mess after ron zook s firing florida state cannot find a consistent quarterback miami has been hit by injuries and faces the reality of being in the atlantic coast conference , which means that teams like rutgers are replaced on the schedule with teams like north carolina but zook said he could not find a unifying reason for why all three teams lost i think it s a coincidence in the way that it happened , zook said in a conference call yesterday if there is a unifying theme , it could be this the teams are flawed miami s rush defense is no 66 nationally florida state is no 65 in passing offense , and

could he be the hideous conclusion is clearly telegraphed as the plot skids its way into the most insulting resolution imaginable look we all have our own taste in beach trash one summer weekend , i sat down and read seven of the janet evanovich newjerseygirlbountyhuntermysteries , and i loved every page so maybe bergdorf blondes is exactly what you need this year at georgica beach we 're all god s flawed creatures and flaws should be celebrated at the shredded edges of this story lurks a fantastic , underutilized antiheroine julie bergdorf , heiress and megabitch julie could have been another bridget gregory , the genius evil manwrecker played by linda fiorentino in the last seduction , the most perfect chickempowerment flick ever made with julie as its star , bergdorf blondes could have been a gorgeous , cruel mashup of na vebrilliant beauties tangling over men and social power at the expense of their humanity julie is great here s the girls at muffy s big ! charity ! benefit ! then the men carried on ignoring everyone but themselves and their jets and so julie , who is very talented in the redirecting attention to herself department said , 'i 've got a hundred million dollars' the ph s went quiet so julie added , 'all to myself , ' and suddenly they all started acting very interested in julie s mind , whereupon she sweetly announced , 'excuse me , i have to go kill myself in the ladies room' fun ! but julie is just decoration in bergdorf blondes , sykes rounds up all the right satiric details , then never quite turns them into great farce or parody because the fascist force of the plotting insists that her narrator be strangely imbecilic after all , if she were allowed much intelligence , she would too soon figure out her happy ending , and there would n't be much of a book to sell , right \? worse , sykes , a vogue editor and a socialite herself , refuses to do more than gently critique her world sykes is n't bitter or disenfranchised or drunk enough to get all truman capote on her own personal lee radziwills so her novel turns into a shallow romantic comedy in the early meg ryan vein and even meg ryan is over that flapdoodle by now sykes s heroine has none of the severe stakes for which lily bart was once forced to play we could even unfavorably compare bergdorf blondes to tama janowitz s underrated novel , a certain age at the end of which the haughty manhattan girl ends up smoking crack or to the slutty oeuvre of candace bushnell , back when she still cared to actually write then again , there is sometimes in sykes s writing a giddiness reminiscent of the lovely comic surrealist amanda filipacchi and when she wants to , sykes can really nail it chlo jeans and alphabeta peels do n't make the nasty things go away you have to live with the nasty things forever , like liza minnelli does her trashy concision can ring true teterboro ! all new york girls know that that ugly word means something very pretty teterboro means 'i have a plane' but too often the narrator will make you want to slice her pretty face sometimes the things julie says make me feel like dating in new york is worse than it is on sex and the city' and i always used to think sex and the city' is as terrifying as dating can possibly get in fact , bergdorf blondes makes sex and the city resemble a carefully constructed anarchofeminist critique of capitalist society sykes can stay on tone with the rabidity of ari fleischer she never flags she can catalog everything that s overpriced and wrong with the world , but she does n't convey a real sense that these things are wrong in fact , a suspicious brand of venality is made clear from the very beginning , as the heroine introduces herself the reason i can just about afford the 325 jeans is because the aforementioned career consists of writing articles for a fashion magazine , which say that spending 325 on a pair of jeans will make you deliriously happy if you have any sense of justice at all , the publication of this book demands that you rouse yourself from the couch this very second and set out to loot and burn manhattan meet us at da silvano and bring weapons

at an october 2002 gala to introduce microsoft s msn 8 internet service , bill gates showed a video of himself wearing a butterfly costume and handing out software for the service his point was that after seven years of floundering in the internet access market , microsoft would do whatever it took to beat its longtime rival america online that included pouring 500 million into msn to match aol s most popular features and another 300 million into marketing , featuring msn s butterfly mascot and a concert highlighted by rocker lenny kravitz singing fly away but all that flew away was the better part of a billion dollars microsoft s share of the internet access market has declined steadily since in the years since the start of what was first called the microsoft network , mr gates has tried dozens of different business models , from internet access to web sites to monthly software subscriptions they all had one thing in common they lost money over the last year , however , msn has finally started to see some profits the unit began making money last fall and is expected to post an operating profit of about 200 million for the fiscal year that ended june 30 , compared with a loss of about 531 million last year the reason has little to do with any of microsoft s more ambitious internet strategies instead , it was one of the businesses that it had put on the back burner internet advertising that really started to take off even without a lot of new investment , msn s web site has long been the third most popular destination on the internet , bringing together its hotmail email service , the msnbc news operation and a variety of other channels recently , it has worked to repair a frayed relationship with madison avenue , putting the company in a good position to gain as the ad market rebounded over the last year , msn has ranked second in online advertising revenue , behind yahoo and ahead of the longtime leader aol , a unit of time warner mary meeker , the morgan stanley internet analyst , said that msn s revival was an indicator of the company s trademark doggedness they began their attack on aol 10 years ago , she said since then they have lost billions , and now they are making money it gives me a real sense of just how patient they are now basking in its newfound profitability , msn is again on the offensive , competing with yahoo , the internet portal , even more than with aol it has a threeprong strategy continue to cash in on the advertising market , sell software services for people who have broadband internet access from cable or phone companies , and build a better web search engine msn , which uses yahoo s search technology , is trying to develop search technology to take on google it hopes to introduce that technology by the end of the year as investors consider google s public stock offering , some worry that microsoft will be able to squeeze out the plucky search company just as it pushed aside netscape in the internet browser market after all , it plans to include links to its new search service on the windows desktop and in many other products and services yet that same considerable windows advantage led many observers to predict that microsoft would cause more trouble than it actually did for aol and yahoo it turned out that most internet users were willing to skip past the default services offered by windows in favor of brands they preferred there was a concern that microsoft would always win because they owned the desktop , said david card , the research director of jupiter research if the desktop is so important , then microsoft should have beaten aol , but they did n't one drag on msn over the years , said several people who worked there , is that microsoft has been conflicted about whether to treat the internet as a media business or a form of software it is not a simple eitheror proposition because so much of the internet is a hybrid free software paid for by advertising one thing that amazed me is that the organization changed annually , said merrill brown , the former editor in chief of msnbc they seize upon a good idea , and throw lots of resources at it until it s time to move to the next idea or acquisition microsoft certainly has had some successes on the internet , including hotmail , msnbc \( a joint venture with general electric \) , the slate opinion journal and expedia , the online travel agency it sold to interactivecorp but there have been at least as many failures , ranging from mungo park , an adventure travel site , to the carpoint automobile buying service , to the controversial hailstorm system for connecting information from different web sites but microsoft s biggest online failure has been its internet access business it lost several billion dollars over the years by paying people 400 rebates to sign threeyear contracts for msn dialup accounts , according to internet industry executives those customers have quit the service in droves as their commitments expire by contrast , aol s internet access business has been hugely profitable , even amid turmoil from its merger with time warner and the decline in the dialup , or narrowband , market we said that narrowband is like the buggy whip business , said david cole , the microsoft senior vice president in charge of msn we could try to be the best buggy whip maker , but that s not very aspirational it s hard to get people rallied around that the broadband market , however , has proved exasperating for dialup providers like msn , aol and earthlink , all of which wanted to buy highspeed connections wholesale and market them to consumers after accounting for the customer acquisition costs , the costs paid to telephone companies and the support costs , mr cole said , there is nothing left over microsoft has invested 6 billion in comcast , the nation s largest cable company , but that has not led to an arrangement to distribute msn services to comcast customers comcast , in fact , edged out microsoft this year to become the nation s secondlargest internet provider , with 10 percent of the internet access market , according to solomon research microsoft s share of that market has fallen from a peak of 13 percent in 2002 to 8 percent today \( aol s share fell to 24 percent from 29 percent in the last two years \) microsoft claims a total of eight million subscribers to its various msn services , of which about five million are internet access customers , according to comscore media metrix , an internet ratings company now , the company hopes to sell extra services to people who buy broadband service from their local telephone or cable companies for 595 a month , it offers msn plus , which mainly expands email services msn premium , for 995 a month , adds firewall and virus software , and access to some proprietary content , most notably webcasts of major league baseball games microsoft paid a reported 40 million over two years for the baseball rights so far , that market has not taken off microsoft will not say how many broadband addon subscriptions it has sold , admitting only that the vast bulk of its users come from deals it has struck with verizon and qwest to include msn software as part of those company s basic broadband services microsoft is also developing more services , including some for small businesses , and a new music download offering meant to compete with apple s itunes but it is msn s advertising business that is really starting to pay off the company had a reputation on madison avenue of being unresponsive and forcing advertisers to use its own proprietary formats but in late 2001 , it hired an experienced magazine executive , joanne bradford , to run its advertising sales staff and to reach out to agencies it also moved to embrace the industry s standard ad formats as marketers discovered ways to use more interactive ads , msn was one of the few sites that could deliver a mass audience still , msn s audience appears to be more transient than those of its rivals according to comscore media metrix , 111 million people visited some part of msn at least once in may that is just slightly behind yahoo , which had 113 million visitors and time warner \( including america online \) , which had 112 million but msn s visitors spent 147 minutes , on average , looking at msn pages in the month , far less than the 260 minutes that users spent on yahoo or the 340 minutes they devoted to time warner sites yusuf mehdi , a vice president for msn , concedes that the company needs to find a way to engage its audience more we want to have the sort of evangelical feedback that people have for the ipod or the tivo , mr mehdi said i want people to say , 'i love msn msn hopes one way to achieve that is to customize its service to the interests of each user for example , it has introduced trial versions of an automated news service that displays headlines for articles based on the topics that users have shown interest in another part of microsoft s internet strategy is to combine web searches with an improved application that lets users find documents and email messages on personal computers the enhanced search function will be a feature of the next major version of windows , scheduled for 2006 , but mr mehdi said that msn would make a desktop computer search feature available much sooner , probably as part of the free downloadable toolbar that it introduced earlier this year and last week microsoft bought lookout , a tiny software company , to help with its desktop search effort but even with this new focus on searches , danny sullivan , the editor of search engine watch , said that microsoft will have a tough time catching up with google to shift market share , google has to get bad and they have to get good , he said people will not go to microsoft , even if microsoft is better than google if google is good enough mr mehdi said that microsoft was betting that none of today s search engines are quite good enough to hold users and that microsoft s strengths will give it a significant advantage as the internet evolves search is not done until you can give users the answer they want instead of a list of 1 , 000 web sites , mr mehdi said that s a big , tough software problem and we said , thank goodness we 're software guys

beasts of eden walking whales , dawn horses , and other enigmas of mammal evolution by david rains wallace illustrated 340 pp university of california press 2495 two hundred million years ago , a whiskered , mousesized creature snuffled below the laurel trees on a wet , warm night in what is now wyoming it sported a strong jaw and other head parts that enabled it to chew , smell , hear and touch better than any reptile but it and its primitive mammal relatives would tremble beneath the feet of the dinosaurs until an asteroid slammed into the earth some 65 million years ago , plunging the land into months of icy darkness and killing off these colossal beasts only then would the mammals inherit the earth david rains wallace , a science writer with 15 books to his credit , offers no original theories on mammalian evolution in beasts of eden instead , he presents a thoroughly researched , richly detailed and lively book on the bone hunters who traversed the badlands of the world searching for the fossils of mammals and on the vituperative intellectual battles that some of these paleontologists waged with one another and as these stories unfold , one becomes familiar with the primary ideas and events in the rise of modern evolutionary thinking wallace begins his stories of the men who dug up the mammal fossils in an unlikely place beneath paris here lie some 200 miles of caverns , quarries that roman miners dug centuries ago to collect gypsum , a sturdy snowwhite building material with time these tunnels became a vast cemetery in fact , montmartre got its name martyr hill because romans tossed the beheaded corpses of christian missionaries into these grottoes in 1795 a young french anatomist , georges cuvier , working at the mus e d'histoire naturelle , came to study some of these bones not those of the six million people deposited here in the late 18th century , when parisian cemeteries became too crowded not the bones of the early christian martyrs but the bones of bears , rhinos , deer and other mammals living 50 million years ago as balzac wrote of cuvier he digs and suddenly marble turns into animals , dead things live anew , and lost worlds are unfolded before us ! working at one or another of his 11 desks , cuvier came to see that the fossil elephants exhumed from these caverns were different from their modern counterparts and he speculated that some sort of catastrophe must have annihilated the ancient pachyderms cuvier saw a brilliant mammalian world that had risen , edenlike , from the ocean , but then had sunk again cuvier s theory , catastrophism , was the first modern speculation on the development of life on earth it was not popular jeanbaptiste lamarck , cuvier s senior colleague at the museum , disagreed as wallace puts it , if lower animals such as reptiles had not given birth to mammals , how had mammals appeared \? instead , lamarck maintained that species had vanished by transmuting into new species although lamarck is better remembered for his false idea that this transmutation process occurred through the inheritance of acquired characteristics , his fundamental concept of transmutation was a prescient preview of how evolution works as lamarck had rejected cuvier s theory of catastrophism , the english scientist richard owen would reject lamarck s theory of transmutation a prolific cataloger of fossil mammals , owen coined the term dinosaur , greek for terrible lizards he embraced none of the current theories for the evolution of mammals when darwin presented his magnum opus , on the origin of species , in 1859 , owen wrote a scathing review of it new ideas are not accepted peacefully as wallace proceeds , more naturalists exchange intellectual shots darwin s critics believed , for example , that species inevitably progress toward more and more complex forms , a fashionable yet fallacious idea of the mid19th century darwin s concept of natural selection by survival of the fittest suggested an inherently random or undirected process , however , a mechanism unlikely to produce increasingly elaborate beings so his opponents jeered his great idea , calling it the law of higgledypiggledy darwin s theory now forms the basis of all modern evolutionary thinking , of course yet other ideas and events have been pivotal to current understanding of mammal evolution one was geological proof of plate tectonics , which was finally found in the 1950 s another was the proposal in 1980 , by the fatherandson team luis and walter alvarez , that a comet had struck the earth some 65 million years ago both concepts help explain the modern distribution of the world s mammals what interested me most was wallace s discussion of the rise of the angiosperms , the flowering plants , some 130 million years ago oak trees , chestnut trees , osage orange trees , prickly pear trees , wild plum trees as the flowering plants proliferated , the first primates could move into this leafy universe above the ground here they developed many of our particularly human traits eventually some would descend and evolve into humankind beasts of eden contains no charts of the paleozoic , mesozoic and cenozoic eras , or of the periods or epochs within each era and there are no diagrams tracing how these fossil forms developed from one type into the next , precluding a clear understanding of the evolutionary branches of the mammals or how one form evolved into another nonetheless , i will never look at the squirrels in central park the same way again squirrels are the best modern representatives of the prehistoric mammals that scampered beneath the terrible lizards some 65 million years ago the squirrels and i are kin , part of a vast web of beings who have journeyed together since deep time beasts of eden has vividly portrayed this web , and as darwin wrote in origin of species , there is grandeur in this view of life

, you could hardly see the ground because of the children , mr arkov said now look you cannot see a child inna and natalya left home at 8 45 am on wednesday for the opening of the school year inna is starting 10th grade , natalya the 4th mr arkov and his wife had treated them to everything new new shoes , new dresses , new nylons the children crossed oktyabrskaya street , joined others who were carrying balloons to celebrate the day and entered the schoolyard for an outdoor assembly minutes later the hostagetakers appeared , wearing camouflage and black masks yelena arkova , the girls' mother , was in the family s fourthfloor apartment when she heard the opening shots at first she thought they were firecrackers then there were more a battle had started between outmatched police officers on routine schoolhouse duty and what russian officials describe as a seasoned band of chechen and ingush fighters , with at least one ossetian militant now strange details cling to memory ms arkova said she ran to the balcony as the shooting intensified and saw dozens of multicolored balloons rising through the schoolyard s trees their release , she said , must have marked the moment when the children panicked , all as one it was like a cloud of balloons , she said she called her husband and told him there was shooting at the school , and ran outside into the edges of confusion as more police officers arrived mr arkov sped home from the capital , vladikavkaz , 20 miles away , driving , he said , faster than he ever had before and going through a roadblock even though a police officer threatened him with an automatic rifle he arrived and saw his wife standing and sobbing on the far side of the street he could not reach her , because she was on the opposite side of the police line the militants were firing grenade launchers , he said , and explosions were booming the police were outmatched he doubled back the way he had come , circled the block , climbed a fence and ran to his wife from the other side she told him that both their daughters had gone to school and then this strange waiting and uncertainty began , he said their building is perhaps 125 yards from middle school no1 , and the inner boundary for the police line that is holding a large portion of beslan s residents parents shuffle on the edge of the barricades and cluster under the trees , weteyed , trembling , sickened with worry and from lack of food and sleep there is light shooting from the school every hour or so , and sometimes random shots from grenade launchers some residents have reached such a state of exhaustion that when new explosions are heard they barely react other break into moans and wails the war between russia and its chechen separatists , characterized by terrorist bombs , abductions , assassinations and brutality by both sides , had descended so deeply into inhumanity that much of the world had turned away in beslan , people here say , the militants are descending further still throughout the siege the parents have assumed most every possible posture of fear and grief some sob some stand silent with hands pressed over their mouths hundreds pace a few shout down the officials when they appear , accusing them of dishonesty and incompetence , venting in screeds most are holding themselves together , showing the deflated calm of the helpless , waiting for any sign mr arkov was almost numb with disbelief he said in addition to the 40 children , several parents from 13 oktyabrskaya were among the captives , having gone to the assembly and been swept up in the attack there are two entire families missing , he said these are families of four or five people there is much to worry over how hungry the children are , given that the militants have not yet allowed deliveries of food to the school how frightened they must be whether they were kept warm during wednesday s cool , wet night families here also know their children are held by militants who have expressed cruel terms of retaliation against any use of government force they have threatened to kill 50 hostages for every militant killed , 20 hostages for every militant injured the parents worry about the government , too the last time militants took a large number of hostages in russia , at a moscow theater in 2002 , security forces stormed the theater at least 129 hostages died even though officials have said they have no plans to take middle school no1 by force , the possibility is on the minds of residents since yesterday morning we have been crying , mr arkov said we are afraid of the storm ms arkova wiped her eyes the guerrillas are said to have wired the school with explosives , especially the gymnasium , where the children are thought to be held a few minutes later , as mr arkov was talking , a grenade fired by the militants exploded one courtyard away in a thunderous crack , having silently sailed overhead and landed almost directly behind him the adults stood and scattered , weaving heads to look over the fence and see if anyone next door had been injured or killed no one had up on the balcony , the lone child visible at 13 oktyabrskaya began to shriek and cry
frank gehry is at the university of connecticut , where he has just presented his design for a new arts center to an audience of faculty and students reed kroloff , who is moderating the program , asks the audience if there are any questions a student stands up and says now that you 're an internationally renowned icon mr kroloff interrupts are you speaking to me or frank \? mr kroloff can afford to be cheeky later that day , he helped award what is a large prize even to a star like mr gehry the commission to design a signature building \( projected to cost at least 70 million \) for the university s sprawling campus and within the following weeks , mr kroloff , 43 , helped select architects for nearly a dozen projects , ranging from an addition to the fashion institute of technology in manhattan to an aerial tramway system for portland , ore , to the motown center , a detroit museum founded by berry gordy mr kroloff is one of a small coterie of competition advisers who organize and administer the bakeoffs so often used to determine which architecture firms will design which coveted projects these advisers are both catalysts for and beneficiaries of an upsurge in interest in how architects are chosen competitions that only five years ago would have been local affairs now draw thousands of entries from around the world , partly because the internet makes the rules available to any architect with a computer and modem it was a less hightech connection that helped mr kroloff establish himself as a competition adviser until april 2002 he was the editor of architecture magazine , a position he resigned when the magazine was sold one of the first people he heard from was mark robbins , an artist and architect whom mr kroloff had described in an editorial as one of the architecture community s great assets at the time , mr robbins was director of design programs at the national endowment for the arts there , he had created new public works , which provided small grants usually in the midfive figures to help organizations run design competitions the government ca n't give someone 75 million to build a building , but it can give them 75 , 000 to build a better building , mr robbins said mr robbins gave his grant recipients a list of competition advisers that included ralph lerner , former dean of the princeton university school of architecture in new jersey , and roger schluntz , dean of the school of architecture and planning at the university of new mexico in albuquerque after he added mr kroloff to that list , mr kroloff was hired to run a half dozen competitions under the aegis of new public works \( mr robbins and mr kroloff also teamed up in 2002 on the competition for the 9 11 memorial at the pentagon , which was sponsored by the army corps of engineers \) the endowment disbanded new public works in 2002 , and around the same time mr robbins , now 47 , resigned from the organization to accept a fellowship at harvard university yet the program lives on through more than 30 competitions , some of which are only now getting under way new public works competitions take a variety of forms , ranging from wide open to by invitation only in connecticut , mr kroloff drew up a list of 57 architects he thought might be right for the job it included stars like mr gehry and zaha hadid a committee that included several of the university s administrators narrowed the field to three finalists , who were invited to present designs in the form of drawings and models to a jury that included the wellknown new york architect hugh hardy , monica ponce de leon of the hot boston firm office da and mr robbins mr lerner prefers anonymous contests that any licensed architect can enter , he said , in order to foster innovation and help promote young talent invited competitions , he said , tend to favor architects who are already at the peak of their profession in fact , at the university of connecticut , the criteria for selecting the three finalists included their ability to raise money for the building that almost guaranteed mr gehry one of three spots , since he is , as mr kroloff put it , a commodity mr kroloff s invitees tend to be a mix of marquee names , like mr gehry and ms hadid , and modernism s young turks , including the new york firm shop sharples holden pasquarelli and the yale architecture professor joel sanders they are in many cases the same architects he championed at architecture magazine he said he is unapologetically a modernist and that one of his goals as a competition adviser is to convince clients that cuttingedge architecture is n't something they need to be afraid of but , he said , his influence on the architecture world is limited , because the number of clients who choose architects through competitions is still dwarfed by the number who choose architects by looking or asking around much of mr kroloff s power comes from assembling the list of architects invited to compete once a competition begins , mr kroloff s role is much like that of a judge in a trial court though the final decision rests with a jury , the judge by setting the ground rules and controlling the flow of information has a great deal of influence on the outcome \( mr kroloff does not vote except in the case of a tie \) and that from a man who says his mother cried her eyes out when he told her he was n't going to be a lawyer \( mr kroloff has three brothers two are lawyers and one has finished law school \) mr kroloff said that his goal is to make the process transparent , so that everybody knows what s going on at a meeting at the university of connecticut , he walked the architects through the competition requirements the way a teacher would review the requirements for an exam at one point , he told mr gehry , if you do n't pay attention , we 're sending you back to the fifth grade clearly , he enjoys the giveandtake later that day , he ended a presentation by the flamboyant zaha hadid by saying to the audience , thank you , posh spice to help berry gordy define his vision for the motown center , he spent a day at mr gordy s house in los angeles , brainstorming with motown luminaries like smokey robinson tanya heidelbergyopp , the director of the motown center , said that mr kroloff did a great job not only of choosing architects for the competition but of representing the center s goals to the designers but the job is n't all glamour during the finals of the fashion institute competition , mr kroloff spent much of his time trying to turn down the air conditioning in the meeting room for all the effort , mr kroloff has yet to see one of his new public works competitions yield an actual building \( right now , one new public works project an addition to the children s museum of pittsburgh , by the los angeles firm koning eizenberg architecture is under construction , according to jeff speck , the national endowment s design director since last august \) but even before ground is broken , the competitions may have had a positive effect motivated by tight deadlines and knowledge that rivals are working around the clock , architects do some of their best work in competitions , mr kroloff said and because most competitions include a period for community comment , competitions require architects to speak the public s language , mr kroloff said mr kroloff is about to spend six months abroad , studying italian design magazines as a winner of the prestigious prix de rome when he returns to washington in august , he said , he will begin running at least three new competitions none of those are dependent on new public works money the demise of that program , mr kroloff says , will be a significant loss mr lerner agreed it s critical that the federal government which is one of the largest builders in the country set the standard , he said and the standard ought to be programs that encourage people to put architecture in the forefront
austin , tex it is a rare day when members of the united states congress try to read the minds of the members of a grand jury in travis county , tex apparently tom delay s colleagues expect him to be indicted last week congressional republicans voted to change their rule that required an indicted leader to relinquish his post they were responding to an investigation by the travis county grand jury into political contributions by corporations that has already resulted in the indictments of three associates of mr delay , the house majority leader yet no member of congress has been indicted in the investigation , and none is a target unless he or she has committed a crime the grand jury will continue its work , abiding by the rule of law that law requires a grand jury of citizens , not the prosecutor , to determine whether probable cause exists to hold an accused person to answer for the accusation against him or her politicians in congress are responsible for the leaders they choose their choices reflect their moral values every law enforcement officer depends on the moral values and integrity of society for backup they are like body armor the cynical destruction of moral values at the top makes it hard for law enforcement to do its job in terms of moral values , this is where the rubber meets the road the rules you apply to yourself are the true test of your moral values the thinly veiled personal attacks on me by mr delay s supporters in this case are no different from those in the cases of any of the 15 elected officials this office has prosecuted in my 27year tenure most of these officials 12 democrats and three republicans have accused me of having political motives what else are they going to say \? for most of my tenure the democrats held the power in state government now republicans do most crimes by elected officials involve the abuse of power you have to have power before you can abuse it there is no limit to what you can do if you have the power to change the rules congress may make its own rules , but the public makes the rule of law , and depends for its peace on the enforcement of the law hypocrisy at the highest levels of government is toxic to the moral fiber that holds our communities together the open contempt for moral values by our elected officials has a corrosive effect it is a sad day for law enforcement when congress offers such poor leadership on moral values and ethical behavior we are a moral people , and the first lesson of democracy is not to hold the public in contempt oped contributor ronnie earle is the district attorney for travis county , tex
detroit , sept 15 senator john kerry lashed out at president bush s economic record on wednesday , saying that mr bush had created more excuses than jobs and that in the closing months of his term he could no longer refuse to take responsibility for the failures on his watch his is the excuse presidency never wrong , never responsible , never to blame , mr kerry said in a speech to the detroit economic club that amounted to his strongest attack yet on the bush administration s economic policies president bush s desk is n't where the buck stops , it s where the blame begins he s blamed just about everybody but himself and his administration for america s economic problems mr kerry s speech , billed by his campaign as a major economic address , offered no policies beyond what he had already put forth tax incentives for american corporations to help keep jobs in the united states , a rollback of tax cuts for people who make more than 200 , 000 a year and a 1 , 000 child care tax credit for the middle class , among other proposals but at a time when mr kerry has pledged to hit harder at mr bush and focus more on domestic policy , he framed his economic argument against the president with hot new rhetoric mr kerry said that the job losses and economic troubles under mr bush were a result not of bad luck the recession , the sept 11 attacks and the corporate scandals that the president cites in his speeches but of bad choices mr bush s choices , mr kerry said , have consistently been in favor of the rich and the powerful he chose and he chose and he chose , mr kerry said and every single time his choices made middleclass america pay the price in mr bush s america , mr kerry added , a fireman who works overtime to save money and pay for his kid to go to school actually pays a higher tax rate than a billionaire who just inherited a fortune mr kerry was apparently referring to mr bush s 2003 tax bill , in which the top tax rate on dividends and capital gains , a source of most billionaires' income , was lowered to 15 percent that is a lower rate than would be paid on the overtime of a firefighter who earns 70 , 000 a year the bush campaign replied that mr kerry was offering up more gloom about america he rehashed old , tired ideas of higher taxes , of more regulation and of more government control of people s lives that his own advisers say will not work , said ken mehlman , the president s campaign manager , in a conference call mr mehlman added that mr kerry had voted 98 times for tax increases totaling 23 trillion and had voted 8 times for higher taxes on social security benefits mr mehlman was apparently referring to a record that is more complex than suggested in the daily charge and countercharge of the two campaigns in reality , mr kerry voted for one large tax increase , the clinton tax bill of 1993 most of the additional income taxes in this bill were imposed on the wealthy , but it did include an increase in the taxes on social security benefits for middleincome retirees mr kerry also voted against two large tax cuts , the bush tax bills in 2001 and 2003 although most of the tax cuts went to the wealthy , the bills included lower taxes for middleincome couples and families mr kerry favored the middleclass cuts but voted against them in the course of voting against the entire legislation mr kerry did cast 98 tax votes , but nearly half of them were not on bills but rather on budget resolutions , measures that set overall tax and spending targets the total also includes the many times he cast multiple votes on the same bill mr kerry delivered the speech , at cobo hall in downtown detroit , accompanied by robert e rubin , the treasury secretary under president bill clinton in the introduction to his remarks , mr kerry lavished praise on mr rubin and made it clear that if he was elected he would want mr rubin at his side mr rubin , he said , is one of those rare public citizens who has this great ability to move between the public sector and the private sector and keeps his credibility through both he added that there are those of us obviously who would love to see him make that transition and move again over all , mr kerry s remarks were greeted with tepid applause , which one of his advisers , gene sperling , attributed to what he said were the largely conservative leanings of the economic club mr sperling , an economic adviser in the clinton white house , was in detroit to brief reporters after mr kerry s speech mr kerry began his day by calling in to don imus s radio show and talking at length about the war in iraq when mr imus asked mr kerry if there were any circumstances that warranted going to war with saddam hussein , mr kerry replied , no , there are none that i see the exchange prompted the bush campaign to again call mr kerry a flipflopper in august , mr kerry said that knowing what he knows today , he would still have voted to authorize the president to use force against iraq and mr kerry told mr imus that a new book , unfit for command swift boat veterans speak out against john kerry , by john e o'neill and jerome r corsi , was a pack of lies , and that he had no interest in reading it he also briefly addressed mr bush s record in the texas air national guard mr bush , who missed duty in the guard in 1972 and 1973 , spoke tuesday to a guard convention in las vegas would n't it have been funny , mr imus asked the senator , if he 'd have showed up for that speech yesterday , that national guard speech the president went up there and gave that dopey salute like you did and said , 'reporting for duty , finally' \? mr kerry laughed and replied , yes , actually it would have been funny
the bridge in west islip is as packed as the verrazanonarrows bridge on marathon morning fully booked was the reply we received when calling a week ahead for a saturday night reservation our waiter informed us that diners had to call three weeks in advance to get a table for a saturday night even on a slow tuesday elsewhere , we had to circle the lot before settling for ontheroad parking what s the draw \? one thing is the restaurant itself it s a beauty on a blustery night , a fireplace in the bar , surrounded by loveseats and big , comfy chairs , had cozy appeal large leather chairs were also interwoven with the usual tiny barroom high tables and stools rivaling the fireplace as an attentiongetter was a fullwall picture of the robert moses causeway a massive metal wine rack shaped like the brooklyn bridge kept the theme going the dining room is as stunning as the bar rows of highbacked striped banquettes offer comfortable seating , as do the overstuffed couches that dot the room they turn an ordinary table into a charming nook on the walls are photographs \( from around the 1950 s or '60 s \) of bridges being built black ceiling fans , wood floors and tiny oil lanterns on the tables round out the space the menu invites patrons to join us at 'the top of the bridge' for our fine desserts , pastries , specialty coffee , imported tea and after dinner cordials we were never able to take them up on the offer on the weekend , the upper balcony room was filled with overflow diners midweek , there was a private party the desserts would not have been worth the climb our waiter confided that the pastry chef had left and that the sweets were now made elsewhere only a caramel chocolate praline cake \( a moist chocolate layer cake with caramel frosting \) and an intensely flavored banana sorbet were worthy a double chocolate fudge torte , with the consistency of a gooey candy bar , was toothachingly sweet the other selections on the dessert menu all seemed to be variations of cheesecake the offering described as raspberry cake filled with pastry cream turned out to be an ordinary cheesecake with a gellike raspberry glaze not what we were expecting , nor what our taste buds were longing for get the meal off with a bang by ordering the lightly packed crab cakes with their mixed bean salsa , cilantro oil and spicy r moulade sauce also perky was a vegetable tart special , an individual quichelike affair with assertive seasoning still , a number of appetizers lacked flavor it was hard to tell what the filling was in the chicken and wild mushroom spring roll all its punch came from a tangy mustard sauce served on the side the beef and barley soup and the haricot vert salad with shrimp and plum tomatoes both cried out for salt standard was the verdict for the grilled portobello mushrooms and the caesar salad yet that ordinary salad exploded with flavor when it was chopped and topped with stillhot , crisply fried calamari the pointcounterpoint of hot seafood and cool greens made for a terrific dish at entree time , the boneless shell steak accompanied by a cornpepper relish and skinson french fries was so juicy that none of it was consigned to a doggie bag other crowdpleasers were the succulent rack of lamb and a spirited saut of shrimp , andouille sausage , tomatoes , sweet peppers and roasted onions it was served over basmati rice and garnished with crisp wonton strips the no1 fish pick was the cookedtoorder blackened tuna mated with grilled portobello mushrooms and asparagus the chilean sea bass sported an appealingly crunchy cornflour crust , but it would take an unrelenting sweet tooth to enjoy it the bass came with a ginger plum sauce as well as a pineapplemango chutney also too high on the sweet meter was the raspberry sauce that accompanied the roast duck thank goodness it was confined to a puddle on the plate , not on the bird service was as mixed as the food waiters were personable but needed prompting when it came to the replacement of silver and empty butter dishes runners delivering the food had n't a clue who ordered what dishes like the calamaricaesar salad , shell steak and

one day after news surfaced that gov john g rowland did not pay his own way during a stay at an expensive manhattan hotel in 1998 , the house committee that is investigating him said he had accepted gift certificates to an upscale hartford clothier from state employees the house committee considering whether to recommend the governor s impeachment issued a subpoena on thursday to the clothing store , stackpole , moore and tryon , said arthur j o'neill , a republican who is cochairman of the committee mr o'neill said that gift certificates were given by christine corey , mr rowland s scheduling secretary , and by jo mckenzie , who manages mr rowland s official residence there have been rumors that seem to be credible that a number of suits were bought at stackpole , moore and tryon that the governor did not pay for himself , said michael p lawlor , a democrat who is one of 10 committee members the committee is interested in how the clothing was paid for , he said a lawyer close to the investigation said that the store had been subpoenaed by federal investigators too on thursday , stanley a twardy jr , a lawyer for a new britain travel agency owner , said that mr rowland had never paid the bill for his room and other incidentals after spending the weekend at the carlyle hotel in manhattan five years ago before he left for a vacation overseas on friday , the governor s personal lawyer , william f dow iii , told the associated press that mr rowland had spent about 2 , 500 to 3 , 000 at the clothing store in recent years , with a significant portion of it paid for with gift certificates from friends and staff mr dow also said that no state contractors had provided the gift certificates dean pagani , mr rowland s spokesman , said on friday evening that he had no idea how much the governor spends on clothes or how much he has paid for it one gift certificate , in the amount of 250 , was given to mr rowland in 1996 as a christmas present by his scheduling secretary , ms corey , said richard r brown , her lawyer ms corey , who with her husband gave mr rowland a 3 , 600 hot tub in 2001 that has also been the subject of interest by federal investigators and the house committee , gave the gifts to mr rowland in the spirit of friendship , mr brown said mr o'neill said he believed the gift certificate from ms mckenzie , 72 , was about 3 , 000 a lawyer for ms mckenzie , austin mcguigan , confirmed that amount and said she has given gifts to someone whom she considers a son there s nothing inappropriate about that mr lawlor said that in isolation , none of these gifts constitute an impeachable offense but when you begin to see a pattern , it gives the whole story another complexion as the investigation of mr rowland continues , two of his most trusted aides marc s ryan , 39 , and mr pagani , 43 have said they are looking for new jobs it has absolutely nothing to do with the governor s travails , mr ryan said , adding that any departure would be many months or as much as a year away mr pagani , who was communications director for mr rowland for six years and has been his chief of staff for the last two years , would say only that i'm exploring other options
the iraqi men s soccer team continued its unlikely run in the olympics when it beat costa rica , 20 , on sunday night to make the quarterfinals with one round of qualifying matches left while empty seats heavily outnumbered fans at karaiskaki stadium , where the capacity is 33 , 353 and attendance was announced at 12 , 150 , the game was nonetheless played in a frenzied atmosphere most of the fans were iraqis who had congregated in athens to support the team , and on sunday night they were massed along one side of the field none of the fans seemed to be sitting shirtless young men balanced on the railing separating the stands from the field , unconcerned by the drop to the track below every cut and thrust of the game and every call was greeted with wild cheering or enraged booing one young fan who gave his name as sizar and said he had come to athens from iraq three years ago yelled joyously it is mad ! iraqis from germany , netherlands , england ! midway through the second half , iraq , which beat portugal in its first game , 42 , began to apply pressure with a series of corner kicks , and the costa ricans finally paid for their inability to clear the ball on the third consecutive corner , in the 67th minute , the ball fell to muhammad mulla hawar on the edge of the penalty area he struck it sweetly on the volley with his left foot and into the goal , rippling the net a couple of feet off the ground before the ball dropped to the grass , half a dozen fans brandishing iraqi flags raced onto the field , where they were chased by dozens of security guards five minutes later , with costa rica pressing , iraq launched a counterattack hawar dashed up the left and curled a high ball across the goal mouth , where karim mahdi drilled in a header i am very pleased that iraq has reached the quarterfinals , said adnan hamad majeed , iraq s coach especially considering the very difficult times
four men arrested for falsely posing as american government officials and illegally detaining afghans were conducting their own selfstyled antiterrorism campaign , afghan and american officials said thursday the four men , three of them americans , illegally held eight afghans for 12 days in the basement of a house where they had set up a fake export company , the officials said three foreigners made up their own group and pretended they were against those who conduct terrorist operations , ali ahmed jalali , afghanistan s interior minister , said thursday at a news conference they were actually outlaws three of the afghans who were detained were brothers who had past ties to the political party of gulbuddin hekmatyar , a protaliban commander , but officials said none of them were involved in terrorism and were , in fact , now employees of afghanistan s new government one works for the afghan supreme court and another for the ministry of education , officials said it was not clear how long the four men had been in kabul or why no one had challenged them sooner western officials have said that american forces had the men under surveillance before their arrest on monday by the afghan police investigators are trying to determine if the group had harmed other afghans in washington , the state department spokesman , richard a boucher , identified two of the three americans as jonathan k idema and brent bennett , the associated press reported mr boucher said the american government does not employ or sponsor any of the men in interviews with journalists , mr idema has said he served as a private adviser to northern alliance forces during the american invasion of the country in 2001 mr idema s unconfirmed accounts of his time in afghanistan were a major feature of a bestselling book , the hunt for bin laden a former special operations soldier in the united states who spoke on the condition of anonymity said in a telephone interview that former commandos had questioned mr idema s afghan claims i know a lot of people are challenging his statements , he said the former soldier said there were also complaints that mr idema had exaggerated his military experience a spokesman for the special operations command in fayetteville , n c , said he could not immediately release mr idema s military records a western diplomat said members of the group were still being questioned and continued to be evasive they seem to be behaving in very irrational ways , he said
the notion that stan van gundy s miami heat would qualify for the playoffs before jeff van gundy s houston rockets was laughable a few months ago , even a few weeks ago but that is exactly what has happened while the surging heat entered the weekend fighting for homecourt advantage in the first round of the eastern conference playoffs , the reeling rockets needed a tense 106103 victory friday night against denver to claim the postseason slot that once seemed a sure bet behind the stifling defense that has come to characterize jeff van gundy s teams , the rockets were 13 games over 500 on march 13 but that defense suddenly turned porous , causing houston to lose 9 of its next 12 games , including five straight , before wednesday s victory over the struggling clippers the rockets lost again last night , 8269 to the jazz the late collapse had put the rockets in jeopardy of becoming the first team to miss the playoffs after being 10 games over 500 with less than nine games remaining since the current playoff format was instituted in 198384 we 're not playing as hard , said van gundy , whose team allowed 98 points a game during its fivegame losing streak it wrenches my gut there s plenty of blame to go around right now , and it starts with me i 've got to get the team playing better the rockets' recent struggles were the latest for van gundy , the former knicks coach who made the transition from the broadcasting booth , as an analyst for tnt , to his first season with houston accustomed to the laidback approach of rudy tomjanovich , the rockets , particularly the starting guards , steve francis and cuttino mobley , were initially taken aback by van gundy s intensity last week , francis said that players were playing too tight because they were afraid of making mistakes mobley said we did n't buy in right away we bumped heads a little bit steve and i came in with rudy and we spent five years with him , so he was like a father figure so to have somebody new come in was a process but jeff s a great dude he s passionate , and he s actually a funny , funny guy he s like smartalecky van gundy found nothing funny about a controversy involving francis , a threetime allstar guard , on super bowl sunday after francis missed the team s flight from houston to phoenix , van gundy said francis told him he had skipped the flight to attend the super bowl , which was held in houston van gundy suspended francis for the next night s game at phoenix francis and his agent , jeff fried , denied van gundy s account , saying that francis was tending to a family issue and did not attend the super bowl to this day , the two sides have yet to agree on what happened but van gundy and francis deny any disagreement exists i do n't have a problem at all with steve , van gundy said last week i think steve has worked diligently to try to be what i want him to be but you 're never going to go through a season without disagreements everybody wants to harken back to the missed planesuper bowl thing , and to me , that s a blip on the radar screen i did what i thought i had to do , and that was it asked if the disagreement would lead to an offseason trade of francis , van gundy said , absolutely not francis is averaging about 16 points a game on 40 percent shooting , both career lows but he is in the playoffs for the first time in his fiveyear career if i ever look at my season individually , that would be selfish because the years when i did do a lot of scoring and a lot of things individually i was looked at as a person who looks for numbers , francis said now that my points are down , and my team is in a great position , i'm definitely happy with that as far as me and jeff , i do n't really see anything people can assume whatever they want i'm just going to concentrate on our goal , and that s to help our team win he s given me an excellent game plan to help our team win me and coach are on the same page as far as the progress of this team the question heading into the weekend was if the rockets were still progressing a busy summer awaits this summer could be one of the most active in recent memory , with several bigname players on the move kobe bryant has said he will opt out of his contract with the los angeles lakers to test free agency , and philadelphia \( allen iverson \) , toronto \( vince carter \) and houston \( francis \) have reasons to shop their superstars if sacramento fizzles in the playoffs , chris webber could be put on the trading block , and with tracy mcgrady able to opt out of his contract after next season , orlando might entertain offers for him mcgrady , a native of florida , sounds as if he wants to stay in orlando , but he said he would understand if the magic sought to trade him if they feel that i'm going to leave , then obviously they do n't want to lose me for nothing , so it would be in their best interest to trade me , said mcgrady , who will win his second straight scoring title i would be cool with that , but hopefully it s a mutual thing where if that does occur both parties will be on the same page mcgrady said he would tell the magic if he planned to leave , so the team could search for a trade partner rather than lose him for nothing i definitely do n't want to just leave and have them not gain anything because they 've helped me grow into the person that i am and i have a lot of respect for the organization , he said farm team not for milicic one reason commissioner david stern wants to turn the nba s developmental league into a baseballstyle minor league is to help young players like detroit s darko milicic who fail to earn meaningful minutes as rookies under stern s plan , milicic , the second pick of the draft , could play for detroit s farm team and be called up by the pistons when they felt he was ready to contribute but milicic wants no part of such a system i never would want to play in the nbdl , he said i 'd rather play in europe because europe has good leagues with really good players i do n't want to say that there s no good players in the nbdl , but it s not for me if i'm over here , i want to play in nba road less traveled to mvp minnesota s kevin garnett appears to be headed for his first most valuable player award should he win , garnett , the league s leading rebounder and one of the top scorers , would become the first player who entered the nba out of high school to win the award since moses malone won it for the third time in 198283 besides the reigning most valuable player , tim duncan of the spurs , none of the other three leading candidates jermaine o'neal of the pacers , peja stojakovic of the kings and kobe bryant played college basketball
the emergency assistance unit , the city s tarnished golden door for families declaring themselves homeless , is most famously overcrowded in august , when children are out of school but on a tepid february evening , when a reporter was allowed a rare visit inside , the bronx building was literally spilling people by 6 30 pm , 300 families had logged in and were waiting to be bused to a bed for the night inside , beyond the metal detectors , a warren of drab , trashdotted waiting rooms were awash in children who wailed and toddled and squirmed adults lined the hallways looking vacant and tired they sat on the transparent trash bags issued at the door now filled with baby clothes , gameboys and the occasional tattered bible or stretched out on the gray plastic benches , waking to brush off the occasional water bug outside , 100 more were waiting to check in it would be 2 am before all the buses were on their way and the bronx office emptied for a bit because it is where poverty s growing demands collide with the supply of subsidized housing , the unit is overwhelmed as it struggles between helping families humanely and weeding out those whose need may not be dire yet almost no one is happy with the balance achieved so far , and a battle is now shaping up that will affect the future existence of the notorious city office and the manner in which new york deals with its homeless population city officials are frank about their desire to shut down the unit for good no one coming through here could believe this works as it is now , said linda i gibbs , the commissioner of homeless services , said on a recent tour of the building for 10 years , she said , the city has poured money into making the unit more physically palatable most recently , the office has been covered with graffitiresistant wallboards and new fluorescent lighting and operationally efficient and though the improvements are real the cafeteria , for example , is sparkling these days she considers them ultimately marginal in the face of the everincreasing demand on the building ms gibbs said it no longer made any sense to her to spend ever more money and staff time on improving the office , which was opened by the koch administration in the 1980 s after the city was sued and ordered by a state court to provide shelter on demand to homeless families she would like instead to create an entirely new system in which families would apply for homeless assistance through local community groups receiving city financing that could offer them less drastic alternatives like rental assistance or family counseling a space in a homeless shelter would be considered a last resort , provided through a new , smaller city office to advocates for the homeless , ms gibbs s vision sounds like treason any effort to eliminate the eau is an endrun effort to eliminate the entry point to safetynet shelter , said steve banks , the legal aid lawyer who has been running class action litigation against the city for two decades we have seen in the past what happens when the government does that families end up sleeping on the subway mr banks s vision is almost the opposite of ms gibbs s he argues that the flood at the office will stop only when the government builds large amounts of lowcost housing or provides much greater rental assistance until then , he would like to see a new , larger complex , where families would not only enter the city s system but where they could also be housed for the night , similar to the process that exists for single men such an office should have enough workers to process families in hours , not days , he said , and to provide immediate aid for getting into housing like longterm shelters ms gibbs agrees with the goals , but says mr banks s approach ignores the larger problem as long as you continue to focus on how to fix the process for the 100 new families that show up every day , all you are going to do is put more bandaids on top of bandaids , she said a different solution is to move the focus of the system away from processing people into homelessness in january last year , the city and legal aid agreed to a twoyear restraint on 20 years of litigation to let an independent panel of experts try to resolve some of the most contentious issues on family homelessness the panel is now preparing a report on what to do with the emergency assistance unit that will have significant weight with the court , and may be the blueprint for its future down in the bowels of the unit , in the cubicles where investigations that decide family eligibility take place , a 17yearold with cherry red lipstick and a matching stud beneath her lower lip might be exhibit a in both sides' argument for change the teenager , whose name was withheld under city privacy rules , wants the city to recognize her and her 9monthold baby as homeless she has applied five times at the unit and been rejected each time each time , after the 10day grace period during which the city provides shelter while it investigates her need , she has been removed from shelter and told to return to her mother s apartment but , as she explains to the city investigator , a quiet woman with a caribbean accent , she cannot return to her mother s apartment because her mother does not get along with her child s father and has kicked her out even if she stayed , there would be six people living in the twobedroom bronx apartment , and her mother is in ecuador anyway until april and has locked the place up the city investigator does not look convinced she points out that the teenager has already had a fair hearing from the state , which agreed with the city her mother told investigators herself that her daughter and the boyfriend had in fact been living there before entering the shelter unless the teenager presents new evidence that she is homeless , the investigator says , the city cannot put her into longterm shelter and into the coveted queue for permanent subsidized housing there is no new evidence , the teenager screams in exasperation the apartment is locked go look the investigator promises to try to reach the mother in ecuador , but until then , the teenager will just have to start the process all over again the city argues that the teenager is an example of just the kind of case that should never have made it to the unit in a rational system , ms gibbs said , the first day she walked out of her apartment she would have met with a community group that might have provided mediation between the mother and boyfriend to arrange a temporary peace and then placed the her on a waiting list for rental assistance or some other subsidized housing without her having to enter a shelter to marshal its case for essentially eliminating the office , the city has amassed a wealth of data that show that there are too many cases similar to this one in which people use the bronx office as a first line of action to get housing instead of the last resort for example , none of the families with children who come to the unit are coming from the street , according to city statistics , and more than half are staying with other family members roughly 40 percent of all those coming to the until are women 25 and under , many of whom are moving away from their mothers the city estimates that only 25 percent of those who come even visit the office in the unit where options are offered to avoid homelessness , such as rental assistance or legal representation to prevent eviction perhaps most maddening of all for the city , at any one point 50 percent of those in the unit have previously been considered and deemed to have housing , usually an apartment of a mother or grandmother nonetheless , they continue to return to the unit to restart the process time after time the expense to the city is enormous , but ms gibbs said she was more concerned that the returning families slow things down for families truly needing help the average time to be processed by the unit is currently two and a half days , although the city says that the preliminary application process could be completed in three hours to the mr banks and the coalition for the homeless , which has also sued the city on behalf of the homeless , those numbers do not begin to tell the complications of the individual cases the city s vision , they say , is all promise and no reality advocacy groups also say that they have numbers based on city records they obtained through court order showing that the majority of those who make it to the shelter s door are really on their last legs from 1999 to 2003 , they say , 77 percent of those who completed the investigations process were found to meet city standards of homelessness \( the city notes that thousands more never completed the process \) of those nearly 26 , 000 eligible families , some 10 , 500 had to apply more than once before being accepted , mr banks said of the roughly 8 , 000 who were found ineligible , only 860 reapplied to the system more than four times in other words , mr banks said , the city s own data show it is a minuscule fraction of families who might be abusing the system the groups would like to see some changes to the system for starters , they would like the city to spend less energy on finding fraud and more on helping people in crisis , with , for example , the addition of social service workers at the unit who help families obtain documents to prove their homelessness if the city offered some kind of onsite living quarters , advocates said , families would not need to be bused to sleeping quarters and children might not miss school for days at a time as they are shuffled before being placed in the 10day interim shelter mr banks said he also wanted the independent advisory panel to improve eligibility investigations , which he said were too prosecutorial gail nayowith , the executive director of the citizens' committee for children , who sits on the independent panel , said it had not reached a conclusion on what should be done , but said she understood that the stakes are enormous she hinted that she would recommend that the city spend the resources to pursue both the systemic changes it wants and the process changes the advocates are demanding the big vision and the smaller vision at the eau will happen at the same time , she said , leaving open the question of where the money would come from
after examining the financial records of national hockey league teams for almost a year , arthur levitt came to a conclusion this is totally bush league , he said and he meant this as a compliment levitt , the former chairman of the securities and exchange commission , was not describing the quality of play or the competence of management in a troubled professional sports business after being paid 250 , 000 by the nhl to look at the financial records of its 30 franchises , levitt was comparing what he found in those sheets to the kind of skulduggery that i 've seen in accounting misdeeds in the past 10 years of my life compared to much of corporate america , levitt said , there is none of that kind of statisculation , none of the kind of managed numbers by those standards , levitt said , accounting in the nhl is straightforward and he concluded that the nhl lost about 273 million in the 20023 season , based on revenues of 1996 billion levitt said salaries of players account for 75 percent of revenues and that is too much the league as it is going now is not viable , he said it s not a business that makes sense i'm telling you the business model is severely flawed it s a rotten business levitt s conclusion , immediately disputed by the nhl players association , was the second major pronouncement from the league in the week after its allstar game the first was the proposal for rules changes to encourage offense , including limiting how much goalies can handle the puck these efforts come while the nhl and its union prepare to negotiate another collective bargaining agreement , and as the goalspergame total is at 50 , the lowest in a half century both developments seem to suggest that the nhl thinks its product needs repair , both on the ice and in the ledger books levitt s findings were announced at an nhl news conference yesterday and discussed more extensively in a conversation afterward levitt was asked whether he had consulted the union , which does not agree with the nhl s methods of accounting no , he said i thought about that at first there was nothing that the union had that i particularly had an interest in levitt said he was an independent agent not looking to take the side of management , adding that he was not familiar with the hockey business in a discussion of context and mutual mistrust , he said he was unaware that the former chairman of the nhl s board of governors , bruce mcnall , and the former executive director of the players association , alan eagleson , both served time in jail in the 1990 s for financial fraud in unrelated cases levitt also said he did not learn the definition of zamboni until recently i thought it was some kind of italian romantic instrument , he said the zamboni is the machine that cleans the ice ! well , yes bob goodenow , the executive director of the union , said in a statement , the levitt report is simply another league publicrelations initiative to suggest the report is in any way independent is misleading goodenow also said that the union continued to believe in a market system , not a team of hiredgun accountants the effort to change playing rules could have a larger impact than yesterday s financial debate , assuming next season is not eliminated by a lockout the 199495 season was delayed for 15 weeks while the two sides negotiated the current collective bargaining agreement under changes suggested by the general managers on tuesday , the goal lines would be moved toward the back boards , from 13 feet to 10 , and goalies could not play the puck behind the lines this could lead to more forechecking and an increase in the dumpandchase style once derided as cruder and lessappealing than free skating and passing , the dumpandchase approach now seems preferable to the passive system of neutralzone traps that have enhanced defensive systems while lowering scores and lessening entertainment value other suggested enhancements , to be tested first in the minor leagues , would be to eliminate all tie games by deciding them with shootouts after overtime and to encourage efforts to win in regulation time by awarding a victorious team 3 points in the standing for a regulation victory , instead of 2 if a game is decided after regulation , the winner would get 2 points and the loser 1 , as is the case now but none of these rules can be implemented until passed by the board of governors in that the changes suggested are radical by nhl standards , the ideas could be diluted or vanquished before a vote all this talk comes between the super bowl baseball s training camps , when hockey s visibility traditionally rises this year , the nhl authorities are choosing to put their biggest problems in the display window they can make people see , but can they make them believe or care \?
kris benson , the man with the tired shoulder who briefly symbolized the mets' seasonlong troubles , pitched a fourhitter last night at shea stadium as the mets eased to a 70 victory over the atlanta braves probably less than 10 , 000 fans \( more than 21 , 000 tickets were sold \) saw benson pitch his first complete game of the season , which began in pittsburgh before he was traded to the mets amid rumors that manager art howe could be dismissed any day , the mets generated home runs by david wright , eric valent and cliff floyd in capturing their second victory in three games over atlanta this homestand before atlanta arrived , the mets had dropped 19 of 21 games in their third straight losing season benson retired the first 11 batters he faced before jd drew drove a ground ball between the legs of mike piazza at first base for an error but piazza also made the play of the game by diving for and catching russ ortiz s line drive with two on and two out the next inning ortiz \( 148 \) allowed all the mets' runs benson \( 1211 \) stretched his scoreless streak to 15 innings in his second appearance since missing a start with his shoulder problem this was the lowesthit complete game of his career but when the shoulder issue surfaced , it seemed to be one more example of a mets trade gone sour , especially since another heralded pitcher acquired in a trade , victor zambrano , was on the disabled list with an elbow problem you tell everybody , 'i need a day off , ' and you 'd better get back to show you know what you 're talking about , benson said after the game i felt under pressure after that situation he spent much of sunday and monday studying the braves on tape , and he apparently learned them inside out he struck out seven and walked none of his 114 pitches , 75 were strikes there was a twist to his performance last night one of the players the mets gave up for zambrano was scott kazmir , a promising prospect kazmir pitched six shutout innings last night in a tampa bay victory over the red sox in boston benson did not yield a hit until the fifth , when johnny estrada lofted a flare to center that dropped that took the onus off piazza , who described his transition from catching to playing first base as still a work in progress for me i feel like a tree sometimes , he said inside pitch mike piazza s fourthinning error was his eighth of the season at first base he has committed five as a catcher his fielding average of 985 at first entering the game was significantly under the national league norm of 993
to take no sides in history would be as false as to take no sides in life , the historian barbara w tuchman once wrote if that applies to the written word , it is just as true for the presentation of history in museums museums ca n't be objective because history is n't to be meaningful , a museum needs a slant on the other hand , a museum dedicated to the history of a place is supposed to be broadly representative so there s the contradiction if a museum is doing its job , you might say , it s ticking somebody off by that yardstick , the custodians of three of the main museums devoted to new york history are doing a terrific job at receptions , in the newspaper , at meetings of their boards , the future of new york s past is being discussed in strident terms the heightened political climate this fall is adding effervescence and the backdrop and catalyst is the event of three years ago that refocused new york in the eyes of the world for a long while , people have lamented a lack in new york go to london , sydney , amsterdam , chicago , atlanta , pittsburgh , and you 'll find a museum devoted to that city s past it s a context stop for any visitor , resident or student that , in an hour or two , sets the whos , hows and whys of the place coal , convicts , spices , hogs , soldiers , princes in a chronological and topical landscape an urban history museum can provide a forum for debating current problems by setting them in earlier contexts it can be a tool for city schools it can be a focal point and a benchmark , something to which residents can point and say , this is who we are perhaps typically , new york does n't have one museum to tell its story it has several , plus dozens of more specialized history centers and while three the newyork historical society , the museum of the city of new york and the south street seaport museum have overlapping missions and collections , according to many observers this is a case where more is less given that their subject is the brassiest , mightiest , most improbable and consequential city in the country if not the world , attendance is pitiable where the american museum of natural history pulls in three million visitors a year , the historical society , sitting grandly right beside it on central park west , gets fewer than 150 , 000 as richard gilder , one trustee , lamented , you 'd think that many people would get lost wandering in from next door cyclically over the last couple of decades , cries of merger have risen to a crest , then crashed in meetings that went nowhere but questions about how best to channel the city s history are more pressing than ever three years after the fact , it is becoming clear that the attacks of sept 11 did not diminish the attractiveness of new york , and may in fact have burnished it nearly 38 million people visited the city last year , a record high and a 7 percent increase over the previous year , making it the second most visited destination in the country \( behind orlando , the home of disney world , and ahead of las vegas \) and history is a part of that , as suggested by the explosion of books about the city s past , the growth in the walking tour industry and the popularity of ric burns s documentary series on the subject given that interest , and given the chronically straitened finances of each of these three museums and the fact that the city is perennially forced to rescue one or another from the fiscal brink , is it time again to ask the merger question \? would it be more cost effective to pool resources \? could a single entity devoted to presenting new york s history become a mustvisit destination in a way that none of these institutions are \? and would a merged institution be a fitting response to the world trade center attack , one grand place that tells the whole story of new york , from dutch port to first national capital to lowercase world trade center \? of course there should be one museum for all of new york history , said betsy gotbaum , new york s public advocate , who ran the historical society from 1994 to 2001 of similar mind is mike wallace , coauthor of gotham a history of new york city to 1898 , who has labored in this regard more than anyone through the gotham center for new york history , the scholarly and education organization he founded in 2000 it s criminal that we do n't , as they say , capitalize on our history assets , he said but an attempt to place a coalition of new york history institutions at the future world trade center site failed , and there is no merger in the offing the grande dame of the three institutions , the historical society , has the prestige , attitude and location to take the lead role in refocusing the city s selfimage , but many people think that as a museum it has also been , historically , the lamest one problem is the historical society has always been burdened by its collection , the base of which is the leavings of generations of the city s wealthy residents how do you make a mission out of antique silverware \? the institution hit bottom in 1993 when , out of funds , it closed its doors it was subsequently given cpr and limped along for the next decade meanwhile , in 2002 the grand plan of the museum of the city of new york to vacate its undervisited outpost at 103rd street and fifth avenue and move into the tweed courthouse in lower manhattan was scotched by the change in city hall where mayor giuliani had promised the ornate building to the museum , which then spent years rebuilding its endowment in anticipation of the move , mayor bloomberg promptly axed the plan shortly after he took office the department of education later moved into the building in response , the museum s president , robert macdonald , resigned , and the place was in left in chaos the south street seaport , which over the last 37 years has built a unique home for itself on a historic piece of lower manhattan waterfront , has a more specialized focus the history of the port of new york while it has collections of artifacts , its most attentiongrabbing holdings are its nine historic ships the museum recently completed a 20 million renovation of its schermerhorn row home , but the attacks of sept 11 caused a 40 percent drop in visitors people have started coming back , but the sudden layoff in june of its waterfront curator and several other officials signaled serious trouble former staff members are whispering of ships rotting in the water and financial mismanagement lawrence huntington , chairman of the museum s board , acknowledges disorderly finances in the recent past , but insists the museum is on a new footing so those are three fairly sorry stories and yet , change is afoot most dramatic is the controversial rejuvenation of the historical society the story that has percolated in new york s history circles and beyond is of a rightwing takeover of its board of trustees by mr gilder and lewis e lehrman , businessmen with bigtime conservative associations \( mr gilder is former chairman of the manhattan institute , a conservative policy group mr lehrman has served on the boards of the manhattan institute and the american enterprise institute \) the two joined the board last year and brought with them new energy , great gobs of cash and their important collection of historical documents some in new york history circles are convinced that the museum will now look at history through neocon glasses others , however , note that the two men have supported a variety of history projects without the taint of bias for his part , mr gilder insisted that his motivation is a passion for history we want people to be excited about american history , he said the beginning of the new era at the historical society came two days ago , with the opening of the muchpublicized alexander hamilton exhibit at 5 million \( 2 million directly from mr gilder and mr lehrman \) , its price tag is 10 times that of anything the museum has ever mounted , and it heralds the historical society s newly refashioned mission to focus not on new york history but on national history as seen through the prism of new york portending the city s immigrant tradition , hamilton was born in the caribbean and emigrated to new york , which was his home as he fought in the revolution , served in washington s cabinet and founded the bank of new york and the american financial system for too long , the exhibit in effect argues , america s early history has been dominated by the founding fathers of virginia and new england hamilton represents new york s claim to be in that front rank some historians fear that the new national emphasis means that the historical society intends to back away from any focus on new york , and thus they consider the new direction a betrayal of the city but if carried through as advertised , the new focus could be exactly what the city needs the idea is to leverage the institution s pedigree and seize the historical moment the postsept 11 focus on new york to elevate both the historical society and its city in doing so , the historical society is ceding the five boroughs story to the museum of the city of new york , which allows for a complementary rather than a competing relationship i think new york is very much advantaged by having a museum that focuses on the history of the city , said louise mirrer , the new president of the historical society , referring to the museum of the city of new york but , and i'm going to sound arrogant here as a new yorker , new york occupies a privileged place in american history , and not to have in the forefront of its consciousness that specialness would shortchange visitors and residents if the rest of the country is unaware of that specialness , new york has only itself to blame the same triangle of real estate in lower manhattan on which the world trade center rose and which has long served as the nexus of global finance was the home of the original american melting pot and the first american congress lower manhattan alone could lay claim to the title of birthplace of america new york has never donned that mantle , but having a significant museum take on the new yorkasamerica mission would be a step in that direction it remains to be seen whether the historical society will do that , or whether it will become , as some fear , a conduit for a conservative , great men approach to history the hamilton show is inescapably in the great men tradition , focusing on a leader rather than ontheground stuff like gentrification , race , immigrant stories , poverty , aids this , some historians feel , is where the political fault lines run there s politics in picking subjects and presentational styles , dr wallace said it s in your silences as well as your emphases , your focus on some parts of the populace and not others , your opting for boosterish affirmation or critical but sympathetic understanding but dr mirrer maintains that the historical society will integrate the two approaches she is especially keen on a planned blockbuster on slavery that will be built around the logbook of a new yorkbased slave ship and the story of a girl who sailed on it this particular struggle has much to do with the selfimage of the historical society , whose trustees want it to become broader in scope and at the same time remain traditional and stately the other two history institutions , meanwhile , have taken a more ontheground approach the museum of the city of new york has a vigorous new president susan henshaw jones , formerly the head of the national building museum in washington who recently won a 139 million grant from the city for improvements far from trying to pretend it is n't in east harlem , the museum has mounted exhibits on the neighborhood , and ms jones has instituted a program of free admission for neighborhood residents more substantively , the museum is planning an expansion scheduled to be completed by 2010 , and as part of it , ms jones wants to create something that one of the history museums should have had long ago a permanent exhibit devoted to the whole history of new york martin mclaughlin , a trustee , said the decision by the historical society to go national helped the museum of the city of new york recommit itself to local outreach and to telling the story of the five boroughs for all its current troubles , the south street seaport has an even greater community presence and a sense of local mission its historic buildings and ships may obscure the fact that it has , over the 19 years that peter neill was its president \( he resigned in june but remains a museum official \) , reached the point where it devotes onethird of its budget to work in the city s schools it cofounded the new york harbor school , an alternative high school in bushwick it is the lead institution in the high school for history and communication , which just opened on the lower east side , where the mission is to weave history into every part of the curriculum it sponsors educational sailing programs for the disabled that connects us with the community in a way that makes us relevant beyond the value of heirlooms in the attic , mr neill said all of which is to say that if taking sides is what history ought to do , then in this case three sides are probably better than one a single monolithic history center might inevitably be seen as a politburo , molding history according to the whims of its donors different institutions mean a mix of methods let yourself dream a happy dream in which the lofty newyork historical society sits grandly on central park , unfurling big shows about the big new york , while the museum of the city of new york does the boroughs with gusto and the seaport sails into the schools it requires money , of course , which means having the government and others see new york s history not as a foster child but as a central resource that binds the city and pays back in all kinds of ways it also requires coordination and marketing focusing on three museums is only a conceit there are dozens of smaller , specialty history centers in the city , and some of them the tenement museum , the new york city police museum , federal hall , the ellis island immigration museum , the museum of jewish heritage , the museum of chinese in the americas , and others used postsept 11 funds to form a coalition , and are marketing themselves as the museums of lower manhattan what we came to realize was that all of our different stories are told best by their individual museums , and what s really needed is to market the idea of new york history , said carol willis , founder and director of the skyscraper museum you

the social democratic party of the german chancellor , gerhard schr der , was decisively defeated in local elections in hamburg on sunday , a result that was seen here as a strong sign of voter dissatisfaction with his government and its program of economic reform in the first of some 14 local elections scheduled to take place in germany over the course of the year , the main conservative opposition , the christian democratic union , gained some 20 percentage points from the last hamburg election three years ago , a result that should enable the christian democrats to govern the northern port city , germany s second largest , without any coalition partners the social democrats' result of just over 30 percent , down about six percentage points from the 2001 elections , was bad news for mr schr der , who , facing intense opposition within his party , stepped down as its chairman two weeks ago in favor of a more popular figure , franz m nterfering hamburg had been a virtual social democratic fief for more than 40 years , until it lost power in the 2001 elections to a conservative coalition mr schr der has bet his chancellorship on a set of economic reforms , called agenda 2010 , that he has fought all year to have passed by the german parliament he himself does not come up for reelection until 2006 , but the numerous local contests in the next several months are being seen as informal referendums on the reform program , which is seen as essential by most economic professionals but has failed to win popular support recent national polls show the social democrats getting only about a 25 percent approval rating , a low figure that seemed to be reflected in the sunday results in hamburg however , the situation in hamburg is complicated by several local factors so that the sunday results may not be an entirely accurate indicator of the national mood most important in hamburg was the presence on the scene of a small antiimmigrant , lawandorder party led by ronald schill that scored a major success in the 2001 elections in the election on sunday , mr schill s party , whose reputation has been tarnished by scandals in the past few months , failed to win the minimum 5 percent of the vote necessary for seats in the local legislative council but most of its former support seems to have gone to the christian democrats , and almost none to the social democrats , according to surveys of voters leaving the polls that were cited by german television the schill party served as a catalyst for earlier spd voters switching party loyalties , j rgen falter , a political scientist at the university of mainz , said in a telephone interview , using the party s german initials the spd failed to get those voters back , and that s bad news for it i think it will be very difficult in the next elections for the spd to win back its former support , mr falter said the slow decline of social democratic power in hamburg is not owing entirely to the unpopularity of mr schr der s reform program the city s mood has also been powerfully affected by increasing social problems , especially crime and drug addiction , factors that led to the momentary success of the schill party
shortly before 2 pm on monday , a handful of president bush s campaign aides huddled around two small speakers in a room that , with its shades drawn , was lit by the glow of 15 television monitors they were listening to the voice of senator john kerry none of the networks were carrying mr kerry s entire speech to a group of financial donors , mostly women , in boston that day but mr bush s operatives had somehow arranged for their own audio feed , they refused to say how , and were listening intently , ready to pounce on any opening for attack after sitting impatiently through what seemed to be a typical stump speech , they found one mr kerry said he was proud of votes by him and his running mate , senator john edwards , last fall against the president s requested 87 billion appropriation for troops in iraq and afghanistan it is a vote that republicans have used to make a case that mr kerry has been failing to support the troops after voting to authorize the war within an hour or so , mr bush s team , at the campaign s headquarters in a corporate office building in suburban virginia , across the potomac river from the white house , had sent a release via email to hundreds of journalists , supporters and campaign surrogates the email message included the new quote and one from september , when mr kerry implied it would be irresponsible to vote against such spending the quotation , along with the idea that mr kerry s position on the money had evolved , found its way onto fox news and into articles in the washington post , usa today , the new york times , the boston globe and the associated press and this was a relatively slow day in mr bush s war room several journalists who cover mr kerry later said they were too embarrassed to say publicly that it took the bush operatives to spot what was notable in mr kerry s remarks though far more technologically advanced , mr bush s war room was built in the mold of bill clinton s pioneering effort in 1992 , which combined campaign research and communications staff members to collect and disburse information to the news media , which are crucial in shaping perceptions and candidates , as quickly as possible that operation was rooted in defense , born of the democrats' vows to never again allow republican attacks to go unanswered the way they believed they did during the 1988 race between michael s dukakis and george bush mr bush s operation , however , is rooted more in offense , devised to seek out and exploit every possible opportunity to paint mr kerry as a political equivocator who switches positions on important issues when it suits his political interest as such , the war room is the nerve center of what democrats , and some presidential scholars , have called the most relentlessly negative reelection campaign in memory and what republicans say is a necessarily energetic drive to hold mr kerry to a record they say is rife with contradictions on a daily basis , the assembled republicans hope to pick new fights based on mr kerry s most recent statements , and those from his past the central tenet of mr bush s communications operation is on a sign on the office door of nicolle devenish , mr bush s campaign communications director , which says it s the hypocrisy , stupid , a play on the famous sign in mr clinton s 1992 war room , it s the economy , stupid when you run against an opponent who is both a committed liberal and a committed flipflopper , you have to have all that research about him all of the time , ms devenish said because he s going to go on the trail and say something ludicrous , like he did last week when he said 'i share your conservative values , ' and you need to rapidly provide reporters with evidence to the contrary in that case , after mr kerry told reporters in cloquet , minn , in early july , i actually represent the conservative values that they feel mr kerry has , at times , said he was referring to fiscal policy and health care costs when addressing the values debate mr bush s campaign responded with a list of examples that it says belie the notion that mr kerry does have conservative values , including votes against the death penalty and for higher taxes of course , mr kerry s campaign has a war room , as well and it has been credited with not only defending mr kerry from republican charges quickly but also taking the offensive , as it did recently against mr bush over high gasoline prices speaking of his bush campaign opponents , chad clanton , a spokesman in mr kerry s war room said tuesday , they 're doing an incredible job of trying to mop up after a failed administration that s made america less safe and less secure reporters who cover the campaigns say mr kerry s war room has grown competitive with that of mr bush , but only in recent weeks not distracted by primary opponents , mr bush s war room was well in place when mr kerry s campaign was still moving to more of a general election footing mr bush s campaign agreed to requests from two news organizations to observe the war room s activities for a day mr kerry s campaign denied the same request the visit , which lasted from 5 am to nearly 8 pm monday , provided an unusual glimpse into the bush campaign s daily efforts to discredit mr kerry the room has three long tables lined with computers most are staffed by college students or recent graduates who constantly monitor politically oriented web sites and watch the television monitors , which are regularly tuned to all of the major cable and financial news networks , the various cspan feeds and the major broadcast networks the core war room staff of eight begins its workday at 5 am but it is a 24hour operation , fueled by cocacola , coffee and slurpees overnight three to four interns watch the late news programs , the latenight comedy shows and the internet for any campaign news one critical overnight job is to collect the most important items from the morning newspapers another task is to seek any new clues in local papers about planned appearances by mr kerry , mr edwards or their prominent surrogates so that the campaign can plan to send its own friendly state representatives to speak against the kerry campaign the schedule , which is sent out to senior bush communications aides , is titled wildeyed watch the monday morning papers included no great revelations about mr kerry and his new running mate the schedule , as far as the war room staff could figure it , had mr kerry making appearances in boston and heading to orlando , fla , to address firemen and rescue workers on wednesday at a meeting of policy and communications aides , steve schmidt , mr bush s deputy communications director , directed his staff to plan a conference call for orlando reporters with representative adam h putman of florida , to criticize mr kerry on various votes noting that a fundraising concert for mr kerry featuring jackson browne was scheduled for monday night , mr schmidt instructed staff members who deal with reporters to remind them of the friday night fundraising concert for mr kerry at which whoopi goldberg used lewd jokes to deride mr bush , undercutting mr kerry s assertion of representing conservative values they 've probably got a trap door on the stage this time , mr schmidt said for all of the planning for action , and determination to show off its war room to the press , monday was shaping up as a very dry day mr kerry , it turned out , was not making his trip to orlando the white house was taking the lead on the front of daily battle as mr bush defended his rationale for war mr kerry s schedule was somewhat limited , which reduced the opportunities for material for the war room staff members after cnn featured a news segment about an iguana stuck in a tree , ms devenish declared it one of the slowest news days in memory the senior staff in the room seemed bored as interns clicked away on the internet but mr kerry s pronouncement that he was proud of the vote against the 87 billion appropriation gave the war room something to attack he was actually referring to mr edwards when he said i'm proud to say that john joined me in voting against that 87 billion when we knew the policy had to be changed after republicans sent an email message about the comment to their vast list of reporters , mr schmidt followed up with telephone calls to select reporters traveling with mr kerry to make sure they noticed it the news of the day , mr schmidt proclaimed in one phone call to a reporter , is an evolution on the 87 billion now john kerry said he was proud \( mr kerry s campaign argued that mr kerry has always stood by his vote and that the bush campaign was making something out of nothing particularly new \) on tuesday , mr bush s aides , while careful not to credit themselves for persuading reporters to jump on the quote , were clearly pleased that it popped up in many articles even so , they were not entirely satisfied mr schmidt said he would ask some of the campaign s surrogates to bring it up again during television appearances but in the end , surrogates were not necessary mr bush , apprised of the quote by campaign aides , brought it up in a speech in michigan on tuesday , saying , members of congress should not vote to send troops into battle and then vote against funding them and then brag about it that sound bite was featured prominently near the beginning of world news tonight on abc on tuesday the program s average , nightly audience far outreaches any single newspaper more than eight million people
this morning when i looked out my window , there was a moving van parked across the street well , i thought , they are finally leaving i did n't much mind if they , the neighbors who have lived across the street at least for the 16 years since i 'd been there , left or stayed my only lament , a bittersweet one , is that i never got to know who they were i could surmise a few things , though they owned a colonial like mine , and we shared a gardener who arrived promptly every wednesday afternoon we also had the same make of car , a 2000 honda crv , which i would occasionally see parked in their driveway only maybe it was n't their car , maybe it was their son s if they had a son the truth is , had i come face to face with my neighbors in the local wawa as i was filling my styrofoam cup with french vanilla blend , i probably would have paid no more attention than i do the rack of car magazines in the front of the store maybe less some people take issue with my desire to befriend , if not know , who my neighbors are who cares , they say , as long as they 're not exploding firecrackers in the backyard \? but sometimes living in a home in the suburbs of central jersey can feel as lonely as floating on an island in the south pacific when i moved here from staten island , i expected the same kind of easy camaraderie i had on our block of new homes there none of us would consider having a dinner party , bar mitzvah or wedding without inviting all the neighbors we never had block parties because we did n't need them each summer night we would emerge from our homes and congregate on beach chairs in front of someone s house as we shared recipes for melon soup or discussed the finer points of redwood deck building our children , though , enjoyed their habitat even more than we did crashing into one another as they rode along the sidewalks on their big wheels or lined up by the compact white jingling truck for italian ices gave them respite from annoying siblings and the regimen of homework and chores and if little johnny was to go astray , he might easily have been found sitting at tara s kitchen table or playing catch in sean s backyard the familial atmosphere was most appreciated , during a crisis when my 3yearold son sliced his pinky on a dishwasher rack , all i had to do was open the door and shout , and in minutes half a dozen neighbors were at my doorstep offering to drive us to the hospital or take care of my infant son if suddenly a pipe broke and water began spurting onto your kitchen counter , a neighbor would appear , wrench in hand , or if your dog got away and raced away , sniffing crocuses from house to house , tracking him became a relay race community electrical blackouts were transformed into barbecues , and snowstorms were occasions for group sledding and snowball fights not so in my current community , though i recall my first week after settling in i would wheel my youngest around the block in the stroller and then go for miles before i would see anyone except a solitary jogger or a stray crow swooping down to peck an errant garbage bag shortly afterward , we were surprised when the two children of the couple next door arrived at our doorstep carrying a tray of hanukkah cookies the next day , their mom showed up , praising my home , my children , even my outfit but she never returned not so much as a greeting when we passed each other in the supermarket in the years since i first arrived , i have made a few close friends in the neighborhood but for the most part , things are pretty much the same we continue to commute to work , park in our garages , and venture out only to retrieve the mail or a newspaper we have gardeners for the planting and hire kids to shovel our snow when a house alarm goes off , no one bothers to check it out or call the police there are no culprits to blame for the death of the neighborhood children grow up , parents work , and computers , cellphones , cars and planes make communicating with longdistance friends everyday fare but do we have to accept it \? last week , another for sale sign went up on the corner house , and it wo n't be long before someone else will be moving out that day , when i look out my window , they probably wo n't be waving but i will

basketball fans from the trinity school , one of new york city s elite private schools , chanted antisemitic slurs at a player from the rival dalton school at a recent game , taunting him with references to gefilte fish , yarmulkes and other jewish foods and customs the incident , at a game in the dalton gymnasium on friday last week , produced a storm of controversy , an investigation at trinity , an apology to the dalton parent who heard the remarks and complained and intensified classroom discussion at both schools a spokesman for trinity was unwilling to say whether or how the offending students would be disciplined but details of the incident are not in dispute the parent , whose letter to trinity s headmaster was widely distributed by email messages and web logs through private school circles in new york city , is shelly palmer , a television producer in manhattan he was attending the game with his 14yearold son , and because the gym was crowded , they were seated in the trinity section in both his letter to the headmaster , henry c moses , and a telephone interview yesterday , mr palmer said he was inflamed by the behavior of the small group of students and the failure of anyone to challenge them if they had been screaming about watermelon and collard greens , there would have been a race riot , mr palmer said why is it ok to be antisemitic \? it is n't , mr palmer said he was told by mr moses the headmaster called him first thing monday morning , after the letter had been handdelivered to trinity , which is on the upper west side mr moses assured him that he had taken the matter with utmost seriousness , was investigating and would take appropriate action this guy was caught in the headlights , and he did the right thing , mr palmer said that investigation was completed by week s end , said joel levy , the new york director of the antidefamation league , who has offered to conduct diversity training at both schools the results of the inquiry will not be made public , said kevin ramsey , a trinity official , because the students are minors and entitled to privacy mr ramsey said that the school would try to reinforce its commitment to an ethical education that teaches students the difference between right and wrong and how to choose to do what s right teachers have also been leading classroom discussions of the incident mr palmer said he agreed that trinity should keep the results of its investigation private and commended mr moses' quick and thoughtful response he and mr moses had also discussed one section of his letter , a broad indictment of trinity s culture , which in retrospect mr palmer said was intemperate and unfair i could have been more constructive , he said but i was angry as i 've ever been i was totally unprepared for this what skill set do i have to deal with something like this \? it s easy to be jewish in new york , or at least it was for me until last friday night mr palmer said that the chanting , focusing on a student with the surname goldberg , was led by two or three trinity students but endorsed by the snickering and giggles of perhaps two dozen more seated near them a few trinity parents were also in the section , he said , but none tried to rein in the unruly behavior then his son , whom mr palmer asked not be identified , decided to leave the arena as the snickering and taunts continued , mr palmer said , he tried to follow his son a trinity student blocked his path , and he said he swatted the boy out of his way as he left the gym , he said , he was approached by a security guard who asked , sir , did you lay your hands on a kid \? he told the story to the guard , who offered to summon school authorities mr ramsey , without challenging mr palmer s account , said the school would not discuss specifics mr palmer chose instead to go home and write his letter he said he has received more than 1 , 000 replies by email on a web log frequented by parents and students from both schools , some commend his actions , and others accuse him of megalomaniac delusions among those who contacted him , mr palmer said , was the mother of the student who was taunted she told him , he said , that her son had heard it all , but did not tell her until she asked about the incident in tears , mr palmer said , the mother thanked him for standing up for all of us
new york s ambitious effort to create a statewide wireless emergency communications system will not include any construction in the protected wilderness areas of the adirondacks and catskills , officials in the pataki administration said on thursday in detailing the project for the first time since awarding the 1 billion contract , the administration said that rather than building hundreds of towers in the mountains , as environmentalists had feared , the plan is for only a handful of towers to be erected in populated areas , and for repeaters , mounted on emergency vehicles , to be used to improve radio signals to give police , fire and other agencies across new york greater coordination in responding to disasters the contract , the largest technology pact in the state s history , has generated sharp criticism from environmentalists worried about the project s impact on pristine areas , and it has also drawn scrutiny from lawmakers and others who denounce what they see as a lack of openness about bidding process yesterday , the pataki administration moved to allay fears about the project , describing it as a pilot program that can be ended at any time the administration announced the awarding of the contract on friday to a subsidiary of tyco international that company , m acom , was represented by former senator alfonse m d'amato in its efforts to secure the work democratic lawmakers , led by assemblywoman roann m destito , from the utica area , have called for hearings into the awarding of the contract the state comptroller , alan g hevesi , a democrat , is looking into the matter the assembly , with a majority of democrats , and the republicancontrolled senate have called for a joint conference committee , a relatively rare event in albany , to try and formulate a reform package that would require the disclosure of costs and expenses incurred while lobbying for contracts with state agencies and authorities a pataki administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said an outside firm looked at the integrity of the process and found that the state had taken every precaution to be sure the contract was awarded properly in describing the effort as a pilot program , two administration officials were careful to say that they viewed the deal in its early stages where the technology could be tested in one section of the state for roughly a year before any longterm commitment is made we can pull the plug any time , said one of the officials , insisting on anonymity because negotiations to complete the deal are still under way those negotiations could take as long as six months it could be two years before the pilot program is completed and three years after that before any kind of system is put into place , according to the administration the awarding of the contract comes more than eight years after the pataki administration initially envisioned the system , three years after it began drawing up details of what it wanted and more than a year after the two companies bidding on the project submitted their proposals democrats , republicans and police union officials have all said new york needs to update its antiquated state police communications system it is an old , outdated system , said daniel m defedericis , president of the police benevolent association of the new york state troopers inc the system is limping along with remnant radio parts from the 1960 s mr defedericis and other union officials said that in 2001 , in ogdensburg , ny , a state trooper had to leave the side of an investigator , who had been shot in the stomach with a rifle and was bleeding , because his handheld radio did not work and he could not call for help from the scene the investigator lived we 've had some awfully close calls because the radio system fails to reach the entire patrol area , mr defedericis said republicans who support a statewide wireless network have also been critical over delays in getting the project moving given the lessons of 9 11 and the urgency of the issue , i am very frustrated it has taken this long to get the program to the point of the initial stages , said state senator michael al balboni , a republican from long island and a leading proponent of enhancing the state s domestic security apparatus in fact , as far back as 1998 , the pataki administration had reached a tentative deal to engage in a partnership with motorola to develop a hybrid system that would have built a few towers in the adirondacks and catskills , limiting the coverage in those areas but avoiding significant environmental damage shortly after reaching that tentative deal , the state comptroller at the time , h carl mccall who was preparing for a run against gov george e pataki voiced concern about the deal the pataki administration decided that instead of challenging him , they would open the contract up for bidding an administration official said the process had taken so long because officials wanted to ensure that new york had the best system after sept 11 , that took on added urgency the proposals , offered by the tyco subsidiary , m acom , and motorola , were so different in what they said the job would cost with tyco s bid for the 20year contract coming in at roughly 1 billion and motorola s bid costing roughly 3 billion that many observers , republicans and democrats alike , wondered how such disparate bids could each satisfy the state s requirements critics of the deal pointed to pennsylvania , where tyco , a company based in bermuda , has the contract to build a similar system that is already three years late it also has cost more than double what the company said it would in its bid the tyco subsidiary s winning bid in new york is roughly three times more expensive than what any other state in the country is spending to install a similar system in offering new details of the project on thursday , a pataki administration official said new york could achieve its goal to cover 95 percent of the state s geographic area , and 97 percent of its roadways , with as few as four towers built in the adirondacks and the catskills and none in protected areas , sharply fewer than the 400 towers that motorola , the company competing for the project , had proposed administration officials said the different approach to building new towers was the major reason for the vast difference in the cost of the bids an official at motorola , which is examining its options and might appeal the state s decision , as well as several democratic lawmakers , said they believed the state had been very specific in what it required of the bidders and that the tyco bid did not meet the requirements but since no one has seen the full details of the tyco proposal , they were relying on public statements and sketchy details that have leaked out in the state s own specifications , which are available at the state office for technology web site , there are 300 pages of very specific requirements for instance , while an administration official said telephone poles would be used to locate equipment , the state specifications seem to require that the poles be metal in addition , the state specifications call for 2 , 000gallon propane tanks to provide a backup power supply and bulletproof shelters at the base of transmitter sites it remains unclear how the tyco plan meets these requirements in the tyco proposal , repeaters are an essential element in avoiding the construction of towers repeaters are used throughout the country as a standard way of giving greater amplification to the transmissions of handheld radios but the technology is not foolproof for instance , firefighters in the world trade center who responded to the sept 11 attack had communication problems despite the fact that a repeater in a fire chief s car had been turned on some law enforcement officials are puzzled over how the state came to its decision we 've had a real positive relationship with motorola for a number of years they 've served a lot of police departments around the state very , very well , said john grebert , assistant director of the new york state association of chiefs of police inc but as far as what made the state finally decide to go with tyco or m acom , i really do n't know that
kiev , ukraine , nov 24 the government of ukraine on wednesday ignored reports of widespread government fraud in sunday s election and certified the current prime minister as presidentelect , moves secretary of state colin l powell swiftly condemned with unrest growing on the streets here , the declared loser called for a general strike and a new election if the ukrainian government does not act immediately and responsibly , there will be consequences for our relationship , for ukraine s hopes for a euroatlantic integration and for individuals responsible for perpetrating fraud , mr powell said in washington we cannot accept this result as legitimate page a14 the decision by president leonid d kuchma to ratify the results intensified the marked differences between ukraine s rulers and the emboldened opposition , whose supporters stood in a huge rally near this capital s center , saying they would continue to resist what they regard as an election stolen by the government s hand both sides warned that the possibility of violence was real kiev was electric with energy on wednesday , and even at the moment of mr kuchma s assertive step , its risks and the depths of opposition against it were evident at a tumultuous meeting of the central election commission , the government declared prime minister viktor f yanukovich the winner of the presidential runoff , giving him 4946 of the vote to 4661 percent for viktor a yushchenko people in the chamber heckled the reading of the results riot policemen were stationed outside behind a defensive ring of sandfilled dump trucks , as were busloads of men from donetsk , the eastern ukrainian region that much of the ruling class comes from the newly arrived men waved the blue flags of the yanukovich campaign and warned away opposition supporters with menacing sneers , and in at least one case , threats after mr yushchenko was declared the loser , he called for national civil disobedience in this country of 48 million , one of the bridges between russia and the rest of europe , a test of political wills moved toward the possibility of confrontation it was mr yushchenko s second impassioned appearance of the day earlier , he called on the army and the police to ignore orders to put down the demonstrations by force you know what is the real choice of the people , you know the evil that is being made before your eyes , you know that the law is being violated , he told the police you are responsible for maintaining the order do n't turn the weapons against the people ! mr kuchma , in a television appearance , mentioned a risk of civil war western election observers and leaders have been unequivocally critical of sunday s election , citing extensive documentation of organized fraud and the abuse of state powers to assist the prime minister , who was personally chosen by mr kuchma to be his successor the white house and european leaders had publicly called for mr kuchma to refrain from validating the results without ensuring the election was fair the government s spokespeople were alternately conciliatory and inflammatory sergei tihipko , mr yanukovich s campaign manager , said the presidentelect would be willing to talk with mr yushchenko about government restructuring we can give certain guarantees , he said we can conduct political reform , reducing the rights of the president and giving more power to the parliament oleksandra kuzhel , a yanukovich aide who serves as a liaison to businesses , took a confrontational stance , saying calls from washington were unwelcome and irrelevant in ukrainian politics i would like very much to see john kerry as the us president , she said but this does not mean i will call on the united states to make this so she dismissed american threats as insignificant , saying aid from washington to ukraine was not large enough to be much missed although mr kuchma s government was able to muster a quorum at the election commission and force through its result , much remained uncertain on wednesday kiev remained crowded with thousands of thusfar peaceful demonstrators , and wednesday afternoon , realizing that the government would ignore his calls for investigations , mr yushchenko moved preemptively , appearing on stage in independence square each day since sunday , the yushchenko cause has drawn more people the crowd on wednesday was the largest yet in front of mr yushchenko was a sea of rapt people waving orange banners that symbolize his campaign if you could see yourselves from this spot , you would realize how beautiful you are , how strong you are , he began , and then told them they were on the cusp of history , that already a wall had been torn down it was the wall between dictatorship and democracy he called for another election , but with stricter rules to prevent abuse he asked the demonstrators to remain in place until they prevailed later , yulia tymoshenko , a member of parliament supporting the opposition , issued instructions through the public address system for mass civil disobedience , calling the square the opposition s beachhead and saying the demonstrators should under no circumstances give it up mr yushchenko had other options for putting pressure on the government , although none were immediately promising mr kuchma s staff noted mr yushchenko could challenge the results in ukraine s supreme court , but his prospects before the judiciary seemed poor a senior western diplomat in kiev on tuesday described the court s record as dismal the leader of ukraine s communist party , petro m symonenko , said wednesday that the elections should be declared invalid and power passed to parliament mr symonenko had not previously taken sides , and his apparent allegiance to the opposition could give mr yushchenko s coalition in parliament a quorum to call a session challenging the vote but this possibility was leavened by the realization at yushchenko headquarters that two communists on the election commission signed the official election results , siding with mr kuchma and suggesting that communist ranks were split moreover , mr yushchenko s campaign said that once the results were declared official , a challenge by parliament would be only symbolic as the standoff continued , one of its larger meanings emerged in clear relief , with russia and the rest of europe diverging sharply in reaction mr yanukovich had campaigned in part on strengthening ties with russia , and mr yushchenko in part on broadening ukraine s european connections westward this shorthand , coupled with the evidence that organized fraud may have tilted the race , was reinforced as international reaction broke into distinct camps russia s lower house of parliament unanimously passed a resolution condemning mr yushchenko s supporters , calling the election legitimate , and throwing lawmakers' support , like that of president vladimir v putin , behind mr yanukovich leading european officials put pressure on ukraine for a recount or investigation of mr yushchenko s charges jos manuel barroso of portugal , president of the european commission , the european union s executive body , warned of unspecified consequences if there were not a serious , objective review , according to the associated press chancellor gerhard schr der of germany , who maintains warm relations with mr putin , told the german parliament that he agreed with the organization for security and cooperation in europe , which led one of the observer missions here , that massive electoral fraud took place poland s foreign minister , wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , called for a recount the european union s foreign policy chief , javier solana , said , we will not accept elections that are fraudulent lech walesa , the former polish president and solidarity leader , said he was prepared to travel to ukraine to support the opposition s claim to power , referring to the president of ukraine , viktor yushchenko with signs of western disapproval accumulating and the possibility of violence looming , the kuchma and yanukovich staffs said the government had no plans to break relations with the rest of europe ukraine cannot disappear from the central part of europe , said sergei l vasilyev , the head of mr kuchma s information department the west will have to learn to come to terms of agreement with the new president another outcome , violence , seemed a clear possibility outside the central election commission , where riot policemen watched over the crowd , a knot of young yanukovich supporters taunted a middleaged opposition supporter one large young man tapped his finger against the older man s chest , telling him to leave you better take care , vadim

'van helsing' stephen sommers s all but unwatchable van helsing serves best as a cautionary fable about what happens when computergenerated imagery is allowed to run riot over basic story concerns bringing together frankenstein s monster , dracula and the wolf man for the first time since abbott and costello meet frankenstein \( 1948 \) , mr sommers confronts them with a radically reinterpreted version of professor abraham van helsing , dracula s nemesis in bram stoker s original novel he is no longer a fussy academic , but a swashbuckling hero with rockstar hair and anachronistic martial arts skills played by hugh jackman teamed with the transylvanian aristocrat anna valerious \( england s kate beckinsale , doing a passable impression of eva gabor \) , van helsing confronts completely redesigned versions of universal s horror superstars , among them richard roxburgh \( the evil duke of moulin rouge \) as a dracula with far more powers than bela lugosi ever dreamed of , including a digitally enhanced ability to calmly walk up walls and across ceilings but he has none of lugosi s dark , festering eroticism there s hardly a shot that has n't been improved with excessive digital detailing , reducing the whole 160 million enterprise to a kind of visual slush the dvd , from universal studios home video , is packed with pointless extras , like the first level of the van helsing xbox computer game and an interactive tour of dracula s castle 2004 2998 pg13 the universal monster legacy collection the best thing about van helsing is that it prompted universal to release fine anthology editions of the studio s classic horror films the five frankenstein films have already been released on a doubledisc set , as have the studio s four wolf man pictures and five dracula films a new batch of box sets , timed to bolster van helsing dvd sales , includes the five mummy films , five invisible man features and the three feature outings of the latearriving creature from the black lagoon while universal has made some compromises in visual quality to pack so many films on so few discs , the source material on these most recent three releases is quite extraordinary , probably because the original negatives have been less battered by years of use \( every great film , in this fragile medium , eventually becomes the victim of its own popularity \) karl freund s 1933 version of the mummy , the film that gave mr sommers s career a boost when he remade it in 1999 , may be the most satisfying of the lot , a wonderfully atmospheric chiller directed by the greatest cinematographer of the german expressionist cinema cinephiles may also be intrigued by the invisible man returns , a formally stunning 1940 feature that was one of the few hollywood films completed by joe may , another german migr who was considered a peer of lang and murnau in the 1920 s the new collections include supplementary material from some of the leading scholars in the horror field , including david j skal , rudy behlmer and tom weaver 2998 each not rated 'eyes without a face' for all of france s filmmaking prowess , the country has produced few horror films of lasting value , perhaps because the country s strictly cartesian , rationalist culture automatically rejects the irrational and unseen the great exception is georges franju s eyes without a face \( 1959 \) , a

lawyers representing general electric made a stinging attack on the european commission on thursday during an appeal of the commission s veto of general electric s 43 billion acquisition of the avionics company honeywell in 2001 that deal will not be revived even if general electric s legal team persuades the court of first instance in luxembourg to annul the threeyearold order ge and honeywell are appealing the ruling in order to clarify european law on mergers for the commission , however , thursday s appeal was anything but academic two years ago , the commission suffered a string of defeats during appeals of merger decisions , but none of those was as damaging to its authority as a defeat in the ge appeal would be , said one commission competition official who worked on the case three years ago for us , the stakes are extremely high , he said , on condition of anonymity the lead lawyer for general electric , nicholas green of the londonbased firm brick court chambers , said , the commission hid evidence , ignored warnings from its own economist about the strength of its case , and changed its arguments at every stage of the merger review cherie blair , the wife of prime minister tony blair of britain , is part of the company s legal team mr green said that the commission had failed to make public 14 letters , mostly from ge customers like airlines and aircraft makers , which informed the commission that the deal did not pose serious problems to competition the letters were submitted to the court this month , and mr green said the commission s disregard of evidence was cavalier the commission admitted it was wrong not to submit the letters to ge lawyers earlier , and the commission s senior lawyer , richard lyal , said that withholding the letters was regrettable but mr lyal played down the importance of the letters , saying they did not undermine the commission s arguments referring to one sent to the commission by airbus , mr lyal said airbus was not concerned about the effects of a merger between ge and honeywell because it was confident it could secure remedies to undo any anticompetitive effects of the deal airbus had addressed the letter to europe s competition commissioner , mario monti , according to francisco enrique gonz lez d az , who led the team of merger regulators in the ge case and now works in the brussels office of cleary , gottlieb , steen hamilton the letter was passed on to the competition department , mr gonz lez said during a break in the proceedings it was misclassified as an internal letter rockwell collins , which , like honeywell , makes electronic systems for aircraft , intervened on the commission s behalf at the hearing to help counter ge s criticism of the commission s handling of the evidence its senior lawyer , trevor soames of the brussels office of howrey simon arnold white , said that most of the letters were almost identical , implying that ge had pressured airlines to submit the letters in order to sway the european commission s decision the correspondences all seem to be written by the same hand , he said , adding , is this the sort of empirical evidence the european commission should rely on \? it was harder for the commission to shrug off criticism that its own economist had doubts about vetoing the merger prof xavier vives , a spanish economist and teacher at insead , the business school outside paris , was hired as a consultant by the commission while the competition department was drafting its ruling on the gehoneywell case he was asked to examine the commission s use of bundling theory in its argument to justify prohibiting the deal the bundling theory lies at heart of the commission s decision and ge s appeal commission lawyers and lawyers for rockwell and the aircraft engine maker rollsroyce made an energetic defense of the argument that ge would be able to shut out competitors by bundling its aircraft engines with honeywell s inflight electronics systems according to mr green , professor vives had at the time concluded that in the shortterm the merger could even foster competition the merged entity could spur the rate of innovation in the industry all indicators point to a procompetitive effect , provided no competitor is pushed out of the market , mr green quoted professor vives as saying professor vives was not present at thursday s hearing an independent economist employed by the commission said the commission had not done its homework , mr green said the commission s lawyers tried to play down the importance of professor vives s opinion , expressed in email messages to the competition department during the months before the ruling was issued mr lyal said any disagreements between professor vives and the team handling the merger investigation were of no real relevance , as differences of opinion are common he said the bundling model professor vives had commented on was later dropped as a central part of the commission s argument professor vives was examining the deal using a bundling model that takes a snapshot of a market at a specific point in time this mode often described as static or shortterm was replaced by a different economic model that tries to estimate the longerterm effects when a company bundles different products into a discounted package mr vives did what he was asked to do , but we moved on from the static model he used to a dynamic view of the market , mr lyal said lawyers for the commission , rockwell and rollsroyce also told the judges of the court of first instance that ge s aircraft leasing division , gecas , had already been exerting pressure on aircraft buyers to equip their fleets with gehoneywell components gecas is the single biggest buyer of aircraft in the world , lawyers for rollsroyce said gecas s stated policy is to buy only planes equipped with ge engines , said andrew renshaw , a lawyer representing rockwell it is hard for an aircraft maker to resist a bundled ge offer when gecas may be a client carl shapiro from the university of california at berkeley , who was helping ge s lawyers , said that the commission wrongly interpreted discounting on ge engines as something that would shut out rivals ge engines have been heavily discounted for over a decade , he said , adding , that s competition

the setting is s o paulo s reallife house of detention , which was torn down in 2002 , a decade after a riot led to the massacre of 111 inmates by the police the film is a splashy return to form by the celebrated director of pixote and kiss of the spider woman in examining social ills , it interweaves multiple stories of the prisoners' lives as viewed by a doctor volunteering his services below

house where michele and his friends play daredevil games filippo turns out to have been kidnapped even after michele s father \( mr abbrescia \) is revealed to be one of the kidnappers and the boy s

charming new comedy is a version of the heartofdarkness teenage social comedy heathers for the tweener audience it has the ambitious and cartoony dark side of a disney channel sitcom , with a lively and talented young cast the saturday night live writer and performer tina fey wrote the script and gives the material a stylized vitality but the film does add a beyourself finale that this picture does n't quite seem to buy it s the kind of bored manipulation you come to expect from the plastics , the pack of hallwayshrewd and glamorous teenage queens who use subtle terror to rule the high

duk and kim young min written edited and directed by kim ki duk \( r , 103 minutes in korean , with english subtitles \) like blake s songs of innocence and experience , this buddhist fable has a lyrical simplicity that masks its deep insight into human experience filmed at a mountain lake in a south korean nature preserve , it follows an elderly monk and his young acolyte through the stages of the life cycle and the seasons of the calendar the placid surface of mr kim s lovely film is disturbed by eruptions of intense emotion , occasionally verging on melodrama , and by an intrusive soundtrack but the film , with its moments of sharp humor \( and the beguiling appearances of a white cat , a wry turtle and a quizzical rooster \) , is both sensual and austere , an exercise in spiritual discipline that sharpens your perception of human nature and the natural world \( scott \) strayed , starring emmanuelle b art and gaspard ulleil directed by andr t chin \( not rated , 95 minutes in french , with english subtitles \) this taut , swift wartime drama , set in the early days of the german occupation of france , begins with a montage of devastating blackandwhite news clips

a german air strike leaves the family car a burnedout shell , a boyish young stranger \( mr ulleil \) guides them into the woods where they find refuge in a grand abandoned house the movie plays multiple variations on the theme of initiation , as the foursome improvises a structured family life and delicately lays out fundamental conflicts between survivalist and bourgeois perspectives between wartime and peacetime expectations between habitually clinging to family values and fending for yourself until their precarious idyll is finally interrupted , each of the four is forced to stretch and grow up in uncomfortable ways \( holden \) super size me , directed by morgan spurlock \( not rated , 96 minutes \) for 30 days , mr spurlock consumed nothing but food from mcdonald s , an experiment in bad living that frames a jaunty critique of junk gastronomy and corporate power like a thinner , less aggressive michael moore , the director talks to consumers , experts and foodindustry flacks , weaving alarming statistics about rampant obesity with visits to the doctor and doublequarterpounderwithcheese combo meals the film is an entertaining statement of the obvious , though its big questions do corporations serve our need or enslave our bodies and souls \? are public health problems caused by capitalist rapacity or personal choice \? are not as simple as mr spurlock would have us believe \( scott \) 13 going on 30 , starring jennifer garner and mark ruffalo directed by gary winick \( pg13 , 97 minutes \) this film is essentially a retread of big what keeps the picture going is mr winick s love for actors and his refusal to judge them by the characters they play this directorial generosity , some songs from the toddler days of mtv and a few other fillips of cleareyed charm go a long way toward making up for the tiredness of the concept , a kid magically leapfrogging into the body of an adult in this case it s 13yearold jenna \( christa b allen \) , suffering through a miserable failure of a birthday when some magic dust that a friend gives her lands on her hair , she awakens from a nap as a 30yearold version of herself \( ms garner \) the obvious laughs are wrung from the contrast of an inexperienced child in a mature body as jenna bobs through a world in which the supposed adults turn out to be more childish than she is the performances give the movie more flavor and life than the situation , which often feels like prechewed bubble yum \( mitchell \) troy , starring brad pitt , eric bana and orlando bloom directed by wolfgang petersen \( r , 140 minutes \) all the talk of glory and immortality is a clear signal that this big , expensive , intermittently campy example of hollywood homerism is desperate to be regarded as a classic it is n't , but it s not so bad either yes , the score is dreadful and the dialogue sometimes painfully obvious , but mr petersen and the screenwriter david benioff take the ancient world and its notions of war seriously mr pitt , in spite of an odd pseudoenglish accent \( perhaps adopted in deference to the mostly british and australian cast \) , plays achilles with wit and charisma , turning the character into a kind of existentialist warrior rock star mr bana , as achilles s trojan counterpart and nemesis , hector , has a brooding sensitivity that contrasts with mr

the most animated presence in the prim , pretty new production of fiddler on the roof , which opened last night at the minskoff theater , may well be its title character no , not the fiddler the roof for david leveaux s handsomely mounted , antiseptically acted revival of this beloved folk musical , which stars a heartbreakingly uneasy alfred molina , the designer tom pye has created what looks like a freefloating roof to hover over the set an attractively weatherworn piece of architecture , this roof moves in mysterious ways , ascending and descending throughout the evening , sometimes to distinguish between interior and exterior scenes , sometimes for no obvious reason it has a willful personality all its own that s more than can be said for the show s performers , a goodlooking , lithebodied and generally anonymous lot portraying jewish villagers \( and a few cossacks \) in a russian village in 1905 , the ensemble members go through their paces of song , dance and yiddish humor with a bland , dutiful cheer that rarely turns into anything more robust should the entertainment enterpreneurs of branson , mo , ever come up with a pavilion called shtetl land , this is what it would be like even before it opened , this revival of fiddler , the show that launched a thousand theater parties when it was first produced on broadway in 1964 , was generating public debate in an essay in the los angeles times on feb 15 , when the show was still in previews , the novelist thane rosenbaum wrote that mr leveaux s production was marked by an absence of jewish soul by that time a nickname for the revival had already started circulating among theater insiders goyim on the roof being a goy myself , i wo n't try to assess the jewish authenticity of this fiddler the theater lover in me , however , is baffled by the production s lack of gusto , earthiness , warmth and to use mr rosenbaum s word soul of any kind an aura of enervation starts at the top of the cast , with mr molina s apologetic performance as tevye the milkman , and penetrates like a paralyzing fog into even the smallest roles from watching the show at the minskoff , it is still possible to understand why fiddler became the mammoth hit that it did , racking up 3 , 242 performances in its original run \( starring the inimitable zero mostel \) it also triumphed as a hit movie musical \( starring the israeli actor topol \) , a rarity in the 1970 s the show has been given two fullscale new york revivals , while living on and on in touring and community theater productions the world over under the musical direction of kevin stites \( with don walker s original orchestrations supplemented by larry hochman \) , jerry bock s score still registers as a tasty , sticky pudding of corn , syrup , eastern european inflections and broadway razzmatazz , with homespun , clunky lyrics by sheldon harnick \( anyone who hears if i were a rich man or sunrise , sunset is fated to live with these songs in his head until he dies \) and the onstage orchestra sounds swell you can also sense the craftsmanship behind joseph stein s smartly structured book , adapted from stories by sholom aleichem , which depicts the changing world of tevye his wife , golde \( randy graff \) and their daughters in the era of pogroms in prerevolutionary russia the plot combines the domestic appeal of the matchmaking machinations of a yiddishstyle pride and prejudice with an elegy to a picturesque way of life on the edge of extinction but as even the big famous set pieces first choreographed by jerome robbins \( also the original director of fiddler \) and reenvisioned here by jonathan butterell parade before you , they never ignite everyone s in the right places , making the right movements and thanks to mr pye \( sets \) , vicki mortimer \( costumes \) and brian macdevitt \( lighting \) , everything looks gorgeous , right down to those covetable lanterns that hang overhead and the autumnleavesstrewn stage , which suddenly tilts forward for a lavish midsummer night s dreamstyle fantasy sequence what s lacking is the human passion and idiosyncrasy that would set fire to all this theatrical tinder mr leveaux , who scored a hit last season with his tonywinning revival of nine , is an elegant contrarian give him a cool , cerebral play by tom stoppard \( the real thing , the broadwaybound revival of jumpers \) , and he finds the warmth , joy and pain at its center give him a warm , joy and painfilled musical like fiddler , and he transforms it into something perversely cool he has achieved this metamorphosis in large part through dogged miscasting mr molina is the terrific actor who played diego rivera in the movie frida and was the best thing about the broadway production of yasmina reza s art but none of his natural charisma or combustibility comes across here whether chatting with god , bickering with his wife or dancing at his daughter s wedding , this tevye does nothing wholeheartedly there s a wary restraint about this performance , as if mr molina were afraid he might embarrass himself if he ever cut loose in selling a song or a joke but then nearly all the cast members deliver their lines and songs as they might have in a cold reading , delivered by seasoned professionals who had yet to add the shading and tics that define original character only john cariani , as the young schlemiel of a tailor , tries for boldly individual portraiture but his frantic gestures and stylized slump have a mechanical quality that jolts in this production as the three eldest of tevye s daughters , each of whom falls rebelliously in love with an unsuitable man , sally murphy , laura michelle kelly and tricia paoluccio have lovely interchangeable faces and lovely voices any of them would be perfect in a more conventional ing nue role , say liesl in the sound of music their suitors are portrayed by the dashing robert petkoff , as a revolutionary , and the gq coverworthy david ayers , as a renegade gentile , as well as by the manic mr cariani nancy opel , a lastminute replacement for barbara barrie , is an oddly youthful and welldressed yente the matchmaker \( a role created by beatrice arthur \) ms graff , a popular stalwart of new york theater , has never looked more attractive than she does as the hardworking , scolding , fretting golde with her head scarf bringing out her fine bone structure , she suggests a fashion editor who has discovered peasant chic and she sings with sweetness and clarity a jewish earth mother , however , she definitely is not it s hard to figure out exactly what mr leveaux thought he was up to with this subdued interpretation maybe he was just trying to avoid the usual stereotypes and give fiddler a more universal appeal but to make its characters , starting with tevye , genteel \( never mind gentile \) folk who avoid selfdramatization is to deprive the show of the zest that makes it spin in this fiddler , when tevye and his friends break out with the drinking song to life , you can only wonder at the absence of the life force they raise their glasses to fiddler on the roof based on the sholom

in the struggle over samesex marriage in new york , smalltown mayors suddenly emerged last week as the unlikely protagonists , becoming engines for social and political change the actions of mayors in places like new paltz and nyack fed the debate and helped trigger a declaration by the attorney general that gays and lesbians were not permitted to wed under current state law while the overwhelming majority of the state s more than 600 mayors may have watched the tempest from the sidelines , the latest developments forced them to engage in their own soulsearching even those with few gay constituents were considering the implications of their power to solemnize marriages in a quickly shifting landscape of sexual politics that landscape expanded yesterday into new jersey , where the deputy mayor of asbury park married a gay couple who had been issued a license by the town clerk s office in a sampling of opinion of mayors from a bedroom community in westchester county to a hardscrabble southern tier city , most seemed relieved at the determination by attorney general eliot spitzer , saying it took the onus off them to wade into a contentious issue only one , the mayor of buffalo , said he had recently been asked to perform marriages for samesex couples like private citizens everywhere , their views ranged widely on whether gay marriage should be legalized in new york and their willingness to wed samesex couples if the law were to change did not always adhere to party stereotypes the mayor of oswego , a republican , said he would most likely preside over such ceremonies , despite his support of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage the mayor of elmira , a democrat , said he would not none seemed interested in following the path of jason west , the new paltz mayor now facing misdemeanor charges for solemnizing the marriages of 25 samesex couples in late february but even those elected officials who are supportive of samesex unions differed sharply on mr west s defiance of the law they 're pushing the envelope , and god bless them , said jeremy wilber , the supervisor of the arty , leftleaning town of woodstock he was referring to mr west and also the mayor of nyack , john shields , an openly gay retired schoolteacher who pledged to sue the state after being denied a marriage license on thursday somebody had to sit at that counter in the late 1950 s and 60 s and push that envelope , added mr wilber , who , as a supervisor in new york , the top elected official in a town , is allowed to perform weddings only with the town board s permission anthony m masiello , the mayor of buffalo , is a defender of samesex unions yet he said he believed that mr west s acts of civil disobedience also had the potential to disrupt personal lives i'm not going to break any laws or create chaos by illegally marrying people , said mr masiello , who has had a handful of inquiries from samesex couples why create a false sense of legality \? that s counterproductive still others , like brian d monahan of dobbs ferry in westchester , said constituents expected mayors to stay focused on the nuts and bolts of municipal life i do n't think it s right to use an office that you 've been elected to as a podium for your position on a national issue , he said i'm elected to deal with issues about parking and traffic and zoning , and i do that last week in ithaca , the mayor , carolyn k peterson , a democrat , announced that the city would accept marriage applications by samesex couples and forward them to the state department of health in doing so , she said , she would force the issue into the courts with the rapid pace of developments around the nation , it may not be long before mayors in new york must decide whether to say i do when approached by samesex partners wishing to become spouses some mayors , like stephen m hughes , a democrat of elmira , a city with a population of 30 , 000 , appear confident that their positions reflect those of their communities mr hughes is staunchly opposed to any form of gay union , be it a domestic partnership or marriage he said he did not receive a single angry phone call after he explained his opposition to gay marriage on a local television station the response that i 've received has been overwhelmingly supportive , he said if the law does change , mr hughes said , he is considering his own brand of civil disobedience not only would he refuse to preside over any samesex weddings , but he would also urge the city not to issue marriage licenses to gay partners it would be my position that we would fight that with every fiber of our being here locally , he said in some cases , a mayor s set of political beliefs would seem to contradict his approach as mayor for example , john j gosek , a republican and the mayor of oswego , a city on lake ontario , said that while he supported president bush s call for a constitutional ban , he would nonetheless marry samesex couples if such unions became legal in new york i 've done more than 20 marriages in four years for strangers , members of the military , he said i certainly would n't turn them down if it was legal it s part of the job mr gosek said he doubted residents would object we 're facing jobcreation issues and budget problems , he said i really , truly do n't think it s an issue here in rochester , mayor william a johnson jr , a democrat , said he felt conflicted after considering the issue on one hand , he said he is an old southern baptist , raised to believe that marriage is between a man and a woman at the same time , mr johnson , who is black , cannot help viewing the push for gay marriage through the lens of blacks' struggle for civil rights it takes a while for your gut to catch up with your head , and that s what s happening for a lot of us , he said perhaps no mayor in the state was feeling as torn as daniel stewart , the openly gay and republican leader of plattsburgh , a small city near the canadian border mr stewart had advised president bush on gay issues during his campaign for the white house , urging him not to turn back the clock on the progress made under president bill clinton a few years ago , mayor stewart advocated a form of civil union rather than traditional marriage for gay couples but after presiding over the marriages of more than 40 heterosexual couples , he said he has changed his mind watching the smiles , the happiness , the excitement , you go home , look at your partner and say , 'we 're not getting the same rights , he said i 've had an ideological change
the parents of a 16yearold identified as a long island couple navigated onto the set of the oprah winfrey show recently to impart their wisdom to viewers the topic of the day was teenagers and alcohol if their teenager wants to have a keg party at the house , it s ok by them , they explained , arguing that since the child is going to drink anyway , it s better for her and 50 of her friends to get toasted in the safety and comfort of home than elsewhere this explanation was greeted with blank stares from the studio audience but sensing approval , the couple continued , adding that under their watchful eyes none of the guests are allowed to drive away on such occasions , they said , the youngsters tend to sleep over at their house en masse you mean they pass out ! i hollered at the television screen i had become mad mom what message are you sending those children \? i shouted at an oblivious oprah oh , sure , the kids gotta have their beer , even if it s against the law ! why do n't you also serve them crack and set up the guestroom in case they 're in the mood for an orgy \? cause you know the kids are gonna take their drugs and have their sex ! you have to understand , this sort of ignorant permissiveness would n't have bothered me so much if i did n't have teenage daughters of my own , two highly sociable creatures in my world , terrorists are not so much accented militants but recently licensed teenagers offering my daughters a ride home from school \( threat condition yellow \) they 're senior boys calling on the phone for one of my 15yearolds \( threat condition orange \) they 're new friends of my girls making dubious plans for a movie on saturday night \( threat condition red \) my personal security advisory system is rendered totally useless , however , when it comes to teenagers' parents , the cool ones who let their children do stuff they are my worst nightmares these are parents like the oprah couple , who , in their zest to be liked by their children , fail to draw a clear distinction between what s legal \( yoohoo \) and what is n't \( smirnoff \) parents who dole out cash on demand , indulging their children in tiffany jewelry and prada bags as if they 're backtoschool staples parents who set up their children s bedrooms with computers , phones , stereos , televisions with dvd players , monitoring usage only if the bills get out of control and parents like the ones i contacted recently after my daughter asked to attend a friend s party why do you have to call \? my daughter shrieked , once again mortified by her mother s overprotective lunacy i just want to make sure the parents will be home , i explained to her calmly , even though we 've had this exact exchange every weekend for the past two years do n't worry , i wo n't identify myself by name the children would indeed be supervised , the boy s mother assured me over the phone , sounding almost offended at the implication so , satisfied that responsible adults would be in control , i allowed my daughter to go only to have her return a few hours later , completely hammered it seems all the children had been drinking at this party one had even passed out on the floor until her father arrived to pick her up i blame my daughter for using poor judgment she blames herself for not having had the foresight to sleep over at someone else s house that night , thus avoiding discovery by mad mom i also blame myself and the party parents clearly , the mother and i had a miscommunication about the definition of supervising i meant making sure the children would n't be drinking she meant making sure they would n't be drinking her and her husband s stash in the refrigerator the basement supply , however , would be up for grabs see , mom , there s no reason for you to call anymore , my daughter stated glibly the next day , because even when parents are home things can happen how s a mad mom to argue with that \?
how many pictures does it take to make a memorable exhibition \? fifty \? a hundred \? how about 18 \? that s the number of paintings by caravaggio that people are lining up to see in naples in an exhibition that is something of a landmark event \( there is also a coda , five copies of lost works and five recently proposed attributions , though none are convincing \) the reason for the success of this magnificent show has less to do with numbers than with the quality of the works and the period that they document the last four years of caravaggio s life , spent peripatetically outside rome , where he had made a name for himself before he died at 39 of malaria that this exhibition should attract crowds is no surprise the admiration previous generations lavished on michelangelo , rembrandt and el greco is now directed at caravaggio , the first and most audacious realist in european art he would have both savored and dismissed the adulation , for seldom has there been such a conflicted artist he was the consummate outsider indeed , he built his reputation in rome by staking out polemical positions calculated to enrage the artistic establishment and endear him to sophisticated , largely ecclesiastical collectors in 1576 , el greco was hounded out of town \( or so we are told \) for suggesting that michelangelo , though a great sculptor , could not paint but when caravaggio arrived 16 years later , he did not simply thumb his nose at the worshippers of michelangelo he took on the whole premise of renaissance painting his bohemian , quasicriminal life style late nights in taverns and frequent brawls seemed a headon attack on the social status that artists had fought so hard to gain and by rejecting the hierarchies that prized figurative painting over landscape and still life , and the beau ideal over naturalism , he called into question the very basis of renaissance poetics caravaggio insisted on working outside the aesthetic and social boundaries of his time yet he was also enormously status conscious like every other artist in rome , he measured success by the social caliber of his patrons and he quickly abandoned still life and genre painting for grand , figurative compositions that caravaggio s roman paintings exert such a broad appeal today is the result of their sensational use of naturalistic effects a basket of blemished fruit precariously posed on the edge of a table , a figure screaming as his head is severed , pretty boys flaunting their nudity in caravaggio s hands , naturalism painting directly from a posed model rather than working through the idealizing process of drawing became a weapon of attack , a means of undermining the critical standards of his day michelangelo had astounded the world with his heroic male nudes on the sistine ceiling , and in his first public commission caravaggio framed the martyrdom of saint matthew with shockingly naturalistic male nudes , two of whom watch the murder with disturbing detachment \( scholars sometimes explain these figures as neophytes waiting to be baptized , but this seems to me a misunderstanding of the transgressive genius of caravaggio , whom one contemporary pointedly called that antimichelangelo \) for most admirers , caravaggio s career pretty much ends in 1606 , when he killed a tennis opponent and fled rome after spending some time on the estates of the colonna family , south of rome , he made his way to naples , malta and sicily , and then back to naples , where one of his many enemies slashed his face and a rumor circulated that he had been killed \( he made a point of offending people wherever he went \) these years , during which he awaited a papal pardon so that he could return to rome , were a period of exile , but they were also a liberating experience in rome , caravaggio had necessarily to do battle with the ghosts of michelangelo and raphael , as well as the legacy of greek and roman art they were the measures by which art was judged but in naples , malta and sicily , there was no such dominant tradition caravaggio was the biggest act in town , and the finest commissions were offered to him i have long thought that caravaggio s greatest paintings were done during the four years of his roman exile , and so i attach special importance to the metropolitan museum s acquisition seven years ago of one of his last works , a deeply expressive painting that shows a woman accusing saint peter of being an apostle of christ , and peter denying it \( i made the case for the purchase to the acquisition committee , but they required no convincing \) the halflength composition is stripped of all extraneous narrative detail , color is subordinated to effects of light and dark , and the summary , rapidfire brushwork aims to capture the psychological conflict of a dramatic moment rather than to describe its physical appearance we sense the artist moving beyond the polemics of so many of his roman works , in which naturalism is pitted against idealism , and the goal was to create a sensation in this and kindred works you have the sense of an artist turning inward to discover the emotional truth behind the biblical narrative at the capodimonte museum in naples , the metropolitan s canvas takes it place alongside some of caravaggio s most memorable paintings , including virtually all of his late altarpieces the crucifixion of saint andrew from cleveland the seven acts of mercy and the flagellation from naples raising of lazarus and adoration of the shepherds from messina , italy the burial of saint lucy from syracuse , italy and the badly damaged but haunting annunciation \( caravaggio s least studied masterpiece \) from nancy , france only the great beheading of saint john the baptist from malta is missing \( it is simply too large to travel \) these works will probably never again be brought together , and the fact that they can be seen alongside pictures like the metropolitan s denial of saint peter , and the david with the head of goliath and saint jerome from the borghese gallery in rome only adds to the overwhelming effect the exhibition is scheduled to travel to the national gallery , london the metropolitan was supposed to be a third stop , but it proved impossible to secure the needed loans for all three museums in any case , naples is the place to see it , not only because the exhibition in london will lack one or two key works , but also because in naples the paintings resonate as nowhere else the capodimonte has transformed itself into what may be the most beautifully installed museum in italy on one floor it offers the celebrated farnese collection , with its wealth of paintings by , among others , titian , raphael , bellini , correggio , parmigianino and annibale carracci another floor has a panorama of painting in naples , from its origins in the 13th century through the 19th century the caravaggio show is installed so that the visitor comes upon the artist at precisely the right chronological place in that history , and when you leave the exhibition galleries , you pick up the threads of that narrative again with those artists whose careers were transformed by caravaggio s presence in the city ribera , caracciolo , artemisia gentileschi and many others this has the effect of at once situating caravaggio within his historical context and demonstrating just how much he transcended his times if vel zquez can be claimed as the precursor of 19thcentury realism , in these works caravaggio lays his claim to being the first modern painter one who looked beyond appearances to uncover the turbulent and conflicted passions that give life its tragic dimension darkness in caravaggio s roman paintings was primarily a pictorial device here , it acquires a profoundly psychological dimension perhaps the most memorable room is the one in which caravaggio s three great sicilian altarpieces are hung , one to a wall facing each other are two works created virtually contemporaneously , which probe the opposite poles of human existence on one side is caravaggio s most tender painting an adoration of the shepherds exceptionally for the artist , the scene is staged in a carefully described space , with shepherds , their heads aligned along a descending diagonal , gathered in mute reverence at the miracle of jesus' birth a humble still life of joseph s carpenter s tools in the foreground and a donkey and an ox at the back of the stable complete the aura of sacred poverty and set off the touching figure of the virgin reclining against the wooden manger , protectively cuddling her newborn child a quality of vulnerability pervades the picture opposite this extraordinary work is the dramatically charged raising of lazarus , in which the dead lazarus is summoned violently and , it seems , painfully , perhaps even reluctantly back to life , to the astonishment of the onlookers and the impassioned but disturbingly noiseless cries of his sisters here the space is a shallow shelf , with the figures pressed into a narrow foreground area a raking light plays across them and its lifegiving powers are contrasted with the oppressive darkness of the upper half of the composition caravaggio has discovered the tragic eloquence of emptiness the silent void at the heart of western painting is the romantic notion of the isolated genius confronting his own mortality and the enigma of human existence this myth little accords with the popular image we have of caravaggio , but it is the one that occurred to me over and over at this unforgettable exhibition 'l'ultimo tempo , 16061610' capodimonte museum , naples through jan 23 art keith christiansen is a curator of european paintings at the metropolitan museum of art
at the order of a federal appeals court , a federal district court judge in portland , me , has reopened the sentencing hearing for a boy who as a 14yearold in 2002 set fire to a boatyard containing an engine that belonged to former president george bush and was sentenced to 30 months in a maximum security juvenile prison the reopening will give the family of the teenager , patrick vorce , a chance to argue that he was treated illegally when judge george singal , of federal district court in portland , had him sent to a juvenile prison in pennsylvania that is under contract to the federal bureau of prisons , said his lawyer and stepfather , robert mongue the prison is a 13hour drive from patrick s home in kennebunk , me , and provides little education or counseling services , his family and lawyers say the case is considered highly unusual because , under federal law , juveniles are supposed to be tried in local juvenile courts and incarcerated in local facilities patrick is the only juvenile from new england or from new york , ohio or pennsylvania in the custody of the federal bureau of prisons , a bureau spokesman , dan dunne , said there are so few juveniles in federal custody that the bureau does not even have its own juvenile prison , mr dunne said patrick s family and lawyers say that the original decision not to try him in the local county court , as the federal juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act requires , must have had something to do with the connection to the former president paula silsby , the united states attorney for maine , whose office prosecuted patrick , has denied this patrick pleaded guilty to the arson in july 2002 and was sentenced last summer but mr mongue appealed , and a threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals for the first circuit , in boston , ruled in february that judge singal had not sufficiently considered the location and rehabilitative capabilities of the detention facility chosen by the government as required by federal law acting on the ruling , judge singal last week set an evidentiary hearing for april 29 to determine whether the pennsylvania prison was appropriate for patrick judge singal agreed with mr mongue s request to bring patrick back to maine to testify , and he will also hear testimony from officials from pennsylvania , from the federal bureau of prisons and from a psychiatrist , keith courtney , whom patrick s family has hired as an expert witness mr courtney is the chief psychiatrist for the new hampshire department of corrections he has said patrick s placement , at the cresson secure treatment center in central pennsylvania , is improper because it is too far away for patrick s parents to play a role in his rehabilitation and because until recently patrick was receiving essentially no education doug oliver , a spokesman for the pennsylvania department of public welfare , which oversees juvenile prisons in the state , said it was the policy of his department to keep a child who commits a crime as close as possible to his parents , to help in the rehabilitative process robert schwartz , the director of the juvenile law center in philadelphia , a nonprofit law firm that represents juveniles , who is assisting with patrick s case , said that it remains an extremely bizarre outlier of a case in years of working with juvenile clients , mr schwartz said , he had never had one who was tried in the federal court system one result is that federal judges and the bureau of prisons seem unsure how to handle inmates like patrick , so he has fallen into a legal black hole , mr schwartz said for instance , mr schwartz said , under pennsylvania law , each juvenile prison writes a monthly progress report on every inmate a probation officer meets regularly with each inmate , and the judge who sentenced him , to gauge his progress but in patrick s case , while cresson is writing the monthly reports , there is no federal probation officer to send them to , and none has been to visit patrick since he arrived last september , mr schwartz said mr mongue said he would ask judge singal to allow patrick to serve the balance of his time at a juvenile prison in maine
to the editor re kerry s acceptance 'there is a right way and a wrong way to be strong \( transcript , july 30 \) none of your analysts or editorialists seem to have noticed the clear implication of john kerry s claim that i defended this country as a young man that the war in vietnam was , as george w bush has claimed of his war in iraq , a war of selfdefense this is not a promising start for the effort to restore credibility to the white house jeff mcmahan highland park , nj , july 30 , 2004
within months of the 9 11 attacks on new york and washington , the global surge of sympathy for the united states began to ebb before the invasion of iraq , london s sunday times reported that equal numbers of britons ranked saddam hussein and george w bush as the top threat to world peace in france , a book claiming that washington itself had sponsored the 9 11 attacks became a huge best seller , and in germany a full 20 percent of the population endorsed this view three years and two wars later , attitudes toward america have hardened still further a worldwide poll taken last march found that the united states' favorability ratings have fallen to critical levels , dropping precipitously in most west european countries and to 5 percent in jordan meanwhile , in october , a columnist in the guardian mused on the coming presidential election , john wilkes booth , lee harvey oswald , john hinckley jr where are you now \? when a columnist for a leading newspaper of a leading american ally seems openly to call for the assassination of a sitting president \( the day after the election , britain s daily mirror ran the headline , how can 59 , 054 , 087 people be so dumb \? \) , it s time to start worrying of late , a whole shelf of books has been published attempting to explain why people hate america so much these works fall roughly into two categories leftwing attacks on the united states , and attacks from the right on those who attack it think of the first group as the antiamericans , and the second as the antiantiamericans just about all these two factions can agree on is that antiamericanism , in one form or another , is almost as old as the country itself and that it has recently grown a lot worse consider first the views of the antis americans as the danish filmmaker lars von trier recently suggested in his inventive but maddening movie dogville are , by turns , materialistic , ignorant , rapacious and brutal arundhati roy , the indian author of one good novel and many peevish essays , complains in her strident broadside , an ordinary person s guide to empire , that the united states suffers from a selfdestructive impulse toward supremacy , stranglehold , global hegemony and is led by a genocidal coward who manipulates a craven press to do his bidding in less hysterical terms , the washingtonbased british scholar anatol lieven laments \( in his wellwritten and wellresearched america right or wrong an anatomy of american nationalism \) that americans are excessively religious and nationalistic worse , they seem determined to inflict their old testament values on the rest of the world it s the selfcongratulatory guff of this civilizational mission \( in the words of will hutton , another british writer and the author of the cranky declaration of interdependence why america should join the world \) that drives many of the antiamericans around the bend if only the united states would act more like other countries especially those in kinder , gentler , more cosmopolitan europe , hutton says much of the resentment would dissipate there is something to such arguments , at least the more moderate ones it s not hard to see why the puritanical moralism of the united states and its vigorous pursuit of selfinterest rubs both secular europeans and impoverished muslims the wrong way the problem with the antiamericans' complaints , however , is that they are often undermined by bad faith some of the critics have never even bothered to visit the united states and even those who have \( like hutton \) or who live here \( like lieven \) frequently sound as though they have n't and do n't when hutton fulminates that national democracy in the united states has descended to the level of preenlightenment europe , it becomes hard to take the rest of his charges seriously and lieven undermines his otherwise lucid writing when he insists that there is little tolerance for dissent in american public discourse has he not seen fahrenheit 9 11 or visited a newsstand lately \? the venom and inaccuracy of such charges suggest that the antiamericans are motivated by something more basic than disagreements over policy or the personality of a particular president also disturbing is the way many of these writers emphasize america s relationship with israel there s nothing wrong with complaining about washington s strategy in the middle east reasonable people can disagree but one should be skeptical of a writer like lieven who refers to the proisrael lobby as having an iron grip on washington or who labels a contemporary proisraeli lebaneseamerican writer an arab josephus a comparison \( to flavius josephus , the hellenized jewish historian of the ancient world often known for his cowardice and treachery \) that manages to combine several layers of racial condescension in two words such language is not new antisemitism and antiamericanism have run together at least since the 1930 s , when french writers denounced the avaricious united states as uncle shylock but the modern antiamericans would serve themselves better by taking care to untangle the two enter the antiantis , who seize on these faults to mount a spirited counteroffensive three new books lead the charge hating america , a richly detailed if pedestrian chronicle of antiamericanism through the ages by barry and judith colp rubin \( two conservative middle east experts \) understanding antiamericanism its origins and impact at home and abroad , a collection of polemical essays examining the phenomenon around the world , edited and introduced by paul hollander \( a professor emeritus of sociology at the university of massachusetts and himself the author of a book entitled antiamericanism \) and , the most idiosyncratic of the three , the wildly discursive and undisciplined antiamericanism , by jeanfran ois revel , a rare proamerican member of the french establishment , who fills in the picture from paris the three books are united by rage at america s enemies with a venom that mirrors the antiamericans' own in none of them , however , has the excess of spleen produced clarity , fairmindedness or nuance the antiantis reject their opposites' claim that the problem with america is its behavior or its president instead , they argue , americabashing derives from more fundamental sources the resentment of oncegreat societies eclipsed by yankee upstarts , and of those unable to participate in america s bounty as revel writes , much of european antiamericanism stems fundamentally from our continent s loss during the 20th century of its 600year leadership role bernard lewis , writing about the arab world , has made virtually the same claim in revel s terms , the principal function of antiamericanism has always been , and still is , to discredit liberalism by discrediting its supreme incarnation , an argument that echoes president bush s line that so long as we hold dear to our freedoms , the enemy will hate us , because they hate freedom or as hollander puts it , the deepest and broadest source of antiamericanism is the aversion to \( or , at best , ambivalence about \) modernity , which the united states most strikingly represents add to this a few other ingredients a romantic as well as marxist anticapitalism the personal and cultural problems peculiar to intellectuals the specter of standardization and homogenization associated with the spread of american mass culture and the picture starts to seem complete antiamericanism , in this view , also proves useful for covering up one s own shortcomings french intellectuals , revel says , focus on despising america so they can ignore their own blunders and console themselves for their loss of linguistic , cultural and political influence similarly , as salman rushdie wrote in 2002 , arab leaders use the united states as a smoke screen for muslim nations' many defects their corruption , their incompetence , their oppression of their own citizens , their economic , scientific and cultural stagnation bashing washington , the rubins argue , is a convenient way for despotic and incompetent regimes to distract their subjects from the real source of their problems the regimes themselves several of these points , like many of those made by the antiamericans , ring true if hatred of the united states is rational , why has it persisted for so many years in the face of different kinds of american behavior \? as revel says , the hallmark of fanaticism is the way it seizes on a certain behavior of the hated object and sweepingly condemns it , only to condemn with equal fervor the opposite behavior shortly after or even simultaneously and , indeed , at various times , the united states has been roundly attacked often by the same people , and in similar language for being both too engaged in the world and not engaged enough antiamerican islamists almost always ignore recent united states action on behalf of muslims in afghanistan , bosnia , kosovo , somalia and elsewhere that said , it beggars belief to argue , as these writers do , that antiamericanism stems solely from the neuroses of its proponents , that there s no link at all between americabashing and george w bush how else to explain the unparalleled current intensity \? like the antiamericans , moreover , the antiantis make their own mistakes in describing american society revel is so adamant about rebutting every french criticism of the united states that he mischaracterizes the country as profoundly as do lieven or hutton this forces him into some bizarre contortions he claims , for example , that there was nothing even slightly fishy about the 2000 presidential election , and that it s just as easy to get guns in europe as in america \( ignoring the point that europeans seem to use them less \) the rubins , similarly , manage to discuss antiamericanism in chile without an examination of washington s support for the 1973 coup there , an egregious and telling omission even more disturbing is what the antiantis advise for united states policy roger kimball \( the managing editor of the new criterion magazine and a contributor to hollander s book \) insists that since antiamericanism has nothing to do with american behavior , there s no reason to change that behavior on the contrary , kimball says , we must stay the course , for the current orgy of antiamericanism , fanned by the war with iraq , will dissipate in proportion to the resoluteness demonstrated by the united states not only is this unlikely a damnthetorpedoes approach of this sort would also be disastrous after three years of blunders in iraq and elsewhere so , finally , which side is right \? do they hate us for what we do or for what we are \? or for what they are \? once one has sorted through the careless polemics in both camps , the unsatisfying answer seems to be that neither side is right \( entirely \) or that both are right \( in part \) roy , lieven and hutton exaggerate the united states' flaws and underplay the way the country gets damned for whatever it does revel , the rubins and hollander company minimize the country s very real problems and misdeeds meanwhile , the nov 2 elections have n't helped clarify matters when voters endorsed bush for a second term , the difference between antibushism and antiamericanism abroad became harder to distinguish that s not to say , however , that a kerry victory would have resolved this question either there s little doubt that kerry would have turned a more conciliatory \( even frenchspeaking \) face to the world if , as many antiamericans insist , they are really only bushhaters , the change in style could have mollified them and it certainly would have deprived them of some ammunition but on substance the future of iraq , the kyoto protocols , the international criminal court , etc kerry s foreign policy would probably not have been much different from bush s given the pressures on america abroad and the demands of the public at home , especially since 9 11 and the iraq war , a modern president \( whether republican or democratic \) would have little leeway in foreign affairs what this suggests is that the distinction between what the united states does and what it is may actually be less clear and less helpful than many of the antiamericans imply there is no point in wishing , as hutton does , that the united states would suddenly start acting in a more european fashion which leads to a gloomy conclusion a more conciliatory american tone in the years ahead might quiet the country s critics somewhat but nothing washington could realistically do would be likely to change the minds of those determined , for their own reasons , to hate it antiamericanism is something we 're stuck with for at least as long as america remains preeminent perhaps the most americans can hope for is that the animosity wo n't intensify any time soon but if it does n't , that s probably only because , as all these books agree , it could n't get much worse
the white house said on friday that it had received subpoenas in late january in the investigation into the leak of an undercover cia officer s name and that it was complying with the demand for an array of information , including records of phone calls to and from air force one during president bush s trip to africa last summer confirming a report published friday in newsday , the white house spokesman , scott mcclellan , said the white house had received the subpoenas from a federal grand jury looking into how the cia officer s name came to appear in a syndicated column by robert d novak last july 14 mr novak attributed the information to two senior administration officials knowingly disclosing the name of an undercover cia officer can be a crime the officer , valerie plame , is married to joseph c wilson 4th , a former ambassador who had criticized the white house over its assertion , later found to be based on faulty intelligence , that iraq had tried to acquire uranium for its nuclear weapons program from africa the subpoenas followed a narrower request for information from federal investigators last year the administration sent an email message to all white house employees in january directing them to comply with the subpoenas , which covered documents and records relating to the white house s communications strategy on iraq and its dealings with reporters from television networks , news magazines and newspapers including the washington post and the new york times the white house counsel s office did send a letter out to the white house staff , urging everybody to comply fully with the request from investigators , and that s exactly what we are doing , mr mcclellan said the subpoenas appeared to focus more sharply than the earlier request on records involving a week in early july , when mr wilson s criticism was becoming public and when mr bush was in africa they suggested prosecutors are closely examining conversations between aides traveling with the mr bush and colleagues or reporters in washington newsday reported that the subpoenas also sought a list of people who attended a white house reception last july for former president gerald r ford s 90th birthday as well as records of an internal white house group working on communications strategy for the war with iraq some lawyers involved in the case said on friday that the request for additional documents may also indicate that , at least as of late january , prosecutors had not obtained concrete evidence that clearly identified who provided ms plame s name to mr novak otherwise , the lawyers said , prosecutors might not have needed to summon witnesses who were known to have testified before the grand jury in february among those who have testified are mr mcclellan adam levine , an aide who operated as a liaison between the white house and television networks mary matalin , a former aide to vice president dick cheney and other white house press and policy officials but the precise significance of the subpoenas remains unclear of five lawyers interviewed this week about the case , none said that they understood the overall status of the investigation or whether the prosecutors had a working theory of how mr novak had obtained ms plame s name the lawyers said that they believed , however , that the prosecutors were nearing a turning point when they would decide whether to charge anyone with a crime or drop the case mr novak s column centered on mr wilson , who had concluded in a report two years ago for the cia that there was no clear evidence that saddam hussein had tried to buy uranium ore from africa in order to build nuclear weapons mr bush , in building a case for war with iraq in his 2003 state of the union address , alluded to attempts by mr hussein to acquire uranium in africa , attributing the information to british intelligence mr novak disclosed in his column that although mr wilson never worked for the cia , his wife , ms plame , is an agency operative on weapons of mass destruction and that two senior administration officials told him that she was the one who suggested sending him to africa
on a recent wintry night , when officials here made a hurried decision to open a vacant library building to the homeless , they inadvertently exposed the conflicted soul of a privileged city faced with the prospect of playing host to 75 guests , as the homeless from several nearby communities were called , residents grew so polarized that many could not meet the eyes of friends and neighbors with whom they disagreed the temporary shelter never opened because of the outcry in the end , the debate proved much bigger for orinda than the shelter or even the broader problem of homelessness in the san francisco bay area it cut to the core of how residents feel about themselves and their fellow human beings and whether they believe that luck had anything to do with their ability to settle in this bucolic community of mostly welltodo professionals 22 miles east of san francisco what most everyone had thought was a town where people were more or less alike was shown to be one with sharply divergent values it brought out the best and the worst in people , said mayor joyce hawkins , who was among the original supporters of the shelter , which would have opened this month it was a painful process many of the 17 , 000 residents work in cities like oakland , san jose and san francisco , but they return home to a place largely sheltered from big city ills crime is so low that the police chief sometimes reminds residents to remove keys from their car ignitions the public schools rank among the top in the state yet when it came to housing the homeless , orinda discovered it was more ordinary than extraordinary a temporary shelter would probably draw opposition in most communities in this nation , said steven raphael , an associate professor of public policy at the university of california at berkeley who has researched the subject councilwoman amy worth said of the debate , this is anytown usa contra costa county has an estimated 5 , 000 to 8 , 000 homeless people , though none are in orinda the interfaith council of contra costa county had planned to send just families , the frail and the elderly to the old library building on a hill near housing for the elderly , a preschool , a church and a park many residents expressed fear that drug addicts and child molesters would be among the homeless they demanded screening to weed out violent offenders , and they wanted guarantees that the homeless would not congregate in the park and at a nearby grocery store some critics complained that officials had moved too quickly , giving preliminary approval for the shelter in a closed session days before the homeless were to have arrived perhaps the greatest anger was directed at city manager bill lindsay at a raucous hearing , where mr lindsay was introduced as the noble person who conceived this idea , the audience snickered someone said in a loud whisper , and he does n't even live here it was a lynch mob mentality , a resident , inez hollander lake , said i never thought i 'd find that in the bay area ms lake sent an email message to friends about how close she had come to poverty after her husband lost his job , the couple were on the verge of losing their house and health insurance , she wrote it happens all too easily in this country , ms lake , a native of the netherlands , said worried that parents might not invite her children on play dates because she favored the shelter , jennifer tejada , a police sergeant in another town , remained quiet until she became so tormented by her inaction that she spoke up at a second hearing after that , sergeant tejada said , when she picked up her child at a preschool , a number of mothers clearly avoided her dwight foster , the selfdescribed brain trust of the resistance , collected contributions , hired a lawyer to sue the city and set up a web site it was like taking a pennsylvania amish quilt sitting on a line on a beautiful sunny day and tearing it right down the middle , mr foster said of the proposal s effects on the city in the thick of the debate , the rev thomas trutner of st stephen s episcopal church campaigned from the pulpit , saying , jesus christ was born in a homeless shelter by the middle of the month , a bruised mayor and city council asked the interfaith group to withdraw its proposal the council members scheduled a hearing for residents to have their final say more than 500 people attended , with at least 100 taking the microphone at the hearing , the discussion was astoundingly respectful and polite , the senior pastor , the rev frank baldwin , said even though civility has returned , the debate continues a recall campaign against the city council has started the mood seems to have shifted in favor of helping the homeless a resident , chet martine , 67 , is promising to match up to 1 , 000 in contributions from residents to go to homeless programs sergeant tejada and friends are raising money for a voucher program for hotels and mr foster is donating leftover contributions from the legal fight , 700 , to the interfaith group we need to heal , mayor hawkins said
las vegas , nov 15 barely an hour after tendering their applications for political asylum in the united states , two dozen cuban dancers were back on stage here on monday in sweatpants and leotards , stretching and warming their muscles , rehearsing for their big opening night it s best to go right back to work , nicole durr , the artistic director of the havana night club revue , said as she watched the runthrough that s their life in all , 43 singers , dancers and musicians defected , victims , they said , of a harsh policy in cuba that had declared illegal their decision to perform in the united states one member of the troupe , who had initially decided to defect , was on the fence on monday , and did not submit his 10page asylum application along with those of his colleagues at federal offices here an additional six members of the revue applied for asylum to american authorities in germany in september and were granted entry visas on monday the paperwork of a seventh was delayed they were expected to fly immediately to las vegas , in time to take the stage for tuesday night s opening of the show at the stardust resort and casino citing family obligations , the remaining two artists of the 53member ensemble have decided to return to cuba after the engagement at the stardust concludes on jan 11 most of the other players were no less conflicted daisy alvarez , 32 , a choreographer and dancer , said during a rehearsal break that she had not yet told her son , giancarlo , 10 , who remains in cuba with relatives , that their separation might last longer than either of them had expected even though he s very mature , i had to be very careful with him , ms alvarez , who arrived hereon aug 23 , said what i told him when i called him was that i was working very hard so that one day soon i can bring him to this country to live it was the hardest decision she ever made , ms alvarez said in the end , i left my flesh and blood in cuba , she said that s one of the risks we 're taking with this madness then , after thinking about it for a moment , she went on it s not really madness it s our reality the madness is that we really ca n't go back to cuba now if we go back , we 'll have no work what would we live on \? members of the company said they were warned by officials from cuba s ministry of culture this summer that they would not be permitted to resume their careers if they insisted on going to las vegas ten performers decided to stay home the asylum applications were being forwarded to the los angeles office of the department of homeland security while federal officials do not normally comment on pending applications , the process for the performers will be made easier by a law that favors cuban immigrants above those from most other nations , said pamela falk , a law professor at the city university of new york , who has extensive experience in asylum cases and is helping the troupe here most of the cast members believe they will be able to return to cuba when the conflict between fidel castro and the united states ends , or when mr castro dies , whichever comes first in the meantime , the experience of seeking residency in the united states is exciting , they said , even though their home , for the moment , is a motel that is not in the first rank of las vegas establishments in cuba , we were so accustomed to hearing all the propaganda about the united states being a bad place , said ms alvarez , who has appeared with the troupe in 17 countries since its founding in 1998 but as with any country , you 've got to get to know it , both good and bad several of the company s musicians were given a tour of music stores in los angeles and had their picture taken in front of the hollywood sign , although most of the troupe has so far seen nothing of the united states but las vegas and its otherworldly attractions this is like a planet inside a continent , ariel machado , the group s manager , said as he stood in the stardust s wayne newton theater , where the cuban show is to be presented it s a little crazy here , but i think the group deserves to play in a place like this vivian herrera , 26 , a singer and the company s first dancer , who was once a national gymnastics champion , said many people in cuba , including her family , might not understand the performers' motivation a lot of people there have been brainwashed politically , ms herrera said the government has a pretty solid base , and none of us have any idea when that s going to change everything is unpredictable
catholic bishops recently met and sought the best way to enforce church teaching with catholic politicians who fail to oppose laws that allow abortion some critics of the bishops see this as a violation of the separation of church and state both sides are working from misconceptions abortion is not a church issue , so what the bishops have to say about it cannot be an intrusion of the church into state concerns abortion is , admittedly , a moral issue but not one that can be settled by theology or by religious authority modern right to life issues abortion and contraception are nowhere mentioned in either jewish or christian scripture pope pius xi said they were , in his encyclical casti connubii \( 1930 \) , where onan s spilling his seed on the ground \( and the reason for his punishment by god \) was interpreted as preventing conception and birth yet no scholar of scripture accepts that reading of genesis 38 9 anymore it is read as referring to levirate marriage duties the vatican now agrees with this interpretation even in his own sphere , the revealed word of god , the pope could be wrong some , deprived of the onan text , say that abortion is forbidden by the scriptural commandment thou shalt not kill but that commandment does not cover all human life my hair and fingernails , while growing , are alive with my own human life semen and ova have human life even before their juncture they continue to have it after mingling for example , the fertilized ovum that does not lodge itself in the wall of the womb yet no attempt is made to retrieve such dead detritus and give it decent burial so right to life as a slogan is a questionbegging term the command not to kill is directed at the killing of persons , and the issue in abortion is this when does the fetus become a person \? the answer to that is not given by church teaching even st thomas aquinas , who thought that a soul was infused into the body , could only guess when that infusion took place \( and he did not guess at fertilization \) st augustine confessed an agnosticism about the human status of the fetus natural reason must use natural tools to deal with this question philosophy , neurobiology , psychology , medicine when is the fetus viable , and viable as what \? does personality come only with responsibility , with personal communication \? on none of these do the bishops have special expertise john henry newman said , the pope , who comes of revelation , has no jurisdiction over nature the evidence from natural sources of knowledge has been interpreted in various ways , by people of good intentions and good information if natural law teaching were clear on the matter , a consensus would have been formed by those with natural reason the fact that the problem is unsettled by them does not mean that a theological authority can be resorted to an invalid authority \( theology \) does not become valid faute de mieux church authorities have not acted on their own claims aborted fetuses , if they are persons , should be baptized , just as infants are , and buried in consecrated ground but that has not been regular church practice if abortion kills a person , then the woman who undergoes an abortion should be punished as a murderer and the worst kind of murderer , a filicide church authorities have not demanded such punishment tradition does not give an answer where scripture is silent augustine condemned abortion , not because of the status of the fetus , but because it meant that sex was used for reasons other than procreation , which he thought always wrong he condemned , for that reason , sex after menopause , during infertile periods , during pregnancy a ban church authorities long ago lifted nothing i have said is a defense of abortion there are strong arguments from natural reason to oppose it , including a presumption in favor of personhood where the possibility exists that they are not so strong as to command general assent does not free anyone from the duty of considering those arguments seriously , and of making a decision in conscience based on that consideration all i am saying is that the bishops have no special mandate from their office to supplant the individual conscience with some divine imperative for them to say that this is a matter of theology is , simply , bad theological reasoning if they , as citizens , wish to express their opinion on the naturalreason arguments , they have every right to do so but that does not give them the right to deny others the same kind of arguing , on the same grounds the subject of abortion is not a matter of churchstate relations , since the bishops as church authorities have nothing distinctive to contribute to the discussion
it was clear from the moment they took power that president bush and vice president dick cheney were determined to greatly accelerate oil and gas drilling on the public lands of the west driven by a belief that energy independence could be achieved by aggressive exploitation of the public domain , the administration set its sights on doubling the number of wells on lands controlled by the interior department s bureau of land management and urged the environmental community not to block its efforts with frivolous lawsuits the truth of the matter is that nobody , including conservationists , challenged the government s right or need to look for oil and gas , given the tight markets for both all anyone asked for was a balanced approach that would broadly respect the requirements of nature and spare particularly fragile landscapes to the dismay of some western governors , fish and game commissioners , ranchers and hunters many of them lifelong republicans the administration has not produced a balanced policy both washington and the regional blm offices have repeatedly made clear their belief that extraction of oil and gas trumps all other uses of the public lands this being an election year , the administration is making noises about a more nuanced approach , and has begun to reach out to its critics among the ranchers and sportsmen there are 90 different land use plans or leasing proposals on the table four are especially controversial how they come out will tell much about whether the administration has had a genuine change of heart one involves the rocky mountain front , a 100milelong stretch of northern montana wonderfully rich in wildlife the administration is deciding whether to honor some old drilling leases senator max baucus , a democrat , has urged that the leases be bought out and that drilling be barred forever along the front the administration should embrace both ideas while the oil and gas deposits in the front are trivial , the potential damage from drilling is enormous wyoming s upper green river basin , by contrast , is rich in both wildlife and natural gas much of the land has already been leased but until now great care has been taken not to destroy winter animal habitats or impede the spectacular annual migration of more than 100 , 000 big game animals some reports have suggested that the administration is thinking about 10 , 000 new wells any plan that overloads the terrain could ruin a national treasure the administration has also trained its sights on 14 million acres in and around utah s desolation canyon , an area ruled off limits in the clinton years pending a study of its suitability as permanent wilderness interior secretary gale norton rescinded these protections a year ago as part of a broader policy shift in which she effectively announced her intention not to seek new wilderness designations anywhere she has since opened up 14 , 500 of those acres to development and threatens to do more finally there is new mexico s otera mesa , where the bureau of land management has announced plans to open up 14 million acres of fragile grasslands , infuriating just about everybody in the state gov bill richardson , a democrat , has proposed a sensible compromise that would open up some of the area for exploration but protect the rest ms norton should buy it it is not as if the companies have no place else to go even the blm concedes that fully 85 percent of the oil and gas on federal lands is already available for leasing and development meanwhile , a wilderness society analysis suggests that the industry may not have the resources to exploit leases it already owns only onefourth of the 42 million acres of blm land under lease is actually being developed that is one more reason to ask why the administration finds it necessary to accelerate drilling in places where moderation is required and to invite drilling in places where there should be none at all
here in new york , it started with helen kiok mrs kiok died unexpectedly on dec 25 , 2003 , at the age of 87 her brief paid death notice , published dec 30 in the new york times , said she was dedicated to family , friends , learning , teaching and social justice in the last line , it instructed in lieu of flowers , donations in her name may be made to any organization dedicated to the defeat of george w bush a search of electronic archives revealed that other death notices in this newspaper containing similar language about mr bush followed on jan 1 , jan 20 and jan 24 , like a chain letter although dead people voting is a hoary tradition in places like jersey city and chicago , this kind of posthumous attempt to influence elections seems new , a creature of the internet age and an indication of the intensity of this political season hey , it s like a mortuary version of the dean campaign , suggested norman adler , a longtime political consultant in new york a lot of the dean campaign was a matter of spontaneous political combustion through the internet people saw something and they thought it was a good idea , so they emailed other people , or put it on their blogs , and that s how it grew to some , using a death notice as a paid political advertisement seems to bring incivility to new heights from his position as a democratic political consultant , hank sheinkopf asserted that these notices were poor political propaganda and would n't cost the president one vote what s more , he said there s something over the top about that it s not the nicest kind of behavior but the families who placed the death notices say that politics was deeply personal to their loved ones , and that mr bush s tenure , from the circumstances of his election to the loss of lives in iraq and the sofar invisible weapons of mass destruction , inflamed their passion so much they wanted to send messages from the grave mrs kiok , a retired history teacher at john bowne high school in flushing , queens , surely led a life laced with political struggle she fled a ukrainian pogrom at the age of 5 , and was arrested during a cafeteria strike while she was a student at brooklyn college in the 1930 s widowed early , she had to start raising two young children on her own her family remembers that she carried a copy of the united states constitution in her purse mrs kiok had heard of the defeatbush death notice and loved the idea , said her daughter , ellen kolodney , a social worker in the bronx district attorney s office as a joke , ms kolodney said to her mother , well , mom , we 'll do this for you , not thinking she 'd have to make good on her promise so soon mary jean tully , 78 , whose paid notice ran jan 1 , was a pioneer of the feminist movement her son bruce , a private equity investor in manhattan , remembers that even her christmas cards had political messages \( i'm praying for gore , she wrote in 1999 \) she was a founder of veteran feminists of america , and betty friedan and gloria steinem agreed to speak at her memorial service the tullys copied the defeat bush line in the kiok death notice mr tully did wonder whether the message was tacky , but when he called his father for advice , his father replied it s her leave it in in her jan 20 death notice , gertrude brown korman , 98 , was described simply as a beloved mother and adoring grandmother the defeat bush line is the only hint that she had a life outside her family most recently , the line appeared in the jan 24 death notice for herbert kalmanoff , 92 , an upper east side psychoanalyst and former united states army captain his son , jonathan , who lives in rochester , said the line spoke for itself i do n't want to turn it into a bigger deal than it is , he said the first such death notice in the country appears to have been one for sally baron , a waitress , cook and factory worker , which ran in august in the capital times of madison , wis ms baron s daughter , maureen bettilyon , said last week that the idea came to her and her brother as they were trying to think of a cause their mother believed in deeply we really did n't think anybody would notice , she said we were just trying to kind of sneak it through how does all this make the bushcheney campaign feel \? this is why we need tv phones , so that you would see the look on my face , said terry holt , the campaign press secretary and what might that look be laughter , perhaps \? certainly not , mr holt retorted you know , it s umm , incredulous disbelief sounding a bit at a loss for words , he continued i only can say that if , you know , um , as a private person , the passing of my loved ones is going to conjure up lots of emotions none of them political
farmingdale frank lopiccolo , a retired teacher , was standing in his backyard in farmingdale a few weeks ago , staring at the house next door sometime last year , a group of latino men had moved in , and ever since , mr lopiccolo said , there had been more and more people , playing loud music , gathering outside on weekends and , he suspected , overcrowding the house he watched as a man walked into the driveway , glanced across the fence and then darted into the back door i have no idea what people live in this house , and that s a problem , said mr lopiccolo , moving back into the shadows of his own backyard though outsiders sometimes confuse it with farmingville , the suffolk county hamlet 25 miles to the east where a string of violent acts aimed at day laborers brought national attention , the relationship between immigrants and longtime residents has been much quieter in farmingdale but mutual suspicions are not far from the surface in this nassau county village of 9 , 000 now a real confrontation is brewing here after the village resurrected a proposal to condemn and redevelop , under eminent domain law , the buildings in a part of town where much of the latino population lives village officials say the redevelopment project is only intended to restore what many describe as a village in decline but people who live in the area think otherwise , and say it is only the latest chapter in the village s attempt to clear them out for good and for the first time , local immigrant advocacy groups , working on behalf of the tenants , have contacted a lawyer farmingdale has been a destination for migrant workers since the 1940 s , but the latest wave of mexican and central american day laborers started coming in the middle 1980 s according to census data , the hispanic population just about doubled between 1990 and 2000 , from 545 to 1 , 073 , and as of the last census , made up more than an eighth of the village population many of them are illegal aliens with little guidance or experience , farmingdale and other municipal governments have been left to their own devices in addressing the impact of growing immigrant populations since 9 11 , federal immigration authorities have focused most of their attention on homeland security little direction has come from new york state , and only recently have county governments begun exploring the formation of countywide policies the suffolk county executive , steve levy , announced in august an ongoing sting operation aimed at unlicensed contractors , many of whom employ undocumented laborers he also proposed to grant local police officers the powers of federal immigration agents , which has invited skepticism from some police officers in nassau county , thomas r suozzi , the county executive , said he was considering forming a countywide policy and has been discussing the issue with immigrant advocacy groups he is likely to take a different approach from mr levy , if his tenure as mayor of glen cove is any indication there , he helped set up a system of collaboration between city authorities and la fuerza unida , the city s main immigrant advocacy group but as there is still no countywide policy in nassau , farmingdale has been trying a whole range of measures , from supporting the creation of a temporary hiring spot to strictly enforcing traffic regulations to discourage contractors from stopping to hire day laborers on any given morning on conklin street , the twolane extension of the hempstead turnpike that runs through the center of the village , dozens of vans and trucks pull onto side streets to pick up the day laborers waiting on the corner it is a sight that has changed little for years , despite the village s efforts in 1999 , mayor joseph trudden put up signs forbidding drivers to stop or stand on conklin street between 7 30 and 9 30 am , hoping that strict regulations would deter contractors from coming to farmingdale for workers and in 2000 , mr trudden designated an empty lot on elizabeth street where the day laborers could convene and wait for contractors combined , he hoped , the sight of day laborers waiting on the side of the road would go away it s a bandaid on a surgery , he now says the hiring spot raised the ire of nearby residents , who accused the laborers of misbehaving , leaving trash and harassing passersby in less than a year , the village closed off the site , putting up fences and more no stopping signs the next year , local immigrant advocacy groups rented out space for a hiring site in east farmingdale , just over the border in the suffolk county almost immediately , according to those who ran the site , there were several incidents that terrified the laborers and intimated the advocacy groups helping run the site employees of a nearby manufacturing company shouted at the workers from passing cars , threatening to call the immigration authorities in less than a month that site was closed , too while all of this was going on , mr trudden and the board of trustees decided that several properties on the east end of the village had become eyesores although the boundaries of the study area varied over the years , there were essentially six acres in question , the primary address being an apartment complex at 150 secatogue avenue , which houses about 150 people most of the tenants are latino many of them identify themselves as day laborers in the spring of 2000 , mr trudden said , the village tried to persuade the owners of the properties to tear down the buildings and put up new housing suggestions ranged from upscale condominiums with underground parking to subsidized apartments for senior citizens mr trudden said the village intended to find housing for anyone who was displaced , but he admitted that the complex at 150 secatogue and one nearby at 130 secatogue were really the only apartments in farmingdale whatever it is , i just want to see the town look nice , mr trudden said though the owner of the building at 150 secatogue , john tosini , said he was interested in redeveloping , the village began proceedings to claim the properties under eminent domain law the tenants were for the most part unaware of the plans , though local immigrant advocacy groups protested at public meetings we said at the time 'this is absurd you 're just getting rid of them , ' recalled janet liotta , a member of farmingdale citizens for a viable solution , an immigrant advocacy group they just said , 'we do n't know when this is going into effect ' but the proposal languished , and it was not until the summer of 2004 that the village began to seriously consider it again in the meantime , the building at 130 secatogue had been damaged by fire in january 2003 , leaving it unoccupied the 30 or so residents scattered , some of them moving into the larger complex at 150 secatogue the main catalyst was the arrival of a new village government in april 2004 , after a challenger to mr trudden and two candidates for the fourmember village board were elected after campaigning on what they described as a need for revitalization in farmingdale the new mayor , george graf , pledged in his campaign literature to get these day laborers off our streets , saying that mr trudden embraces day laborers once he was in office , mr graf imposed stricter fines for contractors who stop their vehicles to pick up laborers , though in an interview he said the changes were more about reducing traffic congestion and keeping streets safe than discouraging contractors from picking up laborers michael grello , the founder of concerned citizens association of farmingdale , describes the empty storefronts along main street , the gangrelated graffiti he has been seeing recently around the village and a killing and a stabbing that took place in the past two years all of these things relate , in some way , to the presence of the day laborers , he said , though the nassau county police department says there is no connection between the day laborers and gang activity the bottom line is they 're here now and it s not working , mr grello said of the immigrants at a september meeting , the village board announced that it was reviewing the eminent domain plan and had decided to form a committee to study the area by replacing dilapidated housing with new businesses and residential housing we will put valuable property back on the tax rolls , mr graf wrote in an opinion essay in the local newspaper , the farmingdale observer mr graf insists that there is still no specific plan and that the village is simply reviewing what the previous administration had done everyone is concerned about maintaining property values and having their village in the best shape possible , he said it s in our interest to take a look at what s been done before supporters of the plan deny that the project has anything to do with the day laborer issue , saying that most of the workers standing on conklin street come from hempstead , not farmingdale they also say that the village will compensate the tenants and help them find other housing it s not about putting day laborers out of work or removing the latino population out of farmingdale , said mr grello , who supports the eminent domain proposal most people in farmingdale do n't have a problem with the latino population the project , as it now stands , covers about six acres the apartment complex at 150 secatogue is by far the biggest property , with 56 apartments and about 150 people the village attorney , greg w carmen jr , said the project area also includes an office building , a commercial strip along conklin street a pizzeria , a chinese restaurant , a liquor store , a deli and a gas station , one of the main gathering sites for day laborers each morning and 11 multifamily houses and 7 singlefamily homes none of the owners of the multifamily properties live in them the houses are investment properties , and one of the owners happens to be the town clerk , john giordano mr giordano said he had opposed including his property in the plan like the mayor , mr carmen emphasized that the project was still in very early stages , and that every possibility was still on the table but he said the board wanted to put the project on the front burner , and that he had already spoken with developers , engineers and the owners of the properties i think the village wants to see this entire area get redeveloped , through the process of eminent domain or something else , he said we want to revitalize this area mr carmen said that the process would be transparent and that public hearings would be held every step of the way no one disputes that the buildings in this area are run down mr tosini , the 150 secatogue landlord , has been issued citations for 14 code violations , including wall and ceiling damage , roof holes , vermin and mold , according to mr carmen tenants complain of a lack of hot water and heat during the winter , and standing outside , one can see paint peeling off the doors and windows mr tosini said that he had recently installed new boilers , but that generally he was not investing in improvements because he was waiting to see what the village was going to do it would n't make sense for me to do the capital improvements if the buildings are not going to be there , he said at this point , further deterioration of the buildings may not be a factor in whether or not the village designates the area as blighted and proceeds with eminent domain in fact , legal experts say , the definition of blight is so vague that the village would hardly have to make a case for it at all it is a totally meaningless , amorphous term , said gideon kanner , a professor emeritus at loyola law school in los angeles and a specialist in eminent domain law mr kanner said that courts , particularly in new york state , have repeatedly deferred to municipalities' definitions of blight , while municipalities have been stretching the definition to mean any area that could bring in more tax dollars if it were redeveloped dana berliner , a senior attorney at the institute for justice , a publicinterest law firm in washington , agreed blight in new york is basically going to be the same thing as approving this study that says there s something wrong with the area and it must be changed , she said courts generally support economic redevelopment efforts , and because of this , opponents of redevelopment projects have to act quickly once they designate it as a redevelopment area and approve a project , ms berliner said , there s a short window of time to object to the future condemnation of the property for local immigrant advocacy groups , that window opened in october they have been meeting with tenants in a little office a few blocks away from 150 secatogue one night a week , after english classes , carlos canales has been teaching some of the tenants of 150 secatogue exactly what eminent domain is and what they can do about it mr canales is a member of the workplace project , a hempsteadbased group that supports latino workers , and he hopes to assemble a solid majority of tenants in organized opposition to what he describes as ethnic cleansing of latinos at the first meeting , on oct 21 , the tenants who were present elected a 15person committee their task is to represent the whole 150 secatogue building , mr canales said to represent the organization to the village and to spread the news , and educate the rest of the tenants five days after the meeting , the tenant of one of the apartments at 150 secatogue called the police about a leaky pipe in the basement the fire department arrived and , seeing smoke , discovered that the water was leaking into a circuit breaker panel around 1 am , after turning off the water , the electricity and the heat , the firefighters went from door to door in the complex , evacuating all the tenants , according to mr giordano the red cross set up a shelter for the residents at the gymnasium of state university of new york at farmingdale , and the village promised residents that they could move back in after the buildings were thoroughly inspected but in a tense atmosphere , rumors of an imminent condemnation were flying , and mr canales met later that day with professor stefan h krieger of the housing rights clinic at hofstra university school of law two legal interns from the clinic , kerry galvin and farrel donald , were appointed to represent five tenants of 150 secatogue they first went to the village officials , questioning the need for the evacuation and inspection of the entire complex most of the 150 secatogue residents moved back in after two days , and now ms galvin and mr donald are studying their options basically our goal is just to make sure that the tenants can remain in the housing complex , ms galvin said that they 're not forced out for any particular reason and that the housing complex stays up to par , that living standards are met in other words , mr donald and ms galvin will be negotiating with both sides , arguing to mr tosini that the property at 150 secatogue is in serious need of repair , while arguing to the village that it is not so blighted as to call for condemnation they said they were not accusing anyone of discrimination but given that the area consists almost entirely of latinos , mr donald said it s definitely an avenue they were thinking about in the wake of the evacuation , the village is performing a full inspection of the property , and has asked permission from mr tosini to enter the apartments of tenants who have not yet registered complaints the code enforcement supervisor , ron craig , says he is compiling a comprehensive report of code violations to submit to the village board the board , not mr craig , holds the power to designate blight but mr craig , who has the power to cite mr tosini for code violations , did say that during the inspections he has been finding situations that do n't appear to meet the standards for habitable conditions despite the lawyers , the tenants are already talking about moving to uniondale or brentwood , giving up their jobs in farmingdale and taking their children out of the local schools dawn mcmahon , a tenant , said she was already looking for apartments elsewhere , saying she is worried that if the property is condemned and if we 're all looking at the same time , it s going to be hard ely chavez , an eightyear resident of the complex who works for a nearby manufacturer of vinyl sheeting , said his daughters were frightened by the recent evacuation and worried that next time everybody was going to be turned out for good he s looking for a place in another part of the island many of the tenants are convinced that the village is trying to get rid of the latino population armando mart nez , a mexican , said he has lived at 150 secatogue for six months asked why he thought the village was condemning his home , he said the village has a problem with the hispanic community in general ms mcmahon , who is white , said i know what this is all about they want my neighbors gone kumar mishra , an engineer from india who has lived at 150 secatogue for three years , said that although he was unsure why the village was going forward with the plan , he had never felt any enmity from the village himself but things had changed , he said , in the past two weeks on the night of the evacuation , he said , he felt the village officials treated him differently it s slow poison , he said it s all a game plan slowly , slowly we can kick these people out , because these are the kind of people who do not pay attention '
as we close in on the first presidential election in the age of the blog , a certain incongruity is hard to miss when it comes to breaking inside stories about how the bush administration made its most significant foreign policy decisions , no medium not the internet , not 24hour cable , not the triedandtrue organs of daily and weekly news reporting is outpacing the lumbering , oldfashioned giant of them all the book and more often than not , it s the book edited by the same person who 30 years ago helped create a thrilling narrative about watergate called all the president s men editors tend to be shadowy figures the power behind the throne of authorship , as it were and none is more fiercely private than alice mayhew , the editorial director of simon schuster even longtime colleagues confess ignorance of basic biographical details , like her age and where she grew up when approached for a story on her influence , mayhew replied with characteristic modesty \( and bluntness \) , i do n't think that s legitimate nonetheless , she is that rare book editor whose name is known outside the confines of the publishing industry , and whose books have consistently made news through seven presidencies one of her authors , the new york times columnist david brooks , calls her the best nonfiction editor in america this year s mayhewedited blockbusters include bob woodward s plan of attack , ron suskind s price of loyalty and craig unger s house of bush , house of saud although the bulk of her output consists of popular histories , her influence is most conspicuous in the genre she has helped pioneer the heavily reported , narratively driven journalistic volume about the inner workings of government the washington book robert barnett , a washingtonbased lawyer who represents some of mayhew s authors , including woodward , says she s great at taking things that are in the daily reporting cycle and putting them into book form with new material that goes beyond what you get daily these are books that look back , but not years later critics complain that in their contemporaneity , some of these books lack literary art and analytical depth plotdriven and crowded with crudely drawn characters , they do sometimes read like backroom melodramas but they also offer information not obtainable by reporters pressed to publish every day , who have to worry about maintaining relationships with sensitive sources every so often , events converge to place these books at the center of public discussion this year an election year with a secretive white house , a polarized public and an increasingly unpopular war is one of those moments simon schuster occupies an office block on sixth avenue between 48th and 49th streets , not far from rockefeller center mayhew s booklined office on the fourth floor is spacious but livedin , her desk crowded with work in progress some of her recently published books face front on the shelf behind her desk james chace s 1912 , brooks s on paradise drive mayhew herself is a diminutive woman with a flat , raspy voice and an animated face if she does n't agree with what she s hearing which is often , colleagues will tell you she s quick to say so and pulls no punches but her intelligence is not just the piercing , discomforting kind it s also the sort that gives rise to roving curiosity and eclectic enthusiasms her authors speak of her with a mixture of trepidation , respect and affection they describe her as rigorous , toughminded , attentive and engaged and they add that conversation over lunch with her sometimes turns to her excitement over the shaping of another author s book not out of lack of interest in the business at hand , but from an overflow of interest in everything she s working on mayhew s greatest talents , say authors , agents and editors who have worked with her , lie in conceptualizing and structuring the nonfiction narrative she is particularly adept at unearthing submerged themes , developing swift transitions , unsentimentally pruning away digressions , even when especially when they are hundreds of pages long mayhew s faith in chronological organization is said to be nearly religious it s unmistakable in the woodward books , which sometimes seem to move relentlessly through time even when all other motors have stalled but she is flexible , her writers say she thinks creatively about form steven brill , most recently the author of after , recalls that when his 1978 book the teamsters was in development , mayhew , to his consternation , handed him a book on the sinking of the titanic you tell me what the sinking of the titanic has to do with a book about the teamsters , brill complained she said , 'think of this as a narrative form critics , most notably jacob weisberg , writing in 1991 in the new republic , have questioned how much nutsandbolts line editing mayhew actually does but her authors swear by her engagement down to the smallest level of detail alice is the rare combination of an artful line editor and a brilliant conceptualizer , suskind says writers talk about sending her chapters of their books and receiving telephone calls with constructive remarks within hours watching her click into action was phenomenal , says diane mcwhorter , the author of carry me home , a pulitzer prizewinning history of the civil rights struggle in birmingham , ala you ca n't believe she s working on a million different books brill reports that he used mayhew s editorial markings on the first few pages of the teamsters as a teaching aid in a journalism class he gave at yale i tried to teach the kids to be terse that s one of alice s favorite words , he says his manuscript pages from 1977 were covered with wonderful red ink yet mayhew has a light touch like any good editor , she is concerned not about leaving her mark on a book but only about inducing the best performance from the author she herself is a partisan democrat who , according to an editor who once worked as her assistant , viscerally disliked the clintons because of what she saw as their duplicity yet she does not impose her views on others' work , authors say during the 1980 s , when few new york editors took the time , mayhew made repeated scouting trips to washington and she was sure to read the washington post every day james b stewart says he relied on her keen understanding of how washington worked when he was researching blood sport , his bestselling account of the whitewater scandal the clintons had promised to cooperate , he recalls i went to see alice she said , 'i do n't think they 'll ever cooperate with you' until the day the book went to press i was saying 'no , alice , they 'll come around' and then , 'ok , you were right' it s a good thing i listened to her i might have been waiting around forever mayhew s nononsense manner does not work for everyone as the former assistant reported her fierceness can be difficult in the nuanced editorial process some writers ca n't take it and leave others survive and love her precisely for it she s full of opinions there is nothing alice does n't have an opinion on suskind , for one , had no problems with her style we are both pretty loud people , he says i grew up in a house with a lot of noise i'm comfortable with that i do n't find her intimidating mayhew s other major authors almost uniformly praise her editorial attentions but an individual author s experience may well depend on the powerful gutlevel responses mayhew displays toward people and books if she does n't really connect with someone , or with a particular book , writers can get pushed aside , says another of mayhew s former assistants she s hard on books and people we did n't get along , says john b judis , whose 1988 william f buckley biography mayhew acquired for simon schuster i felt she was mean to me according to judis , mayhew changed the title of his book without consulting him , farmed out the editing to a freelancer and was difficult to reach on the telephone though the experience was bruising i felt i was n't treated as an equal , he says judis has come to recognize in the years since that the editing , copyediting , legal and factchecking support he got from mayhew s staff \( including the freelancer \) were first rate in the end , he says my anger diminished and gave way to gratitude she really helped me with that book the washington book , depending on how it s defined , is not new a spate of books about the kennedy administration , written by admiring journalists and insiders like theodore h white , theodore c sorenson and arthur m schlesinger jr , first popularized the contemporaneous political narrative in the 1960 s but all the president s men , published in 1974 , was something different partly because it provided critical , uninvited glimpses into a white house whose corruption astounded even its most cynical detractors it was also because bob woodward and carl bernstein had produced a narrative that remains unusual even today , and even among mayhewedited washington books woodward and bernstein organized their tale around the detective story of their own research the result was less an account of watergate all the president s men takes place well after most of the scandalous deeds had been committed than of its exposure in the washington post in that sense , it was a book as much about journalism as about politics as peter osnos , the publisher and chief executive of the publicaffairs publishing house , notes , normally only war correspondents write books in which a reporter is the protagonist partly thanks to the inherent suspense of its journalistic detective story , all the president s men is a much more compelling read than plan of attack , which comprehensively chronicles the bush administration s march to war in iraq without really advancing an argument or engaging the question of why the administration came to see the war as necessary or desirable in the first place what all the president s men shares with woodward s later solo efforts is its thick detail , loosely sketched characters and flat , sequential construction yet these qualities seem to have become more exaggerated in woodward s recent work , where the profusion of detail is sometimes overwhelming and confusing by comparison , suskind s price of loyalty , an account of the former treasury secretary paul o'neill s disillusionment with the bush administration , is propelled by a spare and clearly directed narrative that cuts through the detail and gives it purpose o'neill told suskind that he experienced a rolling revelation about the nature of the bush white house over the course of his tenure that awakening is the fundamental story suskind set out to tell , and it furnishes a classic novelistic plotline such differences indicate the extent to which mayhew views the author as being ultimately in charge in general , book editing tends to be less invasive than magazine or newspaper editing , which often involves multiple levels of editing and fact checking magazine and newspaper editors generally consider the stories they publish to speak with the voice and authority of the institution book publishers often allow a wider berth for the individual authorial voice that trust in the author can sometimes be misplaced , as mayhew must well know two years ago , two of her most popular authors , stephen ambrose and doris kearns goodwin , were accused of plagiarizing other writers \( no one seriously blamed their editor , but one commentator , timothy noah of slate , suggested mayhew make amends by using her influence to spearhead an industrywide campaign against plagiarism \) there are other costs associated with the lighter touch of book publishing , particularly when the material at hand is highly topical the new republic s literary editor , leon wieseltier , criticizes mayhewstyle books for simply doing the work of daily journalism without the same level of oversight there is something so preposterously transient and fleeting , so onceoverlightly , so egregiously contemporary about these books , wieseltier laments , adding that they do n't break enough journalistic ground to justify their literary clumsiness and lack of historical perspective the stuff coming out in these books is not the hardest stuff anyway , he says we still do n't know who cheney met with for his energy plan , or what tenet and bush knew on sept 10 mostly they confirm what we already knew they just fill in more details still , there is no denying that the high level of frustration within the bush white house has produced fertile ground for reporters like woodward and suskind senior officials in this administration do n't feel they get a fair hearing , suskind says they do n't have the kinds of discussions , white papers , search and find for best answers , that they had when they worked in previous administrations instead , they often find themselves confronted with opaque and nonnegotiable decisions , even within their own areas of expertise and responsibility stymied , even men of loyalty and discretion , like o'neill , colin powell and richard a clarke , all of whom have served in administrations on both sides of the party divide , are taking their cases to the public , either through their own memoirs or through bookwriting journalists in a telephone interview the historian douglas brinkley described this as disloyalty he expressed the belief that figures like powell and clarke should resign on principle rather than continue to serve and proclaim their allegiance , while privately working against white house policies by preparing highly remunerated memoirs or talking to reporters but suskind calls going public trusting truth , and says that part of trusting truth is not worrying about the consequences public dialogue is messy , but it s the best method for figuring out who we are and what we want to do as a country bruce nichols of the free press , the editor of clarke s against all enemies , observes that whistleblowers may be answering to a loyalty more important to them than their loyalty to the president for clarke , the decision was about his own conscience , nichols says clarke felt that the administration s policies were making america less safe and trusting truth has clearly proved useful in generating discussion , not to mention frontpage headlines thanks in part to mayhew and to a host of other editors pursuing these washington best sellers , a genre of book now exists whose publication is a political rather than a literary event there is always a hunger for books that take you inside , that pierce the veil and help readers understand what s going on , the washington literary agent rafe sagalyn says what s most interesting about the evolution of the washington book over the last 30 years , he suggests , is the way it reflects the changing dynamics between the reading public and washington the acolyte memoir stood out in the reagan era , with books by david stockman , donald regan and others under clinton , sagalyn notes , the principals were more interesting and important than their acolytes today , as during the nixon era , a secretive administration has produced a confused public that is hungry for information after 30 years , mayhew is still feeding that hunger what is it that she does best \? sagalyn answers she gets it
washington , sept 27 the same intelligence unit that produced a gloomy report in july about the prospect of growing instability in iraq warned the bush administration about the potential costly consequences of an americanled invasion two months before the war began , government officials said monday the estimate came in two classified reports prepared for president bush in january 2003 by the national intelligence council , an independent group that advises the director of central intelligence the assessments predicted that an americanled invasion of iraq would increase support for political islam and would result in a deeply divided iraqi society prone to violent internal conflict one of the reports also warned of a possible insurgency against the new iraqi government or americanled forces , saying that rogue elements from saddam hussein s government could work with existing terrorist groups or act independently to wage guerrilla warfare , the officials said the assessments also said a war would increase sympathy across the islamic world for some terrorist objectives , at least in the short run , the officials said the contents of the two assessments had not been previously disclosed they were described by the officials after two weeks in which the white house had tried to minimize the council s latest report , which was prepared this summer and read by senior officials early this month last week , mr bush dismissed the latest intelligence reports , saying its authors were just guessing about the future , though he corrected himself later , calling it an estimate the assessments , meant to address the regional implications and internal challenges that iraq would face after mr hussein s ouster , said it was unlikely that iraq would split apart after an american invasion , the officials said but they said there was a significant chance that domestic groups would engage in violent internal conflict with one another unless an occupying force prevented them from doing so senior white house officials , including condoleezza rice , the national security adviser , have contended that some of the early predictions provided to the white house by outside experts of what could go wrong in iraq , including secular strife , have not come to pass but president bush has acknowledged a miscalculation about the virulency of the insurgency that would rise against the american occupation , though he insisted that it was simply an outgrowth of the speed of the initial military victory in 2003 the officials outlined the reports after the columnist robert novak , in a column published monday in the washington post , wrote that a senior intelligence official had said at a west coast gathering last week that the white house had disregarded warnings from intelligence agencies that a war in iraq would intensify antiamerican hostility in the muslim world mr novak identified the official as paul r pillar , the national intelligence officer for the near east and south asia , and criticized him for making remarks that mr novak said were critical of the administration the national intelligence council is an independent group , made up of outside academics and longtime intelligence professionals the cia describes it as the intelligence community s center for midterm and longterm strategic thinking its main task is to produce national intelligence estimates , the most formal reports outlining the consensus of intelligence agencies but it also produces less formal assessments , like the ones about iraq it presented in january 2003 one of the intelligence documents described the building of democracy in iraq as a long , difficult and potentially turbulent process with potential for backsliding into authoritarianism , iraq s traditional political model , the officials said the assessments were described by three government officials who have seen or been briefed on the documents the officials spoke on condition that neither they nor their agencies be identified none of the officials are affiliated in any way with the campaigns of mr bush or senator john kerry the officials , who were interviewed separately , declined to quote directly from the documents , but said they were speaking out to present an accurate picture of the prewar warnings the officials' descriptions portray assessments that are gloomier than the predictions by some administration officials , most notably those of vice president dick cheney but in general , the warnings about antiamerican sentiment and instability appear to have been upheld by events , and their disclosure could prove politically damaging to the white house , which has already had to contend with the disclosure that the national intelligence estimate prepared by the council in july presented a far darker prognosis for iraq through the end of 2005 than mr bush has done in his statements the reports issued by the intelligence council are of two basic types those that try to assess intelligence data , like the october 2002 document that assessed the state of iraq s unconventional weapons programs , and broader predictions about foreign political developments the group s national intelligence estimate about iraqi weapons has now been widely discredited for wildly overestimating the country s capabilities members of the intelligence council have complained that they were pressured to write the document too quickly and that important qualifiers were buried the group s recent national intelligence estimate , prepared in july this year , with its gloomy picture of iraq s future , was described by white house officials in the past two weeks as an academic document that contained little evidence and little that was new it was finished in july , and not circulated by the intelligence community until the end of august , said one senior administration official that s not exactly what you do with an urgent document mr pillar , who has held his post since october 2000 , is highly regarded within the cia but he has been a polarizing figure within the administration , particularly within the defense department , where senior civilians who were among the most vigorous champions of a war in iraq derided him as being too dismissive of the threat posed by mr hussein a cia spokesman said monday that mr pillar was not available for comment and that his comments at the west coast session had been made on the condition that he not be identified an intelligence official said mr pillar had supervised the drafting of the document , but the official emphasized that it reflected the views of 15 intelligence agencies , including the defense intelligence agency , the national security agency , and the state department s bureau of intelligence and research a spokesman for the national security council , sean mccormack , said monday that we do n't comment on intelligence and classified reports , and he would not say whether mr bush had read the january 2003 reports but he said the president was fully aware of all the challenges prior to making the decision to go to war , and we addressed these challenges in our policies and we also addressed these challenges in public , he added a senior administration official likened mr bush s decision to a patient s decision to have risky surgery , even if doctors warn that there could be serious side effects we could n't live with the status quo , the official said , because as a result of the status quo in the middle east , we were dying , and we saw the evidence of that on sept 11 officials who have read the july 2004 national intelligence estimate have said that even as a bestcase situation , it predicted a period of tenuous stability for iraq between now and the end of 2005 the worst of three cases cited in the document was that developments could lead to civil war , the officials have said some democratic senators have asked that the document be declassified , but administration officials have called that prospect unlikely the white house has also sought to minimize the significance of the estimate , with mr bush saying that intelligence agencies had laid out several scenarios that said , life could be lousy , life could be ok or life could be better , and they were just guessing as to what the conditions might be like mr bush later corrected himself , saying that he should have used the word estimate democrats have contrasted the dark tone of the intelligence report with the more upbeat descriptions of iraq s prospects offered by the administration the white house has defended its approach , saying that it is the job of intelligence analysts to identify challenges , and the job of policy makers to overcome them but administration officials have also emphasized that the white house was not given a copy of the document until aug 31 , only about two weeks before it was made public by the new york times in an interview on fox news sunday , secretary of state colin l powell acknowledged that we have seen an increase in antiamericanism in the muslim world since the war began mr powell also said the insurgency in iraq was getting worse as forces opposed to the united states and the new iraqi leadership remained determined to disrupt the election set for january correction september 29 , 2004 , wednesday a frontpage article yesterday about prewar intelligence assessments on iraq misidentified the television program on which secretary of state colin l powell discussed them on sunday it was abc s this week , not fox news sunday , on which he appeared the same day
a suicide bomber driving an ambulance blew himself up wednesday morning in downtown baghdad , shearing the facade off a hotel , killing at least 3 people and wounding more than 15 the bomber was driving more than 100 miles an hour when he swerved around a concrete barrier , dodged a blast of gunfire from policemen and detonated the explosion at the shaheen hotel about 7 am , iraqi police officials said we saw him , we shot at him , but it was too late , said sgt thaer abdullah of the diplomatic protective services , an iraqi security agency with offices across the street from the hotel , where many foreign contractors stay he was driving so fast the blast ripped a wide gash in the street in front of the hotel and showered car parts over a severalblock radius bed sheets from ravaged hotel rooms were twisted around trees and telephone wires burst pipes gushed water over the rubble within minutes , american soldiers sealed off the area and helped carry away the casualties the iraqi police said one of the dead was a south african working for a british firm his body lay under a blanket as american soldiers pushed back an angry crowd an explosion struck an iraqi security patrol in baquba , 40 miles north of baghdad , early thursday , and witnesses said they believed there were many casualties , reuters reported there were no other details on thursday morning as in many recent attacks , most of the injured on wednesday were iraqis , this time newly minted officers of the diplomatic protective services iraqi police officials said it was just as likely that the security agency was the target of the bombing as the fancy , threestory hotel 100 feet away but they also pointed out that the interim minister of labor and social affairs , sami izara almajoun , was staying at the hotel this will not end until the americans leave , shouted zenab abdul hussein , an office worker at the security services they blame iraqis for the violence they must blame themselves none of the wounded iraqi security officers had helmets or flak jackets why is it americans have all these things \? and our boys have nothing \? ms hussein said , pointing to two american soldiers wearing body armor some of the wounded were taken to the ibn alnafis hospital , nearby there , in a room with a bald concrete floor , a father looked down at his son , a guard with the security service my dear , what s wrong with you \? the father asked his son , wounded in the neck and chest , looked up from his hospital bed and blinked the father started to cry a nurse quietly led him away the attack was the most destructive bombing in baghdad since a 1 , 000pound truck bomb exploded on jan 18 at the front gate of the fortified compound housing the headquarters of the military occupation forces in iraq , killing at least 25 it followed several days of attacks against american soldiers , civilians and iraqi security services around the country in another hotel a mile and a half away , hundreds of iraqi civic leaders gathered for a townhall session on democracy sponsored by the american occupation powers and the americanappointed iraqi governing council the palestine hotel , where the civic leaders met for about four hours , the target of insurgent attacks in recent months , is now heavily defended after hearing speeches by council members and representatives of the baghdad city government , the participants sat down in groups at small tables to discuss topics like the decentralization of power in a federal system , the role of women , and other issues facing the country we must give women 25 percent of the seats in local city councils , declared one member of the audience when his turn came before the microphones and the men must demand rights for women , too elsewhere , delegates held mininews conferences on security , the guerrilla war , crime , how to hold free elections and the role that the united nations could play in bringing iraq to its feet also on wednesday , l paul bremer iii , the civilian administrator of the occupation , issued a short statement saying that the united states would take a tough approach toward kurdish groups opposed to the turkish government that have used iraq as a refuge the kurdistan workers' party and its aliases , the kurdistan freedom and democracy congress and the kurdistan people s congress , are terrorist organizations and have been designated as such under us law , mr bremer said the coalition provisional authority , coalition forces and iraqi security forces will treat the groups as terrorists the statement also said , there is no place for terrorism or terrorist organizations in the new iraq
if the drama unfolding around the walt disney company were a movie , you might call it six degrees of martin lipton mr lipton is the longtime lawyer and good friend of barry diller , the chief executive of interactivecorp , and has bailed him out of a handful of messes over the years mr diller , in turn , is perhaps the closest hollywood friend of michael d eisner , the embattled chief of disney , with a history that goes back to when the two worked together at abc in 1966 and , at paramount in the 1970 s so when the comcast corporation made its 54 billion hostile offer for disney , mr eisner knew just whom to call that s right , mr lipton after all , the bid was as much a takeover offer as it was a referendum on mr eisner s management there is just one small problem mr lipton , the respected takeover lawyer who was a founder of wachtell , lipton , rosen katz and invented the poison pill that has been used to thwart wouldbe corporate raiders , was hired by mr eisner to advise disney s board whose job it was to consider firing him and guess who has n't lost his job yet \? it would be classic for michael to turn to marty to come in and use legal reasons to keep people in line , said sarah ab teslik , executive director of the council of institutional investors , who has been critical of some of mr lipton s relationships with his clients indeed , if there was any dissension on disney s board about the fate of mr eisner before mr lipton arrived on the scene , there is none now with mr lipton in , out went cravath , swaine moore , the whiteshoe law firm that had been working with the disney board to help swat away roy e disney s mob of irate shareholders cravath could hardly be counted on to rescue the company and protect mr eisner s job \( technically , cravath resigned the account , but what else could it do \? \) after mr lipton s arrival , several independent disney directors raised the issue of whether they should be seeking out their own lawyers and bankers to help evaluate the situation separately from mr eisner and management naturally , the idea was summarily rejected , according to executives close to the board the board s other advisers were hardly independent , either alan d schwartz , president and cochief executive of bear stearns , is a close friend and longtime adviser to mr eisner gene t sykes , a managing director of goldman sachs , has similarly had a long relationship with mr eisner , as has morton a pierce , a partner in dewey ballantine , the company s regular outside counsel of course , new independent advisers would interfere with mr lipton s game plan in a telling memorandum mr lipton sent to all his clients last year , he wrote , there is no need for the board to create a special committee to deal with a major transaction , even a hostile takeover , and experience shows that a major transaction is best addressed by the full board that advice may be right under some circumstances , but between comcast s bid for disney and roy disney s effort to oust mr eisner , it is hard to believe that any adviser hired to be a sage and savior on both issues could be anything but conflicted mr lipton declined to comment a spokesman for disney called him a worldrenowned lawyer and expert whose reputation and integrity are beyond reproach now back to six degrees in his latest role , mr lipton is working against one of his biggest former clients c michael armstrong , who used to run att but is currently chairman of comcast still , some conspiracy theorists on wall street believe mr lipton may have his own reasons to want to beat back comcast and its chief , brian l roberts payback a brief history lesson mr lipton represented mr diller s qvc in its planned sale to cbs in 1994 that was going to be a very big deal and even bigger for mr lipton had the transaction been completed , wachtell lipton would probably have become the de facto law firm for the combined company yes , displacing cravath you can see the dollar signs even now but it was n't to be mr roberts , along with his father , ralph , and john c malone of liberty media came out of nowhere with their own bid for qvc , dashing mr lipton s chance foiling mr roberts s takeover of disney might be sweet revenge for mr lipton but even if he succeeds , he still has his work cut out for him trying to salvage mr eisner , whose troubles only worsened last week with the miserable boxoffice performance of his company s new 100 million movie titled , fittingly enough , the alamo
the stock market is surging and the economy appears to be booming , but judith pike is getting out of business i'm finished i'm out of here , said mrs pike , owner of acme grinding , whose customers have been vanishing and whose work force has shrunk from 40 to 4 two days before christmas , mrs pike sold her business and more than 40 machines used to grind and finish metal parts it will be for pennies on the dollar , she said less than what it cost to buy just one of these machines considering that nearly every scrap of data suggests that the american economy has finally climbed out of the doldrums and is humming at its fastest pace in at least four years , mrs pike s timing may seem unfortunate but here in rockford , and in the nation as a whole , factory owners like her have seen their worlds turned upside down and their struggle goes a long way toward explaining why this continues to be such a joyless recovery more than 11 , 000 jobs have disappeared in and around rockford in the last three years , and many of those are not expected to return motorola shut down a big repair plant not far from mrs pike s company last year , eliminating more than 1 , 000 jobs , even as it invested 19 billion in a new electronics factory in china textron is closing several factories that make metal fasteners and industrial parks are swimming in for sale and for lease signs we 've been through downturns before , but this time it s different , said malcolm anderberg , owner of dial machine inc , which does contract manufacturing this time , the work is leaving the country , and it s not coming back in part , this is an old story and one not unique to rockford manufacturers have been shedding jobs in the united states for decades , moving plants to lowwage countries or squeezing ever more production from fewer workers at home but the process accelerated recently , with manufacturers trimming a whopping 28 million jobs over the last three years alone a study published in august by the federal reserve bank of new york concluded that more than half of those job losses stemmed from structural changes and were likely permanent history leaves little doubt that new jobs will eventually replace the old , and that workers' incomes can still rise but the outlook for the short and medium term remains grim this is the second jobless recovery , the first having occurred after the slowdown in 1990 and 1991 before then , factories in cyclical industries had tended to be the biggest source of employment gains once the economy began to revive now the bounce has to come from other areas and this time , even those sectors have been less than gungho about hiring still , rockford has become a case study of how an industrial area can respond to a shifting economic landscape this city has long been synonymous with manufacturing it has scores of automobile suppliers , toolanddie makers , machinetool producers and small companies that provide contract manufacturing services the unemployment rate is nearly 11 percent in the city and about 8 percent in the surrounding rock river valley , much higher than the national average of 59 percent but the news is not all bleak confronted with the choice between adapting or dying off , rockford has tried to reinvent itself we are in a global economy , and we are in the throes of a major transformation , said robert levin , executive director of the council of 100 , a businesspromotion group here rockford s sprawling airport , which has almost no passenger traffic , has become a fastgrowing cargo handling center united parcel service employs 1 , 500 people there , making the airport its secondlargest hub , after louisville , ky all told , 3 , 000 people work at the airport , which handled 14 billion pounds of freight last year telephone call centers just outside town employ about 5 , 000 people , mostly parttime workers who earn about 10 an hour the pay is lower than in most factories , and many people worry that even these jobs will be pulled away to the fastgrowing call centers of india or the philippines but mci , the longdistance carrier , has built a center with more than 1 , 000 workers and is still hiring rockford is also becoming a bedroom community new housing developments are attracting people from chicago s western suburbs , about 70 miles away \( the prospect of fourbedroom homes for 169 , 000 seems to make the commute more tolerable \) reflecting the influx , walmart , which already owns one big store outside town , is building two more in the area target and home depot are each opening a second store in the area as well so far , none of this has come close to filling the void left by the loss of manufacturing jobs the big question is whether the remaining industries also transform themselves or move away entirely the answer could determine the shape of the economic expansion in the months and years ahead though more extreme than in some other parts of the country , rockford s unemployment problems fit in with a broader national trend like their counterparts elsewhere , many executives here are increasingly confident that business is picking up , but they are also reluctant to hire extra workers companies are either convinced that they can extract more productivity from the employees they already have or are worried that they will be overstaffed if the expansion turns out to be another false start most evidence suggests that the economy is moving into high gear after one of the feeblest recoveries in history economic growth soared at an annual rate of 82 percent in the third quarter of 2003 , and economists say they think it will climb nearly 4 percent this year business spending , the weakest component of the economy more than a year after the recession officially ended , is now growing rapidly orders for new equipment shot up at the fastest pace in 20 years in december , rising for the sixth month in a row , according to a survey by the institute for supply management that was released on friday industrial production jumped 09 percent in november , the third increase in a row and the biggest in four years , according to the federal reserve perhaps most encouraging , the increases were spread across most sectors of industry despite all the good news , employment continues to climb much more slowly than in previous recoveries many people took heart when the labor department reported that the economy added a total of 236 , 000 jobs in september and october but just 57 , 000 jobs were created in november , and most employers remain cautious about expanding their payrolls given the growth of the workingage population , the nation needs to add around 250 , 000 jobs a month to achieve a significant decline in unemployment before the november election economists are skeptical that job creation will hit that pace , in part because companies of all types have been getting ever more work out of the same number of workers productivity climbed at an annual rate of 94 percent in the third quarter of 2003 , and it has risen at an annual rate of 5 percent for the last several quarters if the pace continues at anywhere near that level , the economy would have to grow by far more than 4 percent a year to bring down the jobless rate china is the other big factor lobbyists for manufacturers attribute many of their woes to that nation , which is running a trade surplus with the united states of roughly 125 billion but a large percentage of chinese imports come from subcontractors of american manufacturers , which are themselves trying to take advantage of china s low costs whether jobs are being lost to china or merely to higher productivity , many companies remain nervous about hiring even if business is picking up it s busier for us than it has been for the past four years , said eric anderberg , general manager of dial machine and the son of the founder the problem is , there s nothing that gives me the sense of a sustained recovery founded in 1890 at the dawn of the automotive era , rockford powertrain , a maker of transmission equipment for heavyduty trucks , is still profitable and exports its products all over the world but these days , it does little manufacturing its main business is logistics we want to stay in rockford , said thomas m corcoran , the company s president we just do n't want to manufacture here over the past decade , rockford powertrain has stopped producing most of its components at home and started buying almost all of them abroad from south korea , poland , germany and , most of all , china the number of employees in rockford has dropped from 800 in 1988 to 250 , and the work is limited largely to assembly , quality control and management in october , mr corcoran took his international plans further , selling what he called a substantial minority stake in the company to the wanxiang group , one of china s largest auto parts suppliers the deal , he said , will give him more reliable access to a major chinese supplier and to the booming chinese market there may be more deals like that to come given the globalization of both suppliers and customers , he said he could imagine selling off additional stakes to investors in india , germany and other countries rockford powertrain still occupies a 625 , 000squarefoot factory here , but that , too , is changing two weeks ago , mr corcoran agreed to sell the plant and lease back about half the space until he can move the company to a smaller and more appropriate location the plant was designed for a different business model , mr corcoran said we do n't need that much space today rockford powertrain is but one example of a broader shift away from domestic manufacturing , a trend that appears to have accelerated sharply since the economic downturn in 2001 intense global competition is expected to force factories to keep squeezing their work forces and to focus tightly on areas where they have a special technological edge or can offer highly customized services even if some manufacturing companies remain vibrant , they are not expected to supply many new jobs , and the real economic growth will continue to come from services the relative decline in manufacturing employment is real , as is the decline in the manufacturing share of national income , said n gregory mankiw , chairman of the white house council of economic advisers , in a speech last month mr mankiw compared the trend in manufacturing to that in farming over the last century farm production has increased , but the proportion of people working in agriculture has dropped from 40 percent a century ago to 2 percent now both job creation and job destruction are part of the process by which countries gain from trade , he said free trade encourages each country to specialize in what it does best it thereby raises national incomes both at home and abroad in rockford , industry is far from dead but business has been transformed , often with great pain one of the few thriving metalworking industries here is the business of scrap metal mainly because of voracious demand from chinese steel mills some of the metal is discarded industrial machinery from factories that have closed china has a need for a tremendous amount of raw material , said bill day , chief financial officer at joseph behr sons , a large trader in scrap metal here generally , production at home is becoming less important than logistics and shipping companies that once sold easytoreplicate products to nearby car companies are being bypassed by distant rivals in china we have lost our technological edge , our pricing edge and in many cases our quality advantage , said eric anderberg of dial machine , testifying before a recent panel on manufacturing that was convened by the commerce department carl bradberry , owner of a small machining shop near rockford called sb jig grinding , produces machine parts engineered to a precision of less than the diameter of a human hair mr bradberry took out a second mortgage on his vacation cabin to keep the company going , and in november he saw his first profit in nearly four years but even now , many of his machines are idle increasingly , the companies that survive are those that function like boutiques they offer specialized products with unusual craftsmanship , and they deliver on short notice north american tool , which makes precision tool parts , was able to retain its 100 employees over the last three years and is now beginning to have a solid pickup in demand but it specializes in customized parts ordered by the dozens rather than the thousands , and it has shrunk its delivery time on most orders to just one day even with all that , company executives say they must constantly look for new market niches or the next idea the good old days are gone for good , said roger k taylor , the chief executive i do n't know what our company will be doing in two years , but it will almost certainly be different from what it looks like today here is robert o'brien s next big idea nonstop passenger flights between rockford and budapest as in hungary farfetched \? not necessarily as executive director of the northwest chicagoland regional airport , rockford s sprawling but underused airport , mr o'brien is confident that this region is on the verge of becoming a major logistical center though it is big enough to handle boeing 747 s and military transport planes , the airport has become so overshadowed by o'hare international in chicago that it has had virtually no passenger air service for more than a decade but rather than go out of business , the rockford airport has turned itself into a busy cargo center in addition to the ups hub , the airport also houses some operations of bax global and dhl , two other big shipping concerns that transformation mirrors a strategic shift for the rock river valley area manufacturing is either stagnant or in decline , but transportation and logistics are booming in the town of rochelle , 30 miles to the south , the union pacific corporation has built a new intermodal transportation center that it hopes will become a major transfer point for truck and rail cargo local officials say they have a big opportunity to steal cargo business from chicago i think we 're sitting on top of a gold mine , said mr o'brien , the airport executive but even with the increase in cargo traffic , he said the airport was still operating at less than 10 percent of its capacity so he and other local leaders want to resurrect passenger air service knowing they had no chance to compete against o'hare on flights to most american cities , they decided to focus on specialty routes and littleknown airlines in august , transmeridian airlines , a small charter company , started regular flights to las vegas and orlando , fla the service has carried about 11 , 000 passengers so far , mr o'brien said now he is pushing a deal with malev , the hungarian airline , to offer regular nonstop flights between rockford and budapest demand for that route may seem limited , but rockford officials say malev would attract tens of thousands of american travelers who would use budapest as a lowcost jumpingoff point to the rest of europe mr o'brien envisions rockford playing host to an array of lowcost airlines , domestic and international , that would offer travelers low prices in exchange for destinations that are slightly less convenient last month , rockford officials welcomed hungary s ambassador to the united states and executives from malev the hungarians said they were intrigued , but they have not yet bought into the idea if they do not , mr o'brien says , he has other deals in the works
marion jones , lunging out of breath with the baton and failing to catch lauryn williams for a handoff in the women s 4x100meter relay , produced a jarring image of her diminished role at the athens games it was an image deedee trotter tried to erase as she ran the first leg of the 4x400meter relay on saturday night over all , it just drove our team to want to regain some of the respect that was lost yesterday and kind of bring it home , trotter said the united states won its third straight 4x400 relay , in 3 minutes 1901 seconds russia was second , in 3 2016 , and jamaica was third \( 3 2200 \) that was the last track and field gold medal the american women won in athens and only the second gold of six medals over all that total is one fewer than the women won at the sydney games in 2000 and at the atlanta games in 1996 , and the lowest total since 1976 , when they won three medals the men s track team won 18 medals here , including six gold , with only the marathon left , and that is an unlikely medal event for the united states at the sydney games , jones accounted for three of the four gold medals won by the women and five of the team s seven total medals in athens , she won none jones has spent the last year under investigation for potential use of performanceenhancing drugs she was not the same this season , her first since taking off 2003 to have a baby she failed to make the united states team in the 100 and 200 meters , in which she won gold in 2000 she pulled out of the 200 before the final at the olympic trials , citing fatigue that could have been a red flag for the united states coaches yet sue humphrey , the head coach , put jones on the 4x100 relay team after torri edwards was barred from the games for taking a prohibited stimulant and gail devers opted out of the relay humphrey still had a reserve of young runners allyson felix , 18 , the silver medalist in the 200 , had attended all the mandatory practices of the relay camp her coach , pat connolly , said that felix was allowed to take only limited handoffs with the a squad it s all political , connolly said wednesday at some point , speed has to account for something on friday , it accounted for nothing when the team botched a handoff on saturday , in analyzing what went wrong in the relay , some questioned williams s culpability jones , they noted , took six attempts in the long jump before running the relay the sad thing is that marion was on the team at all , said carol lewis , a former olympic long jumper and now a commentator for nbc she had to take six long jumps that s 40 meters six times it does not make sense lewis said that she saw jones hit williams s right hand the first time , but that they did not truly connect jones did not continue running through the 20meter exchange zone at full speed and was in the center of the lane , rather than on the inside , as she should have been , lewis said when lauryn pointed the finger at herself , marion should have stepped up and taken some of the blame , lewis said the united states coaches defended their choice of jones we made the right decision with the right people , said curtis frye , the women s relay coach humphrey said the problem was with both williams , who left early , and jones , who slowed down the men s team swept the 200 and the 400 meters for the first time in 100 years , but the women s team did not sweep any event the women took two medals in the 100 hurdles , with joanna hayes winning gold and melissa morrison taking bronze deena kastor became the first american to win a medal in the marathon in 20 years by taking a bronze and the young 4x400 relay members trotter , 21 monique henderson , 21 and sanya richards , 19 along with monique hennagan , 28 produced a glimpse of the future we have athletes right there on the cusp , humphrey said
citigroup , the country s biggest financial services firm , reported record quarterly profits of 527 billion yesterday , but investors drove down the company s shares on lingering fears that an interest rate increase might sideswipe the bank and its competitors in coming months the shares of financial services firms have been pummeled this week because investors fear rising rates may mean lower profits for banks and other companies that lend , borrow and manage money over the last five days , the philadelphia stock exchange kbw bank index , made up of 24 leading national and regional bank stocks , has fallen about 44 percent but analysts said that in the case of citigroup , interest rate fears were overblown they say the bank is well prepared for rate increases and that , absent extreme inflationary pressures that would cause unexpectedly large rate spikes , citigroup should benefit from a rebounding economy and citigroup , which offers a broad mix of consumer and commercial services in 100 countries , is not a typical bank there are lots of things you can nitpick and quibble with in citi s earnings this quarter , but none of them are really consequential , said guy moszkowski , an equity analyst with merrill lynch but this is all rationality talking most investors always have interest rates in the back of their minds with financials and will toss the stocks out and ask questions later citigroup s earnings rose to 527 billion , or 101 a share , from 41 billion , or 79 cents a share , in the first quarter last year few companies in any industry post quarterly earnings that formidable in size citigroup s profits were nearly twice those of its nextlargest commercial banking rival , the bank of america corporation , and exceeded the combined profits of several of its largest competitors in investment banking citigroup s results included an aftertax gain of 180 million , or about 3 cents a share , on the sale of a portion of its electronic funds services business still , shares of citigroup fell 103 , or about 2 percent , to 4992 yesterday since monday , the bank s shares have fallen about 4 percent citi s firing on most cylinders right now , said tanya azarchs , an analyst with standard poor s they definitely are in a class by themselves in terms of the size of the organization and its diversity during the quarter , citigroup posted doubledigit income growth in each of its nine major product areas and in all its geographic regions the bank provides products and services that include credit cards , mortgage loans , retail banking , brokerage services , equity underwriting and corporate lending todd s thomson , chief financial officer of citigroup , said in an interview that he was mystified at the stock market s focus on interest rate fears he noted that 40 percent of the bank s income comes from outside the united states , making it less exposed than other banks to the domestic interest rate environment , and that half of citigroup s revenue comes from feebased services , making it much less dependent on the old breadandbutter banking business of pocketing the interest rate spread between loans and deposits mr thomson also said that citigroup was upbeat about global economic improvements and that benefits from a rebound in the domestic economy will offset any troubles associated with rising interest rates if interest rates are rising because the economy is improving , that means more retail sales , more employment , better credit costs on the consumer side , and more activity on the corporate side , all of which is good for us , mr thomson said the revenue that will provide our company will more than outweigh shortterm negative interest rate increases others agreed i think investors are being myopic because i do n't think interest rates are a big issue for them , said steven wharton , an analyst with loomis sayles company a measure of the bank s optimism is that it lowered its corporate loanloss reserve by 150 million in the quarter and expects to lower reserves further in the future the total loanloss reserve stands at 4 billion , a reflection of the major credit losses banks suffered in recent years because of illadvised or illtimed loans to corporate borrowers citigroup s first quarter was distinguished by strong improvements in its overseas units trouble spots abroad , particularly japan and argentina , have become less of a problem , and broader economic and business gains in asia and the middle east also helped the bottom line revenue in the quarter was 215 billion , up 16 percent from the period last year , fueled in large part by a consumer business that ms azarchs said was cranking along at an accelerating pace the consumer business had profits of about 26 billion in the quarter , while the corporate business posted earnings of 17 billion private client services and investmentmanagement activities kicked in the bulk of the quarter s remaining profits the bank s robust finances have not satisfied some large investors , including two large state pension funds in california and new york that plan to make an issue of citigroup s corporate governance policies at the bank s annual meeting next tuesday the funds are opposing the reelection of sanford i weill , citigroup s chairman , and charles o prince , its chief executive , to the board the funds have expressed concern about mr weill s role in past problems at the bank and have raised questions about mr prince s ability to bring an objective eye to board matters citigroup disputed the criticisms in public statements this week for his part , mr prince stayed focused on the bottom line yesterday citigroup s record firstquarter performance demonstrates our unique ability

a return trip to 'the cooler' maria bello , a once and future new yorker , read the script for the cooler , where she plays a las vegas cocktail waitress looking for luck , when she was in new york two years ago later this month , ms bello faces holly hunter , patricia clarkson , hope davis and ren e zellweger for the golden globe award for best supporting actress in a motion picture ms bello said she had to fight for the role with a videotape audition and urgent importuning i heard first i was too pretty , she said by telephone yesterday then i heard they were looking for some gorgeous , you know , actress , who was , you know , kind of a bigger name than i am luckily the film s director , wayne kramer , was familiar with ms bello from er on which she played dr anna del amico , putupon physician ms bello and the director agreed on how to approach her role in the cooler unlike some reviewers' summaries of her character , ms bello said , it s so far removed from that idea of the hooker with the heart of gold i think she wears her heart on her sleeve in addition to her affecting performance , the film s most talkedabout scenes are the nude ones between ms bello and william h macy in their naturalism , the scenes recall the nude scene with julie christie and donald sutherland in do n't look now , nicolas roeg s film from the mid70 s what really makes them different from most mainstream hollywood movies that you see , ms bello said about her nude scenes , is that they 're real people with real bodies and they 're not in perfect lighting she added , we really worked on it not being very graceful still , as goodnatured revenge for having a whole crew of camera operators , electricians and grips see them nude for a week , she and mr macy organized what we will call a showusyourhindquarters party at a reno restaurant , members of the crew were required to take polaroids of themselves before they could get drinks the photographs were publicly displayed , a variety of gluteus muscles scrutinized , and then glasses raised in acclamation or derision the funny thing is , we do n't know where those pictures are , said ms bello , who plans to move back to new york in a few months someone s going to blackmail everyone ! making sure his head does n't swell after a miserable 412 record this season , none of the new york giants could resort to the babe ruth answer for why he was paid more than the president of the united states i , said the babe , had a better year despite his nonchampionship season , dhani jones , 25 , a giants linebacker , is nonetheless ever vigilant against the swelling of his own head to guard against creeping egotism , he said on tuesday night at a muscular dystrophy association benefit at chelsea piers , he retreats to the subway and plays a makeshift musical instrument for spare change a lot of times when you play in new york , people put you on a pedestal , you hear the cheers , said mr jones , dressed in a gray pinstriped suit and a purpleandblack bow tie you start to think that you are important down in the subway , usually somewhere along the d line , mr jones said , he dresses in blue jeans with paint stains and plays a washboard bass the most he made was 485 it s a dose of reality for me , he said it helps my ego and she can act , too ! alone among the celebrities at the eric lindros celebrity minigolf classic at madison square garden on tuesday night , chlo sevigny actually attempted some minigolf and her connecticut friends , who accompanied the actress to the charity event , said she was a big hockey fan and played goalie in street hockey all the time ms sevigny demurred i really do n't know anything , she said still , she did notice that there was a difference between basketball players and hockey players i thought they would be bigger , she said of the few new york rangers present it s not like when you go to a knicks function with joe brescia and melena z ryzik
the two buildings just across the railroad tracks and inside the metal gates have a sort of hanselandgretel quality they are prim white with green shutters and trim , with lush , forestlike vegetation all around the building to the right has a cute aframe roof and a road beside it , where you can almost imagine a trail of goodies leading into the woods for golfers , truly , that trail beside that aframe is a road to valhalla , as pine valley golf club is perennially rated the top course in the country but for the 20 residents of pine valley , the borough that surrounds the golf course , the cute aframe building is police headquarters , next door to steiniger hall , the borough office building , where you can often find robert mathers , the clerk of pine valley , one of new jersey s leastpopulous towns we operate in the same respect as any other town in the state we are small in stature , that s all , mr mathers said recently we have a construction department as far as meeting state codes we have a police department four regulars and three parttimers we have an assessor and me and there is always something that needs to be done small as new jersey is , it has 566 municipalities , a vestige of the state s independent character some , like newark , jersey city , paterson and trenton , are large and have myriad bureaucracies and services but others have barely enough residents to fill an auditorium there are cape may point \( population 241 \) and diamond beach \( population 218 \) in cape may county , rockleigh \( population 391 \) in bergen county and loch arbour \( population 280 \) in monmouth county altogether , there are 30 incorporated towns in new jersey with fewer than 1 , 000 residents , according to the 2000 census four of them have fewer than 50 souls walpack \( 41 \) in sussex county , teterboro \( 18 \) in bergen county and pine valley and tavistock \( 24 \) in camden county new jersey is a perfect example of creative localism , said michael aaron rockland , the chairman of american studies at rutgers university from way back , the hallmark of freedom and liberty in the state was to keep things small and decentralized the idea that the more you centralize , the less you have citizen involvement and caring on local issues we have long been an involved state just about everyone in tavistock is involved , to be sure , and always has been actually , tavistock is infinitely larger today than it was when it was founded in 1921 it was a town without residents when it was formed , said kathy tassini , the librarian of the historical society of haddonfield , the town that borders on and provides most services for tavistock basically , it was made to play golf on sundays frank middleton , who owned the old nonworking gill farm in center township , next to haddonfield , was upset that he and his buddies were thwarted by blue laws from golfing on sundays at the haddon country club in haddonfield they formed a committee and , given easy secession laws as they were in new jersey at the time , mr middleton donated his land for the new town in time , a few houses were built adjacent to tavistock country club though the official figures from the census note 24 people , ms tassini says there are really only 11 residents , making it new jersey s smallest town , beating out teterboro by 7 they must have counted the houses on the other side of the street , which are really in haddonfield , she said everyone in tavistock gets to be a part of town government the eight registered voters elect three commissioners , who then select a mayor among them george j buff iii is only the third mayor in the borough s history , and he has been in office 10 years mr buff appoints a fivemember school board , which meets once a year to pass a budget basically sending payments to haddonfield for the borough s three schoolchildren the commission meets every fourth tuesday in the borough hall at the 10th hole of the tavistock golf course the idea that places like tavistock had to have a school board without having any schools or even that there should be a place as small as tavistock at all in new jersey so confounded the late assembly leader alan karcher that he wrote a book about it , new jersey s multiple municipal madness \( rutgers press , 1998 \) that experts cite as the best on the subject one chapter , for instance , is called shrewsbury , the incredible shrinking township , and shows how , one after another , 74 other municipalities separated themselves over the 19th and early 20th century from shrewsbury , so that now , the original township has only 56 acres one of those splitoffs was ocean township seaside realestate developers there found in 1849 that their interests conflicted with the farming and industrial ones of the western end of shrewsbury eventually , places like eatontown , ocean grove , asbury park and interlaken broke away from ocean township because of liquor laws or a desire for fancy houses or connections to a railroad stop the final comeuppance for ocean township , though , came in 1957 developers wanted to build a condominium complex on the beachfront in the loch arbour section of town the few homeowners there tried to stop it , but were initially unsuccessful until they decided to secede from the township the village of loch arbour was formed , the last new municipality in new jersey when it seceded , it took with it the last piece of oceanfront in the now ironicallynamed ocean township today , loch arbour has but 280 residents , making it the seventhsmallest town in the state as such , it needs help from other towns to keep services up it sends school students to ocean township , does recycling with allenhurst , sends sewage to asbury park and gets snowplowing from deal over the years , we have investigated merging with other towns , but it is mostly when taxes come out and people think we could keep them down otherwise , said lorraine carafa , who serves as village clerk , treasurer , recycling coordinator , tax collector and a few other things if i think hard enough various laws since the 1960 s have made it much more difficult for sections of towns to split off as loch arbour did but only one town , pahaquarry , has disappeared and that only because the federal government finally acquired all that warren county township s land in 1997 we made a huge advance , from 567 to 566 , james hughes , the dean of the edward bloustein school of planning and public policy at rutgers , said with a laugh consolidation would do wonders for services , but no one seems to have the energy to try it they might consolidate some services , but everyone seems to want to control their own destiny , so we have these little towns they do n't get much smaller than teterboro , which was created in the early 1900 s out of parts of lodi , little ferry , moonachie and hasbrouck heights none very big themselves by william teter , who wanted to create a residential community world war i and a recession thwarted him but the postwar fascination with airplanes brought the wittemanlewis aircraft company to teterboro s flat fields the bendix corporation bought the business and expanded and actually renamed the town bendix the few houses that were built in town have continued to be occupied , but teterboro remains primarily its airport and related businesses you 've got to remember that 100 years ago , no one thought that each municipality would have to provide so many services , so it was no big deal to split off and have your own town , mr hughes said now , when you think of schools and sewers and roads and police , well , it might be virtually impossible
the book review recently asked a handful of poets and critics to respond to this question what book of poetry , published in the last 25 years , has meant the most to you personally the book you have found yourself returning to again and again \? we asked them not to select reissues , or volumes of a poet s selected or collected work here are their responses john ashbery poetry is being written , and presumably read , all over america some of it bears traces and inflections of its place of origin much of it does not the new poet laureate , ted kooser , lives in nebraska , and according to james h billington , the librarian of congress , he is the first poet laureate to hail from the great plains one hopes that the high plains , the mississippi delta and the florida panhandle will one day achieve similar recognition democracy is after all what our land is all about , or was until fairly recently , and states' rights are important , though for reasons that have always eluded me but what about poets whose accents are less easily traceable , like charles wright of virginia , via florence and pickwick dam , tenn , his birthplace \? susan howe of boston and buffalo \? charles simic of new hampshire and belgrade \( serbia , that is \) \? are they of less significance because their poetry happens to speak with an unfamiliar regional burr , or none at all \? is this gasp cosmopolitanism , a crime under the soviets \? then there is james tate , born in missouri and educated in kansas and iowa , whose idiom may not sound familiar to inhabitants of those states but then again , it may tate knows that all places are the same place , and conversely , if you ai n't where you are , you 're no place elsewhere he writes , adios toledo , see you in ohio local color plays a role , but the main event is the poet s wrestling with passing moments , frantically trying to discover the poetry there and to preserve it , perishable as it is tate is the poet of possibilities , of morph , of surprising consequences , lovely or disastrous , and these phenomena exist everywhere i return to tate s books more often perhaps than to any others when i want to be reminded afresh of the possibilities of poetry it s hard to choose a single volume i 'd have picked his selected poems if that were allowed , but reckoner \( wesleyan university , 1986 \) is as good a place as any to start , prime middleperiod tate he chose to preface it with a passage from wallace stevens s man on the dump , which ends where was it one first heard of the truth \? the the the line is a notorious one \( my spellcheck wo n't accept the the , and neither have a lot of readers \) yet it is essential its where is the wellspring of poetry , and , yes , there is a there there , an allencompassing one tate , who lives in amherst , mass , channels emily dickinson in one poem from reckoner 'tears are my angels now , ' she said to me around 4 am 'but are they interested in cedar rapids \? ' i asked 'i'm not qualified to say , ' was her sorry reply suggesting both that the reply was inadequate and that emily was sorry about that i think she was being unduly modest she is qualified and she does say , over and over , regardless of the setting , which is always here and tate , though he seems to be kidding the boonies \( sorry , cedar rapids i 've been to you and know you 've got culture \) , is similarly our great poet of local habitations and names , even if they do n't show up on every map john ashbery s new book of poems , where shall i wander , will be published next spring jorie graham in 1982 , i stole out of a study that doubled as a guest room to find an allnight xerox machine in berkeley i had found , in galleys sitting on the desk , a sound , a tone of voice , searing , true beyond anything i could imagine uttering a sound i have come to think of as one of the most distinctively american sounds the easiest to fake or betray , the hardest to make endure the sound of a sorrow that is inseparable from terminal anger the center of the world is closed , denis johnson writes in the title poem of his seminal collection the incognito lounge and other poems \( random house , 1982 \) , the beehive , the 8ball , the yoyo , the granite and the lightning and the melody only the incognito lounge is open although they seem random , and might have been so in the hands of a lesser poet , each of these names has crucial meaning to disclose the wisdoms of nature , of the archaic , of chance , of mathematics , of sacred texts , of transcendent forces , of song , of the epiphanic as such , are all closed to us the only way through this night is to go without name , without face , to go , spiritually , off the grid there is a strain of our poetry that wants to speak in a tone of voice , out of a predicament , that feels exclusively american the sound of damaged lives eked out in desert lots , trailer parks , motels lives unemployed \( both literally and spiritually \) , abandoned by the dream of freedom though still haunted by the habit of it , abandoned by god although he might be one motel down the road , who knows a loneliness born as much out of feeling one s self to be outside history , as out of being abandoned by the dream that america owns to its marrow the dream of the loner , of absolute selfreliance but here one weeps , johnson writes , to see the goodness of the world laid bare and rising with the government on its lips perhaps anyone , like myself , coming from a european background , carried by its long current of history , would be drawn to that sense of an utter dead end , that voice from the edge of the world the american tone gestures toward that anger which allows james wright to say , in his great ars poetica some recent criticism , reader we had a lovely language , we would not listen , and end when i was a boy i loved my country ah , you bastards , how i hate you that sense of the achingly shortsighted betrayal of what richard hugo described as those stammering pastures where the picnic should have worked the picnic not a continental angst , but rage hopeless grief mixed in for who we should have been for what we could have been sometimes the closest i get to loving the others is hating all of us , johnson writes the vietnamera poet of the incognito lounge spoke for a people who knew when they were being betrayed and lied to you have to be able to tell you are being lied to , to be this angry in exploring to what use such anger can be put , johnson reminds us that when anger is a useful tool , it is because one watches the speaker turn the blame inward as well as out jorie graham s new book of poems , overlord , will be published next spring jim harrison now that i am older and am sliding into home base , i 've become aware that i 've read some poetry nearly every day for the past 50 years for basically nutritional reasons it is a survival tactic , this soul food , a need to assuage the sense of incomprehension that i have lived with daily since i was a desperate and vulnerable boy just last week on a french book tour when i felt like a stray dog struck by a car and biting at its wounds in a ditch i stopped into a bookstore to fortify myself with a few pages of rimbaud and ren char naturally i read hundreds of poets , many of them foreign , but in recent years i 've probably returned to the work of gary snyder and ted kooser more often than any others this is not to say they are the best poets of our time i find such rating attempts paltry and onerous but the poets whose work most soothes and enlivens me snyder has not been subsumed by our culture but has consistently stood off to the side , giving his work a grand range far beyond academic claustrophobia ted kooser has been a friend and correspondent for many years but i was drawn to his work long before i met him because of his genius for making the ordinary sacramental in both of these poets i find a consistent ability to do honor to their calling they are apparently incapable of inferior work and have not been swallowed by the activity that surrounds the poetry world but has nothing to do with poetry it s only the work that matters recent books by the two are snyder s danger on peaks \( shoemaker hoard , 2004 \) and kooser s delights shadows \( copper canyon , 2004 \) we 've been slow to understand that likely the best work in poetry in the last century has been written in the spanish language in august i used the new antonio machado published by copper canyon as an overpowering morning devotional poetry does n't care about nationalities \( even our fiction seems an island in the sea of garc a m rquez \) long ago sappho wrote mysteriously what cannot be said will get wept snyder and kooser say it jim harrison s most recent book of poems is the shape of the journey new and collected poems robert pinsky there is no most or best in art no top 10 or first place on the scale of art the large scale , where ben jonson is more famous than this year s celebrity of the many contemporary books of poetry i value , i 'll choose one treasured by poets , but not much noticed by academic or journalistic fashion james mcmichael s four good things \( houghton mifflin , 1980 \) has provided me repeatedly , over the 24 years since it was published , with the quality of vision by vision i mean something like the view from a high place you see more , and farther partly about one life , four good things also includes a social vision usually , when poetry tries to imagine the nature of society , we can expect a version of the oped page , but with the ideas simplified and the rhetoric amplified the ordinary poem of this kind has less nuance than journalism on the same subject but four good things provides the exhilarating subtlety of art akira kurosawa s great film ikiru sees the profound mystery in what could be banal a bureaucrat , told he has a fatal illness , tries to accomplish something good mcmichael s material , too , is familiar he writes about how america s suburban streets and houses , comforts and technologies , involve an invisible history , from the industrial revolution and colonialism to the information age planning and worry , information and labor , form mcmichael s home place , pasadena , calif , where caltech , home of the wind tunnel , was founded in the spirit of william morris s weavings and handmade papers the poem s sentences , the dreamy movement from irish poverty in manchester to the maps of computer chips , the lines flirting with a camouflaged blank verse , all create an unforgettable formal impression the feeling of a vision into the forces of greed and generosity , contending in one s country and in oneself robert pinsky s most recent book of poems is jersey rain mary karr to watch german tanks roll down your block one year and six million deaths later soviet tanks in their wake must have doomed zbigniew herbert to kantian antinomy he sometimes speaks through a clownfaced doppelg nger called mr cogito , whose lofty beginnings in descartes s cogito ergo sum are countered by his bumbling , buster keatonesque manner herbert poems are slapstick for intellectuals and philosophy for the ill educated blame poland s history constantly invaded , the country was obliterated from maps for centuries , its language even deemed barbaric enough to be banned in some polish universities in the first half of the 18th century facts that impel herbert s poetry to its keen polishness but he also embraces the european and classical traditions others might renounce as tools of the oppressor he s a barbarian classicist whose precise , chekhovian detail provides a cleareyed view of the 20th century at its bloody vortex he makes marble statues breathe herbert also advances local experience to mythic scale the title poem of report from the besieged city \( ecco , 1985 \) opens with the author s political impotence as he s made to chronicle i do n't know for whom his city s siege at first the approach is wholly ironic , the reticent speaker making a grocery list of outrages monday empty storehouse a rat became the unit of currency but the poem ends as herbert s work often does with emotional conviction in the face of certain catastrophe cemeteries grow larger the number of defendants is smaller yet the defense continues it will continue to the end and if the city falls but a single man escapes he will carry the city within himself on the roads of exile he will be the city we look in the face of hunger of fire face of death worst of all the face of betrayal and only our dreams have not been humiliated in a time of great terror and prevarication , this voice can heal us mary karr s most recent book of poems is viper rum james fenton no one would wish to deny cavafy his preeminence as lyricist of the homoerotic , but the acts of love he was talking about were furtive , led nowhere and took place in a disapproving world thom gunn toward the end of his life wrote a group of erotic poems and love poems \( the categories sometimes overlap \) which record a society in which such furtiveness would be comically out of place it is a new moral world , containing choices that cavafy never seems to have had to face can a man balance , for instance , a life of hedonistic sexual adventure with longterm partnership \? what happens to the sexual buccaneer as he grows old \? how should one make one s life mean something \? two of gunn s most beautiful friendship poems \( rapallo and in trust \) appear in his last collection , boss cupid \( 2000 \) still , i must choose an earlier volume , the man with night sweats \( farrar , straus giroux , 1992 \) , since it contains , at the end of the sequence of poems arising from the aids epidemic , that most characteristic of his responses to the crisis , a blank in this poem , a former lover is glimpsed from the bus in the company of the child he has decided to adopt , and gunn admires the spirit in which his friend has embarked on life as a single father the situation of the poem is something new to lyric poetry , although the appreciation gunn expresses is entirely consistent with his life s work what he admired was always authenticity james fenton s most recent book is a garden from a hundred packets of seed sapphire all of lucille clifton s previous books come together in this one like a train pulling into the station next \( boa editions , 1987 \) this is not so much the book i come back to as the one book that keeps coming back to me the path men walk is shadow enter the dream to be real this belief in the magic of whiteness , that it explains allows assures entitles like jack s bean leads to the giant s actual country where jack lies broken the land is in ruins , no magic , no anything lines from a poem in next come to me as i am standing on a new york city street on sept 11 , 2001 , watching the twin towers burning the hoop of the world is breaking fire burns in the four directions and i thought of nagasaki and my mother , who was a soldier in the segregated women s army corps during world war ii my mother blamed the leukemia that killed her on her exposure to fallout from nuclear tests that the army had lied to the soldiers about doing i think of lucille clifton now there is a wheel and it is turning we are all next or next sapphire s most recent book of poems is black wings blind angels harold bloom john ashbery s eighth volume of poetry , as we know \( viking , 1979 \) , was certainly his most ambitious up through 1979 it was two books at once first comes litany , a highly problematic and at moments magnificent long poem of some 65 pages , in two quite separate columns or is it two long poems resolutely refusing congress with one another , while running side by side \? then come 40odd shorter poems , lyrics and meditations of which at least the following are anything but problematic , and indeed are superb silhouette , as we know , flowering death , my erotic double , knocking around , late echo , tapestry and the sun those eight poems stand with the best of ashbery , and one in particular , tapestry \( of which more to come \) , is of the eminence of soonest mended in his book the double dream of spring and wet casements in houseboat days there are not many contemporary poems that deserve the old but crucial phrase inexhaustible to meditation these do but i begin with litany , the scandal of the volume and a text i have never mastered , at least in the high nietzschean sense of interpretation exercising itself as the interpreter s willtopower over the text with nietzsche , i murmur who is the interpreter \? even as i begin a ninth or tenth reading of this maddening but very amiable and accomplished poem what is maddening did not come suddenly to ashbery at 52 it was always there , in an only apparent discursiveness that played at being a willful randomness but , as before , ashbery is neither discursive nor random he is as intensely figurative a poet as whitman and stevens were , and like these ancestors he wears a mask of the casual extemporizer that no reader should trust for an instant ashbery insists that litany ought to be heard simultaneously as two monologues independent of each other , yet somehow related i understand that he and another reader have so performed the poem , before an audience , but i cannot regret my absence from that celebration sustained reading has convinced me finally that the righthand column is much the better of what i suspect after all to be two poems , uneasily separate from each other not that the lefthand column lacks its glories , but it speaks for ashbery s self whereas the righthand meditation is the voice of what whitman has called the real me , or the me myself , a more inward and vulnerable aspect of the self if my judgment is at all correct , then i would call the lefthand column a substitution for or sublimation of ashbery s deepest desires , whereas the righthand side is more nearly an evasion or repression of those desires , which fascinatingly keep breaking through , revealing ranges of ashbery s sensibility and intellectual ambition that have not been overly evident before this i give first a lefthand passage in which poetry , like the dreadful , is what has already happened and the agony of looking steadily at something is n't really there at all , it s something you once read about its narrative thrust carries it far beyond what it thought it was all het up about its charm , no longer a diversionary tactic , is something like grace which is to say that ashbery , unlike wordsworth , cannot labor to keep his eye steadily upon the object , because every object now belongs to anteriority , and not to us this rueful sublimation has its elegance , but is weak when confronted by the righthand column s beautiful evasion that ends a brilliantly sustained passage on the use of poetry and the right use of criticism and so lead us gradually back to words with names we had forgotten , old friends from childhood , and then everything is forgiven at last , and we can sit and talk quietly with them for hours , words ourselves , so that when sleep comes no one is to blame , and no reproach can finally be uttered words ourselves is , in full context , a wholly adequate trope , and one of a litany of evasions of the righthand me myself i call the poem poems litany problematic because with each rereading i wonder why i \( or ashbery \) need the lefthand side , but then i recall whitman s song of myself , surely ashbery s ultimate model , with its moving description of whitman s evasive side the me myself apart from the pulling and hauling stands what i am , stands amused , complacent , compassionating , idle , unitary , looks down , is erect , or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest , looking with sidecurved head curious what will come next , both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it litany extends the achievement of the ashbery who begins to persuade us that he , rather than whitman , has written these lines concerning his true self i have space to consider only briefly ashbery s triumph in lyric and shorter meditative poems his mode here is as clearly related to stevens as litany is to whitman sometimes indeed the relation is a touch too clear the poem of these things takes them apart , and i tremble sparse winter , less vulnerable than deflated summer , the nests of words still , that is the second of five pedantic pieces , and is probably deliberate parody ashbery is most himself in tapestry , which can rival stevens s poems of our climate as an ode on a grecian urn for our time tapestry , like ashbery s masterpiece in the long poem , selfportrait in a convex mirror , studies the estrangement of both artist and audience from the artwork , discovering anew the sorrow that the distance increases even as the aesthetic experience becomes more intense as words go crying after themselves , leaving the dream upended in a puddle somewhere as though dead were just another adjective at one moment in litany , ashbery commends keats s sonnet on the grasshopper and the cricket as writing that does not offend us at his best , as in tapestry , ashbery is equally remote from all offense now , in 2004 , he is our major poet since the death of wallace stevens in 1955 harold bloom s most recent book is where shall wisdom be found \? sharon olds the first book that came to my mind is stanley kunitz s nexttolast things \( atlantic monthly , 1985 \) so many of its lines have become a part of my life , like words from the bible , heard as a child , which seem to be stored where one s own physical sense memories are stored the way i look at it , i'm passing through a phase gradually i'm changing to a word whatever you choose to claim of me is always yours nothing is truly mine except my name i only borrowed this dust the second book makes me wonder , with delight , how such exactness and such mysteriousness can be so deeply present together reading yusef komunyakaa s magic city \( wesleyan university , 1992 \) has been for me like the early days of rock dancing joy and music and trying to figure out how the other person is doing what he s doing ! all the bees in the world live in little white houses except the ones in these flowers all sticky sweet inside i wonder what death tastes like sometimes i toss the butterflies back into the air third is a book that sort of threw me to my knees deborah digges s trapeze \( knopf , 2004 \) is a book that shows me how much truth , and feeloftruth embodying profound complex mourning can be sung as for your dead , they will not be returning the leafless burial woods fill with brilliant brutal light how few you 've loved toward posterity you only recognized each other who would n't

washington , sept 20 for the first time , the federal government has proposed placing responsibility for preventing foodborne illness on farmers rather than on consumers the food and drug administration on monday proposed rules that would require egg farmers to clean up their operations to reduce the level of salmonella in their products in 2000 , the agency advised consumers and grocers to refrigerate eggs and cook them thoroughly to kill harmful bacteria the agency says the combined effects of this regulation and the one in 2000 could reduce the incidence of salmonella infections by 50 percent by 2010 the consumer group that has been pushing the agency to develop mandatory safety standards for egg producers since 1997 , the center for science in the public interest , says that the proposed regulations could virtually eliminate salmonella from eggs salmonellosis is a gastrointestinal illness that usually runs its course in four to seven days it can lead to death in the elderly , the very young and those with compromised immune systems a risk assessment conducted by the agriculture department in 1998 estimated 660 , 000 illnesses a year from salmonella the fda now says there are only 118 , 000 illnesses a year the correct figure probably lies somewhere in between , said caroline s dewaal , director of food safety at the center for science in the public interest over the last several years some egg producers have voluntarily instituted a variety of food safety procedures those measures , when coupled with refrigeration , have resulted in the chances of an egg being infected with salmonella dropping from one in 10 , 000 in 1997 to one in 20 , 000 the proposed regulations would apply only to those farms with more than 3 , 000 laying hens farms of that size produce more than 99 percent of the eggs sold in the united states we 've known for years that these commonsense steps would not only reduce the incidence of salmonella in chicken stocks but would also reduce illnesses , ms dewaal said the systems have been proven in pilot studies if the proposed rules , which are open for comment for 90 days , take effect , chicken producers would have to buy their breeding stock from places that sell salmonellafree chicks they would be required to institute systems to prevent salmonella from being transferred from the outside environment to poultry houses , and to have strict pest and rodent controls if a poultry house was infected with salmonella , it would have to be cleaned and disinfected , including the removal of visible manure eggs would have to be refrigerated if they were held on the farm more than 36 hours after laying environmental testing , including swabbing of manure pits , would have to be done once every laying cycle if the salmonella tests were positive , then there would be further extensive testing of the eggs themselves if one egg tested positive for salmonella , none of the eggs in that infected poultry house could be sold as raw eggs they would have to be pasteurized before sale extensive recordkeeping would be required for both environmental and egg testing and for eggs that had to be pasteurized howard magwire , director of government relations for the united egg producers , said he could not comment specifically on the proposal because he had not read it , though he said he was familiar with most of it mandatory rules , mr magwire said , mean a level playing field , and i think people usually agree that s a good thing the fda estimates that it would cost the poultry industry 82 million a year to carry out the measures louis carlson , deputy director of the food safety and security staff at the agency , said the cost would be well worth it because the rules would save 498 million a year by reducing illness caused by salmonella asked why it took seven years from the time the center for science in the public interest petitioned the fda to develop a mandatory onfarm control program until the rule was proposed , mr carlson said , this is our first onfarm effort , and we wanted to make sure we understood the comments we received and the concerns correction september 23 , 2004 , thursday because of an editing error , an article on tuesday about rules proposed by the food and drug administration to place on farmers the responsibility for the safety of eggs misstated the name of the director of food safety at the center for science in the public interest , who said that the government s estimate of 118 , 000 illnesses a year from salmonella was low she is caroline smith dewaal , not caroline s she uses the surnames together
mosul , iraq , nov 22 a leading sunni cleric was killed in a driveby shooting in the northern city of mosul on monday , and american military officials in the city discovered the bodies of at least four more iraqi army soldiers killed by gunshots to the head gunmen killed another sunni muslim cleric in miqdadiya on tuesday , reuters reported , citing witnesses and hospital officials in the city

intimidation and murder , said lt col paul hastings , a military spokesman in mosul concerns are growing that the campaign is succeeding in part because the insurgents have infiltrated the iraqi security forces the recently deposed police chief in mosul , muhammad kheiri barhawi , whose force almost entirely deserted when the fighting began two weeks ago , was arrested sunday by kurdish forces in the province east of mosul a senior officer in the mosul police department said mr barhawi , found in possession of 600 , 000 , was under investigation on suspicion of collaborating with

iraq insurgent attacks around the country have fallen sharply to about 90 a day from a high of around 150 a day as the battle in falluja began , according to data compiled by a private security company the overall trend since january , however , has been continuously upward in southern iraq , an attack around 9 am severed the smaller of two pipelines running to the country s main export terminal in the persian gulf the fact that there was an explosion indicates that foul play was involved , said an official at iraq pipeline watch , which closely tracks the developments a spokesman for grand ayatollah ali alsistani , the most powerful shiite cleric in iraq , condemned a raid by iraqi and american forces on a prominent sunni mosque in baghdad on friday that killed at least three

delta air lines posted its biggest loss in more than a quartercentury yesterday , prompting standard poor s to cut the rating on its debt the agency warned that the chances for a delta bankruptcy filing had increased delta s loss , of nearly 2 billion , started what is expected to be a dismal earnings season for the major airlines none of delta s chief competitors are expected to post secondquarter profits us airways has said there is a chance it might break even much of the loss at delta was in noncash charges that the airline announced last week including those charges , delta lost 196 billion , or 1596 a share , its biggest quarterly loss since 1978 delta has lost money in 13 of the last 14 quarters excluding the noncash charges , delta would have lost 312 million , or 255 a share revenue rose 13 percent , to 396 billion analysts had expected the airline to lose 246 a share on that basis in the period a year earlier , delta posted a 184 million profit , thanks to a refund of federal security fees without the refund , delta would have lost 237 million shares of delta closed at 594 , up 44 cents late yesterday , standard poor s cut delta s debt rating to ccc from b , the agency s second downgrade for delta this year sp , which last lowered delta s rating in march , said delta s outlook remained negative , meaning yet another downgrading was possible delta declined to comment the action reflects an increasing risk of bankruptcy or an outofcourt restructuring of debt as delta seeks to lower its costs and maintain adequate liquidity , said philip baggaley , standard poor s credit analyst delta warned on may 10 that a chapter 11 filing was possible unless it was able to reduce its costs significantly and win concessions from its pilots' union united airlines , a unit of ual , is already in chapter 11 bankruptcy , while us airways is in a similar situation to delta , striving to cut costs so that they can stay out of bankruptcy court mr baggaley said the lowered rating reflected financial damage from heavy losses over the last few years , a high operating cost structure , substantial debt , lease and postretirement liabilities and the continued pressures that the airline faced in the ultracompetitive airline industry sp cited many of those reasons as the reason for its march downgrading mr baggaley said sp could lower delta s ratings even further , unless it makes rapid progress in its negotiations with its pilots' union , or if its financial condition weakens delta said yesterday that it expected jet fuel costs to be about 680 million higher this year than in 2003 that was a reason its available cash fell to 2 billion at the end of the quarter , down about 220 million from the first quarter by contrast , delta had 27 billion in unrestricted cash at the end of 2003 the airline has hired restructuring and bankruptcy consultants and has repeatedly stressed it must remake itself to face the onslaught of industry competition the industry marketplace has changed , fundamentally and permanently , delta s chief executive , gerald a grinstein , said yesterday during a conference call with industry analysts , which was held before the sp downgrading since the bankruptcy threat , the air line pilots association has renewed discussions with the company , which had stalled after the two sides exchanged initial offers earlier this year the pilots' contract runs out next may mr grinstein said delta was wrapping up the final details of a revitalization plan that will be presented to its board at a meeting in late august delta s goal is to make it comprehensive , do it once and do it right , mr grinstein said mr grinstein , who became chief executive at the beginning of the year , acknowledged delta s permile costs dropped slightly during the second quarter , excluding fuel costs , because of an emphasis on costcutting beyond labor contracts and he said the airline could not base its comeback plan solely on concessions from its pilots he pointed out that the airline s ratio of debt to equity stood at 117 percent at the end of the second quarter we must not just have costs in line with our competitors , we must have cash flow , mr grinstein said the other part of it is attacking the balance sheet but mr baggaley of sp said that the restructuring of bond payments could be considered a default , prompting the agency to lower delta s rating to d for default , or sd for selective default , depending on the actions the airline takes one glimmer of good news for the company came with the disclosure that it faces only 50 million in pension payments through the end of 2004 by contrast , united last week deferred a 724 million payment due to three of its employee plans and united faces hundreds of millions more in payments later this summer
here in the only inhabited corner of the demilitarized zone dividing the korean peninsula , at least one young descendant of the first inhabitants of this most peculiar of villages was blissfully unaware of its twisted origins i 've heard about the dmz , but i do n't know what it is , said kim so young , 10 , a fifth grader at the taesung elementary school , which has 14 staff members , 14 students , classrooms equipped with giant television sets and more computers than the pupils can use there must be other villages like ours , right \? the armistice ending the korean war in 1953 created the dmz , a strip of land two and a half miles wide running about 150 miles from coast to coast it remains enclosed in barbed wire fences , dotted with land mines and surrounded by hundreds of thousands of soldiers in a rare moment of agreement , though , the south and north decided in 1955 to build model villages to extol each side s superior way of life and so was born taesung village , also called freedom village , on the southern half of the dmz here , facing the north s own model village , called kijong each side poured money into its showcase village the arguments were hardly subtle and indeed sometimes boiled down to the level of whose flagpole is bigger in the 1980 s , shortly after the southerners erected a 328foot flagpole , a 525foot flagpole went up on the other side with nothing but an invisible line separating the two villages , cold war confrontation was often eyeball to eyeball at the height of the cold war , north korean soldiers would slip over to this side to ambush american soldiers villagers here unwittingly stepping over into the north would find themselves arrested by north korean soldiers in a recent instance of psychological warfare , or just annoying behavior , north korean soldiers crossed several feet into the southern side and sat down on chairs while the southerners were busy harvesting crops taesung s 226 residents living inside 52 houses carry special id s and , when leaving and entering , must endure countless checkpoints they must return to the village by nightfall and be inside their houses by 11 pm with mosquitoes breeding in the wilderness of the dmz , malaria survives here one resident was killed after stepping on a land mine another lost a foot people outside think this must be a frustrating , closed place , said kim dong hyun , 49 , the mayor but it does n't feel that way to us it s our home my parents lived here before the war indeed , most residents trace their prewar roots to this area in keeping with korean customs , male residents are allowed to bring wives to live here , but female residents marrying outsiders must leave the population has declined slightly , from about 250 two decades ago in return for the restrictions , residents are granted special privileges , including exemption from paying provincial taxes and serving in the military the inhabitants , almost all of whom are farmers , have been allotted large patches of land , so that the annual household income here is among the nation s highest but it is at the school that the south s lavish propaganda spending is manifest according to the principal , gil hae sung , it receives a special budget that allows it to buy equipment and facilities found in no other school maybe because of the school s facilities , or because they had grown up here and knew no other place , the children saw nothing strange in living inside the dmz none of the four fifth and sixth graders could remember being warned to evacuate , as their parents routinely were none in fact could recall any warnings at all my father told me not to go to a certain area , so young finally said , because my grandmother was abducted by north koreans when she was picking acorns at the family home later in the afternoon , the father , kim kyung min , 51 , told of how in 1997 his mother , brother and he were picking acorns because they were near the military demarcation line separating the southern and northern halves of the dmz , they were accompanied , as is the rule , by south korean soldiers speaking of his mother and brother , mr kim said , they probably went over the line by 30 feet when north korean guards came and said stop ! raise your hands ! after five days in detention , they were released and given a box of pears and a persimmon tree , which now grows in the family s garden life here has gotten easier because the north and the south are increasingly friendly the propaganda that each side broadcast over loudspeakers ceased in june the north , too , appears to have lost the zeal or means to compete in the propaganda war on the northern half of the dmz , the north korean village of kijong is a silhouette of a series of tall buildings , an eerie urban skyline inside the dmz but according to surveillance from the south , kijong appears uninhabited the dynamics and conversations along the military demarcation line have also changed according to the fortunes of each country the north was richer than the south just after the korean war but while the south has grown to become the world s 12th largest economy , the north has been facing economic collapse the north korean soldiers would always talk to us first , mayor kim said they used to say 'come over to our side we 'll feed you you must be hungry we 'll give you soup with meat' but nowadays , they talk to us and ask us for food

above all else , it was a jury it was sequestered , for six months , from those who would intrude its members were trapped in deliberation until consensus could be established it called for expert testimony , then called for it again it quarreled it soulsearched it schmoozed and , yes , it laughed sometimes it despaired of reaching a verdict and it worked as hard as if lives depended on it , which , in a broad sense , they did for its verdict was the world trade center memorial , commemorating 2 , 982 lives lost in the attacks of 2001 and 1993 the 13 jurors faced the formidable task of winnowing 5 , 201 submissions ranging from the sublime to something else big apples towers inspired by lego blocks clocks fixed at 9 11 assuming that the memorial motivates enough private donors to build it the preliminary cost estimate is 175 million the jurors' choice , reflecting absence , by michael arad and peter walker , could be the most important public memorial in decades the 12 jurors and other officials who discussed their experiences with the new york times opened the curtain on cloakanddagger moments secret locations , two sets of entry keys and even anthrax screening they bristled when they recalled some of the harsh criticism they could not help hearing they proudly told of ignoring the footsteps of the powerful outside their jury rooms and if they clashed during their 11thhour bargaining at gracie mansion , they also fondly remembered its tranquillity , and the comfort food that fueled their struggle almost from the start of the largest such competition in history , the jury bonded strongly maya lin , one of the jurors , recalled being asked how they could go through 5 , 201 entries without feeling that they missed one many of us said , spontaneously 'i do n't think of myself as one pair of eyes , ' she said 'i think of myself as 13' if the task was daunting , it was also inspiring the first time that i saw those hundreds of boards , my knees buckled , recalled paula grant berry , a juror whose husband , david s berry , died in the south tower i was overwhelmed that so many people cared and wanted to share our grief in an interview after the design was unveiled on wednesday , gov george e pataki said , having a jury that was insulated and allowed to function with the freedom to think and be involved and the freedom to have the time necessary to ultimately come up with what they thought was right was absolutely essential you ca n't , he continued , have a memorial designed by politicians overseeing the memorial , the lower manhattan development corporation sought a jury largely of arts and cultural professionals , said the organization s president , kevin m rampe the belief was that it would lead to the best memorial and have the greatest chance of public acceptance the corporation also knew that to attract jurors of the highest caliber , they would have to be given the sole authority to make the final choice jurors were not paid the names of prospective jurors were discussed by patricia e harris , the deputy mayor for administration , who ended up serving as a juror diana taylor , the governor s deputy secretary for finance and housing louis r tomson , who was then president of the development corporation john c whitehead , the corporation chairman anita f contini , director of the corporation s memorial program and three corporation board members vartan gregorian , the president of the carnegie corporation of new york and ultimately the jury chairman , was recruited by mr whitehead he told me it would take a couple of weeks , dr gregorian commented , with a laugh michael mckeon , governor pataki s former communications director , allowed that he was seen at first as an outright political appointee the jurors learned that mr mckeon , now a public relations consultant , had been working on the scene at ground zero for months , starting sept 11 , 2001 he said he had signed onto the jury because this was a way for me to finish the job as for mr mckeon being his eyes and ears on the panel , governor pataki said , he was very silent similarly , mayor michael r bloomberg said that deputy mayor harris , who oversaw the city s two sept 11 memorial ceremonies , never shared with me the deliberations the question of including a juror who was related to a victim prompted a twoweek discussion there were fears that family members might be too close to their grief to work effectively with a jury and , on the other hand , that their opinions might be given inordinate weight in the end , the corporation realized that politically , it needed a family member ms berry , who is on the corporation s family advisory council , was asked to join i agonized quite a bit , she said i needed reassurance that they did n't want someone to represent the families because it is such a diverse group but i hoped i could look at the process with the families' heart ms lin , acutely conscious of her celebrated role as the designer of the vietnam veterans memorial , was also not easily persuaded she s a little uncomfortable about being miss memorial , another juror said she was conscious of checking her ego ms lin and james e young of the university of massachusetts , an expert in international memorial design , each agreed to serve if the other would i almost felt i needed to help , needed to be on the jury , ms lin said , that that was where i could help , where i could give back nancy rosen , a public art consultant , felt that being a juror meant facing a kind of quarantine we were like astronauts asked to go to some strange planet setting the rules as submissions arrived at a warehouse on west 36th street , the jury met with many groups and with the governor , the mayor and former mayor rudolph w giuliani all of them promised to affirm our autonomy and authority , dr gregorian said for their part , jurors signed confidentiality statements restricting their public comments but their silence during the process also reflected their respect for one another you did not leave a meeting and read about it the next day , ms harris said almost immediately , the jury challenged the master site plan by studio daniel libeskind , which called for the entire memorial area to be depressed 30 feet below street level most of us felt that an atgrade solution was preferable , said julie menin , a juror and president of wall street rising , a nonprofit group set up after 9 11 to encourage the neighborhood s recovery choosing the memorial was as much an urban planning exercise as an artistic commission it was the memorial site competition , said susan k freedman , a juror and president of the public art fund how many artists are given four and a half acres \? although there were two consultant firms to guide the process , it did not take long for the jurors to make their own rules , including a quorum of 100 percent for deliberations if somebody had to leave to get on an airplane , the meeting ended period , said ms harris the jury also decided that the magic number for consensus would be 10 votes and it wrangled with its stewards there was constant friction with this group of jurors who hate authority , one official said they 're a difficult group , but great jurors state officials were not the only ones to feel the jury s heat members debated among themselves sometimes to the point of raised voices and stamping feet how the memorial would feel to those who visited it jurors with a historical bent fought with those more concerned with the memorial s emotional and tactile impact many jurors credited ms contini , a former first vice president for sponsorships and events marketing at merrill lynch , for smoothing disagreements among them i wanted to be sure that each juror always had the opportunity to have a voice , ms contini said narrowing the field with 5 , 201 entries to consider , the original strategy was for the submissions to be divided among three groups of jurors the jury decided , though , that every juror would look at every board , including some 400 that had been disqualified on technicalities they did so in a 20 , 000squarefoot office on the 30th floor of the equitable building at 120 broadway when they gazed out the window , exhausted from viewing submissions , jurors saw ground zero a private investigation firm run by bo dietl , a former new york police detective , examined each submission for explosive devices or contamination by anthrax the 30 by 40inch entries were placed on hundreds of easels in rooms protected by a doublekey system jurors' notebooks never left the office mr mckeon recalled the vista of easel after easel there was so much , and i did n't want to miss anything , he said it was an awesome responsibility i did n't want to screw it up throughout the process , jurors were permitted passion votes designs that could be brought to the next stage of the judging by only one juror one was cast by the architect enrique norten for passages of light the memorial cloud so few of the entries were unexpected , and this one was , he said i thought it was truly beautiful the daunting task of winnowing the submissions was accomplished in a succession of dogged seven and eighthour days jurors studied every presentation , identified only by sixdigit codes \( reflecting absence was no 790532 \) to be eliminated , a submission had to be signed by all the jurors votes were tabulated and retabulated as jurors asked to visit the nearly 600 easels again and again jurors were appalled at the tastelessness of some entries , which conjured airplanes striking buildings and las vegasstyle observatory towers other entrants had obviously studied the works of the jurors and attempted to win favor by adopting their design vocabulary we resisted the idea of the literal , dr young said , that s why you do n't get any big apples in our designs , or representations of airplanes , attacks , death , blood the jury commissioned a survey of existing parks and grew certain that the memorial should offer residents green space they asked engineers to explain how wind velocities would affect various tree species they took into account predictions that the memorial would draw 10 million visitors a year the jurors shared thoughts on the phone , by email , over drinks and dinner we liked to be together , mr mckeon said , but their shared responsibility weighed heavier and heavier as it went on discussion was heated at times , said martin puryear , a sculptor and jury member , but nothing that could be called a meltdown together , they clocked in thousands of hours the jurors walked ground zero several times , pacing off the footprints to gauge the feasibility of the finalists they narrowed the selection to 250 , then 50 , then 25 , then 11 , then 9 a proposal called twin piers was eliminated when it was learned that its designer had submitted another entry , in violation of the rules that left eight despairing and refining those finalists were given two months and up to 130 , 000 each to turn their original presentations into professional renderings , models and computer animations the weekend before the first unveiling , on nov 19 , the full jury met with the eight design teams and learned their identities before the refined proposals went on public view , they were shown privately in a gallery at the world financial center in battery park city jurors , seeing the revisions for the first time , were underwhelmed we knew a lot of these schemes did n't deliver the promise of what was on the stageone boards , said michael r van valkenburgh , a juror who is a landscape architect it was a very heartbreaking time for the process tensions rose as some jurors balked at a public display of the finalists other jurors countered that it was essential because the development corporation was committed to the presentation , the models were revealed public and critical response was not encouraging bland and generic were two of the kindest characterizations and , it turns out , governor pataki shared some of the frustrations i like i think most new yorkers did n't see one that just jumped out and struck me as the perfect , appropriate memorial , mr pataki said so as you go through those discouraging moments , you think , 'hey , throw it out and start all over again' but that s why we created a process where we had jurors who were insulated from those pressures jurors read that victims' family groups were advocating the preservation of the original tower footprints and artifacts they also read an article in the times on dec 7 titled , ground zero s only hope elitism , by michael kimmelman , the newspaper s chief art critic he contrasted populism with democracy and suggested that the competition be started over and limited to participants of the jury s expert choosing jurors , including mr puryear , were incensed elitism was something i was absolutely opposed to , he recalled it smacks of smug cultural superiority , the opposite of the inclusive process we signed onto matthew higgins , the chief operating officer of the development corporation , sought a meeting with the editorial board of the times on dec 13 , an editorial praised both garden of lights and memorial cloud they turned out to be two of the jurors' three favorites picking a winner after working with the finalists to improve their designs , jurors gathered on jan 5 at gracie mansion they were feeling the pressure i do n't know that we were going to get out unless we had a decision , mr mckeon said with breaks for breakfast and lunch prepared by the inhouse chef , the jurors heard the three remaining design teams make their final pitch before the day began , reflecting absence was regarded as a dark horse , though it had been transformed from mr arad s stark original , losing a slablike cultural building that state officials derided as motel 6 there is a resemblance between reflecting absence and a sketchbook of memorial ideas by ms lin that was published in the new york times magazine on sept 8 , 2002 in the end ms lin said approvingly that reflecting absence made something positive out of the void mr arad said he had been contemplating his memorial design long before he knew ms lin would review his work in a competition jurors dismissed the notion that ms lin or anyone else could have commandeered the proceedings otherwise the deliberations would not have lasted 12 hours , dr gregorian said instead , what swayed the jury was that the reflecting absence team was joined by peter walker , a wellknown landscape architect in berkeley , calif , who had also submitted a plan to the competition without walker , there would not be arad , dr gregorian said garden of lights had a lot of support , a juror said , but the support evaporated after a very unfortunate last presentation in which the design team failed to satisfy requests for refinements jurors who favored the garden plan moved to reflecting absence in their arguments , opponents of the cloud as everyone called the memorial cloud design focused on the very quality its advocates admired its distinctive architecture called attention to itself rather than the tragedy its spectacle was so eyeabsorbing , dr young said , that it took us out of ourselves , at a memorial that should encourage us to contemplate inwardly ballot after ballot was taken 8 to 5 , 6 to 7 , 7 to 6 , 9 to 4 there was still no consensus when the jurors broke for a dinner of fried chicken and mashed potatoes , served with expensive bottles of long island estate merlot from the gracie mansion cellar the comfort food was important , dr young recalled that break really helped shortly before 11 pm , faced with the prospect of adjourning and reconvening the next evening , mr van valkenburgh said he told his weary fellow jurors , somebody is going to have to change their vote and somebody did , he said , without identifying that person ultimately 10 jurors voted for the aradwalker plan those who did not vote for it decided to support it some left disappointed but not angry , dr gregorian said a beginning the jurors did not reconvene until wednesday s unveiling of the design in federal hall national memorial they blinked uncomfortably in the brilliant camera lights some reported a sad feeling of withdrawal but none seemed to regret the powerful experience after having a child , ms freedman said , there is nothing i have ever felt a greater responsibility for in a sense , it is just the beginning of a process that could further transform the memorial some jurors vowed that the voice of the jury would continue to be heard we intend , ms berry said , to see it to the end
fennie may williams , 57 , changed her name to najeeulluh maydun in the 1970 s , when she converted to islam you would think that if you change your name then you become anew , but that is not true she said recently at the offices of the brooklyn bureau of community service , one of the seven agencies supported by the new york times neediest cases fund it did n't take away anything , she said her problems and her past had dogged her before the name change and they were still with her dressed in a long jean skirt and pink buttondown shirt , with her hair wrapped in a purple scarf , ms maydun was just finishing her day s classes at the pride program at the bureau s center on chapel street she travels there every weekday to improve her reading and writing and learn secretarial skills i know that i wo n't be able to make it unless i get the education that i really need , she said what i really want is a job , a good paying job , to get off public assistance , she said but at her age , without a high school education and in fragile health \( she has diabetes , glaucoma and circulatory problems \) , it is not easy to make up for lost years growing up in south carolina in the 1950 s , her options seemed limited from the start getting an education simply was n't allowed , she said the way she understood it as a child , her family was given from one farm to another now , she said , she knows that they were sold from owner to owner as farm laborers at one 25acre plantation , her family lived in a ragged twobedroom home the 13 children slept side by side on handmade mattresses pine straw stuffed between pieces of cloth she worked from sunrise to sunset she tended to tobacco plants , cleaned the plantation home , cooked for the owners , and picked cotton 200 pounds a day , by her estimate sometimes the cotton rows looked like they ran to the end of earth , and the sun would come down into your face , she said she attributes her glaucoma to those long days toiling in the hot southern sun the hardest part was that you did n't get paid , she said they would tell us we ate up all our earnings some of the people her family worked for were kinder than others , but none let her do the one thing she wanted to do most go to school when the bus driver drove by blowing his horn , she would run to the edge of the road and wave , but she never clambered aboard eventually her mother sent her to live with a cousin in brooklyn i thought the people were crazy , she said , remembering her first impressions of the city they did n't live the kind of life i knew , but one thing they had that i did n't have they could read books and when they worked they got paid as a teenager , she worked in a factory sewing life jackets she was paid by the piece , and made up to 50 a week in 1977 , she met her husband we met when i became a muslim , she said though she was raised a baptist , islam offered her a sense of community they were more the way i was brought up the way they behaved and cared for each other later she had a son , abdullah faheem , now 22 she and her husband have since separated their son studies digital media and lives in coney island with his girlfriend s family he says he will be everything i wanted to be , she said most of ms maydun s family has died she likes to keep to herself , she said , and rarely leaves the twobedroom apartment that she has lived in for 20 years , except to go to her classes at the bureau her education remains important to her , even though there are still obstacles last summer , her box spring broke she had trouble sleeping , and her attention started to drift during her classes she tried to fix the box spring with some oldfashioned ingenuity and a hanger it did n't work and it made too much noise , she said on public assistance , she could n't afford orthopedic shoes , much less a bed eventually , and with some trepidation , she talked to shenneha porter , the job developer at the bureau ms porter was the first person outside her family in whom ms maydun had confided her story had a great impact on me , ms porter said i felt so much pity for her ms porter drew 70583 from the neediest cases to buy a new mattress , box spring and frame for ms maydun it s a lovely bed , it s the best bed i have ever had , ms maydun said now , she is more alert in class and she is getting the education she dreamed of when she was watching that school bus pass by how to help checks payable to the new york times neediest cases fund should be sent to 4 chase metrotech center , 7th floor east , lockbox 5193

the stupidest angel a heartwarming tale of christmas terror by christopher moore william morrow 275 pages 1495 the season for frankly exploitative holiday novels is off to an early start this year , thanks to the stupidest angel , a christmas story by christopher moore but mr moore , whose cult readership finds him delightful for good reason , marches to his own little drummer boy so his christmas book is also just right for halloween , combining an archangel , a miracle and braineating zombies rising from their graves it also arrives with a doctor s recommendation for allegedly lowering blood pressure hooting at mr moore s offthewall california comedy may be good for your healthit s party time in pine cove , a coastal village tarted up in holiday quaintage and loaded with tourist appeal here mr moore convenes a sly gathering of characters from his earlier novels , which include island of the sequined love nun , the lust lizard of melancholy cove and lamb the gospel according to biff , christ s childhood pal as even his titles indicate , mr moore is seriously wicked about humor , if none too pious about holiday cheer given the highly exploitable nature of pine cove , the stupidest angel also throws in dale pearson , pine cove s evil developer , for good measure dale is dressed as santa claus , which does not stop him from socking his exwife her name is lena marquez , and she is also dressed as santa lena is presiding over a salvation army kettle , in full view of a women s fitness center called bulges seeing this assault , the exercisers opened their cellphones in unison , like the jets flicking switchblades as they gaily danced into a 'west side story' gangfight to the death the next day dale meets with an unfortunate , fatal accident involving lena and a shovel so , a dead santa , says tuck case , a man who usually keeps company with a giant fruit bat named roberto , but who would like to get to know dale pearson s brandnew widow better do you live around here \? since lena is still holding a bloody shovel , tuck s judgment would appear questionable , but the crime was a complete accident and tuck would like to help lena , who is busily rubbing her fingerprints off the shovel s handle i'm a little concerned about there where your name is spelled out in magic marker on the handle , he says that might give things away people never return garden tools if you do n't mark them , lena explains everyone here is winningly peculiar even the local police officer , theo crowe , is strangely laidback \( he only had three speeds amble , lope and still \) that s because theo is usually in a drug haze and busy trying to remember where he left his handcuffs , either in his volvo or attached to his bed then there is roberto , the giant micronesian fruit bat in tiny raybans and there is molly michon , a bmovie star once known as the warrior babe of the outland and currently weaning herself from her antipsychotic drugs in an effort to save money for holiday gifts when molly cooks in this condition , she thinks the ricotta is taunting her soft cheeses could be so smug there s more in fact , there s much , much more in a novel that itself has only one speed \( sneaky antic \) and is laboring under certain selfimposed obligations mr moore has set out to juggle two very different festive moods , and he succeeds , because when the zombies are reanimated , they want to shop at ikea \( no one knows why , but second only to eating the brains of the living , the dead love affordable prefab furniture \) in addition , he is executing a potentially awkward mixandmatch maneuver with characters from different stories , different continents , even different cosmic spheres the title character , from lamb , is an archangel he has been sent to pine cove to find a child \( what do you think this is , bangkok \? one resident snaps \) and grant that child s christmas wish it does n't help that the boy the archangel chooses is jaded enough to use the noxious local wine lingo to describe candy bars \( nestl s crunch a bit na ve , but an undergrowth of ambergris and walnut gives it legs \) or that the archangel is a little well , see title for that the stupidest angel is a gleeful string of gags and wisecracks , culminating in a ghoulish melee that is weaker than the rest readers may be less interested in the zombies' use of a battering ram than in their ability to tell , even from underground , whether the living are wearing armani the fashion plate in question is the town s psychiatrist , and the book has fun with the fact that she wears lipstick to match her footwear before that , the only pine cove resident who could be accused of that was molly and the color was black while this book is not mr moore s best or wildest , it is buoyant enough to look like his big , overdue breakout chalk that up to the confluence of fruit bat , warrior babe , handcuffs and merrily warped holiday spirit and his earlier work has reached critical mass , to the point at which mr moore is clearly the unhinged hiaasen he s daily show funny and willing to subvert anything , even the pile of dead kringle that sets this fractured fairy tale in motion someone killed santa claus tonight , remarks the boy with the sensitive candybar palate childhood ends too soon , does n't it , son \? theo the clueless policeman says reassuringly in mr moore s version of hohoho storytelling , that s enough to make this sweet little 7yearold want to shoot him
the photograph being passed around the room monday night showed a smiling young man in tan army fatigues in front of a shimmering pool and vast arabicstyle mansion janet interdonato explained that her son , kevin , was standing before the palace of one of saddam hussein s slain sons the group murmured its approval later , there was applause for the two families that sold the most yellow ribbons , and for the visiting soldier who was granted a leave so he could meet his 5weekold son , and for the young mother who was here with her mother and baby for the first time while this was only the third meeting of the toms river family readiness group , created in february as 124 members of the 112th field artillery division of the national guard were shipping out to iraq , this hodgepodge of parents , wives , girlfriends and siblings had already started to coalesce around a common goal providing support and hope to anxious family members left behind two days earlier , the anxiety of hundreds of other national guard families was lifted when they laid eyes on the soldiers of the 253rd transportation company , the first national guard unit in new jersey to return after serving a yearlong tour of duty in iraq but in the meantime , several hundred members of the guard from throughout the state have been put on alert that they are next on the list to be called up , joining the state s 1 , 600 guard members currently mobilized in the coming months , new jersey s national guard members will be called up in numbers not seen since world war ii , with an estimated 70 percent of the state s 7 , 000 members expected to see active duty by the end of 2004 , according to col charles harvey , head of the state s joint forces headquarters and the 57th troop command most of those soldiers will be sent to iraq or to related operations elsewhere in the mideast or in guantanamo bay , cuba , the colonel said around the country , about 100 , 000 national guard members \( of a total 460 , 000 members \) and 75 , 000 reservists have been called to active duty since the war began in the first year , guard members and reservists accounted for about 25 percent of the 135 , 000 troops serving in iraq now heading into the next phase of the operation in iraq , the national guard is expected to make up closer to 40 percent of the ground forces nationally , this is the largest and most complex mobilization since the korean war , said john goheen , a spokesman for the national guard association , a washingtonbased lobbying group you have your peacekeeping troops , your homeland security troops , and the troops in iraq and elsewhere in the region sometimes referred to as weekend warriors or citizen soldiers for their normally limited duty providing local security or emergency cleanup , this mobilization of the national guard has caught some guard members and their families by surprise and with the mounting number of deaths more than 100 so far this month alone and taking of hostages during this time of intense fighting , the relatives of many national guardsmen are asking what their spouses , sons or daughters are doing at war , and , more importantly , when they will be home \? in my opinion , we had to know for sure why we were going over there , said maria cecelia , whose son , sgt juan perez , just returned from iraq you do n't just go there because somebody told you something an embittered ms cecelia , who lives in woodbine , called the war a waste of time , adding that the iraqis want to live the life they live , and everybody has to respect that her daughterinlaw , michelle perez , also believes her husband was called to duty for not the right reason and though ms perez , a secretary from mays landing , fully supports the service her husband has provided , she said she had put her life on hold since her husband was deployed last april and was even reluctant to go out in case her husband should call then when he did call , she said , she could hear gunfire in the background and the phone would go dead it could be several hours before she would hear from him again and know everything was all right while 70 members of the national guard have died so far in iraq , none have been from new jersey like many of the family members waiting for the guard unit , which is based in cape may courthouse , to return last weekend , ms perez was cautiously optimistic that the tour of duty would not be extended indeed , the 253rd transportation company , of which sergeant perez is a member , was rumored to be heading home last december then family members got word that the military s 365daysbootsontheground order was going to be strictly enforced , and that the unit would not be back until this april their return to the united states appeared more likely when the unit was flown to kuwait two weeks ago but with last week s announcement that tours were being extended for 20 , 000 soldiers including 6 , 000 national guard and reserve members to counter insurgencies , most family members refused to get their hopes up until they saw the soldiers marching along the tarmac at fort dix last saturday i 'll believe it when i can actually touch him and know it s real , said ms perez , 35 , who married sergeant perez two days before his unit left for basic training like many who join the national guard , ms cecelia said both her sons signed up for the educational benefits tuitionfree access to any of the state colleges or universities and while they accept the possibility of being called to active duty , either by the state or the country , for years guard members' service has been largely limited to one weekend of drills a month and two weeks during the summer , required to maintain their federal guard status when she signed up in 2001 , specialist nicola harvey said she was primarily interested in the free tuition that came with joining the national guard during her second semester at atlantic cape community college , the 28yearold atlantic city resident found herself being called to active duty i was thinking of the weekend warrior kind of thing , said specialist harvey , a driver with the 253rd company not going to war that s not what the recruiter said in fact , she got a lot more war than she was bargaining for while transporting equipment along a road north of baghdad last august her convoy was cut off by a vehicle that exploded in front of her truck , filling her eyes with shards of glass and bits of shrapnel and leaving her temporarily blinded she is still suffering from damage to both eyes specialist harvey received a purple heart for her injuries , which she gladly displayed during the welcome home celebration at fort dix last weekend and while she said she was proud she survived a year in iraq , she was uncertain if she would renew her commitment in addition to their military obligations , most guard members have fulltime jobs or attend school , so the uncertainty of the scope of the operation in iraq and the broader war on terrorism has created an added level of distress it s not a world war ii situation , where you have the whole nation committed to a war and a place , said mr goheen of the national guard association this is an openended mission so they want to know , 'how long am i going to be there \? ' unlike active duty , most guardsmen have to juggle families , school , jobs they need to tell their employers when they 'll be back also different from the enlisted army , where families live together on military bases with a support system in place , the families of national guard members have few networking opportunities in response , family assistance centers have begun springing up at national guard armories over the last year in the last two months alone , five new centers have opened in new jersey , adding to the three that opened soon after the war began in her 23 years with the military , jane hackbarth , a retired master sergeant , said she has not witnessed such a gearing up of support systems for the guard our families are geographically separated and they do n't know each other , ms hackbarth said they only become a support group because of the reality of this deployment ms hackbarth , who runs the family assistance center in lawrenceville , said , once the soldier leaves , we become the onestop shop , helping family members understand the language of the military , coping with pay problems , and getting to meet each other and bond as military folks like the family readiness group in toms river , most of the support meetings try to maintain a positive attitude back for a twoweek leave to meet his newborn son , specialist ronald wentworth drew some laughs when he shared news from the front with the group no , the mechanics still do n't have any tools yes , the bugs are driving us crazy and no , no one has had time to play with the balls and mitts the group sent over the upbeat tenor is not only meant to provide support for the family members , but also ease the concerns of the soldiers it keeps our minds clear knowing that you guys are good and safe and supporting each other at home , specialist wentworth told the group on monday but that does not mean emotions are not running high after passing around the photograph of her son , kevin , who just turned 25 , tears began to well up in ms interdonato s eyes as she talked about the day she had to say goodbye to him in february i never thought 24 years ago , when i held this baby in my arms , i 'd ever have to send him off to war , she said it was the hardest day of my life , and i hope i never have to do it again capt kevin williams , a chaplain and the coordinator of the assistance center in toms river , put it this way people have been in the guard for 20 to 25 years and never gone anywhere we 're citizen soldiers and expected to stay that way suddenly , we 're shoulder to shoulder with active duty this is clearly a shock for everybody many of those left behind latch onto superstitions , develop coping skills or find other distractions to help pass the time ms perez said she decided not to cut her hair until her husband came home faith parker said she started a diary , which she writes in every day , then mails the entries to her boyfriend , specialist billy davies , every three days so he does n't miss out on anything jamie burrows has been busy buying a house in dorchester and selecting bridesmaids and dresses for the wedding she is planning for august now that her husband , specialist james burrows , is back from iraq they , too , were married in a rushed ceremony just days before her husband s unit was mobilized we do n't really remember it , ms burrows , 21 , said of the small wedding held at fort dix they gave us a wedding planner , but it was all so rushed there was a couple right before us , and another right after us of the august wedding , she admitted that her husband was not quite as excited about it as i am , but he promised me so we 're doing it one subject many spouses and mates were reluctant to talk about was the psychological effect the year apart might have on the relationship ms parker said she thought her relationship with mr davies would get stronger ms perez is planning a honeymoon so they can get to know each other all over again ms burrows said she did n't expect much of a transition we were n't married for very long , so there were not assigned duties yet , said ms burrows it will be like starting over despite these optimistic views , military family counselors say the issue is very real the big question is what happens when they come back \? said ms hackbarth , noting that the adjustment can be particularly difficult for national guard families who are not so indoctrinated into the military way of life to start no one who goes there comes back the same person they will be forever changed and while being in a war zone can have longrange effects on the soldiers , those left behind may have changed also , according to sgt maj john hughes , the family assistance coordinator for the 253rd , the cape may courthouse company that just returned from iraq the spouses have taken on the breadwinner role , writing checks , making big decisions , major hughes said now the soldier comes back and the spouse might not be so ready to relinquish that role after completing their first contractual tour of six years , guard members can renew their contracts for one to six years a minimum of 20 years of service in good standing is required to be eligible for the military s pension plan the question now facing many national guard soldiers as they return from active duty is whether they wish to remain in the guard guard members can be called for active duty for up to two years , so some families are concerned that their soldiers might get called back for another rotation in the wartorn country for soldiers providing services most in demand , like the military police , civil affairs and transportation , mr goheen said that is a real possibility there s no predictability , said ray martyniuk , a spokesman for the new jersey department of veteran and military affairs the national guard exists for the sole purpose to be ready for emergencies if there are three emergencies in a row , they will get called three times and while many families may have discussed retiring from the military during this long year apart , mr goheen noted that once the soldiers are back home their outlook might change soldiers on their way home told their wives 'i'm done i'm not going to do this anymore , said mr goheen but after they 've been here for a few months , their attitude changes they say , 'let s go back and get this thing done
at their best , the nets are a freeflowing thing of beauty they can run the floor with speed and grace , finishing with acrobatics that turn the opposition into spectators as much as the fans in the stands are but there is another side this is when the nets come down from the rafters and dive on the floor , shoving and grunting and playing the game like an oldtime scrum as the nets' game with the knicks deteriorated into that type of contest down the stretch last night , coach lawrence frank looked on from the sideline , tie askew , jacket floating off his shoulders , and he saw beauty in this the way only a mother or a coach could i know the perception may be , well , that game was rather ugly , frank said but you know what \? sometimes playoff basketball , it comes down to grit and toughness and sometimes it s not a thing of beauty i thought our guys just found a way if the nets' 8178 game 3 victory at madison square garden did not leave jaws in the stands agape at the acrobatics , the handtohand combat that left jaws bruised on the floor was beautiful to the nets yeah , i think we like it , frank said when you look at our team , we have found a way to play any style you want sometimes it s halfcourt basketball , a 7268 game , and sometimes it s transition buckets i think we were still 204 in fastbreak points hey , you just got to find a way to win sometimes that pitcher , you ca n't always rely on that fastball sometimes you 've got to throw that eephus pitch offspeed might be an apt description of what the nets displayed down the stretch engaged in their first tense moments of this year s postseason , the nets survived by coming up with the bigger plays none were of the graceful variety what they did display was a toughness that did not resemble the sort of swagger that had been talked about endlessly since this series began the toughness was not shown by throwing punches , or even by shouting angry words this toughness was in surviving a shaky performance and the din of 19 , 763 knicks fans chanting in their ears kenyon martin , who found himself in the center of a storm when he was singled out by knicks forward tim thomas in a diatribe wednesday , answered back in the morning in a bemused fashion , affixing the back page of the daily news with the headline whiny tim to his jersey at the morning shootaround and ripping back at thomas but when the game began last night , martin let his play speak for itself he finished with 19 points and 15 rebounds , and two of the biggest plays of the game with 1 minute 5 seconds to play , martin ripped the ball from penny hardaway no finesse , no deft maneuvering , but simply seeing the ball and grabbing it with both hands then , after richard jefferson converted on a short turnaround over frank williams and hardaway delivered a 3pointer to close the gap to a single point with 423 seconds left , martin rose again this time , he took a feed from jefferson as the nets scrambled for a shot jefferson had nearly lost the ball , but jason kidd recovered it and got it back to jefferson , who drove and kicked the ball out to martin on the left side of the lane martin stepped in and tossed a short jump hook over kurt thomas , drawing a foul and completing a 3point play with 259 seconds remaining we made a run , got up , they came back , martin said i think our mental toughness more than anything helped us out , just being in this position before to be up on a team and have them make a run at us and us not folding the goal is to win the game , no matter how you do it i think we did a pretty good job tonight the nets' ire was up for much of the fourth quarter , with derogatory chants echoing through the arena as a loud portion of the crowd heaped verbal abuse on kidd in particular kidd and martin yelled back at the fans at times , but kept their cool when it counted well , i think kenyon had his say , kidd said he did n't let anything deter him out there on the basketball court he was focused and ready to play he was a monster on the boards when we needed a bucket , we did n't have too many in the fourth quarter , he stepped up and made a little jump hook and got fouled it s just the maturity and the growth of those two guys tonight richard jefferson and kmart it was just a matter of executing and the ball bouncing your way we got very fortunate when r j lost the ball and i came up with it , threw it back to him and he made a great play nobody panicked , kidd added we just kept our composure , tried to execute , take what they gave us the knicks played extremely hard and we went to the end
was howard dean ever really regarded as the birkenstock candidate \? that seems a fuzzy memory now , six days before the iowa caucuses , as the democratic frontrunner has disported himself day in and day out on the campaign trail in a manner that has failed to conjure up images of buffalo springfield albums or the graphics on a pint of ben jerry s so committed has dr dean been to his let sdobusiness look of rolled shirt sleeves and a meticulously knotted tie that he stuck to it even while handing out pancakes from behind a griddle to voters in iowa over the weekend no tshirts for him instead , he protected his oxford cloth with a green apron criticized for his imbalances of opinion reversing his view on free trade , evincing support for the iraq war resolution while maintaining an antiwar platform dr dean has remained consistent in his dress , while his opponents have made greater use of the politician s closet despite their differences , most of the candidates have styled themselves in accordance with the customary code of presidential primary dress the goal , paradoxically , is to look unpresidential , said bruce bimber , a professor of political science and communication at the university of california at santa barbara dressing down , rolling up your shirt sleeves , this is universal you 're saying i'm not part of the government you 're electing me to , professor bimber said we have n't loved authority in an unmitigated way since kennedy representative richard a gephardt has availed himself of the working man s cloth and the golfer s pullover he might turn up in a union jacket if he s addressing members of the international association of machinists or speaking at a vfw hall and he might opt for a sweater and khakis in intimate settings clearly he s got to expand the base beyond unions to middle class voters so this makes sense , said david redlawsk , a professor of political science at the university of iowa i think there s a real middle america thing to the vneck sweater , he added it s practical and it covers up a wrinkled shirt middle america is not the message instantly conveyed by the vneck sweaters favored by joseph i lieberman , who has been concentrating his campaign efforts in new hampshire senator lieberman has appeared in the sort with necklines high up to the collarbone it is disconcertingly fashionforward for a man of his devout faith and seriousness a look more befitting a candidate who might do his best stump work at an east hampton fundraiser this smacks of a bad adviser trying to make him seem less grandfatherly , said marion maneker , author of dreaming in the dark lessons in men s style from the movies instead , mr maneker added , the effect is of a german auto executive it is hard to recall when the sweater has been the subject of so much attention in a presidential race last week gen wesley k clark bought a green wool crew neck at an l l bean outlet in concord , nh , while a team of reporters waited outside when he put on an argyle sweater , also in new hampshire , political commentators balked at his misguided effort to lure female voters in a garment that calls to mind a children s television show host playing to his audience too literally , he switched to a sweatshirt that simply read college when doling out pancakes himself at a breakfast held at dartmouth college beyond that , every candidate is using style to militate against some specific negative preconception knowing the world does not take him as seriously as it might , the rev al sharpton rarely goes anywhere in anything other than a suit at the same time , senator john kerry has tried to dilute his image as a man who has no idea how to dig into a philadelphia cheese steak on the campaign trail , he has tried to make voters forget he is worth hundreds of millions of dollars by throwing on a leather bomber jacket with patches it is meant to reinforce the idea that senator kerry would be fully capable of getting up in front of a karaoke machine and singing all the lyrics to jungleland , if asked lately , he s attired himself more effortlessly in a canvas hunting jacket senator john edwards has a somewhat different issue to combat that he is , for lack of a more appropriate phrase , too pretty teased early on in the campaign for his perfectly coiffed hair and dubbed the breck girl , senator edwards has campaigned in fleecelined windbreakers , suggesting a suburban regular joeness for the now enormously wealthy son of a millworker , it is a look that is neither too moneyed nor selfconsciously like a plumber from a fashion point of view , none of the candidates look particularly eyecatching but that is how it must be , as evidenced by dr dean s immediate backtracking last fall after telling of being complimented on his appearance and suggesting he was a metrosexual on second thought he was really a square , he said in our age when we venerate style , we still do n't like our politicians to look stylish , mr maneker said the great men of style in government were guys like dean acheson , who could n't ever have been elected
an authoritative new biography of oskar schindler , the german businessman who saved more than 1 , 000 jews from the nazis , clashes sharply with his idealized portrayal in the oscarwinning 1993 steven spielberg movie schindler s list and the 1982 historical novel by thomas keneally that inspired it the schindler who emerges in this latest account based on interviews with holocaust survivors and newly discovered papers , including letters stored in a suitcase by a mistress is far more flawed than the one depicted in the movie and novel even so , scholars say , the fresh revelations about schindler s darker side cast his moral transformation and heroism into starker relief to begin with , there was no schindler s list schindler had almost nothing to do with the list , said david m crowe , a holocaust historian and professor at elon university in north carolina , whose book , oskar schindler the untold account of his life , wartime activities and the true story behind the list , was published this fall by westview press in the film , schindler , played by liam neeson , is shown in 1944 giving the jewish manager of his enamelware and arms factory in krakow , poland , the names of jewish workers to be taken to the relative safety of what is now the czech republic but at the time , mr crowe said in a telephone interview , schindler was in jail for bribing amon g th , the brutal ss commandant played by ralph fiennes in the film and the manager , itzhak stern \( ben kingsley \) , was not even working for schindler then mr crowe said that there were nine lists the first four were drawn up primarily by marcel goldberg , a corrupt jewish security police officer and assistant to an ss officer in charge of transporting jews \( goldberg was later accused of accepting bribes and of favoritism \) schindler suggested a few names , mr crowe said , but did not know most of the people on the lists the authors of the other five lists are unknown mr crowe said the legend of the list arose partly from schindler himself , to embellish his heroism he was trying to win reparations for his wartime losses , and yad vashem , the jewish holocaust memorial organization in jerusalem , was considering naming him a righteous gentile , an honor given to someone who risked death to save jews those he saved further enhanced the legend because they adored him , mr crowe said , and they protected him no one doubts that schindler , an ethnic german born in what was then austriahungary , was a moral hero , but the revelations add deeper texture to his story it has long been known that schindler was a spy for german counterintelligence in the late 1930 s , but he played down those activities yet mr crowe said that czech secret police archives refer to schindler as a spy of big caliber and an especially dangerous type mr crowe also said that schindler compromised czechoslovak security before the nazi invasion and was imprisoned later , the czechoslovak government tried to prosecute him for war crimes schindler was also the de facto head of a unit that planned the nazi invasion of poland schindler , a big , charming man , was a drinker and womanizer , as depicted in the novel and film but mr crowe said that he also had two illegitimate children whom he ignored there were also rumors , briefly mentioned in the book and film , that after schindler moved to krakow in 1939 as a carpetbagger following the nazi invasion , he stole jewish property and ordered jews beaten although the charges were unproven , mr crowe discovered that yad vashem was so concerned that it delayed designating schindler a righteous gentile the film s epilogue says schindler was named in 1958 , 16 years before his death in 1974 but mr crowe found that he was officially named in 1993 , after yad vashem learned that schindler s widow , emilie , who also behaved heroically , was coming to jerusalem to participate in the film both received the honor , he posthumously there are many books about schindler , including accounts by survivors and emilie s memoirs , but mr crowe s is the first comprehensive biography to draw on newly available records mr crowe is a member of the education committee of the united states holocaust memorial museum in washington , and the author of a history of the gypsies of russia and eastern europe he dismissed some scenes in the film and book that are part of schindler s legend for instance , in the film schindler is shown riding with his mistress on lasota hill in krakow and watching the clearing of the ghetto in march 1943 , when he sees a little girl seeking shelter the scene depicts schindler s moral awakening , but mr crowe called it totally fictitious he said that it would have been impossible to see that part of the ghetto from the hill , and that schindler never saw the girl schindler s transformation was more gradual , mr crowe said , and even before the ghetto was cleared he was appalled by the mistreatment of the jews steve is a very wonderful , tender man , mr crowe said of mr spielberg , but schindler s list' was theater and not in an historically accurate way the film simplifies the story almost to the point of ridiculousness mr crowe also said that he admired mr keneally s novel mr keneally , who interviewed 50 survivors and used available archives for his novel , said it was understandable that mr spielberg and the screenwriter steven zaillian would take dramatic license with some events i believe steven behaved with integrity , he said and he does make schindler ambiguous mr spielberg is filming a movie and could not be reached for comment , but a spokesman , marvin levy , said in an email message that schindler was such an enigmatic figure in life , it is not totally surprising that other information or alleged information could continue to surface in death michael berenbaum , former president of the survivors of the shoah visual history foundation , established by mr spielberg to record survivors' memories , made a distinction between the craft of the historian and the artist it does neither an injustice to the novel , the film or to history to say that the story is more complex , he said mr crowe is not even altering the story , elie wiesel , the author and holocaust survivor , said he s complicated it he s made schindler more human , and also more extraordinary after schindler moved his factory to br nnlitz in the presentday czech republic , a period dealt with only briefly in the film , he stalled the manufacture of weapons , and none were ever made for the nazis he also bribed nazi officers and distracted them with alcohol to save his workers mr keneally describes his heroism in krakow , mr crowe said , he could use the black market to supply his workers with food and health care but by the time he arrived in br nnlitz the russians were advancing , making conditions harsher he risks his life and takes all the money he made in krakow and spends every bit trying to feed his jews and keep them healthy , mr crowe said in an episode known as the golleschau transport , which is depicted in the book but not the film , two boxcars arrived in br nnlitz filled with jewish prisoners , some frozen to death schindler and his wife were able to save many of the prisoners amid the chaos , schindler also tried to accommodate jewish religious law , getting ss officers drunk so that jews could be properly buried mr crowe said that the only part of the film that angered him was the ending , in which schindler flees as the russians advance the jews are shown as defeated , but in fact , mr crowe said , schindler had created an armed guerilla group of jews they were armed to the teeth , ready to fight till the death , he said hours after schindler left , they hung a jew who worked for the nazis in the film , schindler gives a speech and breaks into tears because he did not do more but mr crowe obtained a transcript in which schindler , always a wily pragmatist , also reminded the jews of how much he had done for them , possibly to protect himself from prosecution for war crimes after the war schindler was a failure he squandered money given to him by the american jewish joint distribution committee and moved to argentina , where he attempted to breed nutria he then returned to germany and bought a concrete factory , where workers attacked him for saving jews during the war that factory went bankrupt schindler continued drinking , and begged jews he had saved to help him financially he died from alcoholism and heavy smoking , mr crowe said mordecai paldiel , director of the righteous among the nations department at yad vashem , said the new revelations show that even people with all these characteristics can do a great , saintly deed it seems we all have a little angel sitting inside us and just waiting to be allowed to go to the surface , to expose himself , he said a little , saving angel
as a breakneck beat of drums , whistles and bells urged them on , the sidewalk diners got up from halfeaten dishes of peppers and pasta and started shimmying their way onto arthur avenue blame the wine \? better pin it on francesco castiglione , who with his black leather jacket and wraparound shades cut a hip figure as he serenaded those who dared to be wallflowers at his street party terra bella ! he sang in italian to a decidedly nonitalian samba beat i come to america , and what am i going to find \? that s my song let s go ! heads tossed back , arms spread wide and the party hit the bronx street , where francesco stopped cars with outofstate plates for impromptu singalongs diners leaving other restaurants joined in , too as the song wound down , he segued into a booming version of volare with enough reverb to make it sound as if dean martin himself were crooning from the heavens the second season of sidewalk concerts turned the arthur avenue cafe into big night meets a bronx tale except with francesco at the mike , nobody was waiting for louis prima and this party was in the bronx , unlike the cinematic tale , which was filmed in astoria , queens just as astoria is n't just greek anymore , arthur avenue probably has more albanians , mexicans , dominicans and puerto ricans than italians but romantic notions of food , the old days and older ways still sell the italian soul is here , but it is disappearing , said nick santilli , a regular on the avenue who grew up in abruzzi , italy shopped in east harlem when that area was solidly italian and lived in yorkville when german could still be heard on its streets this is like italy from 40 , 50 years ago it retained that classic character , not the new character this music is like neapolitan songs italian music today is 50 cent and snoop doggy dogg this italy existed years ago the italy that exists today made francesco , 22 and on a firstname basis with everyone , decide it was time to leave his native calabria a couple of years ago he had been a musician ever since the sight of his grandfather s accordion sitting on a dresser entranced him when he was 4 years old he studied piano for 10 years at a conservatory and taught music for a while before he knew that he had to leave southern italy is really difficult to make it , he said if i was from rome or milan , it would be different he shrugged he said he had family in the area , so he joined them we always look to that thing of sinatra , he said if you can make it in new york , you can make it anywhere a mutual friend introduced him to david greco , who had recently opened a cafe on arthur avenue , across the street from the market where his family runs mike s deli mr greco , a member of the younger generation who was intent on keeping part of arthur avenue culturally authentic in ways long gone in manhattan s little italy , was looking for a singer he had not heard francesco utter a single note , but he was impressed just by the way he carried himself he had confidence , mr greco said my father gave me the same kind of confidence i can sell salami to anybody because of him francesco had so much confidence , i knew he had to have talent soon enough , he was able to win over the toughest critics in the neighborhood when he kept a wedding afterparty going for hours after quitting time in a couple of years , he has already done well , appearing on several television shows and visiting hollywood where he innocently turned down one private gig with the question , who is joe pesci \? his goal is to find stardom in argentina , which makes sense since he mixes italian lyrics with latin and caribbean rhythms , along with more than a little eyeflashing charm in new york , he had to learn some new , american songs , like that s amore , which turns out is n't italian you might say the same thing about the neighborhood , too , despite the efforts of its most boosterish merchants like spanish harlem , yorkville , astoria or the lower east side , the ethnic enclaves of the past sometimes live on only in the stores that cater to those who grew up there or tourists seeking an authentic ethnic experience was there ever a real ethnic haven where outsiders from all countries were welcomed \? one where diners danced in the streets and sidewalk singers made the ladies swoon \? in a way , the answer lies in the old country specifically , those who left and came to places like arthur avenue , where they recreated their old towns as they settled into their new one their children , the ones who grew up being dragged by the hand from store to store , have one memory of it their grandchildren have yet another , more selective remembrance of weekend visits to a place that makes their parents get all dreamy on shopping trips for cheese , bread and pasta there are some people who are into this delusion , who will describe these places as being the real little italy , said jerry krase , a past president of the american italian historical association to me , the real italian ethnic neighborhoods are the places they do not know about what makes it a real place is that it is a place others do not go to according to fred gardaph , a professor of italianamerican studies at state university at stony brook , the largest concentration of italians in new york state is in suffolk county the whole thing about becoming american is you have got to leave little italy , mr gardaph said when you leave , it becomes more romantic in their mind if it was so beautiful , why did you leave it \? what it is , then , is it becomes an ethnic disneyland and god forbid they go to disney and see what they did to italy given that last thought , maybe these neighborhoods do serve a noble purpose in offering a taste of authenticity in an olive garden world mr greco , a fan of all things italian , insists he embarked on his cafe business because he wanted people to eat in a causal atmosphere like back in calabria it was n't because of money , since his cafe has not turned a profit what it has done , he said , is brought some life to the street at night this is my neighborhood , mr greco said people think i just run a business here but i spent six , seven days a week here i'm here more than i am at my house maybe i should mind my own business he thought about that for a minute i want this to stay as an italian bar , he said what i do not want is to sell this so it becomes another albanian club at francesco s season premiere two weekends ago , the patrons at an albanian restaurant across the street barely looked up as he set up his keyboard , accordion and amplifier mexican laborers walked home , tired and grimy , clutching bags from mcdonald s francesco , singing to no one in particular , wandered the street singing , in italian , a whiter shade of pale the lyrics made about as much sense in his mother tongue as they do in english , which is to say none francesco stepped back into the cafe , where the diners swayed ever so slightly as he sang come back to sorrento to folks who most likely had just come over from fordham university or connecticut , where he sometimes also sings at a restaurant a few minutes and drinks later , the crowd was moving onto the street the difference is when i play in connecticut , they are really quiet , francesco said when they come to the bronx , they sing and go crazy
the intensifying debate over prewar american intelligence about iraq presents president bush with difficult and risky alternatives as he balances election year politics with calls to overhaul the intelligence apparatus and to restore the nation s credibility around the world he could order the start of an inquiry about the performance of intelligence agencies , as democrats and the former chief weapons inspector , david a kay , have insisted , but his aides fear that that could prove politically damaging and would almost certainly reopen old wounds with the cia he could keep arguing that military action was justified no matter how immediate a threat saddam hussein posed , and put off an examination and possible overhaul of america s intelligence operations for another year but his political team worries that doing so could keep the issue alive through a long campaign or the president and those on his national security team who once described how mr hussein could use his stockpiles of weapons to strike at any time could conclude that something went badly wrong during their long march to war but the white house does not make a habit of admitting error and even if mr bush vowed to fix what many say is a broken system , his national security aides note , the fix would not be easy they 've made a pretty huge mess of it , said one senior republican who has been talking to mr bush s top advisers about what steps to take next they wove this giant story , based on intelligence assessments that in hindsight and this is hindsight , remember were wrong it s exposed a huge problem in our intelligence gathering but who wants to take that on in an election year \? or while you are fighting terrorists \? white house officials will not talk at length about why they are so deeply hesitant to start an investigation but they are facing a situation where democrats are looking for evidence to blame mr bush and vice president dick cheney , and some republicans are looking for evidence to blame george j tenet , the director of central intelligence one white house official said thursday that there was clearly a risk that an inquiry could spin out of control , exactly what many administration officials fear has happened to the inquiry into the sept 11 attacks yet some officials are beginning to argue , in background conversations , that such an investigation is inevitable now that dr kay has declared to the senate that we were almost all wrong the politics of doing what dr kay says needs to be done conduct an inquiry and overhaul the intelligence community before a similar mistake is made over iran , north korea or other potential threats has grown enormously complex mr bush has publicly defended the unbelievably hardworking , dedicated people of the american intelligence agencies in part , some administration officials say , because he because he wants to avoid another bitter public dispute with mr tenet and the intelligence apparatus feelings are still raw over last summer s open arguments between the white house and mr tenet over who was to blame for mr bush s faulty claim in the 2003 state of the union address that iraq was trying obtain uranium in africa they were worsened by the accusations that a white house official blew the cover of valerie plame , a cia officer who operated under cover and is the wife of mr bush s greatest critic on the africa claim , joseph c wilson iv repairing that damage has taken months , and a grand jury has recently begun to hear evidence about the leak many intelligence officials continue to argue that real problem was not the ambiguous intelligence about iraq s weapons capacity , but how mr bush and mr cheney chose to use it on thursday , appearing on nbc , condoleezza rice , the national security adviser , insisted that mr bush and mr cheney were not ducking the issue no one will want to know more than the president of the comparison between what we found when we got there and what we thought was there going in , ms rice said she sounded in no hurry , saying it was important to let the iraq survey group complete its work , work that dr kay believes is 85 percent done many republicans have a different instinct to follow dr kay s lead and put the blame on the agency s assessments rather than the white house in their view , that is the best way to insulate mr bush from the charge that he cherrypicked the most damaging information conveniently , some of them have long been suspicious of mr tenet , who was put in his post by president bill clinton , and see this as an opportunity to speed along a retirement that the central intelligence chief has been talking about for a year but mr tenet has many defenders , including the president s father it was a measure of mr bush s problem , and mr tenet s , that senator pat roberts , the republican chairman of the senate intelligence committee , said this week that his committee s draft report of what went wrong , to be issued soon , would be very specific , and very critical this is , indeed , a very egregious problem , he said if your intelligence is wrong you 're in a world of trouble mr bush s political advisers are highly aware that dr kay s report has given democratic contenders for the presidential nomination something they have long sought a way to revive the issue of whether mr bush was careless and triggerhappy , willing to twist intelligence findings to fit his own agenda , even at the cost of american credibility abroad what that leaves for now is a slow retreat by white house officials a daybyday , factbyfact backing away from assertions they made with such confidence nine months ago mr bush no longer declares , as he once did , that he is certain that sooner or later unconventional weapons will be found in iraq he still thinks it , one of his aides said , but i'm not sure you will hear him say it until the iraq survey group s investigation is complete mr powell , last weekend , started backing away as well , saying more assertively than ever before that there might be no weapons stockpiles in iraq and that if none are found , an effort had to begin to find out what went wrong nonetheless , he and ms rice argue that mr hussein brought his troubles on himself by refusing to account for stockpiles that the united nations said existed in the mid1990 s only mr cheney , the man who made the most extensive claims about iraq s readiness to strike out , has failed to back down publicly last friday he was on the air again , talking about mr hussein s mobile biological weapons units , which now appear , dr kay says , to have had no such purpose we 'll have to get cheney the new memo , one white house official said after mr cheney s comments as soon as we write it
hatchet jobs writings on contemporary fiction by dale peck 228 pp the new press 2395 although robert southey was the poet laureate of england from 1813 until his death in 1843 , and a lake district buddy of coleridge and wordsworth , he is hardly read at all today a wisecrack by richard porson may have done some serious damage about southey s epic poems , porson said , they will be read when homer and virgil are forgotten , but not till then you will notice that i mosey some of us , when we are about to be unpleasant , are bothered by the feeling that it s almost as hard to write a bad book as a good one and lots easier to write a slashandburn review so we walk around the block to suck up randall jarrell and perspective others , like dale peck , fall down out of the sky on the head of the pedestrian author like a piano or a safe peck is his own blunt instrument which is why , in hatchet jobs , his newgate calendar of maledictions , he leans on words with primary colors , like terrible , bloated , boring and gratuitous hate , resent , stale and slather maudlin , dreck , drivel and insipid muddled , pretentious , derivative and bathetic not to mention scatologies that ca n't be reprinted here but brought no blush to the bum of the new republic , where most of peck s fatwas first appeared and where most of american literature is generally considered a waste of the editors' warped space and deep time peck is so hard on his elders that you suspect him of symbolic patricide , except that he is just as hard on his peers famously , of course , rick moody the worst writer of his generation but colson whitehead gets it for his stiff , schematic first novel , the intuitionist , and a second , john henry days , with the doughy center of a halfbaked cake david foster wallace s infinite jest so much fails to amuse him that he wishes on wallace an anal assault richard powers , dave eggers and the jonathans , franzen and lethem , are rudely dismissed for lack of a true empathetic undercurrent and what he elsewhere disdains as pomo shenanigans nor is he impressed by the dirty realists \( trailer homes \) , the brat packers \( nightclubs \) or the new narrativists \( sexual transgression \) but the wise old heads are also on his chopping block so nabokov , between lolita and pale fire , sold out to sterile inventions at the bottom of its bowl of watery oatmeal , the subtext of american pastoral is philip roth s misogyny thomas pynchon in a 30year writing career has n't produced a single memorable or even recognizably human character julian barnes crawls under your skin and itches like scabies stanley crouch s do n't the moon look lonesome is such a terrible novel , badly conceived , badly executed and put forward in bad faith , that it s amazing the guy shows up on charlie rose the ridiculous dithering of john barth , john hawkes and william gaddis is n't even worth discussing , but they belong to a bankrupt tradition going back to james joyce and the diarrheic flow of words that is 'ulysses , ' which tradition has now broken down like a cracked sidewalk beneath the weight of the stupid just plain stupid tomes of don delillo this is n't criticism it is n't even performance art it s thuggee however entertaining in small doses we are none of us immune to malice , envy , schadenfreude , a prurient snuffle and a sucker punch as a steady diet it s worse for readers , writers and reviewers than selfabuse it causes the kind of tonedeaf , colorblind , nervedamaged and gumsore literary journalism that screams look at me ! the rain comes down and the worms come out and just what the culture does n't need is one more hall monitor , bounty hunter or east german border guard not that peck hates everyone there s homer , e m forster , thomas bernhard , joan didion and kurt vonnegut but except for vonnegut , all they get in his fleet passing are adjectives that glow like gumdrops in the dark he would much rather seethe and twitch if you are n't a novelist , he hairshirts , i'm not sure you can imagine what it feels like to write such heresy though i normally write in the morning , i am writing this in the middle of the night like a fugitive my hands are literally shaking as i type is he really that afraid of heidi julavits \? the hit man is projecting so western literary culture went off the tracks with j joyce , smashed up entirely with d delillo and deserves wholesale junkheaping , from the modernists who merely twinkletoed in the theater of war , one blood war after another , to the posttoasties who ca n't even tell anymore if they 're being ironic in place of the word games , peck would bring back something ineffable , alchemical , mystical the potent cocktail of writer and reader and language , of intention and interpretation , conscious and unconscious , text , subtext and context , narrative , character , metaphor novels illustrating the tension between society and the self , written by the oldfashioned sort of authorgod who feels guilty about causing his characters to suffer so much and offers them apologies in the form of epiphanies or the satisfaction of inhabiting a meaningful narrative scratch a commissar and you get a philistine but i have n't mentioned sven birkerts , have i \? never mind delillo , who is smarter than all of us \( except maybe powers \) or pynchon , whose mason and dixon are certainly more memorable than peck s martin and john or whitehead , whose intuitionist is a levitating marvel or barnes , whose flaubert s parrot has been cunningly ignored never even mind stanley crouch , who dumped on toni morrison and so deserves finding out exactly what it feels like but peck devotes more than 30 contemptuous pages to sven birkerts , for the street crime and mortal sin of generosity in literary criticism think of it with a whole world of worthy targets rupert murdoch , michael eisner , donald trump , conrad black , eli manning , shell oil , clear channel , cond nast he mugs a man who has spent the last quarter of a century staying poor by reviewing other people s books , who has read more widely , warmly and deeply than the vampire bat fastened to his carotid , who should be commended rather than ridiculed for a willingness to take on a review of a new translation of mandelstam s journals , and who , even though he wrote a regrettably mixed review of a book of mine in these pages , deserves far better from the community of letters , if there is one , than peck s bumptious heehaw with friends like this , literature needs an enema it s the relish on this hotdog that turns the stomach he promises never to do it again , but the very title hatchet jobs reeks of market niche , an underground service like fumigation or garbage recycling his alibi for being unfair is that he s a novelist , and they lie a lot but his reputation would have long since earned him the right at his various pillboxes and lemonade stands to review any book he chose , out of hundreds of good ones needing discovery among tens of thousands cynically published , and yet he almost always seems to pick a punching bag , or draw his own bull seye on the passing chump this is lazy , churlish and even demagogic i was going to suggest some hardwon guidelines for responsible reviewing for instance first , as in hippocrates , do no harm second , never stoop to score a point or bite an ankle third , always understand that in this symbiosis , you are the parasite fourth , look with an open heart and mind at every different kind of book with every change of emotional weather because we are reading for our lives and that could be love gone out the window or a horseman on the roof fifth , use theory only as a periscope or a trampoline , never a panopticon , a crib sheet or a license to kill sixth , let a hundred harolds bloom but instead i 'll tell a story many years ago the editor of this publication asked me to review john cheever s last , brief novel , oh what a paradise it seems , after he had already been turned down by half a dozen critics who knew that cheever was dying but thought his new book a weak one and did n't want to compromise their supreme importance with a random act of kindness it never occurred to me that a thankyou note to a wonderful writer , a valediction as it were , would get me kicked out of any club i wanted to belong to , so i immediately said yes at the time , besides that review , i wanted to write a message to those preening scribblers who thought they were too good for lesser cheever on a card , in small caps , i would have said what i say to peck get over yourself
dr katharina dalton , a british gynecologist who did early work establishing a link between fluctuations in the menstrual cycle and changes in behavior and who advocated using progesterone to treat premenstrual syndrome , died on sept 17 in britain , the associated press reported she was 87 beginning in the early 1950 s , dr dalton led pioneering studies of premenstrual syndrome , challenging the widely accepted view that the condition was a figment of the imagination she led one of the first clinics to specifically treat the symptoms , at university college hospital in london she is largely credited with developing the use of menstrual charts for the diagnosis of the disorder , and argued that the timing of pms in women was associated with higher rates of suicide attempts , alcohol abuse and violent crimes many people did not believe it was a real entity , said dr mona shangold , a former assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at new york hospitalcornell medical center she really brought it into the public eye , and eventually it became an accepted disorder for which we now have good treatments pms , dr dalton argued , was brought on primarily by deficiencies of progesterone and could be alleviated with hormone therapy she also believed that the hormone could be used to ease postnatal depression but today most experts disagree with those findings and instead rely on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , or ssri s , and other medications for the treatment of pms none of the rest of us have found progesterone as helpful as the data dr dalton presented , but she really was quite influential in the modern understanding of what happens to women premenstrually , said dr diana dell , an obgyn and psychiatrist at the duke university medical center born in 1916 in london , katharina kuipers dalton began her career as a podiatrist after studying at the london foot hospital after her first husband died during world war ii , she decided to switch careers and earned a medical degree at the royal free hospital in later work , dr dalton helped demonstrate that depression and other disorders could be aggravated by pms , particularly around the last few days of the menstrual cycle or the first days of menstruation while many experts today agree that pms can exacerbate certain conditions and influence behavior , some of dr dalton s assertions remain controversial in several court cases in the 1980 s , for example , she testified in defense of women who blamed severe pms for their criminal offenses several of dr dalton s books , including once a month , published in the late 70 s , became best sellers dr dalton is survived by four children and five grandchildren , according to the independent , a british daily

if you wonder what it means to say that art is a calling , do n't miss the ethereal tools of her ministry the art of sister gertrude morgan at the american folk art museum during the 1950 s , sister morgan believed that god called on her to paint she was in her mid50 s , a selfappointed prophet , a street preacher in new orleans , the headquarters of sin , as she called it with no art training and illustrated bibles for guides , she put pencils , pens , crayons and paints to paper , canvas , cardboard and almost anything else at hand styrofoam food trays , toilet paper rolls , doors , window and lamp shades , scrap wood and detergent boxes untutored but full of an uncanny grace , her paintings were meant as teaching aids to spread the word of god , and words , thousands of them , increasingly took up every spare millimeter of space in her pictures they flowed , streamofconsciousnesslike , in rapt and incantatory style , which was also how she spoke woe woe woe name of the star worm wood john the revelator hell fire help help earth quake oh oh oh sister gertrude morgan the lord of lambs wife , annotates a scene of goggleeyed angels from the book of revelations briefly she became a cultish favorite rosemary kent visited her in the early 1970 s to write an article for the first issue of interview magazine sister morgan was seated behind her whitedraped table , in her starched white nurse s uniform with her little peaked white cap , dressed as always as the bride of jesus , in the small front room of her whitewashed everlasting gospel mission , pounding her tambourine and shouting sermons through a narrow painted paper megaphone in her gravelly alto voice in the show is a photograph of the room , pictures on the wall a painting of the eye of god , a head of jesus , a scene of new jerusalem , which sister morgan envisioned as a 12story apartment block with pingpong tables , a cabbage patch and interracial bands of angels swaying in the sky like a field of wheat in a strong wind two floors of the folk art museum are now occupied with these painted epiphanies , happy consolations for a worldweary urbanite warning sternly about hellfire and brimstone , they are hugely endearing , a contrast conveyed in the photographs of sister morgan , solid and stern , fixedly surveying a world in desperate need of salvation she was , by all accounts , a solemn and intimidating woman , determined to bring light into dark places , and if her work had nothing conscious to do with easy charm , it was charming nonetheless its plainspoken ecstasy gives it an aura you do n't have to be religious to appreciate the inborn eloquence , both formal and literary you only have to accept that painting , when it comes from the heart and is so clearly genuine , can lift the soul sister morgan insisted that jesus deserved all the credit , but she was her own favorite subject , a closet egotist who painted herself beside jesus on his barcaloungerlike throne or at their mixedrace wedding , where he was a chubby white man in a tight tuxedo or buzzing in the cockpit of his airplane , where she was a doting lover to her mustachioed romeo she signed her works your boss s wife , nurse to doctor jesus , everlasting gospel revelation painter , little ethiopia girl , housekeeper for dada god she was born gertrude williams , in lafayette , ala , on a saturday , the seventh day of the week , april 7 , 1900 , the seventh child of frances and edward williams at 28 , she married a man named will morgan she was , she later said , havin' a good time , goin' about my business , goin' to the picture show , until dec 30 , 1934 , when , while sitting in her kitchen , she first thought she heard the voice of god like hundreds of other poor africanamerican women in the south , she started preaching in the streets , working as a nursemaid , tending to children and lost souls her husband disappeared she moved around in new orleans , she met margaret parker and cora williams , and they founded an orphanage sister morgan later painted her recollection of the three of them in their standard outfits black robes with white collars and white sashes about the same time that god told her to start painting , she also believed that she had been anointed the bride of christ so she traded her black robes for white ones and set up her own mission in a shotgun house with fourleaf clovers in the front yard a new orleans art dealer , larry borenstein , came across her work around 1960 he invited her to show her paintings and perform in his gallery , and he made a record album of her singing he also bought the mission for her when it came up for sale and , with an associate , allan jaffe , developed a national following for her art that earned her money to maintain the mission william fagaly , the curator from new orleans who organized the present show and knew borenstein and sister morgan , proposes a rough chronology for the art , which is mostly undated the exhibition starts with small crayon drawings , alternately childlike and polished , as if some figures were traced the palette is muted these works give way to increasingly baroque fantasies in bright primary colors with flickering skies , speckled beasts and painted alphabets \( a is for the apple that grows on the tree \) the throughline a combination of obsessiveness and innocence suggests a great deal about sister gertrude morgan s demeanor and character , mr fagaly writes in the catalog he adds her religious devotion was so acute as to be considered abnormal and eccentric and to put her at a certain remove from society she was clearly an extreme case her mix of text and image relates to works by a slew of modern artists and poets , none of whom she ever heard of or cared about the ups and downs in her painting , which affects how we judge it aesthetically , belie its true purpose , to give visual form to voices in her head her paintings were talismans of mystical devotion , derived from inner necessity her eyesight failing , sister morgan announced in 1974 that god had told her to stop making art she devoted herself to poetry borenstein joked at the time , i do n't know how this is going to work out for her and the lord , but it affects me about the same way as the gasoline shortage affects traveling salesmen the lord called her a last time she died , peacefully in her sleep , in 1980 , at 80 after a fancy funeral in new orleans s most respected funeral home , she was buried in an unmarked grave just outside the city , close to the airport it would be heaven if works like hers were eternally before our eyes the world not being heaven , this is your opportunity to see them the day has come , as sister morgan might say tools of her ministry the art of sister gertrude morgan remains at the american folk art museum , 45 west 53rd street , manhattan , \( 212 \) 2651040 , through sept 26 it travels to new orleans and chicago
there was a time , not so long ago , when the ukrainian and polish restaurants in the east village , family owned and mirror images of their counterparts in kiev and warsaw , catered to patrons who liked their bread black , their cabbage stuffed and their soups topped with beetroots not to mention the fact that none of the above cost more than a few dollars , at most those days are long gone today , in a part of the east village once known deferentially as the pirogi belt , nothing short of heresy is being committed pirogies are now buried deeper in the menu than asian eggplant and coconut chicken more heretical still , several east european restaurants , no longer family owned , have given in to the tastes of a younger , more healthconscious clientele by adding lighter fare with nontraditional , spicier ingredients and one mainstay , the kiev cafe at second avenue and seventh street , is breaking daring new culinary ground with its updated versions of a staple of this heavy and deeply nostalgic cuisine the pirogi long the quintessential dumpling of europe s rural slavic populations , pirogies have not changed much over the centuries they have remained crescentshaped pillows of pasta , traditionally filled with meat , cheese or potatoes kiev , which has been serving homemade , handrolled pirogies at the same location for more than 25 years , was once a hallowed feeding hole among the area s slavic population , its grimy , nofrills interior notwithstanding but in recent years , the restaurant has changed hands and undergone a series of makeovers on valentine s day , after a twoyear dropoff in business , kiev reopened its doors , revealing a menu and an interior that had been revamped to give the restaurant an asian flavor that reflected its younger and more diverse neighborhood pirogies now come fused with fish and shrimp , flavored with lemon zest and ginger spice , and filled with items like mushrooms and leeks blintzes come wrapped with beet ginger , while potato pancakes are made with trendy shredded vegetables like parsnips also gone are the grimfaced staff members and cyrillic menus that offered the same starchy foods one could have found in a soviet cafeteria in their place are ornate chandeliers hung from a raised ceiling , walls decorated with goldleafed bamboo and a sleek granitetopped bar that serves french as well as belarussian bubbly the kiev cafe feels like neither kiev nor a typical cafe the only visible reminder of its slavic roots is the row of matrioshka dolls above the bar we 're trying to lighten it up and make it more interesting , explained john mudd , one of kiev s owners the food and d cor were so heavy and bland before not everyone is convinced i do n't think they 'll make it , said helena tischt , a native of ukraine who used to live down the block every two years it s shut down and bought by someone else some local east european haunts , however , have successfully made the jump from traditional to trendy up the street , veselka refurbished and expanded its interior in the late 1990 s and emerged as a popular hangout among the village s new younger transplants next door , the ukrainian restaurant is trying a similar strategy and undergoing a facelift and menu upgrade let s just say we 're refreshing the place , said its manager , a ukrainian who would only identify himself as joe and has run the restaurant since 1976 not every attempt to make over east european cuisine has been successful leshko s , once a popular coffee shop off tompkins square park , was sold a few years ago by its eponymous ukrainian family to a restaurateur who added danish lamps and saarinen chairs and pushed the pirogies down the menu to make room for turkey and shrimp cakes the result \? eventually the pirogies vanished altogether when leshko s was resold last fall and converted into a pricier panlatina restaurant it s a reflection of the neighborhood , maria shust , director of the ukrainian museum , a local institution , said of the changes the older generation of ukrainians is dying out but they were never ones to go out to restaurants anyway
no one needs to tell john servis how difficult it is to win a triple crown he knows all about the history , how it has not been done since affirmed won it in 1978 , how the last nine horses who won the kentucky derby and the preakness stakes were defeated in the belmont stakes , how five times in the last seven years alone triple crown dreams fizzled in the demanding final leg of the series this is the first time i 've been on this road , and i realize now why there s only been a handful of horses to win the triple crown , servis , smarty jones s trainer , said sunday morning before putting his horse , the kentucky derby and preakness winner , in a van for the trip back to his base at philadelphia park it s a very grueling road , and we 've been on it since january but servis may have something the belmont stakes has not seen in a while a horse with imposing credentials and an air of invincibility smarty jones has won all eight of his races and dominated the competition in a recordsetting 11 1 2length victory in the preakness on saturday there is no doubt that he is the most talented 3yearold in the country , probably by a wide margin we 're going to the belmont with a loaded gun , servis said among the nine horses that failed to complete the triple crown sweep since 1978 , some had obvious flaws , while others faced outstanding challengers , like empire maker , who knocked off funny cide last year the 9 or 10 horses expected to challenge smarty jones , a horse who has done everything right throughout his career , are not imposing servis said sunday that smarty jones came out of the preakness in good order he is likely to return to light training wednesday at philadelphia park the stable foreman , bill foster , said the plan was to ship him to belmont park in elmont , ny , about 10 days before the june 5 race he came out of the race terrific , servis said there s not one oat in the feed tub this morning his groom pulled the tub out and he s showing me the tub as i'm looking at it , smarty comes from the back of the stall and dives into the tub like he s looking for more servis s primary concern before the preakness was that it would be difficult for his horse to run another top effort just two weeks after the kentucky derby there may again be questions about his maintaining form after a careerbest effort in the preakness , but servis was hopeful that the three weeks between the final two legs of the triple crown would give smarty jones enough time to recover i'm tickled to death to get the extra week , servis said i was a little concerned going into the preakness i thought he was a little vulnerable since we were coming back in two weeks and there were two fresh horses in there that i was worried about the race he ran yesterday was incredible i'm sure he 'll enjoy the extra week going into the belmont servis , who did not give smarty jones a workout between the derby and the preakness , said he was not sure how hard he would train his horse for the mileandahalf belmont i 'll let him tell me , he said he s not a real hard horse to train he lets you know what he wants to do and when he wants to do it i 'll just pay attention to him , and when he s ready to do a little more , we 'll do a little more with him smarty jones left pimlico race course at 10 12 am and arrived at philadelphia park about two and a half hours later three philadelphia television stations followed his trip up interstate 95 by helicopter , broadcasting live in the last several minutes of his journey the news media were not allowed on the philadelphia park backstretch to watch the horse s return the field for the belmont is still taking shape , but it appears certain that rock hard ten , second in the preakness , and eddington , who was third , will be back in the belmont to take another try at smarty jones none of the other preakness horses are likely to run in the belmont the trainer nick zito could have as many as four starters in the belmont royal assault , who won the sir barton stakes on saturday at pimlico , is a certain belmont starter birdstone , coming off an eighthplace finish in the kentucky derby , is a possible starter , as is the cliff s edge , who was scratched from the preakness because of a bruised foot zito could also run pies prospect , who is being pointed for the peter pan stakes on saturday at belmont tapit , a disappointment in finishing ninth in the kentucky derby , is a definite belmont starter , his trainer , michael dickinson , said among the other possible starters are the santa anita derby winner , castledale the dermot weldtrained relaxed gesture and capitano the peter pan field will consist of several horses that may run in the belmont , including master david , friends lake , sinister g and swingforthefences
the president of good evil the ethics of george w bush by peter singer 280 pp new york dutton 2495 from corporate environmental malfeasance , mutual fund fraud and the megabilking that defined enron to martha stewart s minorleague insider trading , schoolroom plagiarism and presidential sex , the united states is enjoying one of its recurrent waves of public immorality and an equally characteristic obsession with values , family and other , on talk shows and campaign hustings and in pundit publications in the groves of academe , the tendency is showing itself in the rise of ethics \( particularly medical ethics and , improbably , business ethics \) as the chief growth field within philosophy and among its practitioners , none is more prominent than peter singer of princeton university singer has made himself noticed outside the ivory tower his conviction that animals have significant moral rights means he opposes using them for food as well as for experimentation a principled openness to euthanasia under various medical circumstances has led to picketing by groups of disabled people in the president of good evil , he confronts the ethics of the man he calls america s most prominent moralist , george w bush as a philosopher singer must abjure the cynicism with which , he tells us , many of his friends greeted his intention seriously to study the president s ethics for one thing , singer s concern is with the views rather than with the man who says he holds them in any case , he argues , tens of millions of americans believe that he is sincere , and share the views that he puts forward on a wide range of moral issues hence they are , as he says , worth thinking about much of singer s discussion proceeds on the basis of common sense , as when he points out that bush s argument for tax cuts that the government has no right to take your money is undermined by his acceptance of taxation for a wide variety of government purposes but singer also calls on elements of theory to develop his analyses , as when he notes that ownership is not a natural relationship between a person and a thing but a social convention in the united states , law defines how much you get to keep of the money you make using public resources like roads singer is a generous critic in discussing bush s reverence for life , evidenced in his opposition to stem cell research , he constructs the most plausible arguments possible against the sacrifice of unwanted embryos , to demonstrate convincingly how unsustainable they are but he can hardly help observing that bush s culture of life cohabits jarringly with his enthusiasm for capital punishment and readiness to inflict civilian casualties in afghanistan and iraq singer is led , on issue after issue , to a double conclusion bush s views are not intellectually defensible , and his behavior shows he does n't believe in them anyway singer puts his own finger on the biggest problem with his approach when he insists that democratic politics should be not so much a battle for power but rather a kind of public conversation about issues of common concern this is all very nice , but it seems irrelevant to our reallife democracy given that singer s cynical friends turn out to be correct , we are left with a book of pointers for arguing with your inlaws i particularly enjoyed singer s demonstration that in a democratic society , biblebased morals have no higher claim to respect than spacealien demands that the raelians take up cloning but what about the idea that bush needs support from fundamentalist christians for reelection \? can we really expect the tens of millions to strive more for ethical consistency than the fellow they vote for does \? they too all of us are enmeshed in a system of clashing interests in which prosperity or even survival generally takes precedence over abstract reflection singer s willingness to take seriously what people say is admirable alas , he forgets to try to understand what they actually do
the may department stores company said yesterday that it had agreed to buy marshall field s , one of the most venerable names in retailing , for 324 billion in cash may will buy the newly renovated flagship store on state street in chicago and 61 other marshall field s stores , scattered throughout the suburbs of detroit , minneapolis and chicago , from the target corporation , which bought them in 1990 it is also buying the sites of nine mervyn s stores in the midwest gene s kahn , the chairman and chief executive of may , said last night that the purchase would increase both the company s geographic footprint and its socioeconomic scope marshall field s caters to a broad range of shoppers , from the upper moderate to the very upscale , mr kahn said that will allow may to move up to handle the luxury goods that have led retailing over the last year and possibly even couture designers for target , the deal will allow it to more sharply focus on its discount chain industry experts said target had regretted buying marshall field s soon after the deal was done and had been talking about selling it and mervyn s , a moderatepriced chain of 266 stores , ever since but as sales dipped for the nation s department stores , the time never seemed right , the experts said last year target invested an undisclosed amount of money thought to be more than 200 million in marshall field s flagship store in the chicago loop , with its famous sidewalk clock and multistoried atrium as part of the reconstruction , marshall field s influenced by selfridges in london began leasing a significant portion of its space to a combination of local and national merchants , including a seller of exotic pens and a chicago shop devoted to dogs but with the revival of department stores that began in january caused by both reconstruction and new merchandise target thought the time was finally right to sell , analysts said for the 2003 fiscal year , marshall field s had 258 billion in revenue and generated 107 million in pretax earnings , both down from the previous year may will retain the marshall field s name and operate it as a separate division linda l ahlers will remain as president , and its headquarters will stay in minneapolis instead of moving to st louis , where may is based none of marshall field s employees will be laid off , may said the announcement of the deal yesterday afternoon caught many analysts by surprise gilbert w harrison , the chairman of financo , a manhattan investment banking firm , said the may bid was a preemptive one they swept the table may obviously felt they needed it more than federated , he said , referring to federated department stores inc , the parent of bloomingdale s and macy s although the other bidders , and their bids , were not made public , it is widely thought that both federated and jc penney had submitted offers last night , when asked whether the price may bid was too high , mr kahn replied no matter what price it was , people would always say it was too much we paid the right price , he added it was a strategic acquisition and will and should add significant value he said he expected the deal to add to earnings beginning in 2005 although the most recent performance of may s 438 department stores which include lord taylor , filene s and hecht s has been erratic , mr kahn said the purchase would allow may to combine functions like backoffice accounting and would lead to enhanced buying power may expects the synergies to add 85 million in pretax earnings in the 2005 fiscal year , 140 million in 2006 and 180 million in 2007 , according to the news release last month , sales at may stores open for more than a year were up 03 percent , compared with 59 percent for federated and 94 percent for jc penney stores mr kahn attributed the lackluster performance to the calendar last year , the big memorial day sales were reported in the last week of may this year , they fell in the first week of june but the company s numbers generally have been improving in march , sales at stores open more than a year were up more than 10 percent compared with march 2003 may s has been working hard to ride the crest of the wave , for the reemergence of the department stores which has resulted in stronger business , mr kahn said the company has been going after a younger customer , he said , who will buy the new wave of slightly more expensive department store clothes in what is called the better channel that channel was invigorated this year , with the addition of new styles from polo ralph lauren , calvin klein , liz claiborne and many others as for the nine mervyn s sites , all of them in the twin cities area , may plans to use most of them to create new marshall field s branches , mr kahn said those that are not converted may be sold to developers at least that s one option , mr kahn said
albany , dec 28 even after a decade under a republican administration that made tax cutting a priority , new york state still burdens its businesses with such high taxes and other costs that its ability to create and keep jobs is being hurt , a business lobbying group said on tuesday in updating its report on the price of doing business in the state , the group , the public policy institute of the business council of new york state , said it had found that many costs including the average premium for health insurance , the average cost of a workers' compensation case , the retail price of electricity and natural gas and unemployment insurance taxes are higher in new york than in most other states the report comes at a time when the state and its agencies most prominently , the metropolitan transportation authority and the education department are facing enormous gaps between their needs and state revenues some officials have said the state needs to reexamine its tax structure to find ways to increase revenue to deal with its 6 billion deficit , but , in a preview of the debates certain to dominate the forthcoming session , the business council made it clear on tuesday that it wants taxes to go down robert ward , director of research for the business group , said that the pataki administration had made some progress in reducing the tax burden , but that recent tax increases had trimmed the progress back we have made some progress , but we still have a long way to go , mr ward said unfortunately , in the last couple of years , looking at taxes , we have gone backwards we have raised taxes much more than most other states , both at the state and local levels , and that is going to hurt us to help close an 115 billion budget gap in 2003 , the state instituted a surcharge on taxable earnings of more than 100 , 000 for single people or more than 150 , 000 for married couples that surcharge , which raised the state tax rate to 75 percent from 685 percent for that group , is set to expire at the end of next year , and mr ward said he saw no reason for politicians to extend it the state also increased the sales tax on clothing items costing less than 110 , an increase that is set to expire in the coming year , mr ward said a study last year by the citizens budget commission found that new yorkers pay more of their income in local taxes than residents of any other state mr ward said that census bureau figures from 2002 showed that new york also ranked high in the categories of property , sales , income and corporate taxes at the same time , those who are employed in the state are generally earning less money than they could , mr ward said , because the high taxes and business costs tend to divert money from payrolls the result is that new york is a poor choice for businesses and workers , he said , with many urban areas in upstate new york losing economic vitality reaction to the report was mixed in the state capitol on a day when lawmakers were on vacation before the new legislative session is set to begin next week with a speech by gov george e pataki frank j mauro , the executive director of the fiscal policy institute , a nonprofit research organization financed , in part , by money from unions , said one part of the business council s own figures show that new york actually has a lower cost of doing business than all of its neighbors except pennsylvania mr ward said that fact was only one in a number of measures that the group used and did not detract from its overall premise edmund j mcmahon of the manhattan institute , a conservative policy group , said the report underlined the big policy failures of the triumvirate that has held power in albany for the past decade mr pataki joseph l bruno , a republican and the majority leader of the state senate and sheldon silver , a democrat and speaker of the state assembly it highlights the disconnect between albany and the real world , he said that the state is in so much trouble , competitively , and none of the key players up here have any intention of dealing with it a spokesman for mr bruno pointed out the senate s efforts in creating economic development programs , which mr ward praised but said were too limited this report makes it clear that much more needs to be done to make new york state more competitive , said the spokesman , mark hansen todd alhart , a spokesman for mr pataki , said the administration would review the report , but argued that no one was fighting harder than the governor to cut taxes , create jobs and improve the state s business climate since governor pataki took office in 1995 , our state has cut 19 different taxes 75 different times to save new york s people and businesses well over 100 billion , said mr alhart no state even comes close to matching new york s taxcutting record
ovando , mont greg neudecker stopped his truck on a wooden bridge over monture creek and stretched out his arm toward the wilderness lands to the north , and canada beyond that this is the interstate , he said without irony , gesturing to the little stream , maybe 15 feet across everything connects here , from the wild country down into this valley a corridor of the wild through the high country of north america yellowstone to yukon has long been a dream of environmentalists and biologists like mr neudecker , who say that grizzly bears , elk , wolves and other fourlegged commuters need help in looking for mates or new habitats the great national parks of the west , they say , are becoming genetically isolated islands , cut off by development , urbanization and their everpresent iconic symbol , the barbedwire fence but in places like this , on a patchwork of public and private lands , and through a tangle of human motivations that often have little to do with saving the planet , the wild road north along the spine of the northern rockies is becoming reality conservation and government groups say most of the 150 miles or so from here to the canadian border , called the crown of the continent , is now largely protected through land buying and conservation agreements with private owners in december the nature conservancy of canada is expected to lock in the northern anchor 98 , 000 acres just over the border in british columbia that a forestry company has agreed to sell a result will be the creation of a sheltered land bridge where the animal societies of canada and the united states can intermingle conservationists say linking the two pieces of the wildlife road will be as important for its political symbolism as for the animals that will make their way across and could become more crucial over time if global warming changes alpine climates , forcing animals to migrate permanently spanning the international border means getting the cooperation and understanding of how natural systems work irrespective of boundaries , and that is a big deal and very , very hopeful one , said steven j mccormick , the president and chief executive of the nature conservancy in the united states , which has invested more than 45 million to preserve land along the corridor in recent years , an amount matched by the nature conservancy of canada the centerpiece of the project is a better understanding of how animals really move around knowing , for instance , that elk travel to their wintering grounds here in the blackfoot valley northeast of missoula from the high peaks around glacier national park is one thing knowing exactly how they come through what bramble of river valleys and passes has allowed wildlife experts to focus precisely on which lands need protecting , and which ones , given limited resources , can be ignored monture creek , for example , and its equally humble counterpart to the west called dunham creek , are divided by a local landmark called center ridge by a quirk of the glacial age , the three pieces of that triangle upland and two waterways wend their way directly back into the bob marshall wilderness that begins north of ovando from there , animals connect with the river and ridge systems in glacier national park on the border with canada a better understanding of animal mass transit has in turn allowed a downsizing of ambition about the crown of the continent project the goal is not to create new wilderness or new public parks , say conservationists and wildlife experts like mr neudecker , who works for the united states fish and wildlife service , but rather to allow movement of animals through the landscape with the least possible human conflict somewhat paradoxically , that has meant in some cases building more fences , not fewer here in ovando , for instance , the owners of the two creeks ranch had three miles of new electrified grizzly bear fence built and installed this summer , without charge to them , by a team of conservation workers the 13 , 000 project sealed off the ranch s calving area , where the baby animals most vulnerable to hungry bears spend their first few days of life the idea is that bears without easy food sources will keep on moving and not become a nuisance or a threat much of the money spent by groups like the nature conservancy has gone into the bank accounts of ranchers like karl rappold , who has agreed to sell the development rights to most of his land near the town of dupuyer , about 50 miles from the border those contracts mean that mr rappold and his family can continue ranching , but it also means a crucial point for the wildlife corridor that the ranch can never be subdivided or developed that arrangement has been repeated across roughly 170 , 000 acres of private land on both sides of the border mr rappold , whose grandfather started the ranch in the 1880 s , said that selling the development rights had given him peace of mind i want my grandson , and his children , to be able to saddle up and ride across this ranch , he said and he said he had come to understand that the wild creatures are a big part of what makes the land work without them , it would n't be the wild country that it is , he said other ranchers have come to embrace the idea of a wildlife corridor for equally specific and personal reasons dusty crary , who raises cattle south of the rappold place and has also sold his development rights , said that his views about the land and nature changed suddenly , eight years ago , when his father was killed in a ranch accident it made me stop and think , none of us are going to live forever , and how do i want this to be when i'm gone , mr crary said it was a little transition for me , a realization that we have to pass things on motivations like that also reinforce what conservationists and wildlife experts say is so unusual about the crown of the continent project no one person is really building it people are thinking locally and personally , and the resulting combined quilt of their contributions is what creates the corridor other scientists and ranchers say the real question raised by the project is whether any of it is remotely natural mr rappold , for instance , is so fond of the grizzlies and so convinced that a grizzly with a full belly will not bother his cattle that he has begun feeding them he puts out barrels of molasses for his cows , and then a few more , he says , for the bears in spring , when bears are emerging from hibernation , he salts the high plateau with winter kills so that by the time the bears come down into his valley , they are no longer famished some wildlife experts cringe at the idea of feeding wild animals , saying it trains them to look to people for food others say that keeping bears from becoming marauders is the priority , because the health of the corridor will depend on relationships across the humananimal border others describe a sort of race between two evolving , interconnected forces more animals , especially grizzlies , moving up and down the corridor , even as environmentalists work to minimize the impact concern about humans crossing the border here especially terrorists or other unauthorized travelers is playing only a small role in the project planning , participants say , mainly because the crown region , far from major population centers , is so remote and rugged we 're doing all these things to avoid conflicts , but maybe that just means the animals move on to the places where people are n't doing those good practices , said geof foote , a biologist and landowner here in ovando that was apparently the outcome this year on the corridor s eastern edge a latespring storm devastated the wild chokecherry crop that grizzlies depend on , and so many of them simply strayed east , in some cases 35 to 40 miles from the mountains , farther from their regular grounds than most local residents had ever seen one storm affecting one type of wild berry altered the animals' path , and for all the grand designs of man , the bears went where they needed to go
imagine george steinbrenner at the controls of an xbox baseball game , running up the score on a hapless computer opponent eight runs ! fourteen ! eighteen ! enrique wilson \? homer and four runs batted in ! tony clark \? two doubles , four rbi ! bubba crosby \? double to the corner , another run ! it was more , more , more on thursday for steinbrenner s yankees , who made camden yards their personal playground and humiliated the baltimore orioles , 185 the yankees scored 41 runs in sweeping a threegame series from lee mazzilli s sinking team , which has lost its last seven games the orioles set a club record for runs allowed in a threegame series at home when the guys at the top of the order get on base , it kind of sets a tone for the game , said gary sheffield , who went 3 for 6 everybody knows when they step up there and the bases are kind of clogged up , the pitcher has go to after them and you see the results when they do the yankees have not scored more runs in a series in 53 years , since they dumped 42 runs on the st louis browns from may 35 , 1951 their 21 hits on thursday were their most in more than two years , and they buried the orioles for eight runs in the fifth inning and six in the seventh , when they started to empty the bench derek jeter went 3 for 4 with two doubles off the wall , going 7 for 15 in the series to raise his average from 190 to 211 jeter often blames himself when the team does not score , saying it is his job to get on base now that jeter is hot , the yankees are following we feed off his energy , without a doubt , said alex rodriguez , who crunched his 12th home run he s a hitting machine , and when you see him going , he s going to create a lot of havoc on the bases and score a lot of good things happen when he gets going i 've always said he s the heartbeat of this team the yankees actually trailed by 30 after four innings , but their outburst made an easy winner of jos contreras , who allowed three runs on eight hits in six innings in his second start since returning from class aaa columbus , contreras showed none of the flareups that plagued him in his first stint with the yankees he s feeling a lot better about himself than he was earlier in the season , manager joe torre said that was obvious in the first inning , when contreras calmly worked out of trouble brian roberts , who has 16 stolen bases , led off with a single contreras has struggled to hold runners , but he kept roberts close , throwing a pitchout and four pickoff throws during melvin mora s atbat , which ended in a walk on a full count in the past , when i would get in a difficult situation , i really did n't know how i was going to get out of it , contreras said through an interpreter they had first and second , no outs , but i knew i was still in control miguel tejada batted next , and contreras fired a fastball up and in , as he had been told to do at columbus and had done with success against the texas rangers last saturday tejada struck out on a splitter contreras got the next batter , rafael palmeiro , on a popout , then whiffed javy lopez on three pitches a splitter , a 94mileanhour fastball and another splitter , ending the inning the middle of the order was more successful the next time around mora bunted for a single with two outs , and tejada and palmeiro ripped backtoback homers but the next 18 runs belonged to the yankees , who battered the orioles' brutal pitching staff after wilson s sacrifice fly in the fifth , the yankees rapped seven hits in a row with two outs wilson was the last player in the lineup to get a hit , lining a homer to right that made the score 133 in the seventh wilson , who had 15 rbi last season and 11 in 2002 , has driven in 14 runs over his last six games i 've got men on third and second all the time , wilson said those guys are getting on base for me , and right now i feel good at the plate that was the understatement of the night for the yankees , who showed mazzilli , a firstyear manager and the yankees' former firstbase coach , just what he is missing that s all stuff where you pay your dues , said torre , who managed awful pitching staffs with the mets in the 1970 s when you manage , those are all emotions you have to deal with , and it s not a lot of fun , especially at home mazzilli , who gave his team a pep talk before the game , said he would have patience when i get frustrated , they 'll know about it , he said right now , i'm not frustrated not frustrated , but probably envious inside pitch kevin brown will rejoin the yankees on friday in florida and start saturday against the tampa bay devil rays brown , who had permission to leave the team for undisclosed personal reasons , has battled various injuries the last few seasons he also left the team for a day in early may to work with a trainer there is no issue going forward with this , general manager brian cashman said first baseman jason giambi , on the disabled list with a sprained right ankle , could take batting practice this weekend , manager joe torre said rafael palmeiro s thirdinning homer was the 535th of his career , passing jimmie foxx for 12th on the career list with his next homer , palmeiro will tie mickey mantle

training center s goal is you can come in as a nonenglishspeaking worker , come in as a lowlevel kitchen worker , and if you have the desire , you can leave as a gourmet food server , souschef or master sommelier , said d taylor , secretarytreasurer of culinary local 226 , one of the nation s fastestgrowing unions we want to have a situation where the only limits are your own ambition with the food server s course now under her belt , ms diaz has made an impressive leap in status and income busing tables , she made 500 a week , or 25 , 000 a year , but as a waitress , her wages and tips total about 20 an hour , or 40 , 000 a year ms diaz is doing so well that her husband , manuel , a burly sixfoot construction worker , says he jokingly tells friends she 'll be earning so much that i'm going to be able to quit my job and take care of the house so when she arrives home , there will be steaming food on the table two years ago , the diazes paid 125 , 000 for their house on gold sluice avenue their gated community , called sutter creek , was built in the desert 10 miles north of downtown and is so new that none of its trees are taller than 12 feet mr diaz said they wanted a gated community because they were unhappy with their previous neighborhood people from mexico i call them paesanos were burning tires , he said they played radios real loud i was afraid of cecilia playing outside , that someone would run her over here it s quiet and safe for her with a sheepish grin , ms diaz said her parents could hardly believe how she lives she and her husband have a 48inch television , satellite dish , gleaming kitchen with track lighting , and hisandhers pickup trucks his is a dark green ford 150 with a bad boy decal manuel and graciela diaz have come a long way since 1994 , when they met in a los angeles sweatshop she was a seamstress , he bundled garments , and they both earned about 30 a day , or 7 , 500 a year smitten with graciela s broad smile , lustrous hair and easygoing manner , manuel , clinging to mexican tradition , asked her parents for permission to date her they refused , partly because he had once lived with another woman and partly because he was not exactly raking in money but love trumped parental objections , and within a year , they were living together and ms diaz was pregnant with a baby on the way , they grew frustrated at their station in life , earning sweatshop wages and living in a rundown apartment everything is much harder in los angeles , ms diaz said the pay is bad , and everything is more expensive mr diaz persuaded his wife to move to las vegas , lured by his sister s tales of riches there for the taking , and she was n't referring to the baccarat or blackjack tables in her admittedly imperfect english , ms diaz acknowledged that her husband s hunch was right when we came here and see the big changes the money , the benefits were good he says , 'we stay here , she said in california , we never thought of buying a house we could n't buy many things here s it s more easy no rest for the casino builder within days of arriving , mr diaz took a job washing trucks the pay was mediocre , the work unpleasant , so when he heard of a betterpaying job removing asbestos , he took it but after a week he began to realize just how dangerous that work was his brotherinlaw then told him that workers were needed to build the bellagio hotel casino , which the developer steve wynn envisioned as the zenith of las vegas opulence mr diaz landed a job there and joined the laborers' union he did grunt work at first , carrying heavy construction materials his large biceps and chest attest to hard work his current job is on the latest wynn dream project , a hotel casino intended to surpass the bellagio now mr diaz works more with his head than his hands , helping grade the land so plumbers and electricians can lay pipe and wire they say steve wynn s new hotel will make the bellagio look like a doghouse , he said , sounding like a major investor in the project mr diaz s pay is 2366 an hour with overtime , some years he earns more than 60 , 000 i get like 20 times more money than i made in mexico , he said he sounded a little guilty about his immigrant success we do n't want to take nobody s place , he said a lot of people born over here , they do n't work so hard because they do n't appreciate the opportunities they got they did n't suffer crossing the border and all that stuff we put up with from mexico to the strip ms diaz certainly put up with a lot after a brother in los angeles sent money , she and one of her sisters flew from jalisco to tijuana in 1991 to sneak into california it was the first day of the gulf war , she remembered i call my mom , and she said , 'you have to come back because the war is starting it s dangerous ignoring that advice , ms diaz and her sister took a taxi to the border , where they had arranged to meet a coyote , a smuggler who would lead them across but no one showed up the next day , they returned to the border before dawn in a creek below them , ms diaz thought she saw someone waving an arm , beckoning them across i see something , but it was just a cow moving the tail , she said , laughing uproariously just as the coyote arrived , a border patrol helicopter appeared overhead we try to hide , we waited one hour under some bushes , she said it was real scary when the helicopter finally left , they sneaked across the border , and her brother arranged for a drive to los angeles ms diaz arrived illegally , but she eventually obtained a green card and citizenship through her father , who had been granted amnesty for years , he had worked at a carwash in los angeles today , her whole family parents , two sisters and five brothers lives in los angeles once in las vegas , ms diaz took a series of nonunion housekeeping jobs that she did not love , at a best western hotel , at binion s horseshoe casino , and finally at the luxurious venetian in the hotels , the hardest job is housekeeping , ms diaz said it s really hard when you come , and you do n't know the language you want to be somebody , but it s very hard two years ago , ms diaz learned from the wife of one of her husband s coworkers that there were unionized restaurant openings at the luxor weary of making hotel beds and cleaning bathrooms , she landed a job busing tables at la salsa it paid 924 an hour , plus about 4 an hour in tips the health plan was so good that she paid no premiums and made only modest copayments but ms diaz had greater ambitions after she passed the culinary training academy course , she was immediately promoted to waitress now she is responsible for a halfdozen tables in the ochercolored restaurant , which has the music of a mexican crooner piped in she greets customers with her big smile and tentative english , often recommending her favorite dish , the fajita salad as her status at la salsa has risen , so has her pay las vegas s unionized busboys and waiters make the same base salary 1014 an hour , the highest rate in the nation \( by comparison , most waiters in new york city make 330 an hour before tips \) but waiters make much more from tips than busboys , who must be content with the oftenmeager amounts that waiters share with them ms diaz worries that she has unwittingly become a role model to her 8yearold my daughter says , 'mommy , let me have your apron , ms diaz said i'm going to play i want to be a waitress i want to be a waitress because you always have money' i say , 'no , do n't be like me , ms diaz continued my husband says to her , 'you have to learn and do everything the teacher says because one day you 're going to be somebody the diazes have big ambitions for their daughter college and maybe law or architecture school relaxing recently after a dinner of rice and chorizo , they boasted of her report card , which says , with her creative imagination and flair for details , cecilia has become one of the class s favorite story writers many days a neighbor picks up cecilia from school because ms diaz normally works from 11 am to 7 pm but some days mr diaz fetches her from an afterschool artsandcrafts program he usually works from 6 am to 4 pm ms diaz makes dinner before leaving for work so that her husband can reheat it after returning home we help each other , he said i ca n't push and say , 'i want this , i want that' i know she works poking fun at him , ms diaz chimed in , anyway , i'm the boss the affection and respect the two feel for each other are unmistakable now ms diaz can joke about the thumb s down her father once gave her sweetheart now my daddy is proud about him , ms diaz said , giving her husband an oversize girlish grin my daddy loves him more than me my parents look at him they say , 'he takes good care of our daughter' they tell me , 'if you 're doing good , it means he s doing good' that s why my parents love him so much

united nations , sept 2 the security council on thursday night passed an american and frenchsponsored resolution pressing lebanon to reject syrian intervention in its politics and calling on all foreign forces to leave the country the vote on the 15member panel was nine in favor , none against and six abstaining a minimum of nine votes and no veto by any of the five permanent members are needed to approve a security council resolution syria has 20 , 000 troops in lebanon and has controlled the country s politics for decades , but thursday night s action was prompted by a sudden move by damascus to let the president it backs , mile lahoud , stay in office beyond the end of his term on nov 24 last weekend , under syrian prodding , the lebanese cabinet changed language in its constitution limiting presidents to one sixyear term so that mr lahoud could remain another three years the lebanese parliament is expected to endorse the amendment on friday , a development that john c danforth , the american ambassador , cited as the reason for rushing the resolution forward the resolution called for the strict respect of the sovereignty , territorial integrity , unity and political independence of lebanon under the sole and exclusive authority of the government of lebanon throughout lebanon it also called for the disbanding of all militias , which it said were compromising lebanon s ability to govern itself washington has designated syria as a sponsor of terrorism mr danforth told the security council that the resolution was also aimed at ending the presence of syrian and iranian forces in lebanon in a direct reference to syria s intervention this week in lebanon s politics , the resolution declared its support for a free and fair electoral process in lebanon s coming presidential election conducted according to lebanese constitutional rules devised without foreign interference or influence addressing the council before the vote , mohammed issa , secretary general of lebanon s foreign affairs ministry , said that lebanese did not object to syria s involvement in their country syria s ambassador , fayssal mekdad , denounced the resolution as interference in the internal affairs of lebanon
washington , oct 2 over strenuous objections from the bush administration , congress is moving to increase protections for federal employees who expose fraud , waste and wrongdoing inside the government lawmakers of both parties say the measures are needed to prevent retaliation against such whistleblowers , who reveal threats to public health , safety and security but the administration says the bill unconstitutionally interferes with the president s ability to control and manage the government on wednesday , a house committee approved a whistleblower protection bill in july , a senate committee approved a similar measure offering more extensive protections to whistleblowers representative todd r platts , republican of pennsylvania , the sponsor of the house bill , said we need to protect public servants who expose fraud and intentional misconduct court decisions in the last 10 years have eroded whistleblower protections , so that if you 're a federal employee , you 're often risking your job and the wrath of your superiors if you come forward with evidence of wrongdoing the senate bill gained momentum when senator susan collins , republican of maine , chairwoman of the committee on governmental affairs , joined senator daniel k akaka , democrat of hawaii , in pushing it the campaign for this legislation went from dormant to active when senator collins embraced the bill a few months ago , said thomas m devine , legal director of the government accountability project , a watchdog group that works with whistleblowers that was the turning point while the legislation has broad support and a compromise appears to be within reach , it is impossible to know whether the measure will become law as evidence of a need for legislation , lawmakers cited dozens of cases , including these federal investigators found that two border patrol agents , mark hall and robert lindemann , were disciplined after they disclosed weaknesses in security along the canadian border teresa c chambers was dismissed from her job as chief of the united states park police after she said the agency did not have enough money or personnel to protect parks and monuments in the washington area the nation s top medicare official threatened to fire richard s foster , the chief medicare actuary , if he provided data to congress showing the cost of the new medicare law , which exceeded white house estimates airport baggage screeners say they have been penalized for raising concerns about aviation security but in august , an independent federal agency , the merit systems protection board , ruled that they had none of the whistleblower rights available to other federal employees the government , it said , can hire , discipline and terminate screeners without regard to any other law the united states office of special counsel , which investigates complaints of reprisal before they go to the board , has a large backlog of whistleblower cases , including many pending more than a year the terrorist attacks of sept 11 , 2001 , have made the government more secretive , but have also prompted whistleblowers to come forward in greater numbers they feel they can no longer stand by knowing that people s lives are at risk , said danielle brian , executive director of the project on government oversight , another watchdog group senator charles e grassley , republican of iowa , said he knew of several instances in which federal agencies had retaliated against whistleblowers by revoking their security clearances because they can no longer do their jobs , mr grassley said , the pulling of a security clearance effectively fires employees administration officials gave several reasons for opposing the bills peter d keisler , an assistant attorney general , said the legislation would encourage frivolous complaints by disgruntled employees , crippling the ability of senior officials to manage the federal work force the bill would convert every federal employee into a potential whistleblower and every minor workplace dispute with a supervisor into a potential whistleblower case , mr keisler said mr akaka said the objections came as no surprise the justice department has an institutional conflict of interest because it is responsible for defending agencies accused of retaliating against whistleblowers , he said congress has repeatedly tried to protect conscientious civil servants , under laws adopted in 1978 , 1989 and 1994 but lawmakers said these efforts had been frustrated by the court that hears appeals from aggrieved federal employees , the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit the court often assumes that a federal agency acted properly unless an employee offers irrefragable proof to the contrary the senate committee cited this as one of many issues on which the court had misinterpreted the law and the intent of congress by definition , it said , irrefragable means impossible to refute this imposes an impossible burden on whistleblowers by contrast , the house and senate bills would protect the disclosure of any information that a whistleblower reasonably believes to be evidence of government illegality or misconduct the legislation would also clarify the right of federal employees , like mr foster , the medicare actuary , to provide information to congress , free of threats or reprisals
boston when applying the tao of managing , specifically in a baseball universe where star treatment has turned into spa treatment , no one disturbs the increasingly delicate systems of starting pitchers unless a manager is lured by the siren song of the postseason that s why the st louis cardinals' matt morris was jarred out of his zen state over the weekend when tony la russa named him to start game 2 in the world series last night eschewing sensitivity training , la russa dared to shove morris to the mound on short rest three days instead of the sacred four i think the last time i pitched on short rest was a wiffle ball game when i was 10 , morris said if only game 2 had ended when the streetlights came on over four and a third innings , the boston red sox pounced on morris s limited stuff , scoring four runs and drawing four walks on their way to a 62 victory and a twogamestonone lead in the world series it s tough leaving a ballgame in the fifth , morris said but 90 pitches is a lot for me to be exact , it was 89 pitches , an expected fizzle point when regularseason habits leave pitchers unprepared for postseason overtime by the fifth inning , the fatigue began to show when morris walked the leadoff hitter , orlando cabrera on three days' rest , i got him out because i thought we 're pushing it too far he might hurt himself , la russa said that s what i told him i said 'matt , you 've given us enough it s crazy to go any farther ' so in came the cardinals' rockette line of relievers , with each of the four trying to hold off the red sox , putting more miles on the bullpen s odometer so out went another interesting la russa strategy to set up jeff suppan for games 3 and 7 , la russa scrapped morris s normal routine , knowing he had never pitched on short rest and realizing that the red sox had the limping medical miracle , curt schilling , on the mound in this sense , la russa was all but conceding game 2 , confident his team will respond as always at busch stadium for games 3 , 4 and 5 if that unfolds , la russa may be rewarded for his risk imagine if morris had come through \? this pitchus interruptus can be called the josh beckett exception once beckett , the florida marlins' wonder arm , pitched a complete game on short rest against the yankees to win the 2003 world series , managers have let themselves be seduced by the prospect of squeezing more from the sleeves of their aces those aces are promptly glorified for giving up their day off even if they can throw only five superlative innings as johan santana did in vain for the minnesota twins against the yankees in the division series they ascend to the ruggedness status reserved for wilderness survivors it seems like a winwin situation for everyone except that pitchers on short rest rarely come away with a victory as was often mentioned when beckett went out for game 6 of the world series in 2003 , pitchers throwing on abbreviated zzz s in the postseason were 620 where have all the cowboys gone \? these days , the duration of a quality start on normal rest has shrunk from eight innings to six or seven and yet the very managers who need more from their pitchers , the ones who are desperate for postseason exceptions to the fourdaysoff mandate , are the same control freaks who have prompted baseball s evolution of softness i believe when you sign a contract it does n't say you have to pitch five innings , said the legendary cookie rojas , who played all nine positions in his career as a player before becoming a manager and a coach i think we have spoiled some of these pitchers by saying , 'all you have to give me is five innings , and then i 'll have a guy in the sixth and seventh , a guy in the eighth inning and one behind him ' postseason bullpens have become boutiques , with specialists for lefties , righties , middle innings and specific batters , all before the closer we never had that , said luis tiant , who pitched 311 innings , with 25 complete games , in 1974 with boston a lot of times , what you had , you looked in the bullpen , and you see some guy in there , you say to yourself 'uhuh , no , no way i do n't want him in my game i'm going to finish this game ' a finishing touch is a romantic notion now only the los angeles dodgers' jose lima has pitched a complete game in the postseason this year during the regular season , there were only 150 complete games in 2 , 428 major league starts i think it s absolutely ridiculous in my opinion , rojas said it s also selfdefeating in the postseason it leaves the bullpen skidding on bald tires and starters limited on short rest so are pitchers softer , or have they become atrophied by newage conditioning habits \? no matter what i say , they 're not going to listen , tiant said old pitchers like me , we say you need to pitch them more , not less the more you throw , the stronger you get , the quicker you 'll learn , and the longer you gonna pitch it sounds simple , but logic has vanished with the bigmoney deals grabbed by pitchers even when pitchers relax with an umbrella drink and a massage over four days , some refuse to work on their conditioning in between starts they fear injury , and so do their teams the residue of this regularseason habit is in the postseason , with every starter who can go only six innings on normal rest , with every ace who can fade early on short rest , with every game that turns into a blowout when the bullpens ca n't rest matt morris is n't to blame it s the pitching evolution that has turned star treatment into spa treatment
alaska bush lisa murkowski , a republican , narrowly retained her senate seat after a bitter battle with her democratic challenger , tony knowles mr knowles refused to concede defeat , saying there may be thousands of absentee and provisional ballots yet to be counted that could swing the election in his favor , raising the possibility that the final outcome might be fought over for days to come the contest was one of the hardestfought and most closely watched in the country because it was considered central to the republicans' efforts to add to their majority in the senate ms murkowski s

ted williams the biography of an american hero by leigh montville illustrated 513 pp new york doubleday 2695 ted williams had several chances to die an unqualified american hero , none more so than on feb 16 , 1953 , when his f9 panther was hit while flying over north korea the best baseball hitter of his time \( and perhaps any other \) was told to eject , but resisted because doing so could have broken his legs or spine his plane ablaze , williams instead lurched his way back toward his base he crashlanded before escaping unhurt had williams perished that day , his dual identities batting champion and martyred patriot would have left him impenetrably ennobled but williams lived another 50 years , and that had its costs first , most celebrities who give the public so long to learn their faults rarely disappoint it s the difference between james dean and marlon brando , buddy holly and elvis presley second , and far more interesting , when they do pass away , their lives are judged by the standards not of their time but of ours ted williams has become a fine illustration of this as successful as he was as a baseball player batting 406 in 1941 , winning two triple crowns and ultimately ascending to the hall of fame his retirement proved him a spectacular failure as a husband and father , his scathing anger leaving his family in shambles the splendid splinter was also the splendid splinterer he leaves the child within us astounded , the adult in us ashamed in ted williams the biography of an american hero , leigh montville , a former sportswriter for the boston globe and sports illustrated , vacillates between being agape and being aghast as he traces the increasingly dark tale of his boyhood hero the climactic moment comes after williams s death in july 2002 , when his downright creepy son , john henry , successfully fights with his half sister , bobbyjo , to decapitate their father s corpse and cryogenically preserve the parts in separate freezers the strength of montville s book derives from how williams emerges from all this not as victimized but as accountable it is unlikely that any reader could view ted williams just as a ballplayer ever again of course , it is hard to deny that williams made good on his boyhood vow to become the greatest hitter who ever lived his sublime lefthanded stroke netted him a 344 lifetime batting average and 521 home runs statistics that could have been much higher had he not lost five prime seasons to world war ii and korea and provided baseball with some of its fondest moments in 1941 , when williams could have ended his season early with a 400 average , he boldly played the year s final doubleheader and rapped out six hits , ending at 406 \( no major leaguer has equaled the 400 mark since \) in 1960 , he provided an impeccable end to his career by slamming a home run on his final swing a hitting savant , williams helped focus the modern attention to onbase percentage , taking bundles of walks while preaching patience but even in a time when the press preferred to shield the public from how its sports heroes truly behaved , williams was so obnoxious , so chillingly contemptuous of everyone around him , that he made as many headlines for his sneer as his swing by williams s sophomore season of 1940 , montville writes , the frighteningly profane perfectionist was already complaining about his salary , about the sportswriters , about the fans , about anything that crossed his path he was miserable to be around the boston sportswriters giddily portrayed him as a spoiled , selfcentered brat \( dave egan of the boston record , a certified drunk who was on the take of several local promoters , made a career of this , calling williams at various times the most overpaid buffoon in the history of baseball , a misanthropic mauler and a sorry example for a generation of kids \) the writers' enmity persuaded fenway park fans to make jeering at their tempestuous left fielder a game within the game williams got so frustrated that he spat at them several times , inciting even more taunts and leaving him all the more bitter and singular every incident that came along , montville writes , would reinforce the image of the hitting diva williams did have a softer side he visited hundreds of sick children in hospitals , helped them with their homework and even walked with them to fenway after they got better he enjoyed good relations with teammates , and famously , at his induction into the hall of fame , paid tribute to negro league stars who are not here only because they were n't given a chance but he never seemed happy on the stage that made him a star when he homered in that final appearance , at fenway park , after williams rounded the bases he stuck it to the fans one last time by refusing to tip his cap , and vamoosed he spent most of his retirement away from baseball , away from the carping crowds , fishing off the florida keys \( and befriending locals who commandeer montville s narrative with several chapters of stories as eventful as , well , fishing \) the time apart did everyone some good as williams s accomplishments grew more historic , his image softened the septuagenarian ted williams the last living 400 hitter became a national treasure , far more guru than grump but just as williams seemed to have escaped the undertow of his contentious past , latent evidence of its damage emerged in the form of his family obsessed with hitting and fishing for most of his 83 years , williams had generally ignored his three wives and three children , and when he was around he abused them with the same vulgarity and contempt he did almost everyone else \( he was astoundingly vicious , obscenities shooting from his mouth like a detonated box of nails \) all three wives divorced him montville writes that his older daughter , bobbyjo , abused drugs and was temporarily institutionalized for depression and his younger daughter , claudia , moved about as far away from him as she could the only child to stick by him was one who stuck pathologically close , his son , john henry as his famous father s health began to fail in the early 1990 s , john henry , who had gone through life trading on his williams surname with spectacular lack of success , built a marketing business largely based on the fact that his dad had a mint on the end of his arm his autograph and merchandising enterprise became downright sick john henry installed cameras throughout his father s home to ensure he gave away no signatures gratis after williams suffered several strokes that left him mostly blind and needing constant nursing care , john henry \( who himself died in march \) made sure that intravenous tubes were never inserted into his right arm , better that it keep signing and signing the final plan was the creepiest of all john henry s notorious and ultimately successful plan to behead and freeze ted s corpse he claimed williams wanted this , for possible future revival bobbyjo claimed her ghoulish brother was only trying to preserve their father s dna to sell it and leave all these little ted williamses running around the public wrangling over the body became so theatrically absurd latenight talk show hosts yukked about tedsicles and how the williams head should run for governor of california that any biographer , having examined how williams treated other human beings , would have little choice but to wonder if he had earned his uncourtly exit montville comes as close to this conclusion as can be expected from a lifelong ted williams fan too much of his baseball narration wafts atop the adolescent awe he retains for his hero but he maturely ends williams s playing career less than halfway through the book , knowing that there is more to describe here than ted williams s life his death begs for exploration , too one early scene winds up indelible soon after finishing that 406 season , williams clutched in his arms the one thing he loved more than anything else in the world i'm a good hitter , he confided then he kissed his bat
until a few weeks ago , sue levine had no idea the red , white and blue political sign in her westport lawn was anything but an expression of support for diane farrell , the town first selectwoman who is running for congress but a friend told her about a town ordinance that prohibits political signs on residential property more than 60 days before and seven days after an election with the november election more than two months away , ms levine was breaking the law her sign is still up and it will stay up it s a first amendment issue at least it is to me , said ms levine , a retired publicist i really do n't believe it s an enforceable ordinance it was also a first amendment issue to the connecticut civil liberties union , and after several westport residents contacted the group , it contacted the town , saying that putting time limits on political signs infringes on the right to free speech the town of westport ca n't dictate to its citizens how long they get to have an opinion on something , said teresa c younger , the executive director of the cclu the group got no argument from the town , and the dispute was quickly over the town will change the law i wish every letter we sent out was responded to the way westport s was , ms younger said the group is about to find out the westport case prompted the cclu to send similar letters to all 169 municipalities in the state , asking them to check that their ordinances do n't have similar restrictions and to remove them if they do towns that do have the restrictions , which were often passed to keep the signs from cluttering neighborhoods long after an election is over , now have to decide whether to change their laws or fight what control would you have over signs anywhere if they could be there forever \? asked brian robinson , the zoning and wetlands officer in middletown i'm sure at this point no one s really concerned about reagan s campaign in the 80 s in middletown , political signs are not allowed more than 30 days before an election or five days after the fact mr robinson said he did not know how the city would respond to the letter william warner , the head of mr robinson s department , did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment oxford allows political signs for 30 days in any ninemonth period killingly has a law similar to westport s , allowing political signs but not more than 60 days before an election nor 14 days after it we 've never enforced that part of the regulation , but that s what the regulation says , said roger gandolf , the zoning enforcement official in killingly mr gandolf said he did not know of any attempts to remove the time restrictions from the law , probably because the law is not enforced he said that he had not seen the letter from the cclu but that when he did , he would let the planning and zoning commission decide whether to take action on it some towns , like granby and rocky hill , do n't regulate where or when political signs may be placed , except to prohibit them from being placed in lines of sight political signs are merely expressions of free speech , said henry miga , the zoning enforcement official and building official in granby if you want to say , 'i am a person , i 've got blond hair , ' that s up to you , he said that s freedom of speech we do n't regulate it in madison , temporary signs including but not limited to political signs are allowed , but not for more than 20 consecutive days at the same location the regulation is not strictly enforced , so the town will most likely not take any action on the letter it received from the cclu , said marilyn ozols , the planning and zoning administrator why have a rule on your books that you 're not going to enforce \? said ms younger of the civil liberties union just go out and make the change a week after it mailed the letters , the group had heard back from about a dozen towns some , ms younger said , have time restrictions tighter than westport s or other limitations that break the law , like collecting a fee for each sign placed most had no idea their laws were a problem none have refused to comply with the group s request , ms younger said we 're doing this so we do n't have to go out and sue them , she said it s our responsibility not only to litigate , but also to educate there is no state law about the timing of political signs on residential property , said bernie liu , a legal staff attorney for the secretary of state s office the state allows towns to determine their rules according to the timing of their elections and primaries , he said in westport , katherine barnard , the planning and zoning director , said she realized now that the issue was about free speech i wish i had picked up on that myself , she said i certainly do n't want in any way to interfere with freedom of speech ms barnard said the ordinance was in place when she started working for the town in 1986 it is grouped with other sign regulations , which collectively focus on keeping the town looking nice and avoiding visual clutter the goal of allowing adequate but controlled signs is not unusual , ms barnard said , and was most likely not intended to quash free expression westport has not actively cracked down on political signs instead , ms barnard sends polite letters to violators if someone usually a neighbor or a political opponent complains a lot of times people will say , oh , they did n't know about that , ms barnard said the situation is generally resolved if it s not , ms barnard starts the process of sending a ceaseanddesist order and , if the violator still has not complied , taking the issue to court by that time , the issue has often become moot from a practical standpoint , i 've never really done what i call enforcement , she said the election would be over and the situation is resolved i would n't want to spend the taxpayers' money on an issue of that nature westport has started the process of removing the time limits by scheduling a public hearing on the law for sept 23 in the meantime , ms barnard said , the town is not enforcing the rule ms younger said she did not know why westport s regulation , which has been in place for at least two decades , was under fire now she suggested that ms farrell s race against united states representative christopher shays could be the reason along the streets of westport , signs for ms farrell dominate the number of signs for mr shays and both presidential candidates maybe they have never felt as passionately as they do now , ms younger said these are extraordinary times we 're in
more than a few filmmakers who have made the rounds in hollywood with projects about the fight business over the last decade have had to bob and weave around their own material it s not really about boxing , they assure wary executives , in what has become one of the development circuit s favorite clich s clint eastwood did just that kind of footwork when the powers at warner brothers , long his home studio , said they were n't particularly interested in the subject matter of his latest film , million dollar baby i told them it s not a boxing movie , mr eastwood said in a telephone interview it s a love story that just happens to take place on the periphery of the boxing world a fatherdaughter love story fortunately , warner brothers bought in the resulting movie , directed by and starring mr eastwood , along with morgan freeman and hilary swank , swooped into a few theaters on wednesday , a late addition to the holiday schedule , and was greeted with rave reviews in the new york times , ao scott wrote that 'million dollar baby' is the best movie released by a major hollywood studio this year a bit belatedly , the needle on the buzzdetector , that highly responsive if not always reliable hollywood instrument , began quivering in the red zone , with the academy award seers predicting nominations for all three principals so far , million dollar baby has the earmarks of a classic sleeper , a modestly budgeted movie that comes out of nowhere to become a hit this picture was a small picture in the scheme of things , mr eastwood said it was all kind of loosey , and it was n't made , like 'alexander' or 'polar express , ' with a view to how it was going to be released like most eastwood movies , million dollar baby was shot quickly , and though the studio declines to release production figures , they appear by hollywood standards to have been far from staggering warner brothers put up half the money , mr eastwood explained , and lakeshore entertainment the other half , to split the risk this was n't a movie they were just queuing up to do , he said it was turned down by a lot of people i was n't coming in with a 44 magnum and doing the old genre thing in my old age , i'm looking for things that interest me a little more based on rope burns , a collection of short stories by fx toole , million dollar baby is about maggie fitzgerald \( ms swank \) , an inexperienced but determined female fighter who persuades frankie dunn \( mr eastwood \) , a hardbitten trainer with a history of failure , to take her on and groom her for the big time it s rocky in a bra , as one internet commentator remarked , and with much better music \( composed by mr eastwood himself \) fight films used to be a grand hollywood tradition , going back to the great weeper city for conquest \( 1940 \) , in which james cagney played a boxer who gets blinded in the ring while trying to earn money for his brother s musical education this tradition includes such landmarks as body and soul \( 1947 \) , with john garfield the harder they fall \( 1956 \) , based on a novel by budd schulberg \( who also wrote on the waterfront \) and starring humphrey bogart and rod steiger fat city \( 1972 \) , directed by john huston and based on leonard gardner s great boxing novel of the same title and raging bull \( 1980 \) , martin scorsese s masterpiece , with robert de niro as jake lamotta there have also been a lot of turkeys the champ \( 1979 \) , franco zeffirelli s illadvised venture into the ring with jon voight and rick schroder the great white hype \( 1996 \) , a poorly received satire written by ron shelton and tony hendra the similarly underperforming play it to the bone \( 1999 \) , which mr shelton wrote and directed and a youth boxing picture , gladiator \( 1992 \) , which nearly ended cuba gooding jr s career before it started , just to name a few good and bad , almost none of these contemporary boxing films have drawn much of an audience except , of course , sylvester stallone s rocky saga , whose five installments grossed more than half a billion dollars , or enough to run a small country despite enthusiastic reviews and the star power of will smith , ali , for example , did n't register with viewers and even raging bull , though a great critical success , winning an academy award for its star and a nomination for its director , was only a moderate success at the box office , where some might have been put off by the prospect of paying to see a new fight movie that was shot in blackandwhite million dollar baby is n't in blackandwhite , exactly , but the near equivalent it s dark and shadowy , with some ring sequences that recall the flashbulb lighting of george bellows s boxing paintings and some lunch counter shots that are more than a little hopperish it taps deeply into what might be called the joyce carol oates syndrome the tendency of some intellectuals and a few hollywood filmmakers to see boxing not as a sport but as america s tragic theater , in ms oates s phrase , a kind of mythic arena in which the rituals that are reenacted are more primal than those of the seminar room , and the toetotoe combat even more fraught than that between , say , michael eisner and michael ovitz boxing movies , or the good ones anyway , are always about more than people exchanging punches they 're about the values that endure in an atmosphere of seediness and corruption , which may be why some people in hollywood love them so much like many fight films , million dollar baby has a literary subtext fx toole was the nom de plume of jerry boyd , a former trainer and cut man who for a while was the darling of the oates set boyd turned to writing in his 70 s , after a lifetime in the fight game , and the stories in rope burns have a kind of wizened , streetsmart authenticity , along with an occasional hint of hemingwayesque eloquence million dollar baby imports some verbatim chunks of toole dialogue into its voiceover narration \( spoken by mr freeman \) , and mr eastwood , who said he read and admired the book when it came out four years ago , seems to have taken toole s description of the frankie dunn character as a virtual stage direction the voice of frankie dunn pierced in the same sentence it could climb high and harsh or loop as sweet as a peach , like benny goodman playing 'body and soul , ' or go down deep as a grizzly s grunt that s exactly how mr eastwood sounds here , and he and mr freeman , as a weary expug , blind in one eye and now reduced to mopping the gym floor , embody all the essential toole attributes smarts , toughness , a secretly big heart and a profoundly tragic view of life in fact , the movie touches bravely and unapologetically on practically every fight clich ever written or filmed the grimy , sweatstained gym , the sleazy managers and corrupt promoters , the wellmeaning but toughtalking priest , the vicious opponent who will stoop to anything it looks and feels deliberately oldfashioned , except for ms swank , eager and rawboned , who seems to wander in from another kind of movie altogether she jolts the time machine into life and , thanks to an unexpected plot twist , suddenly transforms it into something more contemporary how this will play with audiences , as opposed to the critics , remains to be seen there is no romantic interest in million dollar baby , unless you count sublimated fatherdaughter affection , and the mood is almost unrelievedly somber even the female fighter angle does n't do much to dispel a powerful whiff of nostalgia a movie like rocky was able to catch the coattails of the muhammad ali era , boxing s last great moment the sport has lately enjoyed something of a revival thanks to cable networks like showtime and hbo , but even that may be short lived the ratings for the next great champ , the american idol style boxing competition on fox , were so low that the network yanked it after just four episodes boxing still looms largest as a subject for literary types and for filmmakers paying homage to the past like raging bull , million dollar baby may turn out to be an elegy for a kind of movie they almost do n't make anymore
the best rivalry in american sports will be renewed once again on tuesday , with the sisyphean boston red sox facing the evil empire new york yankees for three games in the bronx inevitability is rarely so compelling as we watch these supposedly unscripted games , we ca n't help knowing that by october s end one of so many ghosts from babe to bucky to boone will slip the pinstripes back on and crush new england s hopes once again history ai n't exactly boston s friend but dig down into it deep enough , to exactly 100 years ago , and the hub can find some reason for hope in 1904 , the first pennant race between these franchises they were n't even called the yankees and the red sox yet featured , as it has so often since , a controversial player acquisition , a goat and heartbreak but an altogether different ending the beginning feels backward , too when the american league was born in 1901 , the boston pilgrims were its flagship franchise , while new york had none tammany hall , seeking to protect the national league s giants , had thwarted all attempts to locate a team in manhattan the al founder and president , ban johnson , was finally able to relocate the floundering baltimore orioles to new york for 1903 when these new highlanders finished in fourth place well behind boston , which ran away with the pennant and drew alarmingly few fans , johnson decided that some charity was in order he engineered several trades to boost new york and weaken the boston champions opening day 1904 suggested a new balance of power , with new york s jack chesbro beating boston s cy young , 82 but by midjune the pilgrims were back on top so johnson , who wielded an influence on his young league that is unimaginable today , arranged for boston to trade its popular left fielder , patsy dougherty a 325 career hitter and speedy run scorer to new york for bob unglaub , a rookie bench player who was in the hospital for blood poisoning the trade drew both fans for the highlanders and ire from pilgrims followers it remains one of the most patently onesided trades in baseball history the fans are greatly disturbed over the change , the sporting news reported there have been signs that the american league is inclined to use the boston club for the benefit of the league as a whole , without properly considering the club and its legion of patrons the red sox' squandering of babe ruth in 1920 and near trade for alex rodriguez last winter are more notorious , but it was the dougherty deal that marked the beginning of boston s playing patsy for new york the race immediately tightened , just as johnson had hoped throughout september , the pilgrims \( who became the red sox in 1907 \) and the highlanders \( who became the yankees in 1913 \) traded first place six times \( one journalist at the time called it the fastest , closest and most desperately contested major league race on record \) as it would many times in the future 1949 and 1978 foremost among them the duel came down to the season s final days , with a fivegame series that began with boston ahead in the standing by half a game new york won the first game boston swept the subsequent doubleheader , setting up a twinbill in new york to decide the pennant two hundred boston fans , complete with brass band and megaphones , jammed into the leftfield grandstand of old american league park and tried to outyell 25 , 000 highlander rooters new york needed a sweep to take the title it appeared in control of the first game when it took a 20 lead in the fifth behind chesbro , the dominant spitballer who had won 41 games , still the modern singleseason record but chesbro , having thrown more than 450 innings that season , began to tire two runs in the seventh by boston tied the score bullpens were but a dream for pitchers of that era , and chesbro teetered into the ninth as a sense of doom wafted through the grandstand with two out and boston s lou criger on third base , chesbro licked some saliva onto his fingers spitballs were legal then and heaved a twostrike pitch to the plate it did n't go anywhere close the ball sailed over the catcher and hit the backstop on the fly criger scored easily to give boston a 32 lead chesbro soon returned to the highlanders' dugout bench and , as one teammate later recalled , cried like a child having quite literally thrown away new york s pennant hopes to the hated bostonians , he became one of gotham s most notorious goats of course , after the red sox hawked babe ruth to the yankees 16 years later , the dynamic between the teams was forever changed the yankees have won 26 world series since then , the red sox none the pilgrims' victory in 1904 was long ago painted over by so many gallons of grief but perhaps history can befriend boston for a change one red sox fan , the indianapolis orthopedist steve puopolo , sighed when he learned that the rivalry that had caused him such enduring pain did , in fact , begin quite differently it gives me hope it is n't an eternal curse , puopolo said maybe every 100 years we 'll be blessed
as the white house opened an aggressive personal attack against its former counterterrorism chief , richard a clarke , a furious debate broke out on monday about the credibility of his assertion that president bush pushed him the day after the sept 11 attacks to see if there was a link with saddam hussein the white house dismissed the accusations , described in a new book by mr clarke , by casting him as a disgruntled , politically motivated job seeker and a best buddy of a top adviser to senator john kerry but mr clarke defended his account , and several allies rallied to his defense one ally , mr clarke s former deputy , roger cressey , backed the thrust of one of the most incendiary accusations in the book , about a conversation that mr clarke said he had with mr bush in the white house situation room on the night of sept 12 , 2001 mr clarke said mr bush pressed him three times to find evidence that iraq was behind the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon the accusation is explosive because no such link has ever been proved i want you , as soon as you can , to go back over everything , everything , mr clarke writes that mr bush told him see if saddam did this see if he s linked in any way when mr clarke protested that the culprit was al qaeda , not iraq , mr bush testily ordered him , he writes , to look into iraq , saddam , and then left the room scott mcclellan , the white house press secretary , responded at a white house briefing on monday that mr bush did not remember having the conversation , and that there were no records that placed the president in the situation room at the time mr clarke countered in a telephone interview on monday that he had four witnesses , including mr cressey , who is a partner with mr clarke in a consulting company that advises on cybersecurity issues in an interview , mr cressey said the national security adviser , condoleezza rice , also witnessed the exchange administration officials said ms rice had no recollection of it mr cressey cast mr bush s instructions to mr clarke less as an order to come up with a link between mr hussein and sept 11 , and more as a request to take a look at all options , including iraq he backed off mr clarke s suggestion that the president s tone was intimidating i'm not going to get into that , mr cressey said that is dick s characterization mr clarke s book , against all enemies inside america s war on terror , also asserts that the administration did not heed warnings about the sept 11 attacks , and then neglected the threat of al qaeda as it turned its attention to saddam hussein another ally of mr clarke , thomas r maertens , confirmed the outlines of mr clarke s critique of the white house mr maertens , who served as national security council director for nuclear nonproliferation on both the clinton and bush white house staffs , said that mr clarke had repeatedly tried to warn senior officials in the bush administration about the growing threat of al qaeda he was the guy pushing hardest , saying again and again that something big was going to happen , including possibly here in the us , mr maertens said monday from his home in minnesota but mr maertens said that the bush white house was reluctant to believe a holdover from the previous administration they really believed their campaign rhetoric about the clinton administration , mr maertens said so anything they did was bad , and the bushies were not going to repeat it and it s disgusting to see the administration now putting a fullcourt smear on clarke for being right mr clarke also charges in his book that mr bush waged an unnecessary and costly war in iraq that strengthened islamic terrorist movements around the world , and has left the nation more vulnerable to future attacks his book is the first by a former administration member to challenge the president directly on what mr bush considers his greatest electoral strength , national security it is arriving in book stores not only during a presidential campaign , but in the same week that mr clarke and clinton and bush administration officials are to publicly testify before the independent commission investigating the sept 11 attacks mr clarke said last week that he was prepared to testify that clinton administration officials repeatedly warned members of the incoming bush administration in late 2000 about the threat posed by al qaeda in the hearings , which begin on wednesday , the panel will call as witnesses four highranking officials from the bush and clinton administrations secretary of state colin l powell his predecessor , madeleine k albright defense secretary donald h rumsfeld and his predecessor , william s cohen the angry white house response to mr clarke , which was authorized by mr bush , reflects the administration s fears over the book s potential political damage in a daylong assault on monday , administration officials portrayed mr clarke , a secretive , combative terrorism expert who spent more than three decades working in the reagan , clinton and both bush administrations , as a bitter former employee who had been denied the no 2 position in the department of homeland security and who was now trying to help the kerry campaign vice president dick cheney , in an interview on rush limbaugh s radio program , noted that mr clarke was in charge of counterterrorism at the time of the 1993 world trade center bombing and the 2000 attack on the american destroyer cole , and i did n't notice that they had any great success dealing with the terrorist threat mr mcclellan told reporters he conveniently writes a book and releases it in the heat of a presidential campaign we know that his best buddy is senator kerry s principal foreign policy adviser mr mcclellan was referring to rand beers , mr kerry s chief foreign policy adviser clearly , mr mcclellan said , this is more about politics and a book promotion than it is about policy mr clarke fired back that the white house attacks were an effort to divert attention from the substantive information in his book , including his impression that ms rice , as the new national security adviser in early 2001 , had not heard of al qaeda \( administration officials disputed the claim about ms rice \) this is the way the bush administration deals with people , with ad hominem attacks , and trying to suppress the truth , mr clarke said by telephone from new york he added that he had been friends for 25 years with mr beers , and i'm not going to run away from him just because he s john kerry s national security adviser administration officials said mr clarke , who was on ms rice s staff , was kept on after the clinton administration because she wanted to maintain continuity in counterterrorism policy mr clarke , they said , proved to be almost obsessive a description he applies to himself in the book about attacking al qaeda and osama bin laden and impatient that many of his ideas , like forging a closer alliance with the northern alliance , the taliban resistance in afghanistan , were not adopted but administration officials said that throughout his tenure in the bush administration , mr clarke appeared to be generally supportive of the president s policies , and never brought to ms rice a broad critique of either the administration s approach to terrorism or its plan for invading iraq sean mccormack , ms rice s spokesman , said that mr clarke ate lunch with ms rice in her west wing office after he had left the administration , a month or two before the attack on iraq , and gave none of the warnings he gave in the book in addition to mr cressey , at least two other former officials with knowledge of what occurred in the situation room that day also backed up the thrust of mr clarke s account , though one of the two challenged mr clarke s assertion that mr bush s demeanor and that of other senior white house officials was intimidating
for ages , it seemed , teenagers drank and partied with impunity in the neat splitlevels and imposing colonials scattered across westchester county a passing police cruiser occasionally sent partygoers fleeing , but mostly the keg bashes sputtered to a close , leaving in their wake a handful of excruciating hangovers and a few trampled beds of impatiens but those days appear to be numbered in the past few years , police departments in the county , working with the westchester district attorney s office , have tackled the problem of underage drinking in new and aggressive ways there are hot lines for tips about planned parties , enabling the police to try to head them off there are continuing liquor store stings there is also a countywide crackdown on fake id s , as well as a new law requiring all beer kegs sold in the state to be registered perhaps most startling , at least for suburbanites inured to the ubiquity of teenage drinking , is the fact that youths and parents are increasingly getting ensnared by the law when we get a call about a party , technically it s a crime , so we investigate it as a crime , said detective john hynes , a youth officer for the village of pelham police department from the very beginning to the end , we will try to make an arrest it s not like in the old days where you just chased everybody home westchester , of course , is not alone when it comes to underage drinking and the recent police clampdown has not stopped the parties , which surface like mushrooms after a spring rain but the zerotolerance approach by local authorities prompted by a drinkingrelated death two years ago and other highprofile episodes is changing the rhythm of adolescence in one of the wealthiest counties in the nation the newly rigorous enforcement of the underage drinking laws , cheered on by many parents , educators and even some young people , is also meeting resistance police officials say that some parents have criticized them for being too aggressive , while some teenagers are showing more hubris at a party in april in rye , a wealthy community on long island sound , some 50 partygoers refused to open the front door when the police responded to a noise complaint for three hours , the partygoers remained inside with the lights out , refusing to budge even after their parents arrived the police generally do not force their way into a house without a search warrant unless someone is clearly endangered when a partygoer opened the door after 3 am , the police found open containers of alcohol in every room , said detective lt joseph a verille of the rye police after investigating , the police charged the high school senior , david mcbride , 19 , whose house was the scene of the party , with two misdemeanors relating to the provision of alcohol to minors the westchester district attorney , jeanine f pirro , called the rye high school students' behavior outrageous , adding that it represented a defiance and a feeling of entitlement on the part of kids that they have a right to drink most police officers say that it is difficult to cite teenagers for possession of alcohol because the law requires that the minor actually have the drink in hand by the time the police are in the door , the partygoers have either scattered or have at least put down their cups of beer but some police departments , like greenburgh in central westchester , have tried a different tack , having officers hang back and observe the gathering before entering at a party last year in the affluent edgemont neighborhood , the police successfully netted a large group of minors that way , charging 16 teenagers with possessing alcohol and referring another 26 teenagers under the age of 16 , who were too young to be charged with a violation , to the department s juvenile unit they were able to sit and look through the windows and see the kids with the alcohol , said john a kapica , the greenburgh police chief the intense focus on underage drinking in westchester has been building steadily for two years , since the death of a harrison teenager in april 2002 after a drunken fistfight at an afterschool house party after being punched , the teenager , robert viscome , 17 , fell back and hit his head on the patio he died a week later from head injuries but a string of drinking episodes in the fall of 2002 soon followed , from a homecoming dance in scarsdale where scores of high school students were fallingdown drunk , to the suspension of nine football players from harrison high school after they attended a beer party most departments today are taking a pretty strong stance on this because there have been such highprofile incidents that everybody recognizes the seriousness of it , said detective lt bryant clark of the scarsdale police more and more , authorities are trying to prosecute the provider of the alcohol , whether it s a parent , an older sibling or the teenage host i 've charged parents before and convicted them , and we will continue to do so , ms pirro said but sometimes there are frustrations with the law chief kapica in greenburgh still regrets that there was not enough evidence to charge the homeowners at the edgemont party the parents , who were home , denied knowing that alcohol was present , he said , and none of the teenagers provided statements to contradict their claim in fact , mr kapica said , there was not only lots of beer at the party but also marijuana and tablets of ritalin to me , it s pretty unreasonable to have 50 kids in your home screaming , yelling , drinking , smoking pot , and not once did you look in to see what the noise was , he said mr kapica also questions the underage drinking law that allows a police officer to arrest a sober teenager about to crack open a can of beer , but not the teenager who is too intoxicated to talk or walk even when charges cannot be brought , officers say they try to notify the teenagers' parents in the village of larchmont , a youth officer , detective barbara a daquino , says she tries to corral the partygoers and then summon their parents every kid has a cellphone these days , and we 'll say , 'call your parent and tell them to pick you up here , and if they ca n't pick you up here , they 'll have to pick you up at headquarters , she said while most parents seem appropriately chagrined , police say , others seem smug or angry , not at their children , but at the police the biggest frustration is that many people in the adult community , people who are parents , in some cases leaders , do not have the same view that underage drinking is a problem , said lt anthony masi of the yorktown police department chief kapica of greenburgh said he also encountered that attitude more parents seem to be really taking this seriously , he said but i 've heard parents from affluent families say that the fact that i am issuing a summons to somebody could stop them from getting into harvard
a new report commissioned by the government suggests that it will be difficult to completely prevent genetically engineered plants and animals from having unintended environmental and public health effects the report , released yesterday by the national research council of the national academy of sciences , says that while there are many techniques being developed to prevent genetically engineered organisms or their genes from escaping into the wild , most techniques are still in early development and none appear to be completely effective one of our big messages throughout the whole report is that there are very few bioconfinement methods that are well developed , anne r kapuscinski , a professor of fisheries , wildlife and conservation biology at the university of minnesota and a member of the committee that wrote the report , said at a news conference in washington yesterday companies and scientists are now developing a wide range of genetically modified organisms salmon that grow superfast , mosquitoes engineered not to transmit malaria , corn that produces pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals one concern about these transgenic products is that their genes or the organisms could spread fastgrowing fish , if they were to escape into the wild , might beat out regular salmon for food or mates , disrupting the ecological balance genes giving crops resistance to herbicides or insects might spread to weeds , making the weeds harder to eradicate pollen flow from corn engineered to produce a drug could allow the drug to get into corn destined for the food supply much of the efforts to prevent these effects have involved physical containment , like growing fish in tanks rather than the ocean or growing crops in greenhouses but the new report , commissioned by the department of agriculture , looks at biological methods of containment , which it calls bioconfinement these include measures like inducing sterility by giving fish an extra set of chromosomes or exposing insects to radiation bacteria might be given suicide genes that would cause them to selfdestruct if they escaped crop scientists are working on a variety of techniques , including putting the foreign genes into the chloroplasts rather than the nucleus because chloroplast genes usually do not get into the pollen in many cases , the report says , such bioconfinement will not be needed because the organisms will pose little risk but it says that when it is needed , it might be useful to use more than one method at a time , since no single method is likely to be 100 percent effective the report also says such bioconfinement methods are best considered early in the development of a genetically modified plant or animal rather than as an afterthought the panel s report could have some bearing on issues now before regulators it recommends , for instance , that nonfood crops be sought for growing pharmaceuticals or chemicals that need to be kept out of the food supply this position is favored by many environmental and consumer groups and by food companies , which fear that a contamination incident would hurt sales and undermine public confidence in food safety but the biotechnology industry has generally argued that it is most economical to use widely grown crops like corn and that these crops can be adequately isolated from crops grown for food the report also says there are weaknesses in the safeguards being taken by a company that is seeking food and drug administration approval to sell salmon genetically engineered to grow faster the company , aqua bounty technologies of waltham , mass , has said it would sell to fish farms only female fish that have been sterilized , thereby eliminating the possibility that the fish could reproduce should they escape into rivers or the ocean but the report says those methods alone might not be sufficient , in part because sterilization does not always work it says the fish should be grown only in special inland facilities , rather than in cages in the ocean from which they might escape joseph b mcgonigle , vice president of aqua bounty , said there were errors in the report they clearly do n't have a full grasp of both what we 're proposing and how effective the technology is , mr mcgonigle said consumer groups and the biotechnology industry differed on their interpretation of the report gregory jaffe of the center for science in the public interest said the report s conclusion that there was no foolproof bioconfinement method suggested there is a need to have a better regulatory system that assesses whether there are any risks to begin with but the biotechnology industry organization said in a statement that the report concluded that technology providers have a variety of methods available to ensure confinement of organisms modified through biotechnology when risk warrants it in another report issued yesterday , the national research council said urgent action was needed to preserve the atlantic salmon in maine , where the fish supply has been rapidly declining the fish there constitute most of the atlantic salmon population in the united states a program of removing dams should start immediately , the report said
following are excerpts from testimony by the director of central intelligence , george j tenet , and the director of the fbi , robert s mueller iii , yesterday before the commission investigating the sept 11 , 2001 , attacks , as recorded by the federal news service inc they were questioned by commissioners john f lehman , timothy j roemer and slade gorton and the chairman , thomas h kean a full transcript is at nytimescom washington mr tenet how do i assess our performance \? the intelligence that we provided our senior policy makers about the threat al qaeda posed , its leadership and its operational span across over 60 countries and the use of afghanistan as a sanctuary was clear and direct warning was well understood , even if the timing and method of attacks were not the intelligence community had the right strategy and was making the right investments to position itself for the future against al qaeda we made good progress across intelligence disciplines disruptions , renditions and sensitive collection activities no doubt saved lives however , we never penetrated the 9 11 plot overseas while we positioned ourselves very well , with extensive human and technical penetrations , to facilitate the takedown of the afghan sanctuary , we did not discern the specific nature of the plot we made mistakes our failure to watchlist nawaq al hazmi and khalid al midhar in a timely manner or the fbi s inability to find them in the narrow window at the time afforded them showed systemic weaknesses and the lack of redundancy there were at least four separate terroristidentity databases at state , cia , the department of defense and the fbi none were interoperable or broadly accessible there were dozens of watch lists , many haphazardly maintained there were legal impediments to cooperation across the continuum of criminal intelligence operations it was not a secret at all that we understood it but in truth , all of us took little action to create a common arena of criminal and intelligence data that we could all access most profoundly , we lacked a governmentwide capability to integrate foreign and domestic knowledge , data operations and analysis warning is not good enough without the structure to put it into action we all understood bin laden s attempt to strike the homeland , but we never translated this knowledge into an effective defense of the country doing so would have complicated the terrorists' calculation of the difficulty in succeeding in a vast , open society that , in effect , was unprotected on sept 11 questions and answers mr lehman that report that you heard this morning was a damning report , not of your actions or the actions of any of the really superb and dedicated people that you have , but it was a damning evaluation of a system that is broken , that does n't function mr tenet first of all , i want you to know that i have serious issues with the staff statement as it was written today i have serious issues about how the dci s authorities have been used to integrate collection , operations when the staff statement says the dci director of central intelligence had no strategic plan to manage the war on terrorism , that s flat wrong when the staff statement says i had no program , strategic direction in place to integrate , correlate data and move data across the community , that s wrong i just want to say to you that i would like to come back to the committee and give you my sense of it , at the same time telling you it ai n't perfect and by no stretch of the imagination am i going to tell you that i 've solved all the problems of the community in terms of integrating it and lashing it up but we 've made an enormous amount of progress i would tell you also that and this is the perspective i lived nobody else can live what i lived through i believe that if you separate the dci from troops , from operators and analysts , i have a concern about his or her effectiveness , his or her connection now , you may want to have a different structure , you may want to have a different cia , sir , in terms of how you manage it so there may be some things we can do there but i would n't separate i would n't separate the individual from the institution you may manage it differently , because i believe that one of the concerns i have is if you create another layer and another staff between something that s supposed to provide central organization , all source analysis and operations , we 've created another gap and a distance so i would n't design america s intelligence community , 56 years later , the way the national security act designed it i would recognize that the key operational principle is not who is in charge of the wire diagrams , but the way data flows is integrated between analysis and operations and in the 21st century , technology is your friend , not an enemy and from a security perspective , it also makes your life easier i would be very focused on organizing around missions and ensuring the capabilities were built , but the mission focused and centers drove the way we operated against the things that mattered most to us in terms of a foreign intelligence target you can structure on top of that , you can lay anything you want on top of that , sir , but i think that that integration is what s key and you can figure out the wire diagrams and the authorities any way you want but i would tell you that the lesson is , yeah , of course we need more change of course , i think you know , if i can tell you , if i 've failed or made a mistake , i 've been evolutionary in terms of the community maybe i should have been more revolutionary i sit back at night and look at a war in iraq , a war on terrorism , conflict in afghanistan and all the things i have to do , and recognize , you know , no single human being can do all these things i understand that so maybe some structure is required but i would also urge the commission , and i will come back to you formally , to take a look at some significant things that have happened in the management of the community , of our resources , of our people , of our collection , of our training , of our education because they are building blocks that , quite frankly , i'm proud of q now , i said this train is coming down the track , and you used the word revolution rather than evolution and i think that s a perfect way for people to understand this you 've done a terrific job in the evolutionary change , but it s clearly not been enough revolution is coming how do you do revolution without losing sight of the business you 're in \? you ca n't take your eye off the ball do you think this can be done in a rational way \? a frankly , my personal view is that you really do need an outside group engagement , recommendations to come forward i think it s people like me and john and people working in the business can certainly inform i 've got a group now i put together on revolutionary change in the intelligence community , and ideas that are flowing to me i think you need something established to come back to you , react to you , push you and prod you and get you out of your skin and your daily responsibilities to get this done in the right way i think it s hard when you 're sitting i mean , the day i retire i 'll be a great person to sit on one of these things but and i 'd love to do it but i think that the important thing is it s very hard for people when they 're sitting in the inbox and the crisis of the day to be reflective and occasionally i have reflective thoughts it s not often enough to deal with the problem like this i think you 've got to separate the current group to allow we can give you the data , give you our experience and talk to you about but i think you almost need a separate group of people who have been around this but you also need people who have revolutionary ideas about technology and how it works , and a new mindset , because the people you 're recruiting are n't 30year veterans anymore you 're attracting a whole new labor force that does n't remember the cold war and they expect a structure that s going to be more agile and mobile and more technologically proficient so we 've got to take this in a different direction mr roemer and you have the information from the fbi at that point august 2001 on moussaoui \? a yes , i was briefed on moussaoui in late august q august what \? a i believe it s the 23rd or the 24th q now , do you all share this information then with other people at ctc counterterrorist center and fbi and other places \? what do you do with this information \? a i believe in that time period we immediately tried to undertake a way to figure out how to help the fbi get data and deal with this particular problem but i 'd really want to go back and check records q with this interesting , curious , fascinating piece of data , do you share this data at the sept 4 principals' meeting with other people in the room at that point , when you 're discussing this policy that has taken seven months to make its way through the process on al qaeda \? a it was n't discussed at the principals' meeting , since we 're having a separate agenda q would it made any difference , if you had mentioned did you ever mention it , for instance , to the president , you 're briefing the president from aug 6 on a i did n't see the president i was not in briefings with him during this time he was on vacation i was here q you did n't see the president between aug 6 , 2001 , and sept 10 \? a well , no , but before saw him after labor day , to be sure q so you saw him sept 4 at the principals' meeting \? a he was not at the principals' meeting q well , you do n't see him a condoleezza rice i saw him in this time frame , to be sure q ok , i'm just confused you see him on aug 6 with the pdb president s daily brief a no , i do not , sir i'm not there q ok , you 're not the when do you see him in august \? a i do n't believe i do q you do n't see the president of the united states once in the month of august \? a he s in texas , and i'm either here or on leave for some of that time so i'm not here q so who s briefing him on the pdb s \? a the briefer himself we have a presidential briefer q so but you never get on the phone or in any kind of conference with him to talk , at this level of high chatter and huge warnings during the spring and summer , to talk to him , through the whole month of august \? a talked to we talked to him directly throughout the spring and early summer , almost every day q but not in august \? a in this time period , i'm not talking to him , no mr mueller i'm sure the question will be asked today as to my views on the need to establish a separate domestic intelligence agency , so let me address that now i do believe that creating a separate agency to collect intelligence in the united states would be a grave mistake splitting the law enforcement and the intelligence functions would leave both agencies fighting the war on terrorism with one hand tied behind their backs the distinct advantage we gain by having intelligence and law enforcement together would be lost in more layers and greater stovepiping of information , not to mention the difficulty of transitioning safely to a new entity while terrorists seek to do us harm the fbi s strength has always been , is and will be in the collection of information our weakness has been in the integration , analysis and dissemination of that information and we are addressing these weaknesses our country has a tremendous resource in the fbi we want to make the fbi better , we want to improve it so that we can fulfill our mission to protect america and we look forward to your suggestions on how we might improve it questions and answers mr gorton try to imagine that we really were starting all over again without existing institutions in this field as to whether or not , you know , your ideal in law enforcement and intelligence would be the two agencies that we have at the present time , one law enforcement and domestic intelligence , and one foreign intelligence two , separate entities , one law enforcement and one all intelligence , both domestic and foreign three , one for each of these or one in which your foreign and domestic intelligence were united together with law enforcement itself a i think there are benefits to a separate intelligence organization where you have recruiting for intelligence and you focus on intelligence i think that s an argument that we have to give but then you look at the other side and in order to deter attacks in the future , it cannot be one agency , particularly when you 're looking domestically in the united states , and it s not just the fbi what we have to do is leverage ourselves with every police department , state and local law enforcement in order to gather the intelligence , the information in our communities , have it passed up so that we can be more predictive and what the fbi brings to that intelligencegathering capacity is the 56 field offices we have around the country , more than 400 satellite offices in just about every one of our communities , who have intersected over the years with state and local law enforcement in a wide variety of undertakings , and develop the relationships that are so important to leveraging that throughout the united states so that s no 1 the second point i would i think is very important is to reflect upon where we were before sept 11 with the wall , where you had the divorcing of intelligence and criminal , which was often tremendously artificial and it was there are a number of contributing factors to that , but that was a fact of life before what we have done since sept 11 is broken down those walls , broken down that artificial determination of whether something s intelligence versus criminal and what you have now is integrated in one agency within the united states the ability , looking at it with state and local law enforcement , to push the intelligence aspects of any set of facts , so long as you can gather more intelligence , identify more persons the fbi has always been trained of operating within the constitution , understanding the importance within the united states of gathering information according to predication , according to the guidelines , whether it be the attorney general and the statutes and the like and that is the way we operate in the united states , and that is the way we should operate in the united states , because we are called upon to gather information and intelligence on united states citizens that is far different than what we 're able to do overseas and we have grown up with two different entities , one for overseas collection of information and one for domestic collection of information and when it comes to collection collection of information i think it is important that we have that separation mr kean i came to this job with less knowledge of the intelligence community than anybody else at this table what i 've learned has not reassured me it s frightened me a bit , frankly and i 'll tell you what still worries me it s things that are in our staff report for instance , according to a recent report by the department of justice inspector general , the fbi shortages of linguists have resulted in thousands of hours of audiotapes and pages of written material not being reviewed or translated into a timely manner another place at every office we visited , we heard there were not enough surveillance personnel to cover the request to conduct live physical surveillance of identified terrorist suspects again , we heard from many analysts who complained they 're able to do little actual analysis , because they continue to be assigned menial tasks , including covering the phones at reception desks and emptying the office trash bins again , agent after agent told us that the primary way information gets shared is through personal relationships there does not appear to be any recognition that the system fails in the absence of good personal relationships and i guess just one more we found there is no national strategy for sharing information to counter terrorism now that s from our report that was read just prior to your appearance , and i guess my question is still can you fix it \? a the fact of the matter is , when it comes to a terrorist organization , except in those instances where we have a very difficult time with particular dialects , it s reviewed within 24 hours certainly if we 've got an investigation that s ongoing that relates to the possibility of a threat surveillance we are stretched on our surveillance capabilities we have made requests to congress , and we are getting in '04 substantial additional support to do surveillance analysts we have to do two things one , we have had to build up our analytical capability , but we also have had to professionalize the analytical staff and train it in the days shortly after sept 11 , we put together and set up a college of analytical studies that has to be improved information sharing there are two aspects of that that are important one is the understanding of the necessity to disseminate that which we have i 've listened to some of the testimony earlier today about when i think it was commissioner lehman , with regard to an investigation , a criminal investigation that turns up intelligence information that would be useful to the intelligence community in the past , that would not have been disseminated , because of the grand jury rules that have been set aside by the patriot act today , it would be disseminated in an iir intelligence information report to the intelligence community
contrary to popular belief , many investors did not lose money in the internet meltdown because they had jumped into bed with highrisk stocks it was because they had done so without figuring out how to end those relationships down the road that may sound unromantic , but investors need to be coldhearted not having a sound sell strategy or any exit plan , for that matter was a big mistake for many people when the stock bubble burst and paper profits turned into huge losses investors need to take that lesson to heart , because the nasdaq has entered what is starting to look like an alltoofamiliar place after a strong rally last year , the nasdaq composite index is in a correction while it is too soon to predict a rerun of the 2000 market , which wiped out most of the gains of 1999 , the nasdaq has lost nearly 8 percent of its value since its january peak even if history is repeating itself , this is no time to panic in fact , times like these call for a rational investment approach that includes a disciplined plan for cutting one s losses at least that is one way to interpret a new study of institutional money managers in the study , published this spring in the journal of portfolio management , christophe faugere , hany a shawky , and david m smith finance professors at the state university of new york at albany examined the performance of money managers who oversee pension funds , endowments and highnetworth accounts because institutional money managers often work under highly defined trading rules , the three professors were able to analyze these investors' performance based on their specific approaches to selling stocks the professors determined that during the bear market months from april 2000 to december 2002 , investors who fared the best relative to their market benchmarks , at least were those with restrictive rules that did not allow much leeway for hanging onto stocks for emotional reasons for instance , more than a third of the 4 , 332 institutional money managers in the study relied primarily on a strategy called valuation level selling that is a fancy way of saying that they sold stocks because they became too pricey , based on measures like earnings or book value the study s authors regard such a strategy as highly disciplined and objective managers who relied on this method outperformed their chosen benchmarks by 046 percentage points a month or 55 points a year , on average , during this period by comparison , institutional managers who relied on more flexible sell strategies requiring judgment calls on the health of a business fared worse they beat their benchmarks by just 008 percentage points a month or just less than 1 point a year , on average , during the downturn , despite outperforming the more disciplined sellers during the roaring bull market of the late 1990 s what does this mean for investors who may not have the skills or the resources of professional money managers \? for starters , it is a reminder that some kind of selling discipline is better than none without any kind of strategy , emotions will come into play and emotions are almost always wrong , said greg forsythe , director of the equity model development team at charles schwab beyond that , said mr shawky , director of suny s center for institutional investment management , discipline matters in down markets the notion of cutting losses may seem anathema in the world of longterm , buyandhold investing but it makes sense to hold all your stocks forever only if every one of your buy decisions is perfect and who can claim that \? that is why it is important for investors to introduce discipline and structure to their investment plans here , we can take cues from some mutual fund managers set target prices like many managers , lanny thorndike , lead manager of the century small cap select fund , judges how high each of his holdings may trade over the coming 12 months this target is based in part on his judgment of how much others are willing to pay whenever a stock comes within 5 percent of his target price , mr thorndike trims his position in the first quarter , he sold shares of sunrise senior living , the assistedcare company , as its price approached his target of 42 the stock fell to 30 a share in early may he bought its stock again at 33 it now trades at 3604 the sell discipline deserves more credit than the analysts or myself when it comes to keeping us out of trouble , he said set a floor the key to good investment results is to avoid the big loss , says arieh coll , manager of the eaton vance growth fund academic research tells us that individual investors have a knack for hanging onto moneylosing stocks but one way that mr coll makes sure that he does not ride his losers all the way down is by reexamining any holding that falls 15 percent below its recent peak although some managers sell at this point , using what are called stop loss orders , mr coll reassesses his entire investment he decides whether to dump the holding and take advantage of the tax loss , which he can use to offset other gains to stand pat or to buy more shares this forces him to deal with his laggards headon , instead of avoiding the topic , as many investors do maintain diversification caps investors often benefit from cutting their losses and keeping their winners , but there are limits to the strategy for example , if you let your winners grow too big , a diversified portfolio can quickly become too concentrated in a handful of stocks , raising the risk level the managers of the jensen fund have a simple way of dealing with this whenever a stock in the 22 billion fund becomes more than 75 percent of the overall portfolio , the holding is trimmed , said robert g millen , the fund s comanager this approach keeps any single stock from having undue influence over the entire portfolio , and ensures that you take some profits along the way make your sell strategy work with your buy discipline whatever your approach , your sell discipline should reflect your buy strategy consider the jensen fund again the only stocks that qualify for this largecap growth portfolio are of companies that have produced returns on equity of 15 percent or more for 10 years in a row only about 120 companies in a universe of 10 , 000 meet that standard , mr millen said if a holding stumbles and breaks its string , it is kicked to the curb that happened with intel in the spring of 2001 the fund sold out of its position at about 31 a share , mr millen said by the summer of 2002 , the stock sank as low as 15 our preferred holding period for all our stocks is forever , he said but in the real world , we know that does n't happen
citing a potential conflict of interest , federal prosecutors have expressed concern about the role of a private lawyer hired by the city to advise employees testifying before the grand jury investigating the staten island ferry crash , several people briefed on the case said yesterday prosecutors from the office of the united states attorney in brooklyn , roslynn r mauskopf , met with city officials yesterday to discuss the issue they agreed that the city would give ferry employees the option of choosing from several other lawyers , one of the people said the original lawyer , john s siffert , a respected former federal prosecutor , had been retained by the city to represent more than a dozen ferry captains , assistant captains and other employees who have been subpoenaed to testify the employees , who are not now targets of the inquiry , are mainly being questioned about rules and procedures of the ferry operation , one law enforcement official said in addition to the two captains aboard the ferry at the time of the october crash , investigators are focusing on whether several senior department of transportation officials who oversaw ferry operations had properly enforced rules requiring that both captains be in the pilothouse at docking at a time when the city faces the possibility of numerous lawsuits by victims , the prosecutors have questioned whether the arrangement with mr siffert is appropriate , the official said another law enforcement official said , where does their interest lie , protecting the city , or in protecting the client they are supposed to be representing \? mr siffert declined to comment yesterday but john s martin jr , a former federal judge and united states attorney in manhattan who was hired to coordinate the city s response to the subpoenas , said the arrangement was a normal practice , especially in corporate cases , and depends on the lawyer steadfastly honoring his obligation to his client he called mr siffert a man of terrific integrity but prosecutors are questioning whether mr siffert has cooperated fully in some instances when prosecutors were preparing ferry employees to testify , one of the officials said mr siffert has been present for those preparations , but not for grand jury proceedings experts in legal ethics said the arrangement was not unusual it s routine for organizations to pay for the lawyers of employees and officers who get into some kind of legal matter as a result of their job , said stephen gillers , a professor at new york university law school it is daunting to appear before a grand jury , so a lawyer is often provided by the employer , dr gillers said in cases when the organization itself is under investigation , prosecutors can ask that an outside lawyer be used in this case , mr siffert the lawyer s job is very clearly to help them respond to the subpoena in a way that is most beneficial to them , regardless of the effect on the city , even though the city is paying the fee , mr gillers said lawrence kahn , a chief litigation assistant for the city , explained that mr siffert was hired precisely to avoid the potential for a conflict of interest this is an important investigation , and we think it appropriate for employees being questioned about their official conduct who want representation to be provided counsel to protect their interests , he said he pointed out that mr siffert was hired in deference to the united states attorney s view that the city s staff lawyers faced a potential conflict because of the civil lawsuits none of the officials would explain why federal prosecutors were now dissatisfied with mr siffert s role in a separate matter , a lawyer for the union that represents ferry captains and assistant captains said he had complained that city lawyers had questioned union members who had been interviewed by prosecutors without a lawyer we fear retaliation , or are they going to pick their brains and try and figure out what the us attorney is doing \? said the lawyer , william p doyle , of the marine engineers' beneficial association he said the questioning stopped after he complained to the city mr kahn said federal prosecutors had given permission for the interviews

kevin d jones , a retired army veteran , was desperate for money he wanted to get his wife out of the philippines quickly after her home had been destroyed in a bombing but she was being delayed as she waited for immigration papers to come through that would allow her to join him in north carolina his military contacts , cultivated during a 25year career that included duty in bosnia and kosovo , helped speed the paperwork and a florida financial services company that he had found through an advertisement in the army times helped him raise the money to fly to manila , resettle his inlaws and return home with his wife he was too frantic , he said , to consider the cost of that money but it was steep in exchange for 19 , 980 after fees and insurance , mr jones signed over his 1 , 000amonth military pension for the next five years , a total of 60 , 000 that is the equivalent of paying interest at a rate of 56 percent a year federal law prohibits retired military people from signing over their future pension payments to others the companies offering these deals say they are arranged to avoid that restriction but two federal bankruptcy judges ruled this year that deals like mr jones s , in which veterans in need of quick cash give up their future pensions for a small fraction of their value , do in fact violate that law but the law has not been enforced or consistently interpreted indeed , the defense department s payroll centers routinely handle the paperwork that diverts the pension payments , even though veterans are warned to exercise caution in these arrangements , a pentagon spokeswoman said as a result , a small but persistent band of financial companies using militarysounding names continue to offer these socalled pension advances to retired military people over the internet and in military newspapers consumer lawyers are getting calls from people facing lawsuits and bankruptcy after signing over future pension payments to these companies no one is certain how many veterans have been affected , but the potential market is substantial in the last year , roughly 17 million military retirees received about 33 billion in pension payments from the pentagon none of these practices are a surprise to either the pentagon or to congress in september 2002 , the senate passed a bill that would have penalized companies offering military pension advances , but the effort stalled in the house veterans' groups have warned members about these deals and in may 2003 , the national consumer law center , a nonprofit group in boston that has worked on consumer protection issues for more than 35 years , condemned the cash advances as illegally disguised loans that do not comply with federal truthinlending laws despite these warnings , neither the pentagon nor congress has clearly defined these deals or decided which laws apply to them the pentagon does not see pension advances as examples of retirees signing away their future pensions , which it acknowledged would be illegal instead , to the pentagon , these agreements appear to be loans based on retired pay as collateral , said lt col ellen krenke , a spokeswoman for the defense department the companies making the pension advances , however , flatly deny that they are loans of any kind in contrast to the enforcement gap that arises from these dueling definitions , congress adopted rules a year ago to protect veterans' disability payments from deals like these now , senator bill nelson , the florida democrat who cosponsored that law , is shaking the tree at the defense department to get some idea of what s going on , a senior aide to senator nelson said recently in october , the national consumer law center organized a band of lawyers , including the former governor of georgia , to file a suit that seeks to confirm the fundamental illegality of buying out military pensions through arrangements like the one mr jones made it seems like this practice falls between the cracks of what the military and the veterans' organizations normally deal with , said steve tripoli , a consumer advocate with the boston group the group s class action on behalf of three plaintiffs , filed in federal court in atlanta , names as defendants ca financial programs of stuart , fla , and advanced funding inc , a maryland company that acted as a broker for ca those were the companies mr jones dealt with during his family crisis in july 2001 , when his inlaws were caught in the crossfire of sectarian violence that had plagued their hometown in the mindanao province in the philippines in august 2003 , after repaying 26 , 000 , he directed the pentagon to stop sending his pension to the florida company because , he said , he needed the money to support his wife and newborn son ca responded by going to court in its hometown in florida to sue him and a number of other veterans like mr jones , the plaintiffs in the consumer law center s case signed on for pension advances whose repayment terms , expressed as annual interest rates , ranged from 45 percent to 76 percent the suit argues that these deals are actually disguised loans that failed to comply with federal truthinlending laws and state interestrate caps , said stuart rossman , the litigation director at the center but if i'm wrong , he added , then it s an assignment of a military pension , and that violates the law , too teri belcher , a lawyer for advanced funding , of glen burnie , md , said the company would not comment on the case leif j grazi , a lawyer for ca in stuart , said that the company had not offered any new military pension deals for several years because it did not find them profitable but its existing deals are neither improper loans nor illegal pension assignments , he said we are just purchasing a stream of payments , he said , adding that other companies were probably handling the business ca had turned away if the sale of these assets is improper , why is it that the united states allows them to advertise on the internet and in the military newspapers \? mr grazi said you 'll see a million ads every month roy barnes , the former georgia governor who has joined the suit against ca , also wonders why the defense department allows pensions to be diverted to third parties and , in fact , handles the paperwork for the payroll deductions , called allotments the easiest way to cut off these companies is for the defense department to stop those allotments , mr barnes said that would get their attention the fundamental issues raised in the suit against ca and advanced funding have not deterred other companies engaged in this business carl bachmann founded and runs veterans first financial services in battery park , va , which also offers military pension advances the suit would not affect his business , he said , because his company offered better terms and clearer disclosure than did the companies cited in court there is a right way to do this business , and a wrong way to do this business , mr bachmann said but there is no doubt , he said , that the business itself is not prohibited by military pension laws executives at structured investments company , which offers pension advances through a unit called retired military financial services , said they were not familiar with the consumer law center s case but steven p covey , a managing member of structured investments , said that retired military s business model was legal and that its rates were reasonable firms that charge outrageous interest rates and take advantage of financially unstable pensioners are completely at the other end of the spectrum from our company , he said we look for a longterm relationship with our pensioners some bankruptcy judges have upheld the right of structured investments to claim future military pension payments but none of those judges addressed how their decision squared with federal statutes sections 701 and 101 of chapter 37 of the united states code that prohibit assignments of future military pensions judge arthur b federman of bankruptcy court in kansas city , mo , observed in a footnote to a july 2002 decision that there were limitations on an individual s ability to assign his or her right to receive monthly pension benefits , citing the law governing military pensions but the debtor did not raise the argument , the judge said , and the court will not address it two other bankruptcy judges , in cases decided this year , did address the special nature of military pensions , and in those cases mr covey s company lost judge james g mixon in little rock , ark , ruled in july that the sale of future military pension payments was specifically prohibited by federal law , which , he said , unambiguously provides that any such assignment is invalid and in august , judge philip h brandt in tacoma , wash , ruled that the company s claim on a retired navy enlisted man s pension violated the federal pension statutes while the company s contracts say the deal is not an assignment , judge brandt wrote , in the words of gabby hayes , sayin' it do n't make it so' but most veterans cannot afford to challenge the companies' claims in court , especially when the court is far from their homes , said lynn drysdale , a member of the plaintiffs' team suing ca and a staff lawyer at jacksonville area legal aid instead , they wind up paying default judgments without ever making the argument that the debts were illegal and therefore uncollectible , she said that is what happened to edgar j basford iii , known as jack , who retired from the navy as a senior chief petty officer in 1993 in may 2001 , facing divorce expenses , he got 26 , 000 from ca , after fees and insurance , in exchange for signing over his 1 , 242amonth navy pension for five years , a total of 74 , 520 after repaying almost 35 , 000 , he fell behind on the debt and was sued for the rest of the money i did n't have the money to fly down to florida to defend myself , mr basford said the 46 , 000 judgment the company obtained was the sole reason he filed for bankruptcy last june , he said but he did not challenge the legality of the debt and wound up agreeing to pay 500 a month to ca for more than seven years mr jones , who now lives in eldridge , iowa , said newly retired veterans like himself were especially vulnerable to a marketing approach that relies on reassuring names like retired military financial services and advertisements in publications that veterans trust , like the army times moreover , said mr jones , who joined the army at age 18 , you spend your whole life in a culture where everything is grounded in clear procedures and high standards , and where instructions are followed without question but in the civilian world , you have to question everything everything now , he added , i'm learning that
honolulu , dec 27 when experts at the pacific tsunami warning center in honolulu were first alerted that an earthquake had struck sunday off indonesia , they had no way of knowing that it had generated a devastating tsunami and no way to warn the people most likely to suffer tsunamis are rare in the indian ocean , which has no system for detecting them and alerting those in danger , and scientists do not have the tools to tell when an earthquake has created one not until the deadly wave hit sri lanka and the scientists in honolulu saw news reports of the damage there did they recognize what was happening then we knew there was something moving across the indian ocean , said dr charles mccreery , the center s director we wanted to try to do something , but without a plan in place then , it was not an effective way to issue a warning , or to have it acted upon , dr mccreery said there would have still been some time not a lot of time , but some time if there was something that could be done in madagascar , or on the coast of africa one of the things that was running through my mind is just that our international group has in many past meetings had discussions about what can be done for other ocean basins , he said and i guess i was just wishing in retrospect that more progress had been made in that area the sequence of events as knowledge of the earthquake , the tsunami and the destruction unfolded suggest the speed and precision of science and modern communication , as well as their limits if there had been a warning system for tsunamis in the indian ocean , thousands of people might have had a chance to flee the first notice of the earthquake that anyone at the pacific tsunami center received was a computergenerated page set off by seismic sensors at 2 59 pm on saturday honolulu time the immediate message received by people like laura sl kong , a department of commerce expert who is the head of a united nations tsunami education center in hawaii , included the time of the quake , latitude , longitude and an initial estimate of magnitude , about 80 nobody was in the office of the pacific tsunami center but staff members who received the pages reached the office , took a closer look at available data and sent out a warning to a preset list of contacts around the pacific the center was advising of sea level changes in fiji , chile and california measured in inches , the echo of a distant event that had sloshed through the straits that connect the oceans the warning center continued to refine its estimate of the quake , eventually raising it to a magnitude of 90 , which is 10 times more powerful than the initial estimate of 80 , because the scale is logarithmic the pacific center , operated by the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration , faced two problems in recognizing what was occurring in the indian ocean and alerting potential victims there is no direct connection between an earthquake magnitude and a resulting tsunami not all quakes under the ocean lift the ocean floor to displace the water needed to create a tsunami for the pacific , there are computer models to analyze the consequences of an earthquake , based on years of observations of previous quakes and tsunamis for the indian ocean , there are no such models , according to vasily v titov , a research oceanographer with the oceanographic and atmospheric administration , based in seattle they assemble quite a bit of data to get the right information and the right warning message , he said of such models another difficulty is that countries that have experienced tsunamis in recent memory are set up with warning systems hawaii , for example , has warning sirens , and the weather radio network of oceanographic administration can also carry tsunami warnings nor is a tsunami obvious as it races across an ocean at hundreds of miles per hour in the open ocean , the wave may be only inches high boats on the ocean would feel almost nothing only when it hits the shallow water of a continental shelf does the wave rise to its destructive height dr mccreery , the honolulu center s director , said the initial estimate of the earthquake s magnitude , 80 , would have been likely to generate a local tsunami based on it being an 80 , we assumed the damage would be confined to sumatra and would be a local tsunami event , one that strikes shore within minutes of the event , he said we were n't overly concerned at that point that it was something larger but using another , sometimes more accurate method of measuring , dr mccreery said , the staff quickly determined that the magnitude had been closer to 85 , more intense , but still only borderline for generating more distant damage the center issued a followup bulletin but it was not until they saw news reports of casualties in sri lanka that all that changed dr mccreery spoke to the american ambassador to sri lanka , who wanted to know whether there were more giant waves expected then he had a conference call with a state department official and embassy staff in madagascar and mauritius to address potential threats headed their way , and how the local authorities might be notified but with no system in place , they would basically be scrambling the indian ocean and some other ocean basins do not have tsunami warning systems the pacific basin has had a wellconstructed warning system with instrumentation throughout the region and plans for communicating critical information since 1965 , dr mccreery said he said there have been frequent international discussions about improving systems for other oceans i know for certain after this event the entire global tsunami community will be looking for ways to implement better preparedness , he said one of the few places in the indian ocean that got the message of the quake was diego garcia , a speck of an island with a united states navy base , because the pacific warning center s contact list includes the navy finding the appropriate people in sri lanka or india was harder the experts knew they were set up for the wrong ocean , but over a holiday weekend , dr kong said , it s tough to find contact information i think they made their best efforts to contact as many people they thought they could get to , she said after pushing the button to send out the initial warning to contacts in the pacific , where about 90 percent of the tsunamis are observed , they 're trying to think of personally who might they call , who might then know who to call last year a book on another indonesian cataclysm , krakatoa the day the world exploded , by simon winchester , asserted that that volcano , which set off an even more deadly tsunami when it exploded in 1883 , was the world s first international disaster , because new undersea telegraph cables spread the news around the world within a few minutes with highspeed data links and the internet , it takes fewer minutes now , but if the information spreads wide , it does not always go deep
chicago , sept 8 it was a birthday gift from his girlfriend and brother , a boxseat ticket to a chicago cubs game against montreal at wrigley field caesar palacios , who is 27 , was surprised and delighted , being a lifelong cubs fan he had no idea , however none of them did that his 36 seat down the leftfield line was that seat it was about a halfhour before game time monday afternoon when palacios , with other friends and family the emeraldgreen grass of the field beyond them almost startlingly bright in the sunlight cheerfully showed an usher his ticket stub so he could locate his seat he then displayed it to several more ushers on his way down to the front row each time , he recalled , the usher would look at his ticket and said , oh , you have the bartman seat it was kind of eerie , palacios said later as he sat in the seat , on which 11 cubs' decals had been placed by fans , like flowers at a grave site i never dreamed i 'd be this close to history palacios , like most fans in chicago , and many people throughout the world this is no exaggeration knows what the bartman seat means and still means , even though nearly a year has passed on friday , the cubs and the florida marlins meet for the first time since that fateful national league championship series last october , when the cubs needed just five outs in game 6 to advance to the world series for the first time since 1945 it was then that chicago suddenly and unspeakably imploded , with some crucial assistance from steve bartman , a hapless 26yearold cubs fan the teams had actually been scheduled to play each other last weekend in miami , in a setting that would have been far less dramatic , but the games were postponed because of hurricane frances so the reunion will instead take place before a full house at wrigley , a doubleheader in which every pitch really will count because the cubs and the marlins are part of a fiveteam scramble for the nl wildcard spot , which brings with it a postseason invitation and another shot at the world series it s big , said cubs left fielder moises alou , one of the dramatis personae in the bartman episode every game is big everybody is so close we have to forget about last year we ca n't afford to remember it easier said than done coincidently , palacios , a mortgage banker from chicago but now living in fairfax , va , has a photo of bartman in his moment of infamy , framed on the wall of his office cubs fans , for certain , remember the date it was oct 14 that bartman , in a cubs cap and wearing earphones so he could listen to a broadcast of the game , stood and reached out for a foul fly ball hit by marlins second baseman luis castillo that was descending toward him at that moment , the cubs led the fourofsevengame nlcs , 32 , and had a 30 lead with one out in the top of the eighth and a marlins runner on second base they were agonizingly close to astounding all doubters , to making it to the world series and maybe even winning it for the first time since 1908 , a streak of futility that to cubs fans seems as interminable as the ice age alou hurried over from his position in left field and , next to the low brick wall that runs along the front row of seats , moved to snare the ball with his glove hand as it fell through the glare of the stadium lights instead , bartman got in the way , hoping to grab a souvenir , and perhaps even acting in a modicum of selfdefense after all , when you approach a runway to the stands in wrigley field , there are signs that read be alert for foul balls ! actually , bartman was n't the only fan to reach for the ball but he was the one who deflected it and kept a furious alou from catching it mark prior , the ace cubs righthander , was working on a fourhitter at that point and , somewhat unnerved , walked castillo a single made the score 31 and then came the blow that was deadlier than bartman s mishap an error by shortstop alex gonzalez on a potential doubleplay grounder by the time the inning was over , eight runs had scored and the marlins and the cubs were on their way to game 7 for good measure , the cubs lost that game , too , with kerry wood , the cubs' other ace , giving up seven runs in less than six innings of work wood had failed , and so had gonzalez , but it was bartman , and only bartman , who stood out after the fateful play in game 6 , he was showered with abuse , with obscenities and beer , and was escorted by security out of wrigley field , his jacket covering his face as if he were on a perp walk he received telephone death threats at the financial consulting firm where he works in suburban chicago , and his home was patrolled by police cars he issued one statement on the morning after game 6 , and has not been heard from since in any type of public forum the governor of illinois , rod blagojevich , knocked him the governor of florida , jeb bush , perhaps adding salt to the wound , offered bartman sanctuary in florida i had my eyes glued on the approaching ball the entire time and was so caught up in the moment that i did not even see moises alou , much less that he may have had a play , bartman s statement read had i thought for one second that the ball was playable or had i seen alou approaching , i would have done whatever i could to get out of the way and give alou a chance to make the catch john zillmer , bartman s brotherinlaw , said recently that , contrary to rumors , steve has not changed his appearance , other than that he s a year older no plastic surgery and whatever offers and gifts he s received and he s received some he s directed everything to the juvenile diabetes research foundation steve keeps a low profile , but he s not a hermit , zillmer added he probably wo n't surface publicly until the cubs get into the world series when that happens , i think the onus will be off him but until then , the cycle will just start all over again joe brodner , who runs a plastics company in chicago , was at game 6 against the marlins and was at last monday s game as well he had looked for , and found , the bartman seat and had taken pictures of himself , his wife and their two children sitting in it i was sitting in section 236 , in the rightfield stands , when that foul ball was hit , he said people were chanting 'five more outs ! ' someone was even selling world series towels , and i said i was going to get one of those , when bartman touched the ball like most other fans , i could have strangled him but they held everybody back now , after the smoke is cleared , and i hear the things that he s gone through , i feel sorry for bartman he did n't deserve all that i think almost any fan would have gone for that ball , too it s just instinct i think most cubs fans are forgiving , too steve gonzalez , who traveled with his girlfriend , dixie pineda , from portage , ind , for monday s game , said you ca n't blame it all on bartman , but he was a part of it , a big part of it i would n't have gone for the ball , not in that situation , not when you 're a cubs fan pineda laughed you would have gone for the ball , steve , she said i know you he smiled , and shrugged said alou it was n't the whole ballgame , but the marlins had been playing with a lot of good luck , and we had bad luck and when i was prevented from catching the ball , i think a lot of our players thought , 'here we go again' i know i did and i do n't blame the fan , alou added everybody wants a souvenir there s no manual that says how you should act when a foul ball is coming your way as it was , bartman never even got the ball it ended up in the hands of a lawyer seated behind him the lawyer auctioned the ball and it was purchased last december by the three chicagoarea restaurants that operate under the name of harry caray , the legendary cubs broadcaster who died in 1998 two months later , in a widely publicized ceremony if that s the word grant deporter , the managing partner of the restaurants , had the ball blown up but a part of the cover and a mess of strings and cork are under a glass case in all three restaurants people from all over the country all over the world , like germany and japan make pilgrimages to see the ball that they 've heard so much about , deporter said i bought it with the hopes that blowing it up would end the curse on the cubs if there is such a thing and it has n't hurt business we are 20 percent ahead in revenues this year over last year , about 15 million , deporter said and i attribute almost all of it to the ball , people clustering around the case to see it deporter said harry caray s has contributed thousands of dollars to the juvenile diabetes research foundation in bartman s name zillmer said bartman was pleased with this but he still will not go public steve was going through security to board a plane recently and showed his id to a woman agent , zillmer said she looked at it and looked up and said 'are you him \? you 're not him , are you \? ' he said he was , and went through the metal detector and disappeared again into the melancholy mists of chicago lore
las vegas , oct 26 in a windowless room behind the snack bar at the liberace museum , an elderly man with a thousand magic tricks up his sleeve could pocket 1 million or more this weekend but the man , sidney h radner , a retired rug salesman from holyoke , mass , is awfully downcast for someone of good fortune his eyes , set deep behind wirerimmed spectacles , invite sympathy , not envy my wife just says , 'take the money and run , ' said mr radner , who is 84 but i have such mixed emotions about it all mr radner , aka rendar the magician , owns one of the world s biggest and most valuable collections of harry houdini artifacts , including the chinese water torture cell , one of houdini s signature props from 1912 until his death in 1926 most of the items were given to mr radner in the 1940 s by houdini s brother , another escape artist who went by the stage name hardeen hardeen considered mr radner , then a student at yale with a reputation for jumping from diving boards in handcuffs , as his prot g until early this year , the collection was on display at the outagamie museum in appleton , wis , where houdini s father was the town rabbi in the 1870 s but after a rancorous falling out between mr radner and museum officials , the 1 , 000piece collection was packed up and shipped here , where it will be auctioned on saturday in the windowless back room at the liberace museum and on ebay sid is very sad about it , said jane merrill of capital recovery group , the auctioneers he really wanted it in a museum the sale , being promoted with true houdini hyperbole , is the buzz of the magic world auction materials quote a 1942 letter from hardeen , in which he described mr radner as owning the greatest collection of houdini material of anyone in the world mr radner says it is worth perhaps 4 million the auctioneers set the value at 2 million when in appleton , the collection was insured for 1 million david copperfield has inquired about several pieces , ms merrill said lance burton stopped by the liberace museum this week to be filmed by the history channel escaping from one of the houdini straightjackets a 94yearold woman from new jersey , dorothy young , who mr radner said was the last living person to have performed with houdini , is scheduled to arrive here this weekend houdini is still the most recognized name in magic , mr burton said it is very exciting to have all of his stuff here beneath the excitement , though , are anger , resentment and disbelief that the artifacts , kept together for nearly eight decades by hardeen and then mr radner , will be dispersed , perhaps never to be in one place again sometime past midnight on the morning after the auction , mr radner will convene a s ance , as he does every year on halloween , to mark the day that houdini died this time he will do so with an unusually heavy and conflicted heart , he said if there is any hope of ever bringing him back , this would be enough to agitate him , mr radner said maybe he will have something to say maybe he will say , 'do n't do it ! ' mr radner blames the outagamie museum , and in particular its executive director , terry bergen , for the turn of events though saddened to see the collection broken up , ms bergen said the outcome reflected the very little common ground that exists between the entertainment world and the museum world relations between mr radner and ms bergen turned sour last year when the museum decided it could not afford to renew the contract for the collection for 15 years , mr radner had lent the pieces for an annual fee , which by the last year of the contract , 2003 , had reached about 27 , 000 , ms bergen said \( mr radner said it was closer to 22 , 000 \) houdini lived here four years and his story is interesting , but there is a whole lot of other stuff that has gone on in appleton , ms bergen said in a telephone interview our county funding had been cut by 35 percent it was just ruinous for us we had to cut a lot of things mr radner said he was interested in working out a deal , and had even included a provision in his will that would have given the collection to the museum after he and other members of his immediate family had died but if there was ever hope of a compromise , it was crushed when the museum opened a new interactive exhibit on houdini in june the exhibit , intended for children , reveals how houdini pulled off one of his most storied illusions , known as metamorphosis , in which he was placed inside a trunk that was locked by his assistant houdini managed to get out of the trunk and switch places with the assistant ms bergen said the exhibit was a huge success , both in drawing visitors to the museum and in creating interest in houdini and his magic but the exhibit infuriated mr radner and many other magicians , who protested that the museum had broken the magician s code by revealing the secret ms bergen , who explained to mr radner that the trick was widely available on the internet and in libraries , said she nonetheless was bombarded with complaints from a small but angry group of magicians who branded her the houdini betrayer the stink over the metamorphosis was part of the stink over us not renewing the lease , ms bergen said it would not have happened if we had n't made sid mad and other people mad geno munari , a friend of mr radner who owns a chain of houdini magic shops , including several here in las vegas , said the appleton museum had taken advantage of mr radner s generosity by mr radner s reckoning , he had donated 750 , 000 worth of artifacts to the museum over the 15 years now , mr munari said , the museum figures it can get along without him and his collection the ultimate act of selfishness and disrespect was exposing the illusion , mr munari said the ill feelings have persisted ms bergen recently had a lawyer remind mr radner that he could not use museum stationery to promote his collection though mr radner was a founder of the houdini historical center , a division of the outagamie county historical society , which operates the museum , ms bergen said it was inappropriate for the letterhead of a nonprofit group to be used for commercial purposes mr radner said this week that he would not rest until he had removed the houdini historical center from the control of the outagamie county historical society and had relocated it far from the grip of ms bergen i do n't care where it goes , so long as it is not in appleton , he said she does n't know houdini from liberace she just knows dollars the curator of the houdini exhibit in appleton , kimberly louagie , said if houdini s wishes had been honored , there would be none of the bickering over the collection as ms louagie tells it , mr radner and his friends might not like what they hear should houdini reveal himself at the s ance on halloween according to his will , he wanted it destroyed , she said i would suspect that he does n't like the fact it is out there at all
there is no appropriate time to fire an icon , as channel 2 did friday to warner wolf for months , the station had hunted for his replacement , and it finally found one chris wragge , a houston sportscaster for an nbc affiliate wolf knew he would no longer be welcome at the station after aug 4 , the expiration date of his contract he was prepared to fulfill his deal as he was preparing his early sports report when he got a call at 3 pm friday telling him to go to the office of dianne doctor , the news director according to wolf , doctor said , we 're exercising your option and taking you off the air immediately he collected his belongings , handed in his id cards and went home it makes one wonder if the station kept wolf to help its sweeps ratings , which were up , and dispatched him once the sweeps ended wolf said yesterday that the departure was not his decision i did n't get to say goodbye , he said so i have to say goodbye to my loyal viewers through you so when is the right time to dismiss someone who has been a star in the market since 1976 \? when onair brain lock is commonplace \? when sportscasters transpose the scores of games \? when they give the wrong narration to highlights \? none of that happened to wolf , who seems as fixed in time as chuck scarborough , who has been a coanchor for the channel 4 news since the 1970 s , or as chris berman , the face of espn for 25 years they keep doing things as they always have because people like and accept them they keep doing them because the wannabes have not proved to be more appealing local newscasts crave broadcasters viewers would want to have in their homes that s why channel 2 recently hired roz abrams to be a coanchor for its 5 pm and 11 pm news programs with the inexplicably youthful ernie anastos that was why wolf lasted so long he has worn well for three and a half minutes at the end of a newscast , he was an enthusiastic , humorous presence whose 1970 s shtick carried him into the 21st century i'm looking forward to being on the air as soon as possible , he said i'm not retiring how many new york sports anchors truly stand out , both for what they say and how they say it \? channel 4 s len berman is witty , smart and subtle about his opinions he s the superior journalist among his local peers , and he fits the maximum into the minimal time he is given channel 9 s russ salzberg has a streetsmart style that resonates my favorite new guy in town , a broadcaster who grasps how to mix sports with wit and charisma , is otis livingston , who delivers the sports on channel 4 s earlymorning newscast even before he arrived in new york at channel 7 in 1976 , wolf was an innovator in the use of videotape he continued to create an entertaining sportscast long after espn s sportscenter made highlights on local newscasts virtually obsolete wolf s style , even the hoary let s go to videotape and boo of the week , and his horse race of the night always alerted you to his presence you knew he was in your tv set , unlike others who have come and gone on the station , like brett haber , a former espn anchor who replaced wolf for a time on the 11 pm broadcast but faded away wolf even survived his new dentures falling out during a sports report , managing to maintain his poise during the incident losing wolf means losing his knowledge and his name recognition at news conferences \( where he frequently asked the first question , the way helen thomas does at the white house \) , and his familiarity with athletes and owners his perspective cannot easily be replaced a few weeks ago , after a column in which i criticized a documentary on wilt chamberlain for not fully evoking his personality , wolf called to say he had chamberlain interviews in his archive that would have filled in the gaps of course he did in making her bad and badly timed decision , doctor must be hoping that wragge s youth and blond good looks will make viewers forget wolf , or somehow bring in new viewers but some people just do n't make it in new york a dozen years ago , wolf left channel 2 to return to his hometown , washington , to anchor the wusatv sportscasts management at channel 2 waited a year for bernie smilovitz to get out of his contract at a detroit station he was hyped as a newwave wolf funnier , more risqu , more 90 s but when smilovitz arrived in early 1994 , his stupid jokes , leering eyebrows and wagging tongue added up to an act that should have been termed an esthetic felony in the fall of 1996 , smilovitz was fired , one of several onair personalities dispatched in a station purge four months later , wolf returned to channel 2 , having been fired two years earlier in washington and spending time as don imus s substitute sports anchor on wfan radio wragge will , for quite a while , be known as the guy who replaced warner wolf

anger quickly flashed across dedrick finn s face as he endured a hard shove with 57 seconds to play against frustrated and beaten mississippi state with xavier ahead by 15 points , its ticket to the round of 16 already punched , retaliation for the foul seemed in order finn turned to talk trash at the bulldogs , but lionel chalmers , a senior guard , stepped forward , escorted finn to the freethrow line and advised him to turn the other cheek do n't do anything stupid it s over , finn , a sophomore guard , recalled chalmers saying to him on sunday just make the free throws an impressive weave of vignettes has testified to the maturity of the xavier musketeers \( 2510 \) , a seventhseeded team whose season two months ago was unraveling faster than the comebacks they have spun in the ncaa tournament examine the pivotal moments in xavier s run to its game with thirdseeded texas in atlanta tomorrow , and it is likely that chalmers and romain sato , another senior guard , were the guiding forces the backcourt duo refused to let xavier become rattled while sparking rallies from doubledigit deficits in the tournament s first two rounds down by 14 points in the first half against louisville , the musketeers won by 10 behind chalmers s 25 points and sato s 24 trailing no 2seeded mississippi state by 10 in the first half , xavier eventually won the game by 15 points sato slipped into a supporting role as chalmers scored 31 points when a player is in there and he s nervous and kind of tensing up a little bit , they 're the ones to step up , finn said they lead us , and we follow xavier s victory over mississippi state confirmed its status as the hottest team in the tournament in december , the musketeers lost to the bulldogs , 8270 , at starkville , miss they are on such a roll right now , mississippi state coach rick stansbury said stansbury said that if xavier continued to play as it did on sunday , it could win the national championship they 're the best team we 've played all year long , he said sudden reversals have become xavier s forte with a 109 record on jan 31 , the musketeers had been booed off their home court after a close loss to thenunbeaten st joseph s and had dropped successive games to richmond , george washington and dayton xavier s crosstown rival , cincinnati , ranked no 10 at the time , was next xavier s season turned with 273 seconds left in the game , when chalmers sank a fadeaway jumper for a 7169 victory the musketeers have won 15 of their last 16 games we were trying to find what we need to do , find the role that everyone needed to do , sato said once we found it , we played better basketball we started playing together everyone got on the same page like xavier , sato has spent most of his life as an underdog he is from bangui , the capital of the central african republic , and he went to dayton , ohio , as a high school senior in an exchange program he spoke five languages when he arrived , none of them english he has learned english mostly while in college , with a huge assist from his teammates now he speaks to high school classes in his new language and has his own web site he is on schedule to graduate in may , having majored in french i always say to myself , if i had to go back , i do n't think i would do it again , sato said i'm happy for the way i had to go i just keep thinking to myself , keep working harder , believe in myself , do n't give up in life whatever you want to do just focus and do it if you ca n't , you ca n't that s why this is so sweet chalmers also leads by example having graduated last may with a major in communication arts , he is taking graduate courses in counseling , which seems paradoxical , because coach thad matta has often had to take him aside to preach patience and poise against mississippi state , chalmers stayed cool , even when he did not score for nearly the first nine minutes of the first half no other team in the country deserves this as much as we do , chalmers said few of the 16 teams left in the tournament possess guards with the savvy , talent and composure of chalmers and sato with many underclassmen leaving teams early for the pros , and some high school seniors skipping college altogether , a seniorladen starting lineup has become a rarity in college basketball chalmers and sato represent an envied chemistry , one that has helped conferences like the atlantic 10 make a national impact that s why you see the parity , because teams like us have the seniors , matta said they started leading the team about a month ago , and that s been the big difference
it is time to come clean for most of my adult reproductive years , i avoided the mold that life has now rather ironically and unceremoniously cast me in that of a hausfrau in suburban new jersey for several years i did well as a newspaper reporter then i switched to editing law firm divas and eventually to teaching high school literature these were certainly not paths for the faint of heart , but now i can only imagine a life in the marines as the last stop on the career train of testing my mettle the thing i 've come to appreciate the most is that when you 're a housewife , there is always something or someone to take care of sorting the mail , emptying the dishwasher or ironing are the things you do on your way to handling the carpenters or figuring out why water is gushing from the secondfloor overhang or what is causing the circuit to randomly trip the central airconditioning system who knew , when i decided to leave teaching last summer in search of what was once a life with time and money , that months of unemployment would whip me into this unplanned marriage \? let s face it my mother , who has far more tendencies of the male hunter 1950 s provider type , has never been happier since she got a wife at 78 , she cheerfully toddles off to work while i sit with a cup of coffee , engage my disgust at the headlines and think about whether the bananas are mushy enough to make bread if only someone would pay me and cover my health benefits , i may have found my dream job oh , i know what you 're thinking but let me set the record straight my mother thrives on working outside the home in a different generation , she would have been a mergers and acquisitions lawyer i know this from watching her draw blood from appliance salesmen over expensive gadgetry there s one more thing when my mother was 67 , she retired from the importexport business the critical subtext was that my father was also retired so a year later , when the phone call came that the brotherinlaw of the son of her former business partner needed some office help , it was worth the daily drive to urban hoboken for my mother , who had seldom driven far beyond the borders of suburban essex county when my father died , going to work did much more for her than sitting with grief since my dad s death , we decided to share the house and the bills so , as the summer advanced , job applications remained unanswered and my guilt grew over the decision not to return to teaching , i did the only thing i could i listened as any good wife does to my mom s stories about the characters in the office or how she had figured out a printer problem or that her friend at work might have cancer and i headed directly to the back 40 , where i spent months landscaping with the belgian blocks i dug up on our property and using the last of the slate left over from a wall i had built earlier sometimes i headed to the local paint store , where i 've become one of the regulars it s hard to know whether it s my adoration of benny moore or the smartaleck commentary that keeps me coming back maybe it s the picture i 'll always have of a bearsized man standing behind the counter demonstrating a fauxfinish technique in the air lightly dab the sponge and blot off excess , he began as if holding a sea sponge in either hand remember , random gentle random gentle , he whispered , his hands alternating on an invisible wall you do n't want patterns or gobs indeed and there s nothing like hearing where you been \? when my pursuits of coppertopped caps for the deck posts or a chrome drainage assembly unit for the clawfoot tub have kept me away of course , i also spent hours with assorted electricians and carpenters , but please do n't tell the paint store guys in all these months , my mother has not only been a good provider , she has been a good friend as i continue to drive us into debt , she encourages me to find something that will give me satisfaction out of habit , i continue reading job postings for editors , writers , admin assistants , research associates i notice there s a run on cardiologists i think about what i 'll make for dinner and smile to think that i have finally gotten my mother , who loves chips , mozart and chocolate , to eat salmon and salad \( thank goodness for organic gorgonzola \) i'm knitting scarves like crazy and my family wonders if somewhere there s a cottage industry i think about cooking school and wonder how i will reinvent myself mostly , i think about how easy it is to feel invisible or unimportant when you live in a culture that rewards making money and you are n't yet , i know the names of the two men who alternate delivering our mail the plumbingsupply guy gives me a discount because i could have gone to home depot and did n't our german carpenters have eaten well on homemade sicilian pizza and bitter greens the post office clerks smile and cross their fingers when i send out a short story my octogenarian neighbor tells me about local history and how he misses his sister who died several years back none of this adds up to a whole lot of anything except a life a visible life
it was a leader board of familiar names five major tournament winners within six strokes of the lead and their presence seemed to promise a long afternoon s shootout with multiple contenders for the 2004 united states open but from the beginning , virtually all the top golfers who had positioned themselves to make a move in sunday s final round made no run at all at the eventual winner , retief goosen one by one , every contender but phil mickelson dropped back , with a few disappearing from the top rungs of the leader board the quickest descent belonged to the twotime united states open winner ernie els , who doublebogeyed the first hole at the shinnecock hills golf club and never recovered , shooting a 10overpar 80 els made just about every mistake in a stumbling round , but he was most inaccurate with his approach shots , which flew or bounded over green after green els came into sunday s round at 3under par and was paired with goosen , who began the day at 5under , but on the front nine , els shot a sixover 41 then he missed a fourfoot bogey putt on the 10th green to drop to eight over els , who finished second to mickelson at the masters in april , declined to speak to reporters after sunday s round while els was squandering his bid for a third open championship , jeff maggert was making another bid to win his first major title maggert birdied the opening hole to go to 2 under par , and though he bogeyed two of the next three holes , he was within striking distance of goosen at par after nine holes he seemed a likely candidate to challenge for the lead , since maggert came in with six top10 finishes in the open since 1994 on the unforgiving greens of shinnecock hills on sunday , maggert managed to post a final round of 72 , one of the best scores of the day , and his fourday total of 1overpar 281 put him in third place he also finished third at the 2002 open at bethpage black i turned on my television this morning and saw what was going on at the course , and i realized that it was going to be a little bit on the comic side today , maggert said afterward i knew we were going to see a lot of bogeys and some really stupid bounces of the golf ball i could n't afford to play defensively because i was trying to catch retief , but being aggressive was n't being rewarded either maggert called the speed and dryness of several greens sunday ridiculous , but he was one of the few , beside goosen , who had few major putting gaffes i just hit it and hoped , maggert said of his putting and i tried to get the ball on the front of the greens so it was easier to let them roll up to the hole but there was no magic to it it was so incredibly difficult any sane person can be the judge of how the greens played and realize that it s a little ridiculous but i do think i 've got a chance to win one of these i 've got another 8 or 10 years out here , and i think i 'll have some good chances to win there were others at the top of the leader board who faded quickly , including fred funk , who shot a 77 on sunday to fall to sixth place funk was paired with mickelson but he could not match mickelson s short game , which was brilliant until a crushing threeputt on the 17th hole phil actually spent the day trying to encourage me and pick up my spirits , funk said i had an early threeputt and he said 'hey , it s going to be like that all day it s just the way it is' he was great , but i could n't find a way to the hole fast enough shigeki maruyama , who started the day three strokes behind goosen , lost his chance at challenging goosen with several early bogeys and shot a 76 to finish fourth in a tie with mike weir , who also dropped four strokes in the first seven holes sunday weir did settle down thereafter , posting a 74 two other golfers who were considered likely contenders were sergio garc a and corey pavin , who were paired and began the day six strokes back of goosen but like so many others sunday , pavin and garc a were seemingly stunned by the pace and peril of the greens each had short game troubles early and did not recover , with pavin shooting a 79 to finish in a tie for 17th , while garc a shot an 80 to tie for 20th place
belmont park s annual springsummer meeting began yesterday with gygistar scoring a mild upset in the feature race , the grade iii westchester handicap but track officials were looking forward to a race at a different track , at pimlico in baltimore on may 15 , when smarty jones , the winner of the kentucky derby , tries to add the second jewel of racing s triple crown , the preakness stakes we 'd love that , said william a nader , the senior vice president of the new york racing association if smarty jones wins , this would be as big , if not bigger , than funny cide last year funny cide , a new yorkbred gelding , finished third in the belmont stakes in his attempt to become the first horse since affirmed in 1978 to complete the triple crown should smarty jones win the preakness , he would become the sixth colt in eight years to shoot for the triple crown in the belmont , which will be run june 5 and if smarty jones is going for the triple crown in this year s belmont , it gives him the opportunity to be the top money earner in the history of the sport , nader said smarty jones , a pennsylvaniabred who has won all seven of his starts , has earned 6 , 733 , 155 , with 5 million coming from a bonus awarded for sweeping the rebel stakes and the arkansas derby at oaklawn park and the kentucky derby if smarty jones can also win the preakness and the belmont , he will be awarded another 5 million bonus for sweeping the triple crown races , enabling him to eclipse cigar s record career earnings of 9 , 999 , 815 smarty jones would also become only the second unbeaten triple crown winner , after seattle slew in 1977 nyra officials are hoping smarty jones s modest pedigree and undefeated status would translate into a record crowd on belmont day the two largest crowds in belmont park history were for the last two runnings of the belmont stakes , both with triple crowns on the line two years ago , 103 , 222 people showed up and saw war emblem stumble at the start and finish eighth to a 701 shot , sarava last year , 101 , 864 fans braved a downpour and saw funny cide finish third and much like last year , people can relate to the story of this horse , nader said , referring to funny cide and smarty jones since affirmed became the 11th triple crown winner 26 years ago , nine horses have won the kentucky derby and the preakness only to fall short in the belmont stakes of course , smarty jones still has to win the preakness , nader said since 1997 , none of the five horses to win both the derby and the preakness faced fewer than nine challengers in the preakness smarty jones could face as few as six challengers in the preakness the other probable starters include three horses who ran in the kentucky derby the runnerup , lion heart , the cliff s edge and borrego and rock hard ten , eddington and water cannon preachinatthebar , who was also held out of the derby , is another possibility for the preakness bob baffert , who trains preachinatthebar , was quoted in yesterday s thoroughbred daily news as saying he probably would not decide until next week whether the colt will run
hempstead , ny , dec 13 coach herman edwards is concerned about what his players' dismal showing against one of the nfl s elite portends for the jets' hopes of making the playoffs and succeeding if they get there we 've got to beat a team like this if we 're going to be one of those teams , edwards said monday , referring to the steelers , who defeated the jets on sunday , 176 because if not , what happens to you is if you do get in the playoffs , you 're going to lose the first game , you 're going to be out that s not a lot of fun why even go \? you want to try to win it you just do n't want to get in there to be going i mean , that s like going to disneyland and saying you ca n't ride any rides the jets find themselves in a familiar position , dissecting the reasons they are not able to keep up with the league s best teams earlier this season , the jets struggled in losses to new england and baltimore those games against the defending super bowl champion and one of the league s most ferocious defenses offered the jets a chance to gauge their progress but in each game and again in pittsburgh on sunday the jets failed to make a play or two that might have turned the game in their favor we played three pretty good teams , i felt , in some stages of the season where you feel that you 've grown as a team , edwards said and this is a time where you want to take that next little step up to say we beat these guys you know when you do that , that s going to elevate you , it s going to elevate you , elevate your mindset we 've been in three of those games we have n't done it despite their failures , the jets \( 94 \) control their playoff fortunes because they hold a onegame lead over baltimore and denver for the fifth spot in the american football conference \( six teams make the playoffs from each conference \) if the jets and the ravens end the season with the same record , the ravens will hold a tiebreaker edge because of the jets' 2017 overtime loss to baltimore on nov 14 new england , which defeated the jets , 137 , on oct 24 , clinched the afc east division title and holds the second seeding position in the playoffs the patriots and the steelers have 121 records , but pittsburgh has the top seeding for now because of its victory over new england on oct 31 although pittsburgh and new england will most likely vie for homefield advantage in the postseason , edwards said it was important that the jets put together a string of solid performances in the final three games to establish momentum heading into the playoffs they will have to do so against three of the league s toughest offenses none of which is ranked lower than ninth in the nfl in games the next two weeks at giants stadium , they meet seattle \( ranked sixth \) and new england \( ninth \) , then they travel to st louis \( eighth \) for the season finale edwards said monday that the common denominators in the jets' losses to the conference s two top teams were sluggish offensive performances that failed to generate points \( a combined 13 points against the patriots and steelers \) turnovers \( a costly fumble inside the patriots' 20 , and three interceptions against the steelers \) and the defense s failure to shut down teams in key situations chief among those issues , edwards said , was improving the offense , which he said had not generated enough big plays against toplevel opponents we got to figure that thing out , edwards said when we figure it out , we 'll win games like that and i wo n't have to sit here and try to say , 'well , that s why we lost a game like this' i'm tired of talking about it players are tired of talking about it they want to win one let s go win one of these that sense of urgency was apparent monday in the jets' locker room , where players like chad pennington said that the playoffs , in essence , were beginning now we feel like as an offense we have to step up to the plate and make things happen , pennington said and not only just to win football games , but if we are going to be a playoffcaliber team , if we are going to be a championship team , we have to score points as an offense if you expect to win a championship scoring under 20 points a game , it s just not going to happen
in 41 years as a pundit , robert d novak has rarely shied from controversy as a syndicated columnist and fixture on cablenews shoutfests , mr novak has opined from the right about some of the biggest stories of his time he has been a stout cold warrior , a critic of israeli policies and a passionate defender of military veterans who criticized senator john kerry s vietnam war record but now mr novak , 73 , finds himself a central figure in perhaps the gravest confrontation between the government and the press in a generation , and he has been uncharacteristically circumspect with a federal judge having ordered two reporters to jail for refusing to name their sources to a grand jury investigating the disclosure of a covert cia officer , mr novak , whose column identifying the officer set off this showdown , has been under increasing pressure in recent weeks to explain his role but he determinedly maintains his own counsel on the cspan washington journal this month , he calmly swatted away one caller who asked how it felt to watch others face jail then , when queried by brian lamb , the program s host , about the matter , he referred dismissively to the reporters , judith miller of the new york times and matthew cooper of time magazine i do n't know why they 're upset with me , mr novak said they ought to worry about themselves i worry about myself the confrontation began when mr novak revealed the identity of the cia officer , valerie plame , in his column in july 2003 mr novak s column is not one for grand ideological pronouncements his stock in trade is whispered insidethebeltway tidbits , from an undoubtedly conservative and sharp point of view outing ms plame , the wife of joseph c wilson iv , a former diplomat who had written an oped article for the times the week before that was critical of the bush administration , was a prime one mr wilson had written that based on a trip he made to niger sponsored by the central intelligence agency , he thought some intelligence related to iraq s nuclear weapons program that the administration had relied on as a basis to go to war was twisted to exaggerate the iraqi threat mr novak responded in his column wilson never worked for the cia , but his wife , valerie plame , is an agency operative on weapons of mass destruction two senior administration officials told me his wife suggested sending wilson to niger it can be a crime to name a covert cia officer , and a federal grand jury and a special prosecutor have been pursuing administration officials who may have leaked the information to mr novak the investigators have also reached into the white house and drawn in other journalists as they seek information about conversations about ms plame although grand jury proceedings are secret , people called before them are free to talk about how they responded to grand jury subpoenas all five of the other reporters known to be caught up in the investigation have done that some testified , with what they said was their sources' blessings ms miller and mr cooper have been held in contempt for refusing to do so mr cooper and two colleagues at time wrote an article questioning the administration s motives for disclosing ms plame s identity ms miller conducted interviews for a potential article but did not write one but , mr novak has not revealed whether he was subpoenaed and if so how he responded he has said he is staying mum on the advice of counsel his office declined to make him available for this article and referred questions to his lawyer , james hamilton , who declined to comment lawyers for other reporters in the investigation say mr novak s role is a mystery it is inconceivable , they say , that he has not received a subpoena from the independent prosecutor , patrick j fitzgerald but they add that none of his possible responses naming his sources , objecting on first amendment grounds or asserting his fifth amendment right against selfincrimination seem to fit any plausible scenario in this case , given mr novak s few cryptic statements a spokeswoman for mr fitzgerald declined to comment a growing number of media ethics specialists , lawyers and journalists are criticizing mr novak as failing as a journalist by not outlining for the public his dealings with the investigation he has become part of the story , said lucy dalglish , the executive director of the reporters committee for freedom of the press he should disclose what s going on everyone else has geneva overholser , a professor at the university of missouri school of journalism and a former ombudsman for the washington post , added he s a journalist if he believes in reporting and truthtelling , it s time he did some of that ms miller and mr cooper have said that mr novak is legally entitled to name ms plame but , in an interview , mr cooper wondered about mr novak s professional courtesy it s bizarre and disappointing that he has n't said , 'judy and matt should n't go to jail , ' he said other journalists and legal experts scoff at the idea that mr novak should come forward , and they suggest that some criticism is coming from those on the left who do not like his political leanings what i see is a distaste for what novak did , for this whole sorry mess , and an antipathy towards the type of journalism he practices and a perception that he practices it on behalf of an administration many people do n't like , said edward wasserman , the knight professor of journalism ethics at washington and lee university but there s no upside to him talking there s nothing exculpatory he can say , nothing that he can do to ease the pressure off them representatives of the chicago suntimes , mr novak s home paper , and creators syndicate , which distributes his column , said they accepted mr novak s statement that his lawyer had told him not to comment steve huntley , editor of the suntimes editorial pages , said the calls on mr novak to talk were offensive it s simply wrong , and , to me , reprehensible , that colleagues in our profession would want to bring that kind of pressure on a journalist in his situation , mr huntley said christa robinson , a spokeswoman for cnn , said mr novak a coexecutive producer of capital gang , cnn s weekly political round table and a cohost of crossfire had taken questions about the plame matter on several cnn programs since then , ms robinson said , he has reiterated to us and to everyone else that there is nothing more he will say to us on advice of counsel she added , it is not his work for cnn that is under scrutiny cnn has covered the developments in the inquiry , mentioning in its reports that it began with a column by mr novak , whose connection to cnn is always detailed among the programs that have devoted segments to the issues are lou dobbs tonight , ' reliable sources and newsnight with aaron brown but on mr novak s regular programs , the issue is rarely discussed mr novak became a columnist 41 years ago , when after stints at the associated press and the wall street journal , the columnist rowland evans jr chose him to cowrite a political column since 1993 , mr novak has held the sole byline on the thriceweekly column , syndicated to more than 300 newspapers although mr novak is a conservative , he does not move in lockstep with the bush administration leading up to the invasion of iraq , he had been among the most vocal conservatives against the war as the justice department opened an investigation in the fall of 2003 , mr novak wrote a column on oct 1 , explaining why he had chosen to name ms plame he said that he did not receive a planned leak , that the cia did not warn him that the disclosure would endanger anyone and that it was not much of a secret he repeated these comments on several television appearances around the same time since then , he has been largely silent , and he has said nothing about his dealings , if any , with mr fitzgerald , the independent prosecutor his friends say that the reticence cannot be easy for mr novak but that they are not surprised by it mr novak broke his hip the morning after the first presidential debate this fall writing from his hospital bed , he refused to let the injury end his column s 41year unbroken streak if his hip hurts , if he s concerned about the independent prosecutor , it s just not imaginable he would complain about it , said tucker carlson , who takes up the banner of the right with mr novak on crossfire so observers can only speculate about whether mr novak received a subpoena and what he did there are three basic possibilities , lawyers say he may have talked , but that would run counter to his answer to a student in a speech at lynn university in boca raton , fla , in october 2003 as reported by the south florida sunsentinel , mr novak said , i'm not going to tell them who my original leak was that 'd be the end of my career , he added if you ca n't protect your sources , you 're finished but mr novak has at least once named a confidential source , disclosing in 2001 that robert p hanssen , the former fbi agent convicted of espionage , had been one several years earlier if mr novak was subpoenaed and has not talked , he may have objected by citing the limited protection available to reporters wishing to protect their sources under the first amendment but there is no reason to think he would have fared any better than ms miller and mr cooper judge thomas f hogan of federal district court in washington , who is supervising the grand jury , has held both reporters in contempt the final possibility is that he has asserted his fifth amendment rights against selfincrimination but lawyers involved in the investigation think that is unlikely because they agree he is not at risk of prosecution under the 1982 law that prohibits disclosing the identities of covert officers the law applies only to people who have authorized access to classified information and to others , like journalists , only if they engage in a pattern of such disclosures and in a comment after a speech this month reported in the capital times , of madison , wis , mr novak said , to the regret of many people , i am not a criminal target
if president bush had been talking a year ago , after the fall of baghdad , his speech at the army war college last night might have sounded like a plan for moving forward he was able to point to a new united nations resolution being developed in consultation with american allies , not imposed in defiance of them , and to a timetable for moving iraq toward elected selfgovernment he talked in general terms of expanding international involvement and stabilizing iraq but mr bush was not starting fresh he spoke after nearly 14 months of policy failures , none of them acknowledged by the president , which have left iraq increasingly violent and drained washington s credibility with the iraqi people and the international community they have been waiting for mr bush to make a clean break with those policies he did not do that last night the speech reflected the fact that mr bush has been backtracking lately , but he did not come close to charting the new course he needs to take his five steps toward iraqi independence were merely a recitation of the tasks ahead mr bush plans a series of addresses on iraq before june 30 it was impossible not to wonder last night why he had waited until the security situation in iraq had become disastrous , until americans had begun losing faith in his leadership and , indeed , until just 37 days before a crucial new phase begins the transition to iraqi sovereignty it s regrettable that this president is never going to admit any shortcomings , much less failure that s an aspect of mr bush s character that we have to live with but we cannot live without a serious plan for doing more than just getting through the june 30 transition and then muddling along until the november elections in the united states mr bush has yet to come up with a realistic way to internationalize the military operation and to get iraq s political groups beyond their current game of jockeying for power and into a real process of drafting a workable constitution the draft of the united nations resolution that circulated yesterday was disappointingly sketchy on these points it contains the phrases of international support like references to a multinational military force without committing the security council to do anything in particular the draft endorses a continued americanled military presence in iraq for at least a year beyond june 30 , but it does not ensure expanded international participation the resolution envisions that after the united nations names the interim government leaders , it will proceed cautiously , and only when it deems it safe to do so there are ways mr bush can achieve the clean break that is so essential a good start , first put forward by the center for american progress in washington , is to go much further in internationalizing the next phase of the iraq operation mr bush could convene a summit meeting to create a multinational group to oversee the transition the un security council could step up its participation by appointing an international high representative who would actively supervise the interim iraqi government until the first round of elections senator john kerry , the presumptive democratic nominee , has proposed restructuring the military force in iraq under nato , with an american commander mr bush should pursue that at the nato summit meeting next month the president still has a number of speeches left to deliver before june 30 we hope he will use them to come up with a more specific plan , to stop listing the things we already knew needed to be done and to explain to us how he intends to do them an acknowledgment of past mistakes would be nice
fourteen years ago , chad a alexander took his bassoon and headed east from a small california town , assumed a coveted place at the juilliard school and began training for a job in one of the country s great orchestras everything seemed possible , he said recently going to juilliard makes you feel very special and privileged and in awe of the history of the school he graduated and quickly won a threeyear position in the new world symphony , a training orchestra based in miami but his career fizzled with a succession of fruitless auditions , dwindling freelance gigs and mounting debt he needed a day job but a juilliard degree had not prepared him for much besides playing when you go to a conservatory , something as specialized as that , you 're basically from a different planet , he said he cast a wide net , but the only outfit that offered him a job was an insurance company in long beach , ny , on long island he played a few jobs in the evenings but he was earning his living as a customer service representative last may , mr alexander finished out of the running in yet another audition , for the metropolitan opera orchestra , and saw his finances on a precipice so in what he called a heartbreaking moment , he sold his bassoon for 5 , 300 to pay credit card bills it was time , he said it got to the point where you 're just tired of being poor now he lives in phoenix and works as an assistant underwriter eric crambes is another former resident of planet juilliard a charming french violinist and a native of lyon , mr crambes studied at the yehudi menuhin school in britain as a child and then with the teacher tibor vargas , living at his home in switzerland ready for a change at 17 , he broke away from mr vargas and came to juilliard since graduating , he has moved smoothly into a flourishing career he has forged a role as a fillin concertmaster with respected european orchestras , and he commissions pieces , directs a music festival and plays as a soloist with dancers from the new york city ballet i do n't want to label myself , he said i have a very large spectrum of activities , and i like it that way both mr alexander and mr crambes graduated from juilliard 10 years ago their stories suggest just two of the many varied paths that superlatively trained musicians can travel after leaving one of the world s premier conservatories , which next year celebrates its 100th anniversary to give a more comprehensive picture of those paths , arts leisure took a close look at the class of 1994 , whose members are now solidly in their 30 s and mostly embarked on careers and family life the results suggest how hard it can be to live as a classical musician in a society that seems increasingly to be pushing classical music to the margins , even as juilliard and scores of other music schools pour out batches of performers year after year orchestras and chamber ensembles are under increasing financial pressure as subscriptions have dropped and government arts financing has dried up , the recording industry has shrunk and the median age of classical audiences is not getting any younger sometimes the struggle is just too much , and many drop out , perhaps disillusioned with a oncesacred endeavor that has come to seem a cold , unforgiving trade others , like mr alexander , are simply sick of the financial grind the low pay , the lack of benefits , the scramble for work but many others make it , and what also came clear from the analysis of this class were the high levels of dedication many of the graduates maintain and the satisfactions and excitement of expressing oneself through one of the purest forms of communication the making of music the class of 1994 includes justine flynn , a frenchhorn player who has battled alcoholism and , after bouncing from job to job in and out of music , now plans to become a tax preparer mark inouye , a baseballloving , happygolucky trumpeter with the houston symphony gwen appel , a clarinetist who gave up the grind of publicschool teaching for a diamond grader s job at tiffany s and ittai shapira , an israeli dynamo with a flourishing solo violin career they were among the 44 instrumentalists who graduated in 1994 , excluding pianists , who generally follow a distinct career path of their own of those , 36 were traced eight could not be found they have left little trace in google and none at the juilliard alumni office , all of which suggests that their involvement in music has also dwindled at least 12 are out of professional music performance eleven have fulltime orchestra jobs another , a cellist , recently quit the hong kong philharmonic to move back in with his parents in dayton , ohio , and audition for american orchestra jobs four are freelancers who survive by teaching five more consider themselves fulltime freelancers or chamber musicians three consider themselves mainly soloists all of those now outside music have struggled to come to terms with their new identities surrender can be a wrenching adjustment for people who have lived their whole lives in the intimate embrace of an instrument and whose talent brought them glory at a young age like many juilliard graduates , ms appel , the clarinetist , was burdened with debt after graduation 28 , 000 in student loans then still using her maiden name , santiago , she taught music in new york public schools to support herself and pay off her loans \( juilliard s tuition now runs 22 , 850 a year \) but the grind kept her from practicing i found it very depressing , she said it really had nothing to do with what i was doing before she quit her job , went back to practicing for auditions and married but something had changed i did n't have that drive anymore to practice four or five hours a day , she said deep down , she knew that the chances of landing a good orchestra job were small i was n't in denial about it some people are i see people struggling , close to 30 i just did n't want to live that way answering a longstanding interest , ms appel took a sixmonth diamond and gem appraisal course in 2001 and went to work at tiffany s as a diamond grader and saleswoman \( she is now on maternity leave \) she still plays as an amateur in chamber groups and community orchestras and as with many of her classmates who quit professional playing but kept up with the instrument , the experience proved liberating the less stress i had with it , the better i sounded , she said sometimes it sounds better than when i was practicing four hours a day the violin is an easier instrument than the clarinet to ride to stardom , and three of ms appel s violinist classmates have managed to do just that mr crambes nicholas eanet , who is one of two concertmasters in the metropolitan opera orchestra and mr shapira what many of the juilliard class have learned over the last decade is that when it comes to making a career , talent is rarely the most important quality it takes discipline , focus and energy and connections , often formed at juilliard at juilliard i met a lot of people that i still work with , mr crambes said it s a very important part of our job , to have relations with people relationships emerge not so much from class membership as from studying with the same teacher or playing in the same groups few of the members of the class of 1994 have kept in close touch , although a number were aware of what others were doing several reconnected recently after the suicide of a contemporary at juilliard mr shapira , represented by the international management group s touring department in london , performs around the world , and he gave the premiere of a piece by shulamit ran at his carnegie hall debut last year he has issued a dozen cd s , produced concerts , toured with the jazz pianist dick hyman and started the ilona feher foundation , which supports young israeli violinists this is my passion , he said as a student , mr shapira said , he did not pay much attention to teachers who talked about a changing music world i practiced and did what i was told , he added but he has learned just because you play really well , he said , that s not enough you need vision , you need persistence , you need passion for what you do , and you need to provide something unique i 've formed relationships with conductors and producers we found out what we like to do with each other in a changing market rather than be the missing part of a puzzle , you can create a puzzle around you mr shapira , who still lives four blocks from juilliard , credits the conservatory with giving him a solid musical foundation and a base of operations for a few weeks every year , he plays with the group concertante , which consists of juilliard grads the key to enjoying what i do is the focus that i thank juilliard for , he said , but also variety , versatility for many students , juilliard was a rude awakening they often arrived as minicelebrities in their musical communities , perhaps the winner of a local competition or the best player in town and they joined a group of people just as accomplished , just as driven and often just as unprepared for the tough job market they would someday face when you 're 12 , said matthew herren , an accomplished cellist who moved last year to lawrence , kan , where his partner got a job , no one says , 'you 're going to have to carry that thing on the b train to queens to do some cash job for 75 bucks ' it was a hard fall for ms flynn , the horn player , an engaging woman with an explosive laugh ms flynn said she grew up with a young mother in a singleparent household and felt the burden of providing her with emotional support for me , music was my religion , she said it was my reason for being the rest of my life , i was n't so crazy about when i got accepted and was 18 , it was sort of like a dream coming true , she said of juilliard i'm going to go there , and it s going to be beautiful and wonderful but she hated juilliard from the start it was cold , she said it was professional that s what it s supposed to be i was not ready for that before , music had provided a sense of belonging to something greater than herself i got there , she said , and the message i received was , 'it s a business , kid ' the drugs and drinking came in the first two years there ms flynn took a year off and came back , more focused on the horn after graduation , she went back to her original home in portland , ore , with hopes of working on a pilot arts program for public schools , knowing deep down that a real go at a career would have meant staying in new york but she was searching for something else she described her questions at the time how can i be useful as a musician \? what s my purpose \? what s my point \? i was very conflicted about being a classical musician in the years since , ms flynn has worked as a groundskeeper at an arboretum on long island , played fourth horn in the new mexico symphony , received a master s degree in composition from wesleyan university , composed , played horn and trumpet in bands , shaved her head , directed a choir in albuquerque and most recently taught band and chorus at a school outside phoenix ms flynn , who said she became sober two and a half years ago , recently took a tax preparation class i got an a , she said , laughing it shows i can do something else other than play the french horn over thanksgiving she moved back to portland , where she said she had been warmly welcomed by old friends and was applying for jobs preparing returns i feel my life is better than it s ever been , she said i have hope , hope in the sense i do n't have to be real specific what my life has to look like i have an opportunity to live it the sorts of questions ms flynn asked about the relevance of music applied to many of her classmates , who sometimes wondered what point there was in playing the same war horses over and over , to what seemed to be inexorably aging audiences some sought a way to make music more immediately and directly relevant to the world around them , like rivka gottlieb , a british harpist who was buffeted by a bitter custody battle and family illness before discovering music therapy as a career she has just finished postgraduate training in using music in psychological counseling and teaching the disabled from the guildhall school of music and drama in london to be able use to music as a tool to help people it s something i had always dreamed of , ms gottlieb said alanna honor describes herself as one of those people who needed stability and a sure way to pay the rent after graduation she taught viola students through her time at juilliard , earned a public school teaching credential and now teaches 200 third , fourth and fifth graders in the ossining , ny , school system it is a job she clearly loves ms honor , known as alanna wheatley at juilliard before she married , still practices and plays community recitals the way for me not to get bitter or depressed is to keep playing , she said i had to create my own reality and performance venues you get rejected and ca n't take it personally you have to create your own success and play for yourself primarily then it does n't matter if it s not to someone s liking juilliard s uniquely highpressure atmosphere , its fame and the brilliance of its teachers provoke contradictory feelings about the place from its offspring some alumni complain that it failed to prepare them for orchestra playing or teaching , breadandbutter work for musicians , or for the practical aspects of running a career or that it squelched creativity and individuality still , many said that their juilliard years were among the happiest of their lives , a time of intense musical development with beloved teachers and a source of lifelong musical collaborations juilliard s president , joseph polisi , said he was not surprised by the number of undergraduates who do not have performance careers they came in as 17 or 18yearolds , he said in an interview they 're very talented , they 're very focused , but at the same time they are becoming young adults and finding themselves in ways that may not have anything to do with music yet he acknowledged the prime goal was to create excellent performers over the last decade , the school has developed courses in how to shape careers or teach , but they are often electives it requires at least one class a term in the humanities , which most students barely tolerate at the same time , juilliard has an obligation to create a sense of excellence by having a critical mass of students approaching professional level , mr polisi said we 're providing the curriculum , the tools and the experience to have a shot at this incredibly competitive profession , he said but there is no guarantee when asked how he expected a typical class to turn out , mr polisi said , i want them to be at peace with themselves and with whatever they are doing with their art mr inouye , the trumpeter , seems to have arrived at that point mr polisi recalled him as the young man who used to joke about turning juilliard s open spaces into a beach volleyball court mr inouye has a wry take on the laments of classical musicians he tells this joke how do you get a musician to complain \? give him a job how do you keep him complaining \? give him a better job some of those interviewed who travel from gig to gig like modern troubadors welcomed the variety but yearned for the stability of an orchestra orchestra players said they liked the stability but felt stifled mr inouye defies his own joke when i get tired of music , it 'll be the end , he said , i love it all i need is one person to inspire me or push me or find motivation from , he said of orchestra playing mr inouye arrived at juilliard with valuable perspective he had spent two years as a civilengineering major at the university of california , davis it exposed me to other people , other things , other backgrounds , other ways of thinking , he said he is now playing principal trumpet in the houston symphony while on sabbatical from his permanent post as second trumpeter in the san francisco symphony i always said i wanted to get a job in a national league baseball city , he said but the giants ! that s the team i grew up with in the end , maybe going to a conservatory is like being a compulsive gambler it is one big bet , but the drive to study music is so blinding , and doing anything else so inconceivable , that young players are oblivious to the risk sometimes it is hard to determine whether they are driven by singlemindedness or they live in selfdenial once at juilliard , they discover the inherent paradox of being a classical musician you are called on to be expressive , imaginative , creative , somehow in touch with the mystical reaches of art , an individual but you are also called on to ply a craft with exceeding skill , meshing a complex of minute physical activities in the service of black markings on a page and the composers who wrote them , often submerging yourself in the crowd and you do it all with the purpose of making a living inevitably , many will be disillusioned some , enough so to leave the profession but every one of those graduates has an indelible stamp even if my instrument was destroyed , said nora mcinerney fuentes , a violinist who works in public relations for timewarner , the gifts that i was given and what i 've done with them no one can take them away from me music correction december 19 , 2004 , sunday an article last sunday about the careers of members of the juilliard class of 1994 misspelled the surname of a violinist who taught eric crambes , a class member , before he entered juilliard he was tibor varga , not vargas
svejk \? svejk who \? or is it svejk what \? most americans are likely to be puzzled by the word because the good soldier svejk , the czech writer jaroslav hasek s novel about a selfdescribed idiot named svejk who bumbles his way through the first world war , is mired in the category of greatest books never read or hardly read by americans yet the 1920 s novel continues to have an astonishing afterlife onstage in colin teevan s current production of svejk , stephen spinella makes the hero an endearing fool and miraculously keeps us guessing about the question at the heart of the character is svejk so smart he s acting stupid , or so blessedly stupid he survives as if he s smart \? bertolt brecht transplanted svejk to world war ii in one of his lesser plays , robert kurla turned the novel into an opera in 1957 , and just last year vaclav havel praised its universality the czechs have adopted the term svejkism \( extreme passivity \) , much as americans have catch22 in fact , the good soldier svejk is commonly cited as an ancestor of joseph heller s catch22 and many other antiwar novels in 1996 the new york public library named hasek s work one of the most influential books of the past 100 years how can a book that still sends out such ripples be so little known today \? the simple answer is that the novel does n't translate well , to english or to other genres the only easily available english version has such stilted language that reading it is a slog through 752 pages and mr teevan s play , trying desperately to compress svejk s picaresque story for the stage , is antic and inventive but has little power to grip an audience yet the play s intellectual energy and the novel s continued resonance suggest how deep a nerve hasek touched his comic hero highlights the illogic of war so brilliantly that svejk s character has been absorbed into western culture , speaking to many generations and their different wars svejk may be a simpleton , but there is nothing else simple about him , including his name it is pronounced shvake , and sometimes spelled schweik a humble man who spends his time drinking in his local pub and selling dogs , svejk proudly admits that he s an idiot he has been certified one by doctors , even if other doctors decide his idiocy is a ruse and send him to war in the army , svejk follows orders so scrupulously that when he is tossed off a train carrying him to the front , he decides to walk there , taking the most circuitous route possible hasek s piercing satire comes from the confrontation of this ordinary man with the chaos of war , even if that chaos is cloaked in military discipline hasek had his own meandering story he was a sometime drifter , a sometime journalist , a bigamist and a relentless practical joker \( as editor of the magazine animal world , he invented new creatures and passed them off as real \) like his character , hasek was drafted into the austrian army during the war , and like most czechs resented fighting for the austrohungarian empire that controlled his country he began publishing the good soldier svejk in 1920 , and had written four of the six volumes planned when he died in 1923 , at 39 the book may stop short , but it is a relief to get to page 752 in the clunky 1970 s translation by sir cecil parrott , once the british ambassador to czechoslovakia but no literary stylist and the tangled politics of the czechs , austrians and hungarians is just one of the elements likely to be lost on englishlanguage readers hasek scholars agree that the dialects given to various characters indicate their status , with a complexity that is virtually untranslatable a more recent translation of the first volume , by zenny k sadlon and mike joyce , is far more fluent \( it is distributed as a printondemand book , easily available online \) mr sadlon has translated the next volumes , which are being edited , but have not been scheduled to appear yet really , you just have to speak czech to get svejk in some visceral way but as mr teevan s play reveals , it s easy to admire the concept of svejk the problem with his ambitious , lucid work is that svejk remains a symbol despite mr spinella s likable performance tall and gangly , mr spinella looks so wrong for the role \( another character actually refers to svejk as the little man \) that his disarming presence is a triumph of acting over natural physique his mouth hangs open he speaks in a singsongy voice occasionally we see glimpses of what might or might not be some shrewd intentions are you some kind of idiot \? he is asked yes , i am , he answers cheerfully yet any sense of character is dissipated by frantic action on a stage with scarcely any props , actors race on and off playing multiple roles and occasionally pop their heads out from trap doors in the floor the play might have worked better if mr teevan had ruthlessly pared down the novel and not tried to reflect its unwieldy scope this svejk is smoothly directed by dalia ibelhauptaite , who also directed the version produced five years ago in london the war in iraq should have made the play s themes more resonant today , but only once does a scene leap out with a ferocity that seems haunted by feelings about the current war a cat , played by chip persons in white tie , tails and clawed gloves , looks at svejk and says to a canary , he may be an idiot but he s our superior and we must trust that our superiors know what they are doing there s a war on then the cat kills the canary because svejk has opened its cage michael moore could n't be blunter about the folly of blindly following the leader in that fully realized scene , it is possible to see how hasek s themes echo through the past century , even if his novel was not the direct influence on books like catch22 or kurt vonnegut s slaughterhousefive that many blithe claims make it seem last week mr vonnegut said through his longtime agent that svejk had no impact on slaughterhousefive , an entirely credible statement mr vonnegut s hero , billy pilgrim , has none of svejk s idiocy there is something svejkian , though , about heller s yossarian , the ordinary guy trapped in the twisted logic of army regulations yossarian is smart enough to want to escape war by pretending he s crazy which makes him sane enough to be kept in the army , being shot at like an idiot heller , who died in 1999 , told various interviewers that c line and kafka were his most powerful influences and that svejk was just a funny book but hasek s attitude toward the lunacy of war was definitely in the air , shared by writers like heller and mr vonnegut both were veterans of world war ii whose novels about their experiences appeared in the 60 s and were embraced by readers living through the vietnam years while waiting for a better translation , it may be best to regard the good soldier svejk as the 20th century s great template for comic antiwar novels , and hasek as the most prescient of social observers svejk runs through dec 5 at the duke on 42nd street critic s notebook correction november 23 , 2004 , tuesday a critic s notebook article on wednesday about the continuing influence of the czech novel the good soldier svejk misspelled the surname of the composer who wrote an opera based on it in 1957 he was robert kurka , not kurla

amazon changed the face of ecommerce categories like music and videos simply by entering those markets now the dvd rental industry is shifting course on just the rumor that amazon will offer a competing service and although some investors have not been thrilled at that prospect , more consumers will probably be pleased enough to join the market netflix , the leading online dvd service , recently dropped its prices 18 percent , to 18 a month for unlimited rentals , after its chief executive said he learned that amazon would soon offer a competing service \( amazon refused to confirm the rumor last week \) blockbuster quickly followed suit , cutting its price to 1750 from 20 the other key player in the market , walmartcom , the online service from walmart stores , said last week that the company was evaluating its own pricing strategy , having gone from offering the lowest to the highest price in a matter of about 10 days amazon offered no details on when or even if it might offer movie rental service but the company s chief financial officer , tom szkutak , said in a conference call with journalists on thursday that dvd rental is a business we 're well positioned to do we can afford to offer low prices , mr szkutak said our customer acquisition costs would be low to none , given amazon s traffic to match the services of competitors , though , amazon would likely have to open distribution centers throughout the united states a strategy it has largely eschewed since early 2001 , when it began shutting huge warehouses filled with goods it owned and started relying more on retailers and distributors to ship products on its behalf the company maintains six regional shipping warehouses mr szkutak said the company did not expect to open any new distribution centers in the coming months still , amazon could rely on a network of vendors for dvd distribution , much as walmart has done to supplement its 14 dvd warehouses the cost of building a movie rental library alone could daunt some investors , said mark s mahaney , an analyst with american technology research , a san francisco investment firm mr mahaney noted that netflix spent 80 million in the first nine months of this year simply acquiring dvd s 10 million more than amazon s capital expenditures for the past year netflix has about 25 , 000 movie titles if you 're talking about doubling amazon s capital expenditures , that s something i 'd have to think about , mr mahaney said when asked if he thought the idea made sense for amazon it 'd obviously benefit them from a gross margin perspective , though amazon s gross profit margins have decreased steadily in recent years , to about 24 percent , as the company has cut shipping costs and dropped prices by contrast , mr mahaney said , gross margins for online dvd rentals are 40 percent to 50 percent while amazon s entry into the market , let alone its success , is far from certain , rumors of the move stunned netflix investors , who have already seen their shares drop from a oneyear high of nearly 40 in february to about 17 this month that decline was partly in response to blockbuster s dvd rental service , which made its debut in august but when reed hastings , netflix s chief executive , announced the price cut and exposed amazon s putative dvd rental initiative , his company s shares dropped again , to just over 10 \( netflix closed at 980 on friday \) mr hastings remains composed outwardly at least at the prospect of simultaneously competing against the world s most powerful retailer , the world s most successful movie rental company and the internet s most vaunted merchant it s going to be a much more competitive market than we ever expected , he said but the competition will improve consumer value , which will mean more consumers renting movies online netflix is in a good position to compete , mr hastings said , because it is profitable , it has 175 million in the bank and it has 22 million subscribers , by far the most in the market the company s revenue reached 142 million in the most recent quarter , 93 percent more than the same period a year earlier despite its lower prices , mr hastings said , netflix will remain profitable because it can continue to add subscribers and thereby make more efficient use of existing inventory it is a position that some analysts openly doubted when downgrading the company s shares even if amazon enters the market , however , netflix may have time to add customers mr hastings said one crucial aspect of the online dvd rental business was widespread distribution of warehouses , which makes overnight delivery possible it has taken netflix six years to build 29 distribution centers enough to offer overnight delivery to nearly 90 percent of the country s prospective customers but blockbuster has thrived even without such broad capability for overnight delivery the company has 10 distribution centers , covering about half of the nation for overnight shipment , yet it says it is on track to reach 500 , 000 rental subscribers by the end of the year netflix took more than three years to reach that number of customers shane evangelist , senior vice president of blockbuster online , said that like netflix , his operation could remain profitable at the lower price , particularly next year when blockbuster stores begin shipping videos to customers who rent online we 've got 'top gun' in 6 , 000 stores , mr evangelist said we bought it , we 've rented it , it s fully amortized , but it s not sold out every week we can ship it from the store , but also rent it online mr evangelist said the company would be able to route the customer s online order to a store in a given region that has the requested title available so you start to see how this becomes pretty big in optimizing our inventory , he said walmartcom has been quietly building its dvd rental service since its debut in june 2003 kevin swint , walmartcom s director of entertainment and photo , would not disclose the number of dvd rental subscribers the company has , but he said that business had grown beyond our expectations and despite the price cuts from

richard a clarke , the former counterterrorism chief in president bush s national security council , said on thursday that his former boss , condoleezza rice , had a radically different interpretation from his of the events surrounding the attacks of sept 11 , 2001 , even though they basically agreed on the facts in a telephone interview hours after ms rice completed her testimony before the commission investigating the attacks , mr clarke described a white house operation that had been pointedly and repeatedly warned of a mounting terrorist threat but did little to address it there s broad agreement on the facts , mr clarke said , and a massively different interpretation mr clarke , a veteran of four administrations who advised ms rice on terrorism and computer security , ignited a furor last month when he testified that president bush and his aides had failed to take action to thwart al qaeda and then , after the fact , sought immediately to link the sept 11 attacks to iraq mr clarke s testimony coincided with the release of his book , against all enemies , which has become required reading in washington political circles the white house has sought to portray him as selfpromoting and unreliable but ms rice who had asked mr clarke to stay in his position from the clinton administration , for the sake of continuity , she said refrained from directly criticizing him in her testimony mr clarke , whose name was repeatedly on the lips of ms rice and her questioners , kept a relatively low profile on thursday he limited his statements to a few interviews with print journalists and an appearance on abc news , which has hired him as a consultant on terrorism as other television networks fumed over the lack of access to mr clarke , who had been hired by abc before his testimony before the commission , peter jennings , the abc anchor , remarked on his network s good fortune , saying it had not necessarily expected that he was going to make the kind of news that he did when he appeared before this commission mr clarke described ms rice s presentation as generally reasonable , even as he pointed out what he called inconsistencies in it for example , he noted ms rice s account that she held 33 meetings of the socalled principals committee , and that none focused on al qaeda , the terrorist organization believed responsible for the attacks while ms rice insisted that she had not placed terrorism on the back burner , mr clarke differed i say that indicates it was not a priority , he said similarly , mr clarke noted ms rice s assertion that president bush had been briefed 40 times by the director of central intelligence , george j tenet , on intelligence reports about al qaeda s activities what does a person do in this situation \? mr clarke said the only thing the president does is , in may , he says , 'i want to stop swatting flies' but there s no evidence that he did anything he keeps getting these meetings about the imminence of the threat but he does n't seem to be doing anything about it asked if ms rice s testimony had offered any surprises , mr clarke said he was perplexed that she had resisted mobilizing domestic resources even after a meeting on july 5 , 2001 , in which she met with him and andrew h card jr , the white house chief of staff , to discuss ways to prepare domestic agencies against an attack in this country ms rice told the commission on thursday that the threats they were receiving were too vague , in the nature of something very , very big is going to happen' she asserted nevertheless that the administration needed to prepare a comprehensive strategy to eliminate al qaeda and that the process had been under way when the attacks occurred i will tell you , if we had known that an attack was coming against the united states , an attack was coming against new york and washington , we would have moved heaven and earth to stop it , she testified mr clarke indicated that waiting for precise intelligence could be a fatal mistake what was it going to take , he asked if she was told it was new york or washington , she was going to move heaven and earth \? there are inconsistencies here
reggie strickland , a middleweight from indianapolis , fights once a month , often more though he is not without talent , strickland has made his mark as a perennial loser during 17 years of professional fighting he has lost 260 of 344 fights , some under his name and some under pseudonyms like reggie buse and reggie raglin verdell smith , a welterweight from bartlesville , has also established himself as a journeyman capable of providing an upandcoming boxer with a challenging match that does not usually carry with it the risk of defeat smith , whose record is 4173 , has also fought under a variety of names eight times , he has faced welterweight buck smith , no relation verdell smith lost all eight matches twice under his own name , twice as tommy bowles and four times as tim brooks , according to state regulators and databases of boxers' records fighting under different names is what we needed to do , to get paid , verdell smith said a journeyman , that s all you can really be coming up from here tomato cans , palookas , bums , stiffs boxing has myriad words to describe these boxers' singular purpose to provide more promising fighters a chance to pad their records and enhance their careers they are the opponents who are summoned from out of town to serve as lastminute replacements , the trial horses fighting in preliminary bouts hours before most fans make it to their seats , the tankers whom prospects must punish to look good sometimes , they may upset an opponent but far more often they lose , and that is no surprise they have been carefully selected by matchmakers and promoters to perform as best they can and to lose , preferably by a close margin outside of boxing , people will call it fight fixing , but inside of boxing this is the art of matchmaking , said sean gibbons , a matchmaker and verdell smith s manager , who acknowledged that he had occasionally climbed through the ropes to fight under aliases like the matchmaker and adrian crawford that s not criminal that s making a living what some view as a relatively innocent mismatch can be construed by others as a rigged fight mismatches are among the subjects being explored by federal investigators , who for two years have been examining boxing and , in particular , one of its elite promotional companies , top rank inc , based in las vegas some members of congress are also concerned about journeymen who travel the country and earn a few hundred dollars to take a beating , sometimes under a variety of names to escape the attention of state regulators federal law now requires fighters to provide photo identification to receive boxing licenses state regulators say it is now more difficult to fight under pseudonyms the epidemic of fighters getting knocked out in different states under different names every other night just breaks my heart , senator john mccain , republican of arizona , said in an interview mccain is coauthor of a bill that would establish a federal commission to regulate boxing and create national standards boxing is the only major sport that lacks a central authority the bill , approved by the senate on march 31 , has gone to the house for consideration in boxing s depressed financial climate , with unblemished records drawing a high premium , boxers willing to take on a superior opponent have been in high demand that has made for peculiar economics for some fighters , it can be easier to make a living by losing rather than by winning many of these fighters maintain that they are doing nothing improper they are not fixing a fight , they insist they are simply willing to compete against better fighters bert sugar , the boxing historian , is among those drawing a firm distinction between rigged fights and mismatches fixed fights used to happen like in old film noir movies , when you had a fighter in the tank and he would be told in the locker rooms , 'kid , this ai n't your night , go down in the third , ' and his mobster promoter would make a killing on a bet , sugar said now losing is just not that interesting we have the guys who are never matched to win silent offerings verdell smith , who is 40 , has been among these silent offerings he was once part of a looseknit group of fighters who referred to themselves jokingly as the knucklehead boxing club and who logged hundreds of thousands of miles on the road the way they tell it , a handful of fighters would squeeze into gibbons s hatchback and put on bouts in places like bozeman , mont goodlettsville , tenn , which is near nashville and bartlesville they did it to collect quick purses , as many as possible they would stuff cash they earned 50 to 100 a round into their athletic supporters to keep the money safe from thugs lingering around the ring , and then into their underwear before going to sleep to keep it safe from one another we had to keep on moving , said buck smith , who earned a guinness world record for winning 106 matches in a row , although it was against questionable opposition in one month , smith fought 12 times , winning bouts in kansas , kentucky , missouri , indiana , tennessee and oklahoma he once fought twice in one night , in different states in one stretch during the early 1990 s , he defeated a series of opponents who fought under assumed names he beat kenneth kidd , who fought as tony taylor rocky berg , who fought as rocky vires and tony enna , who appeared as tony montesoro , according to databases of boxers' records and state regulators the boxing business is different in the middle of the country than it is on the coasts or in las vegas , where fulltime fighters tend to flock matches take place less frequently here and tend to be no longer than six rounds the only way for a talented fighter to attract national attention is to compile a whopping number of victories , the way buck smith did he retired last year with a record of 17916 or they can establish a reputation as a worthy opponent , as verdell smith has done verdell smith s record , when fighting under his own name , is 4148 he has lost an additional 25 bouts when appearing under pseudonyms , according to state regulators and the boxing databases the fbi , as part of its inquiry , has questioned a number of the aging knucklehead alumni , a law enforcement official said investigators have also been sifting through state records in oklahoma for evidence of fight fixing and other crimes , like social security fraud , tax evasion and forging medical records we 're looking at everything , the law enforcement official said gibbons , who considers himself a cofounder of the knucklehead boxing club , said he was among those who had drawn the attention of federal investigators gibbons was reared in oklahoma city and moved to las vegas to work at top rank as a matchmaker for preliminary bouts when federal agents first began conducting background checks on top rank employees , the law enforcement official said , they came across a 1997 report produced by state investigators in oklahoma titled allegations of fraud and other corruption in professional boxing the report contends that gibbons , working in concert with other local matchmakers and boxing agents , defrauded fans and skirted state laws by taking fighters under fake names to bouts in states outside oklahoma \( once even using the name of a dead fighter \) the report also said that gibbons and other matchmakers had told fighters to lose in order to pad the victors' records , creating a carnival atmosphere one step removed from professional wrestling no one was charged with a crime as a result of the report using fake names was the equivalent of using alter egos , gibbons said he denied that he had told fighters to lose , though he admitted that many of his fighters had only a puncher s chance of winning , like the time he sent ross puritty of norman , okla , to ukraine to battle the former olympic gold medalist wladimir klitschko in 1998 puritty , then 2513 , stopped klitschko , an undefeated heavyweight , in the 11th round that was n't part of the script , gibbons said , but that s what s great about boxing you never know what might happen next gibbons , who no longer works for top rank , said that while he was in las vegas two years ago , he became friendly with frankie manzione , an undercover detective on loan from the new york police department , according to the law enforcement official gibbons said he had introduced manzione to the insular world of boxing and had taught manzione how to work a fighter s corner as a second manzione began working the corners of gibbons s fighters while wearing a wiretap , the law enforcement official said among the fighters he worked with was verdell smith none of my fights are fixed , smith said i just do n't like getting hurt , and i'm not going to risk my brain and my kids to prove anything i'm not in it for the recognition , he said i fight , i get paid , and i go home , that s all i do i do n't really have a story to tell

if the goal of a cookbook is comprehensiveness , how many recipes for chocolate cake is enough \? after several throwdowns between cooks in the test kitchens of gourmet magazine , there was keening and wailing but at least no food fights the answer was that eight is enough the devil s food , with a brown sugar buttercream \? in the chocolate souffl cake with orange caramel sauce \? out now that the gourmet cookbook \( houghton mifflin , 40 \) has hit the shelves this week , weighing in at 1 , 040 pages , feelings are beginning to heal there will always be vol 2 after all the negotiations ended just short of blood , said zanne stewart , the executive food editor of gourmet and one of dozens who spent the last two and a half years building a cookbook that is gourmet s attempt to enter the canon of cookbooks that are not only bought but also used ms stewart and kemp miles minifie , a senior food editor and resident chocolate freak , were standing in the test kitchen recently at they recalled how desperately they and others in the magazine s kitchen fought for their favorites while they tested 3 , 000 recipes from a database of 50 , 000 recipes accrued over gourmet s 60 years , eventually settling on 1 , 283 winners for what they hope will be an instant classic houghton mifflin is betting an unusual amount of money that the gourmet cookbook will enter the pantheon , along with joy of cooking , how to cook everything and the good housekeeping illustrated cookbook the publishing house is putting 1 million into promoting the book , by all accounts a pretty steep investment for a cookbook the promotion includes the purchase of baking racks to display the fivepound tome in stores ruth reichl , gourmet s editor in chief , along with ms stewart and john willoughby , the magazine s executive editor , will be on the road evangelizing for a month , not only preaching to the converted but also trying to convince others that a cookbook with the word gourmet in its title does not mean snooty food with precious ingredients such populism only goes so far , though and so there is a recipe for roast capon with chili cilantro rub and roasted carrots that clocks in at 3 1 2 hours from start to finish crispy sweetbreads with parsnip potato puree , braised endives and port sauce takes 14 still , the book itself is surprisingly low to the ground there is none of the luscious , vaguely pornographic food photography that is one of the magazine s hallmarks instead , there are prosaic little blackandwhite illustrations and a folksy tone to the text ms reichl , who was the restaurant critic for the new york times from 1993 to 1999 , said that forgoing photography meant more recipes could be included and that the book would not look dated a decade from now i also wanted it to be affordable , a book that lives in your kitchen , ms reichl said , sitting with mr willoughby in her office on the fifth floor of cond nast publications headquarters at 4 times square in manhattan at 40 , it is very cheap by the pound , and you can get it on amazon for 2720 we wanted a book that people cooked out of , not just looked at , mr willoughby said the idea is that you can go to it for anything , from the best hamburger to a beef wellington tutorials and tips are sprinkled throughout the book ms reichl said that synthesizing six decades of recipes produced a few epiphanies , along with a very large book i was surprised how well some of the recipes from the 40 s still worked , she said but there are almost no recipes in the book from the 50 s i think it was a time when frozen foods were introduced and there was n't a lot of imagination going into cooking , in part because women were beginning leave the kitchen but beginning in the 1960 s , cooking began to take hold as a hobby , and gourmet gave its readers plenty of culinary mountains to climb the book , like the lives of people who might buy it , is bifurcated there are recipes that will help get something edible and healthy on the table on a weeknight in half an hour and others that will have home cooks canceling teetimes to spend a saturday in the kitchen we tried to come up with a workhorse , not just something that will dazzle a dinner party , ms stewart said that does not mean that every copy will end up dogeared and stained with b arnaise sauce the kitchen bookshelf has become the new coffee table , a place where one s personal style is expressed through various pretty artifacts , full of bold and wonderful recipes that may never hit the table all cookbooks sell the fantasy of cooking in addition to the recipes , said christopher kimball , the editor and publisher of cook s illustrated , a magazine that has produced 40 cookbooks in the last six years , including a new version of its own comprehensive cookbook , the new best recipe it s like a seed catalog people buy it for the promise of the plant , but most of the time , the seeds never get planted barbara haber , the author of from hardtack to home fries an uncommon history of american cooks and meals \( penguin \) , said she thought gourmet , the book , would be a big win for gourmet , the franchise this is a perfect gift book , the one you give the bride who is starting out and wants something comprehensive , she said executives at houghton mifflin are banking on that we think it could be a huge book , said nancy e grant , director of marketing for references and guides at houghton mifflin we think people are ready for the next big cookbook but gourmet will be entering a very crowded kitchen according to book scan , there have been seven million copies of various entertaining and cooking books published in just the last year the name gourmet might help cut through some of the clutter , but the book s threecolor graphics black , white and difficulttoread yellow will not endear it to some readers but it is not as if gourmet has never lived behind hardcover in the 1950 s , earle r macausland , then the magazine s publisher , produced the gourmet cookbook , vols 1 and 2 and the magazine has published a series of best ofs in partnership with random house , along with a number of singletopic books everyone dreams of coming up with an encyclopedia of food , said corby kummer , a senior editor at the atlantic magazine who often writes about food ruth is one of the few people who has the background , the team , the recipes , and the money to do it
less than four miles from the site of the attack that horrified a city , unified a nation and transformed george w bush s presidency , speaker after speaker at the republican national convention yesterday summoned the stillraw memories of sept 11 in service of a single , overriding theme the nation will be safer if mr bush wins four more years there is only the finest of lines between invoking a disaster in which all new yorkers , and all americans , regardless of party , felt such a devastating stake , and exploiting it for partisan advantage from morning to night , the republicans strode proudly , even defiantly , right up to that line if not over it and the delegates responded with roaring approval as the evening session crested , three sept 11 widows spoke before a stark black background , emblazoned only with that date , and the delegates , including gov george e pataki of new york , spontaneously joined in song when daniel rodriguez , the new york city police officer whose performances rallied the city after the attacks , sang amazing grace perhaps no single american has more earned the right to his opinion about the impact of the attacks than former mayor rudolph w giuliani of new york , whose steady leadership in the aftermath was initially seen as overshadowing even mr bush s last night mr giuliani repeated what he described as one of his first thoughts that day thank god george bush is our president bernard b kerik , who was the city s police commissioner on the morning of the attacks and later helped american troops in baghdad train a new iraqi security force , declared , george w bush has my vote , and for the future and safety of this country , i pray to god he has yours as well and even the actor ron silver , an outspoken liberal on many issues of domestic and social policy , vowed that he would never forgive , never forget , never excuse what he called the murder of 2 , 605 of my neighbors at the world trade center , and insisted the president is doing exactly the right thing the republicans are hardly alone in summoning images of the smoldering trade center ruins in this campaign season at their convention in boston last month , the democrats offered their own emotional tribute , with stirring music and videos , and delegates holding small flashlights simulating candles in the darkened hall but that was nothing compared to the intense and personal speeches here , and mr bush has already faced criticism for using images of firefighters and the flag in early campaign advertising so there was some risk in the graphic speech in which mr giuliani recalled seeing a man jumping from the trade center s north tower , then himself escaping from a nearby building in which he was briefly trapped only to realize that things outside might be even worse in a speech that echoed franklin d roosevelt s preworld war ii warning that the nation had a rendezvous with destiny , senator john mccain of arizona took a less sharpedged but no less emphatic approach , recalling the moment of national unity that followed the attacks in that moment , we were not different races , mr mccain said we were not poor or rich we were not democrat or republican , liberal or conservative we were not two countries we were americans the republicans had good reason to recall that sense of shared purpose and mr bush s role in creating it before he splintered that consensus with his invasion of iraq on the very day that nbc news broadcast an interview with mr bush in which he suggested the war on terror might not be winnable in the conventional sense none of the primetime speakers mentioned the name of the man who remains a symbol of that challenge osama bin laden the world identifies with this site , said mitchell moss , a professor at the wagner school of new york university and a giulianiwatcher i think there s no downside risk in emphasizing concern about what happened here it s part of our national fabric i think more americans can identify with ground zero than baghdad , and that this is the reason we have to be constantly vigilant rick a lazio , a delegate and former new york congressman , defended the speeches , saying hearing john mccain and rudy giuliani praising ordinary americans doing extraordinary things is not politicizing sept 11 this is about taking those actions for granted michelle bouchard , 42 , a delegate from manhattan , lost a close friend , a broker at morgan stanley , on sept 11 i watched the towers fall from seventh avenue , ms bouchard said i think you have to talk about it we would n't be here with helicopters flying over us and guys with machine guns all around if it was n't for that day it rocked the world forever democrats are all too aware of the power of those postsept 11 images and memories that is one reason senator tom daschle of south dakota , locked in a tossup reelection race , recently began broadcasting a new television advertisement that includes an image of him embracing mr bush , and an excerpt of his own televised response to the president s stirring speech to congress on sept 20 , 2001 , when mr daschle declared , tonight , the president has called us again to greatness , and tonight we answer that call but jano cabrera , a spokesman for the democratic national committee , said that americans feel that what happened on sept 11 was a national tragedy that had nothing to do with partisanship , and that what should follow should have nothing to do with partisanship just as the democrats strived to portray their convention city not as a liberal hotbed but the cradle of american liberty , speaker after speaker described new york not as a stew of urban dysfunction but the hopeful city of immigrant strivers who found the american dream and of gritty survivors who endured the nightmare of sept 11 there is no better place to celebrate president bush s leadership and present his vision for the future than here in new york , said his campaign chairman , former gov marc racicot of montana for his part , mr bush made it clear in theinterview broadcast yesterday on the nbc news program today that the attacks are never far from his mind asked whether he had ever considered what his presidency would have been like without sept 11 , he replied well , i have n't had the luxury , because it was defined by 9 11 and you know , as i tell people , every day i wake up thinking about how better to protect america it s the nature of the presidency right now
last year ended a bit brighter for terry and beverly hicks , a workingclass couple here ten days before christmas , they were allowed to speak to their 28yearold son , david , for the first time in more than two years it was pretty exciting , pretty emotional , mrs hicks said , sitting at the kitchen table of her simple home most of the conversation was about family besides , the censors would not let him talk about other things , like how he was being treated , his parents said the hicks s son , a high school dropout and roustabout adventurer , has been confined in a 6feetby7feet wire cage at the american military base at guant namo bay since he was seized in afghanistan in december 2001 he gets two brief exercise periods a week in december , mr hicks was also finally allowed a visit by a lawyer , stephen kenny of adelaide , who has often taken difficult and unpopular cases it was the first time a civilian lawyer had been allowed access to a guant namo detainee , mr kenny said , adding that he won access by agreeing not to discuss the conditions of mr hicks s confinement mr and mrs hicks do not believe that those belated gestures are a coincidence a few weeks earlier , in november , the united states supreme court agreed to hear arguments in a lawsuit brought by mr hicks and 15 other foreigners detained at guant namo bay , challenging their lack of access to civilian courts the bush administration argued that the court should not take the appeal if it is to avoid a potentially adverse ruling , the administration needs to dispose of the detainees' cases before the scheduled argument in march in december , a marine corps lawyer , maj michael mori , was appointed to represent mr hicks he assured the hickses that he would not lie down for anyone , the senior mr hicks said david hicks s case may be the stickiest of those involved the administration is now negotiating for the release of some of the detainees to their home countries , principally britain , where they would be tried but australia says that if mr hicks fought for the taliban in afghanistan , he did not violate any australian laws at the time the bush administration is holding some negotiations to urge mr hicks to plead guilty to a crime , but it is unclear what crime he might have committed his case is often compared to that of john walker lindh , the californian who was seized fighting for the taliban mr lindh pleaded guilty to violating an american antiterrorism law and was sentenced to 20 years in prison but mr hicks is not an american citizen there is no evidence that he killed or wounded any civilians or any american soldiers , said mr kenny , his lawyer , who has enlisted the help of the center for constitutional rights , a liberal public interest group in new york nor does mr hicks have any history of antiamericanism , his parents said in 1998 , he fought with the kosovo liberation army against the serbian government of slobodan milosevic a year later , a convert to islam , he went to pakistan there , he joined lashkaretaiba , a guerrilla group used by pakistan s intelligence service to fight in kashmir lashkaretaiba was closely linked with al qaeda , and mr hicks was sent to afghanistan , where he was when the united states went to war after the sept 11 attacks contrary to most reports , he was not captured by the americans on the battlefield , his father contended the elder mr hicks , a printer , went to afghanistan last august , for a documentary being made about his son s life by a sydney filmmaker , curtis levy mr hicks said he had met the commander of the northern alliance , the antitaliban group allied with the united states , which did capture his son the commander told mr hicks that his son had been arrested while traveling in a van with several afghan men , none of them armed , the father said ten days later , the afghan commander turned david hicks over to the americans , his father said his family has received fewer than a dozen letters from him in the last two years , and there is often a long delay before they are delivered i have nothing to say because today is the same as six months ago and six months before that , david wrote to his parents last march they received the letter in july he wrote that he knew his father was doing a lot to help me , but do not do it to a point so that it affects your health the next five lines of the letter were blacked out by the censors that s cuba , were the next readable words his parents assume that david had just described something about life at guant namo bay in september , david hicks received a letter his parents had written in may , with news that an aunt , pat , had died of cancer the news about pat is extremely sad in fact , unbelievable , david wrote back why these things happen to good people he told his parents that he had been moved away from the rest of the detainees the reason is not clear and that as a result he saw only military police officers a lot has changed in the last year , said mrs hicks , who is david s stepmother , and the developments in december suggest that some resolution appears to be ahead but we 've still got another harrowing year ahead , she said
forest lawn cemetery floats high above los angeles , offering a producer seye view of the television studios below as cars streamed toward the memorial service for maryellis bunim , the cocreator of the real world , a member of the cemetery staff fretted over which visitors were allowed at the service there s some controversy , she confided , about whether this is public or private the memorial s subject might have relished the moment bunim who died on jan 29 of breast cancer at the age of 57 was the irascible mother of reality television a woman who conquered the soap opera world , then built a second career engineering human behavior into vivid , addictive story lines in collaboration with her partner , jonathan murray , bunim was a pioneer in this new genre drawn from real life , a decade before the current flood of survivors , bachelors and apprentices together , they sucked a whole generation through the fourth wall , democratized the nature of celebrity and permanently altered the way networks thought about programming as a strong breeze rattled the microphone , mark itkin , ms bunim s gravelvoiced agent , affectionately recalled ms bunim as one of the toughest and most demanding clients i ever had her old friend millee taggartratcliffe , a former actress ms bunim had shepherded into a career as a writer for soap operas , recalled the early ms bunim as a gorgeous young blonde , an ambitious secretary hoping to climb the ladder of daytime television her daughter , julianna , 24 , described her mother , but weeks away from death , pressing her to rewrite her graduate school essays and on screens that were almost invisible in the sunlight , viewers watched a short film , showing clips of ms bunim on various sets , plus a shot of her skydiving on her 50th birthday , all set to the des 'ree song you gotta be after the ceremony , television executives in power ties mingled with bunim s friends and relatives but equally conspicuous was a cadre of bunimmurray alumni , the amateur stars of the real world and road rules , known to most viewers by only their first names trishelle , kameelah , theo , veronica paris hilton , lately of the simple life , strutted by , heading toward the parking lot ms bunim , the child of a rice importer and a nurse , got her foothold in television in 1967 , parlaying a secretarial position at cbs s search for tomorrow into a production assistant s job not long afterward , she became the youngest executive producer of daytime television ever for two decades , she supervised production at search for tomorrow , as the world turns , loving and the witty and outrageous santa barbara , where she was hired to juice the ratings in what was then a sedate genre , ms bunim pushed for glamour exotic location shoots in greece , televised concerts with pop stars like whitney houston then , in 1987 , ms bunim and mr murray were introduced by their agent , mark itkin , who thought they might be a good creative team mr murray came from a news background he had produced socially conscious news features , including one set in a doomed housing project despite their divergent specialties , the two shared a fascination with confessional storytelling , and they envisioned a new genre of television that would straddle drama and documentary working on the cheap , they set up shop at opposite ends of the same conference table even after their company succeeded , ms bunim and mr murray continued to work side by side , at desks in the same executive office , so they could hear each other s phone calls it was an ideal match between his newsy sensibilities and her eye for plot , his laidback manner and her forcefulness we were very different people , mr murray recalled last week , sitting in the offices they had so recently shared and shifting back and forth in his tenses she s sort of a takenoprisoners kind of person she feels her opinions very strongly she has no doubts about any decision that she makes she had a great sense of story a real instinct for sort of cutting to the point in terms of what was right or wrong for the show though she was n't the greatest diplomat she would say 'this show is a disaster let s start over' for several years , the two of them put together a series of protoreality pilots , none of which succeeded unlike previous cin ma v rit , we wanted to make it very commercial we wanted a hook at every act break , mr murray recalled each scene advanced the story we wanted you to come back next week first there was crime diaries , meant to be a daily halfhour series that featured fictional detectives solving actual crimes then came american families , a docusoap inspired by the highly influential 1970 s pbs documentary american family these strange genrebusting projects were a tough sell the team had so much free time , ms bunim told her daughter , that they took french lessons just to fill up the work day in 1992 , mtv solicited ms bunim to create a scripted soap opera about young people she put together a traditional proposal , but the network balked at the price they mostly played music videos , which they got for free , mr murray said so the idea of having to pay for programming was a little shocking for them he and his partner pitched a cheaper alternative an unscripted series starring actual twentysomethings rather than actors mr murray continued we said , 'we could do something about a bunch of young people starting out their lives in new york except let s not have them on the lower east side in crummy digs , let s put them in a fantasy loft but the interactions , where they go to , what they feel , will be very real it s just that they 'll be attractive , and the place will be attractive , in the finest tradition of television the outcome was the real world as the opening sequence said , again and again , seven strangers , picked to live in a house , to find out what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real the 1992 series featured a diverse cast of unknowns , including julie oliver , a fish out of water from alabama , and the future host of the grind , eric nies it hit pay dirt with the channel s youthful demographic , and the show became an mtv perennial spawning 14 successive seasons set in various cities from new orleans to seattle to las vegas \( the latest is to begin filming in philadelphia \) in 1994 , bunimmurray produced road rules , a roadtrip spinoff featuring sports contests it was the first example of a subgenre that now dominates the airwaves the competitive reality series over the next decade , the company brought back its reallife characters again and again , for reunion specials and alumni challenges , and produced making the band , a variation on the formula in which teenage boys vied for the chance to be the next menudo at their best , the bunimmurray productions distilled the poignant lunacy of early adulthood doofus philosophizing , humiliating flirtations , cutlery flung across the roomthrowing disparate young people into a lush loft \( or a winnebago , or a music studio \) , they triggered some surprisingly raw discussions of race , sexuality and gender years before ellen degeneres came out , the real world cast idiosyncratic gay characters who were neither tokens nor simple role models at its tawdriest , the series could be a cautionary tale of what happens when you mix hot tubs with alcohol or magnify narcissism with a zoom lens but it was also reliably watchable melodramatic , hilarious , phony , raw and tender from its first season , the real world pioneered the stylistic conventions that have since become clich s of reality programming the confessional interview , the meaningful song lyric used to underscore an interpersonal crisis , the experimental friendship between a former bigot and a minority member for viewers , it was often hard to tell what was real and what was mere posturing \( or an editing trick \) , and that tension added to the show s unsettling allure and the rerun marathons that mtv frequently ran allowed viewers to climb into the show s constructed reality and hang out there for an entire day it was perfect for mtv , because we have an audience that loves to see themselves , to be on television , to find out what tribe they belong to , said judy mcgrath , mtv networks group president and maryellis perfectly tapped into this she was funny and thoughtful and adult , but i always felt like there was a 14yearold girl in there ms bunim s creative progeny had a tricky relationship with the producer who made them famous since you were young when you came to her , you treated her like the high school principal , said jake bronstein , who appeared on road rules 4 , broadcast in 1997 obviously , you wanted both of them to like you , because they could do things for you , but you did n't want anyone to think you wanted them to but if she ever called and had a nice word to say , you 'd jump at it ms bunim was the one who decided whether cast members were the heroes of their own lives or the villain of somebody else s she was n't one to baby people she was n't going to sit there and take their 'oh poor me' thing , mr murray explained some of the cast members who do n't come off well they 're angry when they watch themselves some of them learn from that , and some feel exploited but i always think maryellis did n't get enough credit for protecting people there s lots of times we could have used unflattering footage and we did n't she wanted the characters to be likable , for us to root for them and she always pushed for romance in the late 90 s , reality television began to boil over , spurred by the european success of big brother and mark burnett s united states production of survivor network executives quickly crosspollinated bunimmurray s hamsters in a box technique with every conceivable genre including game shows , grossout contests , makeovers , dating programs , sitcoms and satires according to mr murray , ms bunim was frustrated at the way critics lumped all such shows together clearly there s all kinds of reality , just as there are different kinds of dramas , he argued ms bunim would sort of laugh when people would draw these big conclusions about reality programming , he added she felt you had to look at people s motives when the writer s guild is condemning it , duh , i wonder why \? by the time she died , ms bunim had been battling breast cancer for eight years in contrast to the full disclosure she asked of her tv subjects , she had told few of her colleagues that she was ill even into her final weeks , she continued to chip away at new projects , never speaking of the possibility of death these efforts paid off though bunimmurray s reality movie the real cancun bellyflopped , this fall the company scored its first network television ratings smash with the simple life , a campy faux sitcom on fox but ms bunim s true labor of love was the company s other new show , starting over , nbc s oddball selfhelp experiment , which is broadcast each weekday morning at 11 , just like a soap opera like the real world , starting over features strangers picked to live in a house but this time , they are mostly middleaged women a team of life coaches alternately prod and cajole their subjects through oprahesque crises makeovers , postdivorce dates , job interviews ms bunim herself devised the show s tag line life has never been this real ms taggartratcliffe , now a consulting producer on starting over , said the show exemplified bunim s fundamental interest to dramatize the complex mess of human character do n't get me wrong , she said i'm not saying she was a deified saint she was tough , but i'm ok with tough , because underneath was a warm heart and a great inquisitive mind in a city which was all about perception , she was always what she was she was n't nicer than she was , and she did n't have a phony bone in her body she did n't apologize for it and she was always about the story , about the journey she was always about making it better

the airtrain terminal , with its sleek driverless trains to kennedy international airport , was plunked down six months ago in the middle of a ragged pocket of jamaica , queens , and many community leaders predicted it would set off a tide of revitalization but these leaders say they are running up against a formidable and familiar barrier , a landlord named rita stark ms stark , who inherited one of the larger collections of real estate in queens , owns a defunct meatprocessing plant opposite the airtrain terminal that has sat largely derelict for 15 years she owns a 19thcentury beauxarts limestone jamaica savings bank building a few blocks from the airtrain that has been empty for 15 years as she has fended off efforts to have it declared a landmark she owns the threestory plant that published the long island press before that newspaper went out of business in 1977 , and most of that building has been idle since few people claim to understand why ms stark would hold such pivotal properties off the market even as the airtrain is expected to provide a tonic to the neighborhood s bustling spine , jamaica avenue whatever the reasons , the puzzle has only added to the mystique of a landlord who is labeled by a community newspaper as the notorious real estate heiress and whose name , far more than those of other holdout landlords , is often murmured by frustrated queens politicians rita has been an obstacle for years , said claire shulman , the former borough president , who once clashed with ms stark over a fraying shopping center in far rockaway \( it is still woebegone \) lawrence gresser , deputy borough president from 1974 to 1979 , said there s no rational reason she does what she does he added , my grandfather once said to me , 'you 'll drive yourself crazy if you try to make sense out of nonsense ms stark , in a long interview in her office with her lawyer at her side , vigorously denied she was obstructing renewal she said that until now it was hard to sell or rent anything at reasonable prices but with property values rising , she said , she is on the verge of a deal with a national retailer for the press building she plans to auction off the fourstory bank building next tuesday with bidding starting at 14 million , she said , and is negotiating with the nonprofit greater jamaica development corporation over a joint venture to build something new where the meat plant stands she indicated that her philosophy was no different from that of landlords in times square who held onto seedy properties until the neighborhood revived i'm not opposed i'm hoping and praying for development in jamaica , she said you have faith in an area and you know it s coming back , you hold on and see if it comes to fruition despite her plans to take action with the three properties , her critics do not all think she is relenting they point out that she has a history of changing her mind two years ago , she put the bank on the auction block and at the last minute canceled the sale f carlisle towery , president of development corporation , acknowledged that he has been speaking to ms stark about parting with the meatprocessing plant but he said that after two years of negotiations she wo n't sell it she s emotionally attached , he saidms stark , who has lived in queens for most of her 57 years , has burnished her maverick reputation in other ways , most famously as the chief witness against sheldon leffler , the longtime councilman who ran for borough president confronted by prosecutors with improper campaign donations to mr leffler , she wore a microphone and taped him her testimony led to his conviction last november for campaign finance violations she walked away without penalty rita plays ditzy but she s not really as ditzy as she seems , said mr leffler , who is appealing the verdict as the executor of the estate of her father , fred stark , who died in 1988 , she was sued by her brother , harold , though the two have reconciled ms stark or the estate controls at least 26 properties in queens some vacant lots , some thick with apartments or stores but none have aroused more controversy than the three in downtown jamaica once a shopping hub boasting three department stores macy s , gertz and montgomery ward downtown jamaica went into a slump in the 1960 s after residents moved to long island or sought out suburban malls with ample parking according to mr towery , jamaica avenue and connecting streets began bustling again in the late 1980 s , and that momentum has picked up with recent additions of a 13screen theater building that houses gap and old navy outlets and a bally fitness center jamaica has also been the exceptional beneficiary of government largesse , chosen as the site of york college , the social security administration and food and drug administration federal buildings , queens civil and family courts and the airtrain , operated by the port authority of new york and new jersey mr towery and his planning group have sketched designs for a jfk corporate park , which would feature a hotel atop the airtrain terminal and five other buildings thousands of travelers are already using the airtrain every day , paying 5 for an eightminute dash to and from the airport , and connecting through the terminal to a 20minute ride to midtown manhattan on the long island rail road or the e , j and z subway lines mr towery , an alabama native who has worked for the corporation for more than 30 years , has no illusion that these travelers would take an interlude to shop on sutphin boulevard below or nearby jamaica avenue but mr towery and supporters of the jamaica development believe that some travelers and flight crews would stay at a hotel and try the shops and that aviationrelated businesses like jetblue might prefer offices there a consultant recently argued that a renewed jamaica should also entice young urban pioneers like those who invigorated brooklyn s brownstone neighborhoods one of the properties that would have to be bulldozed to make the project work is ms stark s meat factory , once the headquarters of merkel inc the gunmetal building is tumbledown , its clock stopped at 6 37 on mr towery s visionary map , it is the site for a commercial building and garage if ms stark does have a sentimental attachment to her properties , it may have something to do with her family s ragstoriches story ms stark s father immigrated at 13 from austria , worked as a painter and contractor , sold hardware and appliances , then specialized in building apartments in st albans and hollis for elderly and single people of modest means , often furnishing them himself ms stark obtained a law degree from hofstra university and went into her father s business real estate professionals in the area said she was overwhelmed when fred stark s empire fell in her lap and had trouble figuring out how to pay for enhancing rundown properties ms stark said that until the early 1990 s she had been able to rent portions of the meat plant to butchers , but it did not draw reasonable offers until the airtrain became a reality forces greater than me changed the entire area , she said
jeanne theisen lives with her partner and two young children in a nondescript cape cod in midland park she works during the week at the printing business she owns , and attends church on weekends in nearby ridgewood although ms theisen , 40 , has attended a couple of meetings on gay issues , she does not consider herself any sort of activist she wishes , above all , to have a suburban family life that is almost boringly normal and that , she says , is why she settled in new jersey we moved to new jersey because the laws have just improved and continue to change in good ways for the gay and lesbian community , ms theisen said and we 're specifically not moving into gay neighborhoods here within the state of new jersey , we feel comfortable living anywhere long before the world heard gov james e mcgreevey declare himself a gay american , new jersey was quietly building itself a reputation as one of the most hospitable places in america for gays and lesbians its laws are now among the most progressive in the country , including a domestic partnership law signed in january and put into effect in july that is drawing an influx of gay couples from better established gay communities in new york , philadelphia and other urban areas and as new jersey s gay population has grown , its members are playing an increasingly assertive role in state politics , successfully lobbying for a series of legislative victories , building a reputation in political circles as a formidable fundraising constituency and , most recently , announcing the formation of a political action committee to prepare for a fight over gay marriage that could happen as early as next year in the last three or four years , they 've definitely become much more activist , much better funded and much better organized , said gerald cardinale , a republican senator , who is a leading opponent of gay marriage in the state legislature steven goldstein , who managed jon s corzine s senate campaign and is the founder of the new political group garden state equality , goes somewhat further in his assessment we 've never been stronger here , he said the gayest place in america is not provincetown , it s not san francisco or south beach it s new jersey the domestic partnership law in particular was a demonstration of that strength , not only because of its substance it made gay and lesbian couples eligible for statefinanced pensions , hospital visitation rights and some health care benefits but because of the ease with which it passed although the law attracted some limited opposition in the months following its introduction in the legislature from some religious and social conservatives , it ended up sailing through both houses of the state legislature by overwhelming margins what i found most surprising was the lack of opposition , said assemblywoman loretta weinberg , a democrat , who authored the domestic partnership law in the end , it did n't even take a lot of debate to get it passed but unlike politically influential gay constituencies in nearby urban areas , which have their centers of gravity in dynamic neighborhoods like chelsea in manhattan or washington square west in philadelphia , new jersey s is a more diffuse phenomenon although there is no reliable count , gays and lesbians have been an increasingly visible presence in places as varied as asbury park , moorestown , maplewood , plainfield , south orange , trenton , collingswood and jersey city as gay men and lesbians have established themselves , there has been an advent of such decidedly conventional institutions as bowling clubs , choruses and church congregations for gay men and lesbians take , for example , the four yearold unity fellowship church in new brunswick , which serves a largely africanamerican congregation its 150 members are mostly gays and lesbians who moved to new jersey from cities including new york , philadelphia , washington on a recent sunday , the church , which is situated on the top floor of an old industrial building , was mostly full the congregation of about 50 worshippers included a handful of children the music drums , keyboard and a chorus of congregants was extraordinary , thanks in large part to the man at the pulpit the minister , kevin e taylor , is a producer at black entertainment television , where he oversees much of the network s musical programming in his sermon mr taylor touched on some common themes as he addressed what seemed to be part congregation , part mutual support group some of you all came crawling here because someone told you you were n't welcome somewhere else , he said , over the sounds of gospel music in the background but god stands with you at all times , in all things later in the service , congregants stood and testified to their good news , which in a number of cases included their good fortune at having moved to a place where they could find so many people with similar personal situations mr taylor , who testified last year before the state legislature in support of the domestic partnership bill , said in an interview recently that he thought new jersey afforded a uniquely hospitable environment for gays and lesbians because of its combination of proximity to urban centers and suburban topography in the towns we 're living in , you know your neighbor , he said so the idea of gay and lesbian is not some stereotype you 've seen on television it s kyle and bart across the street who 've been together for 20 years they 're not an idea you know them and i think that s why people here are so receptive to us if new jersey has come to be regarded as a welcoming place for gays and lesbians , it is partly because of the state s increasingly liberal position on a number of social issues until recently , the political makeup of much of the state mirrored the conservatism of new york s suburbs in places like westchester and long island but like the new york suburbs , the state s demographics have been altered over the last decade by an influx of democraticvoting city dwellers from new york and philadelphia and by various immigrant groups a zogby poll commissioned last year by a gay advocacy group seemed to indicate that the views of new jersey voters on gay issues were indeed more liberal than those of voters nationwide in particular , the poll found , a majority of new jersey voters supported the right of gay couples to marry and even the state s reaction to the mcgreevey resignation , ostensibly because of an affair with a male staff member , provided a significant , if less scientific piece of evidence the governor actually seemed to have benefited politically by his declaration that he was gay , as it served to distract from the widespread disapproval over his failures of governance before he came out , the governor had opposed gay marriage , but supported other measures facilitating domestic partnerships and adoptions by gay and lesbian couples how many states do you know where the governor would wrap himself in being gay to distance himself from other things \? mr goldstein asked further underscoring that shift in attitude is the way new jersey has passed those gay rights measures the domestic partnership law , for example , passed through the legislature and across mr mcgreevey s desk with a minimum of fuss there are only five states other than new jersey that recognize samesex unions in some form massachusetts , which allows gay marriage , vermont , california , hawaii and maine only two of those states , like new jersey , have not gone on to ban the possibility of gay marriage i think the way the law went through shows what a long way the gay community has come , ms weinberg said by contrast , gay rights advocates in new york state celebrated the passage of an antidiscrimination law just two years ago a similar law has been on the books in new jersey for 12 years and hold little hope of major domestic partnership legislation anytime soon and if new jersey has provided a more conducive environment for gay rights legislation , new jersey s gay advocates seem better organized than ever to push for it ten years ago , new jersey was light years behind new york in terms of gay advocacy groups and fundraising , said christy davis jackson , a democratic strategist who also worked on the corzine campaign and , before that , for senator frank r lautenberg you started sensing a major shift around 2000 , when you started to talk about specific national legislative issues , and people were forced to consider the debate and then something really terrific happened , and they started fundraising money changes everything , as far as political currency in new jersey mr goldstein , 42 , was first hired by a new yorkbased gay rights group last year to organize a series of town hall meetings throughout new jersey to build support for domestic partnership and samesex marriage \( the group that hired him , lamda legal defense and education fund , is the same one that organized the suit on gay marriage \) mr goldstein was encouraged enough by what he saw to have joined the ranks of gay urban exiles to new jersey , moving recently with his partner from their longtime home in brooklyn to a house in teaneck he reckons , at least , that he will be where the action is that the new jersey supreme court will force a showdown sometime next year on gay marriage by hearing a case that is currently in the court of appeals and he says that his political organization the first set up specifically to provide money and grassroots support for local elections in new jersey should be up and running by october , with a goal of turning out 300 , 000 gay voters and their family members at election time but even as gay advocacy groups flaunt their newfound strength , some opponents of samesex marriage warn that they may be overreaching my general sense of it is that since these groups have become better organized and apparently better funded , they 've been rattling their sabers , the legislature has taken more notice of what they want and has attempted to accommodate them with the limitation that they do n't want to get the rest of the population offended , mr cardinale said but , he continued , there was the risk of a public backlash , especially on the issue of gay marriage they should understand that if they push too hard , they will risk whatever they gained , he said that notion is likely to be put to the test soon the national attention and controversy surrounding a samesex marriage law would dwarf anything the state has seen so far if the recent furor in massachusetts is any example or , for that matter , in any of the 39 states that have passed defense of marriage laws in some form gay marriage is an issue that rouses far more opposition than any other topic involving gay rights some local religious groups , like the new jersey catholic conference , have already declared their determined opposition to gay marriage and national groups such as the family research council are anticipating a largescale fight if new jersey s liberalleaning supreme court decides to involve itself in the issue if this becomes challenged on a higher court level , you 're going to see outside groups from both sides coming in with help and money , said genevieve wood , a spokeswoman for the group this becomes a national story because even though it s one state , it has implications for the other 49 states as well but while the battle over samesex marriage looms , some of its potential beneficiaries continue to celebrate a new jersey lifestyle that is , above all else , routine one of the plaintiffs in the gay marriage lawsuit is diane marini , a building contractor who moved to haddonfield several years ago from a gay neighborhood in philadelphia ms marini is an activist by almost any definition , and has been actively involved in all phases of the legal and publicity battles for domestic partnership and gay marriage but she says that where she lives , none of that makes her all that unusual anymore here , we 're just part of a neighborhood , ms marini said we were n't the gay girls next door we were just neighbors we were able to blend in , which is what you want to do , rather than have the scarlet letter on our heads new

to the editor one point in paul kengor s insightful oped article deserves elaboration he notes that president bush s worldview is heavily influenced by democratic peace theory , which implies that democracies do not fight democratic peace theory does not imply , however , that a region halffull of democracies is more peaceful than a region with none , since democracies and autocracies do go to war similarly , it does not imply that more democracy is always better for peace the most dangerous states are actually those mired between democracy and autocracy taken together , these points imply fairly radical policy prescriptions more radical than most politicians who cite democratic peace theory to support their policies seem to realize the peaceful benefits of democracy may require that democratic institutions become deeply rooted in the majority of states in a region given our recent experiences in democratization , such an enterprise is ambitious , to say the least bear f braumoeller cambridge , mass , oct 18 , 2004 the writer is an associate professor of government at harvard university drawing \( drawing by grady white \)
yonkers to collectors , there s a story behind every bit of colonial currency and every confederate bank note being auctioned off in florida next month , from the massachusetts sword in hand notes engraved and printed by paul revere to the commercial national trust and savings bank of los angeles note signed by cecil b demille one of the most intriguing among the 4 , 288 lots to be sold at the florida united numismatists convention , the year s biggest coin and currency show , will be the remarkable collection that malcolm a trask put together during the 1940 s and 50 s at his small apartment in south yonkers but the real story is not the collection it s the collector mr trask was a subway motorman with an eighthgrade education who died in 1989 at the age of 88 while raising four children on a working man s salary , he somehow amassed one of his era s greatest currency collections , only to stash it in a closet where it languished , forgotten , until his children found it two years ago after his wife died the current value of the 300 items estimated by the auction company at a million dollars will become clear when it is sold on jan 13 , 14 and 15 in fort lauderdale exactly how mr trask put together the collection , or what he was thinking when he just stashed it away , may be harder to figure out mr trask was born in yonkers in 1901 , dropped out of school after the eighth grade , enlisted in the navy in 1917 , and then went to work for 46 years as a motorman on the old irt line the subway was his job the collection was his passion he began with coins , but by the late 1940 s he had sold them all to concentrate on paper money , at the time an arcane satellite universe apparently using 20 , 40 or 80 he was able to squirrel away , he bought at auctions , from dealers or at coin and currency shows every night , his children recall , he would pore over ledgers , write in journals , type up notations , compile censuses of numismatic arcana he was one of the earliest serious researchers of national bank notes , paper money that was issued by more than 11 , 000 banks between 1865 and 1933 and was about 20 percent larger in size than current bills the truly incredible thing about this collection is that a guy with no formal education , utterly limited resources and almost no research material available could pick so well and build a collection that would be significant a halfcentury later , said allen mincho , a director of heritagecurrency auctions of america and a currency expert who researched and catalogued the collection he clearly had the eye but how he knew just what to pick , i really do n't know i 've sold plenty of milliondollar collections , but none where the initial investment was so low , the returns so high , and the overall quality so amazing mr mincho , who in a previous life was a city and state prosecutor in new york , says the collection is almost a fluke of history the right person at the right time making brilliant purchases for almost no money until prices rose to a point he could no longer afford to buy almost the whole collection was purchased between 1945 and 1957 , at which point , mr mincho assumes , a motorman was priced out of the market dick trask , 75 , the youngest of mr trask s four children , remembers a meticulous , utterly focused man , so attentive to detail that when he took up woodworking he became just as expert but beyond that , he says , his dad s passion was something so intense and intimate that when he tried to convey it to his children he was like a man speaking a foreign tongue and over time the collection became so much his world and not theirs that none dared ask what became of it we wondered , but we never asked him about it , mr trask said i do n't mean this to sound negative , but we understood it was none of our business it would have felt presumptuous on our part to ask and then going through boxes at his mother s apartment , mr trask found it , stashed in five black catalog boxes , similar to large recipe boxes , that were inside a cardboard box each note was encased in its plastic sleeve he took it upon himself to begin researching the collection , finally getting a sense of just how remarkable his father s work had been mr trask will be at the auction , and he has informed his brother and sister to expect a windfall but more than that , he says , he s a bit awed at finally getting to appreciate his father s work , share his passion , enter his world if only decades later the thing this means for me and for all of us will be some sort of redemption , mr trask said i hope that he s looking down and watching this evolve and that he 'll finally see some appreciation for his skills and hard work i hope he 'll feel proud our towns email peappl nytimescom

it took 90 minutes at sea in a small boat , 5 hours driving in two vans and 75 minutes on a commuter jet before the boys' and girls' basketball teams from seldovia reached bethel , a remote town in western alaska when the players stepped off the jet onto the bethel tarmac , as flat as the tundra enveloping it , the lateafternoon temperature was 38 degrees below zero seldovia s players would stay for four nights , sleeping on classroom floors at the local high school , to play three games in a roundrobin tournament joining them were teams from unalakleet , a village of about 800 people on the bering sea , and homer , a port town like seldovia in the state s southcentral maritime wilderness i feel sorry for those kids back east who just have to drive 20 minutes to the next suburb for a game , nikki dill of unalakleet said how boring and so went another typical week in alaskan high school sports , where to play something as routine as a basketball or a volleyball game , hundreds of teams habitually crisscross a mammoth state on jets , ferries , vans and even caravans of snowmobiles they do it at great cost bethel s high school athletic travel budget exceeds 200 , 000 and they do it with striking aplomb despite inherent dangers an unexpected blizzard a few years ago forced a bethel team returning from a game by snowmobile to spend the night outdoors beneath the emergency tarp of a survival kit they do it , alaska s high school athletes say , because the challenges are part of the fun of playing school sports i have seen so much culturally , met so many different people , and the long trips let me bond with my teammates , dill said where is the hardship \? alaska s interscholastic sports map is probably without rival anywhere in the athletic world consider that its westernmost sports conference includes not only bethel and unalakleet but also villages like unalaska on the aleutian island chain and the arctic ocean port of barrow the distance from unalaska to barrow , annual regional rivals , is roughly equal to the distance from miami to boston unalaska is so far away and its weather so fickle , few teams want to go there , leading to another odd custom of school sports life in the state unalaska pays other high schools to come play against its students the teams on kodiak island do the same we give them about 3 , 000 to come , said pat costello , kodiak high school s wrestling coach what difference does it make \? it would cost us about 3 , 000 in airfare to go play them in the southeast part of the state , at ketchikan high they frequently offer teams 3 , 000 and throw in harbor tours , halibut feeds and a promise to put up every visiting athlete in a private home but it seems like we are still the ones usually traveling , rick collins , ketchikan s wrestling coach , said ketchikan has one of the state s largest high schools , yet a short , socalled road trip involves a 36hour ferry ride to juneau the bunks for the voyage are sleeping bags on the ferry deck lots of card games , collins said our kids have gotten really good at hearts a farflung enterprise the challenge of alaska s high school sports structure is not just its geographic and weather extremes , and the daunting travel logistics they impose the state s population is roughly 640 , 000 spread across more than 572 , 000 square miles , or nearly onesixth the land mass of the united states more than 100 alaskan high schools have fewer than 50 students in the bethel area , the school district is geographically about the size of ohio at the district s 23 schools , some basketball teams have the minimum number of players needed to start a game , five and that starting five may consist of girls and boys it is not uncommon for basketball games in this part of the state to end with one team fielding only three players , because two have fouled out state championships have been won in the division of the smallest alaska schools by teams that finished the title game with four players they are the reallife hoosiers , legends of the alaskan bush , which is defined as any school in a town that cannot be reached by car , places like seldovia and unalakleet these are just additional hurdles in a frequently harsh environment , and like most other obstacles confronting alaskans , they do not seem to overly trouble anyone at lumen christi catholic high school south of anchorage , 18yearold jonas musgrave said he had been shoveling off his driveway since he was 6 so he could practice shooting at the family basketball hoop he does this unless it is colder than 20 degrees below zero until then , it s not really that cold , musgrave said the one problem is , the ball wo n't bounce the cold takes the air out of the ball but you can still shoot all over alaska , there are stories of such perseverance in extreme or unusual conditions in the southeast , haines did not have flat space in mountainous terrain , so it used the municipal airport runway for high school track meets which was suitable until an aircraft with engine trouble made an emergency landing on the eve of the 110meter hurdles , wiping out half the school s hurdle supply undaunted , haines started running meets on the state highway in front of the school the local police halted traffic to allow the events to continue in the 1980 s , costello was the wrestling coach at new stuyahok , where the high school had 18 students one year at new stuyahok , pat had a heavyweight wrestler , but none of the other schools in the area did , said dudley homelvig , the wrestling coach at nome high school so when new stuyahok came to town , every coach in the region wrestled that kid instead we did n't want to leave the kid out in the cold well , that s not what i mean i mean , we improvised they do the same in volleyball , where 60 state schools play a popular coed version called mixed six in ice hockey , many of the teams play on outdoor rinks keeping good ice is not a problem , but getting the whole schedule played sometimes is , because alaska has a rule that no outdoor game can start if it is colder than minus 15 degrees we 're not crazy about that rule , said tim delaney , athletic director at kenai central high , 100 miles down the cook inlet from anchorage minus 15 is n't really that cold shoot , we practice in it all the time no school too small there is one rule that alaska state school sports officials would not consider excluding village schools , no matter how small the opportunity for everyone , regardless of how distant the island community or how deep into the arctic plains the school may be , is ingrained in the culture everything in these small towns and villages is familiar and unfamiliar at the same time bethel , for example , has a subway sandwich shop the cars parked outside , while empty , usually have their engines running so the car remains warm , even after a 30minute stop inside it is not as if someone is going to steal a car where would they go \? there are no roads out of bethel during the bethel basketball tournament from feb 5 through feb 7 , nikki dill , who was inside bethel regional high awaiting a game , acknowledged that the alaska of her grandparents , with whom she is still close , is subtly disappearing i listen to the elders and have heard the stories about them cutting the ice from the river so they could melt it and have water to live , she said i have heard about the hunting and fishing to subsist nowadays , we complain about the smallest things there is change i do n't , you know , understand too many words in our native language dill had plenty of opportunities to hear her native language during the games at bethel , when the local crowd filled the 1 , 200seat high school gym it was a pulsating atmosphere , with a representative audience for an area that is 87 percent native there were occasional chants in yupik , a native eskimo tongue and sometimes i know they are cursing the referee in yupik , karl pulliam , the seldovia boys coach , said but because the ref is n't yupik , somehow it does n't matter the cost for the most wideranging , multifarious interscholastic sports enterprise in the united states is staggering , especially because in most alaskan schools , as much as 40 percent of the money has to be raised by the athletes and the coaches in the halcyon days of oil production from the alaskan north slope pipeline , the state paid for much if not all travel these days , many school districts frequently pay no more than half or twothirds of athletic costs , and they often have to send teachers with the teams on long trips to help the students keep up their studies it is not unusual for alaskan high school teams to have to come up with anywhere from 20 , 000 to 60 , 000 just to play their regular season qualifying for a state tournament is a mixed blessing it may mean raising another 10 , 000 i used to tell my kids who wanted to come out for basketball that they had to play defense , play offense and fundraise , said billy strickland , bethel s dean of students and a former basketball coach almost every alaska high school team , from soccer to softball , runs raffles , bake and rummage sales and silent auctions some of the state s 24 football teams have to raise 1 , 500 a player it is part of the covenant every player agrees to when he signs up to play you get used to it , strickland said with a shrug , the same mannerism often employed when someone here is asked to explain how people adapt to the arctic temperatures the community understands that without their help , the athletic department dries up and goes away so they help out 'this is their time to shine' for a host of reasons , the alaskan high school athlete truly has to want to play sports and the overwhelming majority play for the most basic reasons i think it s more pure , dill said we are playing a game , not pursuing a career we are trying to have fun , not trying to get a scholarship gary matthews , the executive director of the state athletics and activities association , said , there is no money or college scholarships at the end of the rainbow for all but a very few of these kids every year , some alaskan athletes get offers to play at major colleges in what alaskans call the lower 48 the level of play in alaska high schools is good , but it is awfully hard to get noticed outside of the big cities , and there really is only one of those , anchorage carlos boozer of the cleveland cavaliers in the nba attended high school in juneau , but he is such a rarity that his gamebygame statistics are a daily feature in the anchorage daily news center scott gomez of the devils is an anchorage native they are exceptions in three decades of alaskan scholastic competition our kids do n't play aau basketball and they do n't go to nike camps , strickland said come on , there are no travel teams , no allstar teams you play here , in your town and our kids , deep in their hearts , know that high school games will be the best ball they will play in their lives this is their time to shine whether suffering from jet lag or sea legs , the seldovia boys basketball team waited days to find its moment to shine in bethel seldovia s first two tournament games were lopsided losses in the final game , however , seldovia upset unalakleet , a perennial power among small schools i was proud of the guys for hanging in there , karl pulliam , the coach , said that was a pretty good win for us the team could not get out of bethel until the next evening , its fifth day in town then , after landing in anchorage , the team considered beginning its drive pulliam said driving after midnight meant fewer moose crossing the roads , but there were concerns about the late hour , and the players and coaches stayed in a hotel instead the next morning at 6 30 , they began the fivehour drive to the port of homer there , after boarding a waiting boat , the team just beat a nasty storm of high winds and driving rain into the seldovia harbor we had icy roads , and the firehouse flooded , pulliam said , describing the scene in his village of about 300 people i went down and helped bail out a couple of boats although the winds were gusting at 45 miles an hour , pulliam was still planning basketball practice that afternoon seldovia had another away game that weekend i do n't think the storm will be a problem for that trip , pulliam said we 're only going 45 miles across the bay to ninilchik we 'll get there one way or the other , we 'll get there
greenburgh , ny , oct 13 it has been almost six months since the knicks' season ended in disappointment , embarrassment and frustration four straight losses to the nets in the first round of the playoffs underlined the knicks' place in the onesided rivalry , and the squawking of tim thomas after a flagrant foul in game 1 that sidelined him for the rest of the series served as a reminder of what might have been since then , the knicks have added to a roster already rebuilt on the run , and the nets have cut costs and come away a shadow of the team that won three straight atlantic division titles and went twice to the nba finals and thomas is still angry the knicks and the nets will meet thursday night in wilkesbarre , pa , in a meaningless preseason game but the bitter feelings still float over this game , thomas having called jason collins , who fouled him hard in game 1 of the series last season , a coward but in light of thomas s recent statements about the former nets forward kenyon martin , thomas and collins seem like old friends thomas has offered to face martin , who was traded to denver in the offseason , in a boxing ring thomas said he never received an apology for the foul by collins that sent him crashing to the continental arena floor and required him to be taken from the arena on a stretcher , and he does not want one now i mean , some guys are cowards about it , thomas said it is what it is i wo n't be the last one he does it to thomas said the worst part was knowing that his children were home watching on television , seeing their father helped off the floor but on the court it cost the knicks , too , leaving the team without one of its most potent scorers , a player who had averaged 178 points against the nets in the postseason a year earlier while he was a member of the milwaukee bucks it just took out a scorer , thomas said someone who in the series a year before that had given them trouble they knew that coming in how can you settle it \? thomas was also upset that none of his teammates retaliated , a situation he said he was certain would be different now that the team had spent more time together tim expected a little more from us , said kurt thomas , who was to his surprise named one of the team s three captains wednesday with stephon marbury and allan houston we were already undermanned he was already down by us going out there and intentionally fouling someone or getting in a fight , we 'd lose other guys it was just about going out there competing , trying to get a win with martin gone and jason kidd sidelined for at least the preseason and most likely longer after knee surgery , the nets have their own worries the knicks , for the most part , were trying to look ahead and use thursday s game as the first step in what they hope will be a far different outcome in the rivalry rebounds kurt thomas was named a captain after another offseason of trade rumors and having to fight off the secondyear forward mike sweetney for the starting power forward job i think that he worked real hard and set a great tone in training camp , coach lenny wilkens said when he s on the floor it s the same thing he does n't take nights off the rumors , if you 're in this league you 're going to hear the rumors you ca n't let it affect you and i wanted him to know i appreciate what he does thomas said , patrick ewing was a captain and he got traded , right \?
change one digit , and you have the new cry in baseball land 1908 now that the boston red sox have wiped 1918 out of the baseball and new england lexicons , the chicago cubs take center stage with 1908 a full decade before the red sox last won the world series , the cubs last won a world series and if the game follows recent evolution , the cubs should get their turn next year after all , the red sox and the cubs were each only five outs from the world series last year and did n't make it but the red sox , after being only three outs from elimination , traversed the necessary distance this year as andy macphail said the other day , we 're next we 're glad they paved the way for us , macphail , the cubs' president , added , and we 'll sort of slide through in their wake macphail , who built two world series champions in minnesota , said the red sox were impressive in winning the world series and offered valuable lessons for teams striving to do the same someday being here 10 years , he said of his cubs tenure , you get a sense of what they 've had to overcome as well i think it will help us i think we 're close , and it s just a matter of short time to experience what they have to emulate the red sox , the cubs may want to adjust their strategy slightly instead of winning their division , they may want to consider reaching the playoffs next year as a wild card john schuerholz , the atlanta general manager , joked recently that after 13 consecutive division titles but only one world series championship , the braves should win the wild card instead of the division and that was before the red sox became the third successive wildcard team to win the world series the best theory offered for the success of the wildcard teams has been that they often have to play hard to clinch their spots right up to the end of the season and are better prepared for the postseason than teams that clinch their divisions early in the red sox' case , their wildcard position was not really in doubt the last month of the season , but they were still trying to catch the yankees they were hot the last seven weeks of the season , compiling a 3412 record \( 739 \) they were even hotter in the playoffs \( 113 , 786 \) in the same sevenweek season stretch beginning aug 16 , the yankees had a 2619 record , and the cardinals went 2917 the red sox humiliated them both , becoming the first team to win its last eight postseason games the wisest thing i 've ever heard in baseball has been , 'it s not who you play but when you play them , ' macphail said teams give you different looks over the course of the season , depending on injuries and how players are doing you can run into the wrong team at the wrong time or you can run into a team at the right time with the 162game schedule and a threetier playoff system , macphail said , whoever is left standing deserves it that team next season , he desires , should be the cubs , whose ancestors won successive world series in 1907 and '08 but none since the cubs have appeared in seven world series since , the last in 1945 , coming closest to another triumph that year when they lost to detroit in seven games no team has gone as long without winning the world series , though the crosstown white sox \( 1917 \) are closest we 're going to go after it , macphail said our general manager knows one speed , and that s full ahead the cubs , led by a strong pitching staff , were supposed to contend for the national league central title , but injuries to their top pitchers , kerry wood and mark prior , undermined their effort first , they fell hopelessly behind the cardinals in the division , then they squandered their wildcard lead in the last days of the season , losing seven of eight games we just did n't hit , macphail said we had 26 games in 24 days our guys ran out of gas the cubs will begin planning for next season s run tomorrow , with the start of their organizational meetings they have made two decisions , declining to exercise options on moises alou and mark grudzielanek they apparently have no interest in retaining grudzielanek but are prepared to sign alou to a new contract for less than the 115 million salary that the option called for alou , who can become a free agent , led the cubs this season with 39 home runs and 106 runs batted in among other cubs who can be free agents is nomar garciaparra , the shortstop they acquired from the red sox in july he decided on friday to test the market we have some interest in resigning nomar , general manager jim hendry said , and hopefully we can move forward on that if that s not possible , we 'll see what our other options are two options would be the world series shortstops , orlando cabrera and edgar renteria hendry worked in the florida marlins' minor league system when renteria began his professional career the cubs must also decide if they want to try to trade the superstar sammy sosa , who , with 35 home runs and 80 runs batted in , had his weakest season since 1993 , his first full year with them speculation has begun that sosa , who was fined a day s pay for leaving the final game of the season early , will wind up with the mets , whose general manager , omar minaya , signed sosa as a 16yearold in 1985 the teams , however , have not discussed sosa but general managers can never be sure when a trade might develop last year , hendry said , we were n't looking for a first baseman , and then we traded for derrek lee after that , everything sort of fell into place everything but first place those cursed cubs enough with future cubs time to talk about excubs , specifically the excubs factor in the world series ron berler , a freelance writer , brought the excubs factor to light in 1981 , and it s a pretty good barometer for determining ahead of time which team will win the world series this is how the factor works any team with three excubs cannot win the world series its creator says the factor should be applied only to the world series , but it s hard not to note that the yankees had six excubs in the american league championship series that they lost to the red sox , who had two , mark bellhorn and bill mueller how did it work in boston s world series victory over the cardinals \? no surprise there st louis had three excubs on its roster ray king , julian tavarez and tony womack meek in the middle the world series did n't last enough games for cardinals third baseman scott rolen to make a dent in the record book , but his hitless performance was impressive nonetheless by failing to get a hit in 15 atbats , rolen moved into a tie for 10th for most atbats without a hit in a world series , according to elias sports bureau records the recordholder also played for the cardinals shortstop dal maxvill was 0 for 22 in 1968 one difference between them maxvill batted 253 during the 1968 season rolen hit 314 this past season except for a gift hit , jim edmonds , who followed rolen in the lineup , could have joined his teammate at 0 for 15 in his first series atbat , edmonds saw that the red sox had shifted third baseman bill mueller just about to the shortstop spot , and he bunted toward third for a single edmonds did n't get another hit as much as the red sox humiliated the yankees by becoming the first team to win a postseason series after losing the first three games , look what they did to the cardinals the cardinals led the major leagues in victories and the national league in hitting and scoring , but they could n't win a series game and they batted 190 , the lowest average for an nl team since the cardinals batted 185 in their 1985 loss to kansas city their 24 hits were the fewest for any team in a fourgame series since 1966 , when los angeles had 17 in being swept by baltimore , which had 24 tony la russa , the cardinals' manager , has been involved in three of the last five series sweeps his 1989 oakland athletics won four straight over san francisco two before the earthquake , two after and his 1990 athletics lost in four to cincinnati baylor s feeling fine don baylor , the mets' bench and hitting coach in art howe s illfated regime , has left new york healthy and thankful to his former employers for helping make that possible last year , his first with the mets , baylor found that he had multiple myeloma , the same cancer that struck mel stottlemyre , the yankees' pitching coach , a few years ago like stottlemyre , baylor is free of the disease my health is fine , he said the wilpons definitely got me into the right facility and got me the right doctor for that situation to put my multiple myeloma in remission baylor said he understood why the mets did not include him in their managerial search the team is looking for a fresh start after two more dismal seasons and wants a new face in the dugout baylor is waiting to hear from the philadelphia phillies about their managerial position he is among half a dozen candidates who have been interviewed for the job should baylor not get the phillies' job , he will probably wind up as some team s bench coach or hitting coach if the mets do not hire rudy

an angry worker with two handguns strode into the cafeteria of a meatpacking plant in kansas city , kan , yesterday afternoon and shot four men to death , wounded three others and then killed himself as officers closed in , the police reported the gunman was not immediately identified , but was described by the police as an employee at the conagra foods inc plant where the shootings took place another report described him as a 21yearold worker whose job had recently been terminated early police reports said that as many as seven people had been killed , but a deputy police chief , col sam breshears , corrected those reports and put the number of dead at five , including the gunman none of their names were released but two were said to be 45 years old the three wounded were taken to the university of kansas medical center bob hallinan , a spokesman for the hospital , said that one man was in critical condition while two others had less serious injuries a worker , andre porter , said the gunman s first name was elijah he said he had spoken with the gunman in a plant locker room shortly before the shootings he quoted the gunman as saying , andre , how you doing \? i said fine , mr porter said he said , 'that s nice , real nice' he walked out to the hallway and i heard a popping noise i said , 'elijah , what are you doing , popping firecrackers \? mr porter said he then saw that the man had a pistol and that another worker was lying on the floor of the locker room and had been shot mr porter said he ran to the adjacent women s locker room and told the women there to stay put then , he said , he ran downstairs and told everyone to get out mr porter said he heard the gunman tell other people , you have n't done anything to me , so you can go he also said there appeared to have been a confrontation between the gunman and some victims earlier this week the police said the gunman entered the cafeteria shortly after 5 pm with two handguns they said a witness told them the man had said something before opening fire , but it was unclear what had been said it was also unclear how many people were in the cafeteria at the time kris washington , who was in the cafeteria , said that at first people thought it was a fourth of july prank but quickly realized that the sounds were real gunshots and fled toward the exits in panic colonel breshears said that the shooter was still moving through the building when the first officers arrived in response to numerous calls to 911 it was unclear , the colonel said , whether the gunman killed himself before the officers confronted him the colonel declined to discuss the gunman s possible motives , but described him as a disgruntled employee many of the workers on duty were detained at the plant for several hours by the police as the investigation proceeded some called relatives on cellphones , and within an hour , hundreds of people family members and friends of many of the 150 workers said to be employed at the plant gathered outside the windowless onestory concrete building to await information they were joined by meatpackers in white coats who had not been on duty many of the faces were lined with anxiety some paced nervously , and a few wept three grown children of ms washington , who has worked at the plant for five years , were among those waiting a daughter , latashia , said i do n't know if she s alive or dead i came straight down here when i heard i'm very emotional , scared , upset , even for the other families i'm going to wait here because i want to see my mother s face i want to see her throwing up a peace sign when ms washington finally emerged , she was mobbed and hugged by weeping relatives she said she and other workers were astonished that the gunman had killed and wounded coworkers because he had seemed quiet and nice audrey edwards , who was waiting for word about her husband , are edwards , and her nephew , lonnie ellingburg , both employees at the plant , said that as rumors spread in the crowd she heard that her nephew had been shot five times but we do n't know if that s the truth , ms edwards said please , lord do n't let it be true the plant is in an industrial area four miles from downtown kansas city , mo bob mckeon , a spokesman for the company , which is headquartered in omaha , neb , told the associated press that the plant processes meat for sandwich products the shooting followed by a year and a day an attack in which a manufacturing plant employee in jefferson city , mo , killed three people and then himself
cleveland after three years of denying that the arthritis drug vioxx could induce heart attacks and strokes , this week merck bowed to reality it withdrew vioxx from the market the impact of this decision is farreaching , and not only because tens of millions of people have tried vioxx it also highlights the absence of food and drug administration oversight of the pharmaceutical industry as well as the lack of comprehensive longterm studies of not only vioxx but its entire class of arthritis drugs in 2001 , i was part of a team from the cleveland clinic that published a paper demonstrating the significant heart attack risk of vioxx our research , published in the journal of the american medical association , found that compared to naproxen , a commonly used overthecounter antiinflammatory drug with similar benefits , vioxx has a five times greater heart attack risk in response , merck claimed that early conclusions about the risk were flawed , and attributed the comparatively high heart attack rates to an unproven protective effect of naproxen our study was followed by several others demonstrating vioxx s dangers each time merck had a similar reply the study was flawed merck finally had to acknowledge the truth , but only by accident the company undertook a large , randomized trial of 2 , 600 patients with colon polyps in hopes of proving that vioxx could help their condition in the process , though , merck discovered that 35 percent of patients taking vioxx suffered heart attacks or strokes as against 19 percent taking a placebo merck at last did the right thing by voluntarily and abruptly taking vioxx off the market there are two important issues to consider here first , the risk of heart attack or stroke found in the merck study , at 15 cases per 1 , 000 patients , may be greatly underestimated merck s trial did not include anyone with known heart disease patients who might be expected to have the highest risk and the problem may extend beyond vioxx and its users while it s true that when compared to the other cox2 inhibitors , vioxx has repeatedly carried a far greater risk of heart attack and stroke , none of the manufacturers of vioxx s class of drugs , called cox2 inhibitor agents , have studied patients who already have heart disease the number of patients who may have sustained heart attack or stroke as a result of using these drugs could be tens of thousands it would be premature to conclude that the other drugs still on the market , like celebrex and bextra , do or do not carry some risk of heart attack until sufficient testing is done while we remain in this zone of uncertainty , people with arthritis should remember that conventional overthecounter agents like naproxen \( as in aleve \) or ibuprofen \( as in advil \) work extremely well , are much cheaper than the cox2 agents , and are not known to have any risk of heart attacks in addition , one of the mostcited benefits of the cox2 agents that they are less likely to cause stomach ulcers than overthecounter drugs may ben grossly exaggerated second , and what may be more alarming , is that despite studies showing the magnitude of the public health problem , for several years merck did nothing to investigate this surely represents a conflict between the interests of the public and the interests of a company with a blockbuster drug that had sales of 25 billion in 2003 instead of doing the requisite research in patients with heart disease who frequently have arthritis as well and are thus prime users of antiinflammatory medicines the company undertook studies that avoided them at the same time , merck spent at least 100 million a year for directtoconsumer vioxx advertising , while the company s employees and their consultants published several papers in medical journals rebutting studies reporting vioxx s heart attack risk the food and drug administration could have forced merck to do the appropriate research studies , but instead it was a bystander as the vioxx debacle shows , we have a long way to go in this country to get on track with prescription medications most important , we need a stronger regulatory agency to compel pharmaceutical companies to do the proper studies and force these companies to stop directtoconsumer advertising unless a drug has major benefits for patients and negligible increased risk of heart attacks and strokes our two most common deadly diseases should not be caused by a drug oped contributor eric j topol is chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the cleveland clinic
a selective listing by critics of the times new or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in new york city denotes a highly recommended film ratings and running times are in parentheses now playing anchorman , starring will ferrell and christina applegate directed by adam mckay \( pg13 , 91 minutes \) neither as crazy as old school nor as charming as elf , this extended comedy sketch \( directed by a former saturday night live head writer \) will nonetheless satisfy , for now , the national hunger for mr ferrell s special brand of goofiness this time he plays ron burgundy , a san diego newsman whose supremacy is threatened by the arrival of a woman \( ms applegate \) who becomes his rival , his love interest and , of course , his straight man the movie s ideas are none too fresh the crazy sideburns and ugly neckties of the 1970 s will yield only so much hilarity but there is a reasonably high quotient of funny jokes and offthewall , nutty gags , including a street fight among rival news teams as amusing for its moviestar cameos as for its brutal slapstick \( a o scott \) before sunset , starring ethan hawke and julie delpy directed by richard linklater \( r , 80 minutes \) nine years after they parted , in vienna , at the end of before sunrise , jesse \( mr hawke \) and celine \( ms delpy \) rediscover each other in paris , and relive their brief encounter this time it is even briefer the film unfolds , without skipping a minute , in the hour or so before jesse must catch a plane home to new york , and all those minutes are filled with looping , selfconscious talk as the reunited lovers wander along the seine their intimacy is tinged with nostalgic regret the airy sense of freedom that they shared in their early 20 s has given way to the resignation of adulthood , even as they meander toward a second chance the liberating sweetness of the earlier movie has mellowed into a saltier , sadder flavor , but mr linklater , one of our most literate and intelligent directors , has not talked himself out of the possibility of romance , and the movie s relaxed , discursive structure is dense with implied feeling and oblique drama \( scott \) the clearing , starring robert redford , helen mirren and willem dafoe \( r , 91 minutes \) joining in the bedroom and house of sand and fog in the new subgenre of tastefully filmed literary fiction , the clearing is centered on the frayed but enduring marriage of wayne and eileen hayes \( mr redford and ms mirren \) , whose inner tensions \( tastefully \) explode when wayne is kidnapped by a former employee \( mr dafoe \) and taken on a forced march through the smoky mountains eileen and her two adult children try to cope with the crisis as best they can , but a pesky fbi agent \( matt craven \) keeps stirring up the past , in the form of wayne s adulterous relationship with another of his workers the film is selfconsciously classy , in the tidy , antiseptic way of a new yorker short story \( dave kehr \) delovely , starring kevin kline and ashley judd directed by irwin winkler \( pg13 , 125 minutes \) unfolding as a bumpy , muddled this is your life series of confusing , overcrowded tableaus , the new cole porter biography gives you the creepy sense of watching adult children \( with the singular exception of mr kline , who can surmount any disaster \) dressed up in period costume at a school pageant although its publicity goes out of its way to pat the movie on the back for its supposed candor about porter s homosexuality , the film s attitude toward sex is dainty the heat in a film about the man who wrote too darn hot remains a steady , airconditioned 68 degrees it ca n't imagine a wealthy , sophisticated couple marrying for friendship and social advantage without that arrangement involving torment and guilt over its lack of sex some two dozen porter songs are glossed by contemporary singers like elvis costello \( let s misbehave \) , alanis morissette \( let s do it , let s fall in love \) , sheryl crow \( begin the beguine \) and diana krall \( just one of those things \) if they 're not awful , these labored , selfconscious interpretations are undercut by flimsy period arrangements \( stephen holden \) dodgeball a true underdog story starring vince vaughn and ben stiller directed and written by rawson marshall thurber \( pg13 , 96 minutes \) mr stiller returns to the comedy crime scene to portray a monstrous , pumpedup fitness guru and hilarious variation of derek zoolander , the airheaded male model he played with pursedlipped , vacanteyed perfection three years \( and many dull movies \) ago his new character , white goodman , a preening product of fanatical selfimprovement , wears a blowdried mullet and a fu manchu mustache and favors hideous white leisure suits affecting the pseudomacho bark of a drill instructor , he suggests anthony robbins as a shrimpy , steroidenhanced gym rat white and his robotic cronies represent the goliath that peter la fleur \( mr vaughn \) , the slobby , nice guy who owns a nearby lowrent gym , sets out to slay with the help of his nerdy pals who form a dodgeball team to compete for a 50 , 000 first prize in a las vegas tournament the sports comedy is very dumb and often very funny \( holden \) fahrenheit 9 11 written and directed by michael moore \( r , 116 minutes \) mixing sober outrage with mischievous humor and blithely trampling the boundary between documentary and demagoguery , mr moore takes wholesale aim at the bush administration , whose tenure has been distinguished , in mr moore s view , by unparalleled and unmitigated arrogance , mendacity and incompetence of course your estimation of the movie will depend largely on whether you share his view , but this unabashedly partisan collage of interviews , archival video clips and mr moore s trademark agitprop stunts is nonetheless his most disciplined and powerful film mr moore is a prodigious talker and a wily showman , but he is also a good listener , and when he visits his hometown , flint , mich , to speak to the mother of a marine killed in iraq , the film achieves an eloquence that its most determined critics will have a hard time dismissing the movie s cheap shots and inconsistencies may frustrate its admirers , but by now we should have learned to appreciate mr moore for what he is he is rarely subtle , often impolite , frequently tendentious and sometimes selfcontradictory he is also a credit to the republic \( scott \) garfield with breckin meyer and jennifer love hewitt directed by peter hewitt \( pg , 93 minutes \) jim davis s lazy , lasagnaloving cat has been plucked from the funny pages and turned into a computergenerated dancing blob with the voice of bill murray why anyone thought this was a good idea is beyond me , but the movie is at least short and relatively lowkey there are two equally pointless plots , one involving a dognapper \( stephen tobolowsky \) , the other a romance between garfield s owner , jon \( mr meyer \) , and a cute veterinarian \( ms hewitt \) even the most devoted cat lovers will be better served by a plate of reheated lasagna and a nice nap \( scott \) i 'll sleep when i'm dead starring clive owen , malcolm mcdowell and jonathan rhysmeyers directed by mike hodges \( r , 102 minutes \) mr hodges s new film his ninth in 35 years has much in common with his first , the legendary get carter this time , mr owen plays will , a selfexiled london underworld figure who returns home to avenge the death of his beloved younger brother \( mr rhysmeyers \) , who killed himself after being raped by a prominent citizen \( mr mcdowell \) the movie runs more on mood than on plot or psychology the motives of the characters are at once too obvious and too obscure , and the storytelling is willfully oblique but mood is mr hodges s specialty , and few directors create such finely shaded atmospheres of longing , dread and grief his chilly elegance and mr owen s morose precision are balanced by touches of eccentric humor and by the vulgar warmth of the supporting performers , especially jamie foreman as the dead man s best friend , who becomes will s unlikely sidekick \( scott \) the inheritance , starring ulrich thomsen , lisa werlinder and ghita norby directed by per fly \( not rated , 107 minutes in danish and swedish , with english subtitles \) filmed mostly in shades of gray , this sleek , desolate fable about the conflict between corporate values and human needs gives the upscale ethos that engulfs its characters a bleak palette all its own the central character , christoffer \( mr thomsen \) , forsakes a carefree life in stockholm to assume control of his family s floundering steelworks after his father commits suicide part of the story revolves around the tug of war between his domineering mother \( ms norby \) and his beautiful wife \( ms werlinder \) , who puts her promising acting career on hold to move from stockholm to copenhagen the inheritance reminds you in painful detail that one of the tasks of a financially responsible executive is to execute as he turns the business around , his decisions tear apart his family and erode his marriage you can read the danish film as an unsettling parable about any corporation , or , for that matter , any country forced to take stringent financial measures to avoid catastrophe for all the pain he inflicts , christoffer might even be seen as a selfsacrificing hero but as the morose movie shows , a corporate hero is in many ways the antithesis of a humanitarian \( holden \) king arthur , starring clive owen and keira knightley directed by antoine fuqua \( pg13 , 130 minutes \) this misty , smoky , plodding epic claims to resurrect the true story that has been buried in centuries of arthurian legend arthur \( mr owen \) is a mopey roman officer , whose knights are a band of conscripts policing the area around hadrian s wall and fighting off the woads , a band of guerrilla fighters led by merlin the romans withdraw , the saxons arrive \( led by stellan skarsgard , hamming it up in braids \) , and arthur grapples with his identity crisis and falls in love with guinevere \( ms knightley \) , a tough woad babe he has rescued from a roman dungeon the battle scenes have some impact , though not much coherence , but mr fuqua gives the movie an element of brawny , bpicture camp that mitigates its ponderous dullness \( scott \) metallica some kind of monster , directed by joe berlinger and bruce sinofsky \( not rated , 139 minutes \) mr berlinger and mr sinofsky , who begin filming the mighty heavymetal band metallica in early 2001 , turn what might have been a conventional behindthescenes rockumentary into a riveting , intricate pyschodrama after nearly 20 years together , metallica was in something of a funk , and the band members hired phil towle , a therapist , to help them through their artistic and interpersonal struggles at its core , some kind of monster is the portrait of a marriage the angry , sustaining partnership between james hetfield , the lead singer , and lars ulrich , the drummer , who founded the band as teenagers and must figure out how to keep it going now that they 're in their 40 s \( scott \) the notebook starring ryan gosling , rachel mcadams , james garner and gena rowlands directed by nick cassavetes \( pg3 , 115 minutes \) young love the oldfashioned kind that flourished before the age of the hookup has always been one of the most challenging emotions to portray on the screen with any specificity beyond the smooches , sighs and adoring glances , how do you convey the reality of a shared , private paradise \? in the strongest scenes of this screen adaptation of nicholas sparks s treacly best seller , mr gosling and ms mcadams break through the barrier to evoke highstrung , slightly crazed teenagers plunging headlong into first love against your better judgment , you root for them to beat the odds against them the romantic drama , which spans six decades , is told in flashback as duke \( mr garner \) , a garrulous , ailing old codger in a comfortable nursing home , reads aloud excerpts of a love story to a woman \( ms rowlands \) with alzheimer s disease as the movie seesaws between seabrook , nc , in the summer of 1940 , when the young lovers in the story meet , and the present , it is deliberately \( and annoyingly \) coy as to who these oldsters might be gosh , could they be the same young couple , still in love , six decades later \? \( holden \) shrek 2 , with the voices of mike myers , eddie murphy , cameron diaz , antonio banderas and jennifer saunders directed by andrew adamson , kelly asbury and conrad vernon \( pg , 93 minutes \) this sequel revives the raucous high spirits of its predecessor , with some new characters , jokes and satiric targets to compensate for the loss of novelty shrek \( mr myers \) and fiona \( ms diaz \) , now married , travel with donkey \( mr murphy \) to meet shrek s inlaws , the king and queen of far far away , which is to hollywood what duloc was to disney in the first shrek there they contend with a scheming fairy godmother \( ms saunders \) and a swashbuckling , scenestealing puss in boots \( mr banderas \) the animation has improved , and the crossgenerational appeal slapstick and moralizing for the kids , cheekiness and pop music for the grownups is precisely calibrated and jauntily executed still , the cynicism of the enterprise leaves a bit of a sour taste the movie is too timid to risk genuine ugliness , and too crude to try for real beauty \( scott \) spiderman 2 , starring tobey maguire , kirsten dunst , james franco and alfred molina directed by sam raimi \( pg13 , 110 minutes \) this wonderfully vibrant entertainment surely one of the best comicbook movies ever reminds us that being a superhero is not all fun and games the first hour is a pop art chronicle of suffering and indignity , as poor peter parker \( mr maguire \) struggles with the loneliness and frustration of being an anonymous urban crime fighter his powers are waning , he has lost the respect of the woman he loves , and even aunt may \( rosemary harris \) seems a little disappointed in him meanwhile , a new supervillain , the tragic and terrifying doc ock \( mr molina \) , rampages through new york on mechanical arms with minds of their own there is plenty of noise and color , and some soso special effects , but the real thrill comes from mr raimi s devotion to his hero s complex , conflicted emotional life , and to the melancholy , grownup love story that develops between peter and mj \( ms dunst \) , who comes into her own as a strong and decisive character , while still fulfilling the traditional comicbook girlfriend duties of screaming , getting kidnapped and being rescued \( scott \) the stepford wives starring nicole kidman and glenn close directed by frank oz \( pg13 , 110 minutes \) less a remake than a fullscale reengineering , this adaptation of ira levin s dry , efficient suburban gothic turns a dusty 70 s thriller into a loud and shiny postmodern farce the music , by david arnold , is as dementedly campy as some of the performances , notably ms close s as the robot matriarch of stepford , conn ms kidman plays joanna eberhart , a highpowered manhattan television executive who retreats to stepford after her career collapses and her marriage \( to matthew broderick \) threatens to do the same once there , she discovers that the town s women have all been turned into busty , cheerful automatons who exist to fulfill their husbands' every wish the screenwriter paul rudnick s gags and oneliners are often sly and incisive , but the movie never lives up to its satiric potential , collapsing at the end into incoherence and wishywashy , haveitall sentimentality \( scott \) the terminal starring tom hanks directed by steven spielberg \( pg13 , 128 minutes \) mr hanks plays viktor navorski , a traveler from a fictitious eastern european country who spends a year stranded in the international arrivals terminal at kennedy airport what sounds like a nightmare turns out to be a soothing comic dream , thanks to mr spielberg s playful virtuosity , and also to the talents of the cinematographer , janusz kaminski , who infuses the neutral , unwelcoming architecture of the airport with soft , radiant light the story is a bit soft viktor is befriended by a motley group of airport workers , bedeviled by a homeland security apparatchik \( stanley tucci \) and beguiled by an unhappy flight attendant \( catherine zetajones \) there is a bit too much easy sentiment and artificial sweetness , and ms zetajones s character is woefully underwritten but these flaws cannot dispel the film s deep enchantment mr hanks , like mr spielberg , has nothing left to prove , and the nuances lurking in his sly , genial performance emerge only in retrospect similarly , the movie s deepest engagement with some of the central anxieties of modern life can be found not in its plot but in its ambience it is a visual tour de force that turns fear into optimism , loneliness into solidarity , and frustration into resourcefulness \( scott \) time of the wolf starring isabelle huppert written and directed by michael haneke \( not rated , 114 minutes in french , with english subtitles \) in this minimalist disaster movie an unspecified ecological catastrophe has disrupted modern life , and some of the survivors , huddled together in a bleak corner of the french countryside , struggle to hold on to the trappings of civilization food and water are scarce , and so is kindness , which mr haneke rations out with elegant sangfroid the movie is rigorously harsh , and its view of human nature is as dark as the cinematography , which forces you to discern human features in twilight , deep fog and utter darkness ms huppert , who played the unhinged musician in mr haneke s piano teacher , is a mother trying to protect her two children and her own sense of identity amid chaos and desperation mr haneke s formal control is impressive , but his steely resistance to sensationalism or sentimentality can be repellent you may find yourself horrified and disturbed by this alltooplausible nightmare and shamed by the thought that , in some parts of the world , it represents real life without being especially moved by it \( scott \) two brothers starring guy pearce directed by jeanjacques annaud \( pg , 105 minutes \) this familyfriendly movie about two tiger cubs , kumal and sangha , growing up in the jungle somewhere in french indochina in the 1920 s , is terribly hokey but once you accept the anthropomorphic premise that a gentle pussycat lurks inside the most ferocious tiger , the movie succeeds as an inspirational pastorale and passionate moral brief for animal rights and preservation it also inveighs unequivocally against one culture s looting of another s historical treasures the movie is not as gripping as the director s muchloved 1988 film , the bear but when it concentrates on its animal stars \( each played by several tigers \) , it remains on solid ground mr pearce is a treasureseeking marauder and a big game hunter who softens and considers abandoning his rapacious ways \( holden \) white chicks starring shawn wayans and marlon wayans directed by keenen ivory wayans \( pg13 , 91 minutes \) most movies require some suspension of disbelief , but white chicks , a comedy starring two of the wayans brothers as africanamerican fbi agents disguised as dippy white socialites for a weekend in the hamptons , requires something more radical a full frontal lobotomy might be a good place to start the celebutantes they are impersonating , the wilson sisters , are obviously based on nikki and paris hilton , and dressed up in their whitegirl drag , the wayanses look as if they 've just lumbered in from dawn of the dead with rubber prosthetics making their faces all but immobile , and blue contact lenses that give them that much soughtafter vacanteyed zombie look , they are scarier than anything in scary movie and

boston let s be clear about this just because the red sox dispatched their historic tormentors from new york does not mean they are home free they still have to beat the cardinals to beat the curse , or whatever it is the curse is a cute little device that refers to all the terrible things that have happened to the red sox since babe ruth was sold to the yankees early in 1920 since then , the yankees have won 26 world series and the red sox have won none the world series is the focus of the spell , hex , jinx , bad luck , bad plays , bad managing , bad karma , that seem to follow the sox now the sox are back in the world series for the fifth time since the babe pitched them to the championship in 1918 they made a good start last night with an 119 victory on a tworun homer by mark bellhorn into the rightfield corner off the pesky pole , named for johnny pesky , the venerable sox coach emeritus , who plunked a few homers into that corner many decades ago david ortiz drove in four runs , and became the 28th player in history to hit a homer in his first world series atbat and a threerun homer at that big papi from santo domingo hit 301 in the regular season and he was voted the most valuable player in the league championship series , but when the series shifts to st louis , ortiz will be forced to play defense because of baseball s confusion over the designated hitter poor loopy baseball , which has had trouble dealing with complexities like rampant steroid abuse and the transfer of the montreal expos , has also dithered with the designated hitter rule this gimmick was seemingly designed for viewers of sports highlight shows who have played too many video games in their short lives and have no attention span for the discreet beauty of the suicide squeeze or the hook slide for them , it s boomboom or nothing baseball does not value the tradition of its own sport \( who will forget the brief craven impulse , early this season , to display a comic book character , spiderman , on the hallowed white bases \? \) the american league still uses nine hitters the national league still allows the pitcher to bat the result is two separate styles , with teams constructed differently national league teams are built for more speed , skills , versatility american league teams are built for the long ball so when the series shifts to st louis for two or three games , ortiz will move to first , where he did play 34 times this year kevin millar , a righthanded hitter , will probably be pushed off first and share right field with trot nixon , a lefthanded hitter realistically , it does put us at a disadvantage when we go to st louis , manager terry francona of the red sox said we 're not sending our team out on the field does n't mean we 're not going to win , but we 're not sending our best team out there cardinals manager tony la russa said it s a lot easier for us to add a hitter and then you get in our park , the pitcher is involved in the game and that s not easy for him , he added the national league game is just more interesting , as demonstrated in the deciding game of the championship series in st louis on thursday night both managers had to create runs around the bottom of the batting order , with cardinals pitcher jeff suppan executing a perfect suicide squeeze la russa even used a pitcher , jason marquis , as a pinchrunner last night , although marquis s stumbling adventure as he scored a run was not exactly an advertisement for the latent athleticism of pitchers american league managers just do n't seem compelled to try things joe torre could n't do much with a weak yankees bench in the recent league championship series also , when curt schilling stopped the yankees on tuesday night , his right sock bloody from sutures to secure an ankle tendon sheath , the yankees did not try to bunt schilling into trouble well , i watched quite a bit of that last performance and it looks to me like the thing he has to do is throw the ball well , and his ankle is good enough to do that , la russa said yesterday la russa added , we are not going to try to run schilling around because we are just going to run ourselves into outs that is nice logic , but the cardinals still might try to put the sox at a disadvantage tonight , before the sox are at a disadvantage by losing the designated hitter starting tuesday the sox caught a break because roger clemens and the astros did not survive the seventh game against the cardinals if the hulking clemens had stomped into fenway park in his sevenleague boots yesterday , his return would have been a huge distraction , even if he did n't pitch here any way you look at it , breaking the spell of the babe is still very much a work in progress
a wouldbe romance etched in acid and loathing , the new film ps opens with a woman looking into a mirror and painting her face as if scrubbing an especially befouled saucepan she is n't removing offending layers of grease and grime , but jabbing color onto her face , tracing oily circles of red into her cheeks to try to make them bloom that the woman should feel the need to work so hard and with such concentration seems puzzling because the face belongs to laura linney , a beauty whose dimpled cheeks would n't seem to require such feverish ministrations in time it emerges that ms linney s character , louise harrington , possesses two faces , one attractive , the other deformed by fear and jealousy , and that this is a movie about scrubbing away the layers of falsity , the sediment of sublimation and bitterness , to get at the real face below when that happens louise will be \( you guessed it \) forced to confront her faults and flaws , all of which the filmmakers will have laid out on the table with the careful attention of autopsy attendants it s only after this symbolic disembowelment , after louise has been opened up and her insides are hanging out for everyone in her life to feast on \( and feast they do \) , that she can be put back together and set on the road to inevitable closure directed by dylan kidd , who showed some filmmaking promise a few years ago with his feature debut roger dodger , ps is based on the novel by helen schulman , who wrote the screenplay with mr kidd having seen the movie , i have no desire to read the book , so i ca n't tell you who should take the blame for such an appalling collection of clich s and stereotypes what s disheartening about the film is n't its contempt for its central character in specific and for women of a certain age in general , or the screenplay s silly swerve into the supernatural or how the direction shows none of the energy of mr kidd s first feature what s disheartening is that an actress as fine as ms linney has to endure the indignity of such excremental nonsense an administrator in the applications department of a new york city graduate program , louise lives one of those lonely careergal lives that went out with garters and girdles , or so i thought on her way home one afternoon , she notices that an applicant has the same impossible name as the teenage love of her life , f scott feinstadt \( topher grace \) stunned , she calls the young man in for an appointment and scurries back to her childhood home , where she retrieves a flirty sundress from a closet stuffed with clothes and memories then , with d colletage at the ready , she makes her move , hungrily launching a relationship with her bewildered but nonetheless game prey complications ensue while paul rudd , gabriel byrne and marcia gay harden each stop by for a guest appearance throughout it all ms linney holds onto her dignity , in and of itself no small thing given how the filmmakers toss her character around for all manner of abuse it s understandable why she took the role on paper , the slow revelation of louise s character probably presents the sort of challenge relished by actors but while ms linney easily negotiates the story s emotional and narrative switchbacks , sliding from fury to hurt like rain on a window , she ca n't fashion a living , breathing , believable human being from such a shabbily patchedtogether conceit you believe her character in the moment , but not when those moments are strung together for his part , mr grace , whose performance in steven soderbergh s traffic was a gem of callow malevolence , seems to be enjoying himself enormously ps is rated r \( under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian \) it includes strong language and sexuality ps opens today in manhattan and san francisco directed by dylan kidd written by helen schulman and mr kidd , based on the novel by ms schulman director of photography , joaquin bacaasay edited by kate sanford music by craig wedren production designer , stephen beatrice produced by robert kessel , anne chaisson , john hart and jeff sharp released by newmarket films running time 105 minutes this film is rated r with laura linney \( louise harrington \) , topher grace \( f scott feinstadt \) , gabriel byrne \( peter harrington \) , marcia gay harden \( missy goldberg \) , paul rudd \( sammy silverstein \) and lois smith \( ellie silverstein \)
very few artists thrive in a vacuum they tend to gather in bands of likeminded individuals , many of whom are also artists josef and anni albers belonged to such a band the bauhaus , a legendary art schoolcumthink tank that flourished in germany between the world wars with founders and faculty members like walter gropius , paul klee , wassily kandinsky , mies van der rohe and lazlo moholynagy , the bauhaus helped establish the basic tenets of modern design and architecture but the alberses were also a band of two their marriage was a remarkable meeting of minds , souls and sensibilities that enabled each to sustain a long and fruitful career through the most turbulent of times taking separate paths , they pursued identical principles by different means their shared credo boiled down to the bauhaus catch phrase less is more , which they followed as devotedly in their lives as in their work josef and anni albers designs for living , an enlightening , quietly excellent show at the cooperhewitt national design museum , almost reverberates with a sense of this devotion it could be called the incredible fullness of less the exhibition , which was organized by nicholas fox weber , executive director of the josef and anni albers foundation , and matilda mcquaid , the cooperhewitt exhibitions curator , is the first to juxtapose the design works created by these two remarkable artists it is eyeopening josef is known primarily as an abstract painter whose glowing images of nesting squares presaged minimalism here you see the nesting tables with bright paintedglass tops that he designed in 1927 anni was the first designer to be given a solo show at the museum of modern art , in 1949 , and her textiles are not unknown but she has only recently begun to receive her due as the premier innovator , experimenter and conceptualizer of modernist textiles in her field , she stands as high as josef , if not higher using many littleseen textiles from the collection of the albers foundation , the selection here expands upon the retrospective held at the jewish museum in 2000 the cooperhewitt display includes handsome \( and durable \) plaid bedspreads designed for harvard dorms room dividers made of jute , cellophane and metallic thread and a nubby , intermittently transparent curtain fabric with a wavy pattern , a result of the unlikely combination of moir and boucl they met at the bauhaus in 1922 , arriving from markedly dissimilar places and seemingly headed in opposite directions she was a cosseted yet rebellious daughter of wealthy german jews from berlin , who was determined to be a painter but was deflected , at first unwillingly , into weaving \( despite the egalitarian fervor of his 1919 bauhaus manifesto , gropius closed most other courses of study to female students \) josef was born a catholic , the son of a house painter and general contractor near d sseldorf who taught his son an array of manual skills he worked in glass , furniture design and typography while at the bauhaus , and took up painting only gradually they married in 1925 and emigrated to the united states in 1933 , where josef taught painting and color theory , first at black mountain college near asheville , nc , then at harvard and finally at yale he died in 1976 at age 88 anni died in 1994 , at 94 their last home was a splitlevel ranchstyle house with white walls devoid of art , a living room with a few bauhaus prototypes and a kitchen table from sears with a white formica top their one indulgence was a mercedes there is , strictly speaking , no art in this exhibition , certainly no pure art everything has a purpose , an application in everyday life but the show is infused with a sense of aesthetics that creeps up on you with delicious stealth the objects here confirm that design can rise to the level of art , through formidable concentration on its own purposes , materials and techniques this is , of course , the signal lesson of the bauhaus it is a question of rigor and ruthlessness we are inclined to look at and think about things that have come into being through a process of unsparing care and thought the alberses possessed this kind of ruthlessness , an ability to think through a design to a solution that seems both inevitable and interesting , locked in yet still breathing \( josef designed bedside tables whose drawer and knobs face sideways , toward the bed s inhabitant \) at the same time , their work in design was inflected by their interest in painting , either thwarted or not yet realized the little foundglass reliefs that josef made at the bauhaus in 1921 are restrained riots of greens , yellows , blues or reds that announce his love of strong colors and diverging tones of the same hue his furniture introduces his faith in clear lines , crisp corners and simple geometry as strongly as his paintings he liked to use close , but different , tones of wood , especially evident in a monumental armoire made of contrasting surfaces of walnut and maple whose contrasting squarish and narrow doors are punctuated with a few somewhat large spherical pulls the examples of his furniture are few and unique none of his designs ever went into production the major pieces that survive were intended for the berlin apartment of close friends , fritz and anna moellenhoff , both psychoanalysts , who transported it to the united states in 1935 but he claimed to be the first modern designer to use bent wood , and his chairs may cause some reconfiguring of the origins of modernist design other pieces may also alter views of minimalist sculpture and furniture a boxy wall shelf from the 1920 s could almost be an early work by donald judd or robert morris , while some of josef s thinlegged tables and desks \( including one with a doubledecker top \) point directly to judd s furniture , examples of which are on view upstairs at the cooperhewitt anni , who cited paul klee as one of her primary influences , was an equally sensitive colorist , expert at contrasting shades and also at shifting weaving techniques so that one color could read as two as an extended vitrine of 24 textile samples suggests , she sustained over decades the ability to make handsome , restrained fabrics the different kinds of threads and weaving techniques involved can mesmerize when studied closely she had a genius for making every thread count and for making structure seem both intelligible and mysterious this is a teaching show in which learning is a pleasure , perhaps because the alberses' sense of form was implicitly , almost luxuriously didactic their designs prove that while form is clearest when it follows function , it also emanates from dozens of small decisions about structure , materials , scale and color form is the finale , the culminating chord , created by these choices looking at it is a matter of picking out the constituent notes , listening to each individually to gain a fuller appreciation of the whole josef and anni albers designs for living remains at the cooperhewitt national design museum , 2 east 91st street , manhattan , \( 212 \) 8498400 , through feb 27
it s midseason in cheer nation this winter , thousands of girls will travel on college allstar teams to take part in competitions across the country practicing more than 20 hours a week , they will refine a routine of back flips , handsprings , roundoffs and splits all perfectly synchronized and timed to an olympic second their goal first place their game competitive cheerleading , one of the fastestgrowing sports for women in america last year , the university of maryland became the first division i ncaa institution to recognize competitive cheerleading as a varsity sport that means team members are accorded the same benefits as other campus athletes a coaching and medical staff locker rooms help with academics help dealing with the press by the 200506 academic year , maryland will provide 12 full scholarships to competitive cheerleaders the question is this what took so long \? \( time out for a definition competitive cheerleading overlaps with but is not identical to the spirit squads you see , say , on the sidelines of a saturday afternoon college football game the teams we 're talking about do cheer at school games , but they also compete against other schools in cheerleading competitions where they perform highrisk routines under highpressure circumstances \) for too many years , cheerleading has been the subject of derision sports illustrated has lampooned it many americans fail to distinguish it from the sideline shows the dallas cowboy cheerleaders put on back when i was a cheerleader in high school in the late 70 s , we were called a sideshow in those days , we performed at every sporting event football , basketball and baseball we practiced three days a week purchased our own uniforms \( skirts , sweaters , trunks , socks , saddle shoes \) and were responsible for our own steady supply of bandages ace bandages there were plenty of injuries , mostly to ligaments after a big game , my knee would swell my dad would offer a diagnosis water on the knee bandage it up , and then prescribe 50 reps on the knee machine but cheerleaders were n't allowed in the school weight room today , more than 200 , 000 highschool and college students attend cheerleading camps each year at least 15 percent of them participate in competitions the universal cheerleading association feeds its competitions to espn for lively weekend fare when these events were televised last year , they drew an average audience of 334 , 000 homes for all its popularity , though , the sport is governed or not governed by a patchwork of entities schools may treat cheerleaders as athletes but they do n't have to some offer little more than a uniform and a gameday parking pass others offer scholarships none offer the fullrange of support and benefit that maryland does for competitive cheerleading what s more , cheerleading is not even recognized by the ncaa as a sport given the nature of competitive cheerleading , this seems like a risky proposition think about it in what other sport is an athlete tossed more than 30 feet in the air smiling before spiraling down into the arms of a trusted teammate \? lifts and tosses and catches are the mainstay of competitive cheerleading fliers do not wear hip pads or kneepads or helmets there is little to protect a cheerleader from awkward or poor landings on the gym floor not surprisingly , cheerleading is the no 1 cause of serious sports injuries to women , according to the national center for catastrophic sport injury research , ahead of gymnastics and track from 1980 to 2001 , emergency room visits for cheerleading injuries rose fivefold pushing colleges to recognize competitive cheerleading as a sport will surely help to cut down on injuries right now , the american association of cheering coaches and advisers publishes a manual and administers a safety certification program , but only a fraction of coaches have been certified many cheerleaders try dangerous stunts without proper training , coaching and supervision of course , convincing other schools to make competitive cheerleading an official sport wo n't be easy according to deborah yow , maryland s athletic director , it took more than a year to make sure that the university s cheerleading squad would meet all the guidelines set forth by the department of education s office of civil rights while the department does not define what is or is not a sport , it does determine whether a university s given activity such as cheerleading can be considered a sport in order to comply with title ix is maryland s action entirely altruistic \? probably not it doubtless relieves some title ix pressure but what s wrong with that \? and would it be so wrong to ask the ncaa to sponsor and govern the sport \? after all , when the big collegiate cheerleading competitions begin next month , hundreds of thousands of people will tune in , acknowledging the importance of cheerleading more ncaa colleges would be wise to follow suit
washington squandered many chances before sept 11 , 2001 , to reform the nation s outdated , encrusted intelligence bureaucracy after the 2001 terrorist attacks exposed those agencies' horrifying shortcomings , the bush administration made a stab at reform but it involved halfmeasures that avoided the politically risky steps needed to fix the whole problem with the publication today of the report by the bipartisan commission on 9 11 and its recommendations on how to better protect the country , president bush and congress are getting another chance the nation cannot afford for them to pass it up the panel is expected to recommend a muchneeded change in the duties of the director of central intelligence , who has three jobs but not the power to do any of them particularly well the director is supposed to run the central intelligence agency and act as the president s chief adviser on intelligence he is also nominally in charge of supervising and coordinating the 14 other intelligence agencies scattered through the federal government but the director has no authority over their staffs or their budgets about 85 percent of the intelligence money goes to the pentagon he is not part of the president s team , like the national security adviser , and just managing the cia is more than a fulltime job anyone who doubts the magnitude of this problem should read the december 1998 memo from george tenet , who recently resigned as director , telling the intelligence agencies to consider themselves at war against terrorists and ordering that there should be no resources or people spared in this effort it was a stirring challenge , but very few officials read it , and those who did failed to do much of anything in response news reports say the panel will recommend leaving the head of the cia to run that agency , and creating a new post in the president s executive office to take over the other two jobs that person would have veto power over hiring and the authority to fire people in operational intelligence posts , including those in the defense department and the fbi , as well as control of their budgets anyone familiar with washington knows that kind of change wo n't be easy it s never easy to trim a powerful official s turf defense secretary donald rumsfeld , who tried to create his own minicia at the pentagon , is hardly going to welcome this change nevertheless , it s an excellent idea , and congress should quickly figure out how to do it congress and the president can decide whether that means creating a new cabinet secretary , or a post with some other rank it s important , however , that this new official be subject to senate confirmation lawmakers have been lining up all week to announce , depending on their party , that mr bush should get busy on all of this , or that they 're sure he will do a great job on it that s all well and good , but it misses the point , which is that congress desperately needs to fix itself , too the budgetary and operational oversight of all 15 intelligence agencies should be consolidated efficient oversight is impossible when officials have to scramble from one committee to another , with none taking full responsibility the homeland security department , ludicrously , now reports to nearly 90 committees the times reports today that the 9 11 panel wisely recommends that these arrangements be consolidated into two committees in each house , one for intelligence oversight and one for homeland security congress has it fully within its power to do that reform will require members of congress to give up turf , porkbarrel opportunities and other perquisites , but it s time for them to make a few of the sacrifices in defense of national security that have been much discussed by politicians but generally imposed only on soldiers and their families news reports have made it clear that the panel s judgment of both the clinton and bush administrations before 9 11 is harsh , as well as its assessment of mr bush s efforts since then the president s reelection team will try to counter these charges , just as it attacked the panel earlier for refuting mr bush s claims of an alliance between iraq and al qaeda that s politics in an election year but this is a unanimous report from a bipartisan panel and since mr bush has settled on america is safer as his reelection theme , we 're hoping for a sober , practical response to its recommendations
washington , sept 21 the commission on presidential debates told the bush and kerry campaigns tuesday that it could not accede to their unusual request that it sign by wednesday their 32page agreement detailing parameters for the debates first of all , the commission said , it has to determine which candidates have enough support in the polls to qualify for the debates , which it does not plan to do until friday regardless of the timing , the new requirement that the independent commission as well as the four journalists selected to moderate the debates sign onto the pact between the two candidates has made some people involved in the process uncomfortable the memorandum of understanding negotiated by the campaigns also includes an unusual level of prescriptions , particularly over the townhallstyle debate scheduled for oct 8 , which some say undermines the idea of a voterdriven discussion it states several times that audience participation , outside the forum questioners , is prohibited , and calls for visible timing lights , so viewers will know if someone is filibustering the interesting thing here is the lengths they go to to restrict the questioning at the town hall , said martin plissner , a debate expert and former cbs news political director it makes the whole process look kind of ridiculous it will have to be extremely mechanical the agreement includes four pages of provisions up from one in 2000 about the townhallstyle debate , including a requirement that the moderator , charles gibson , present to the campaigns by oct 1 a questionselection method mr gibson is to ensure that the audience members pose equal numbers of questions on foreign policy , domestic security and other domestic issues alternate the candidates to whom their queries are directed and not alter their preselected questions on the fly instead of the uncommitted voters typically invited to such events , the auditorium is to be filled with those identified by the gallup polling organization as leaning toward but not firmly committed to mr bush and mr kerry , and mr gibson would have to call on the same number of people from each side if any audience member poses a question or makes a statement that is in any material way different than the question that the audience member earlier submitted to the moderator for review , the moderator will cut off the questioner and advise the audience that such nonreviewed questions are not permitted , the agreement reads the men who negotiated the agreement , james a baker iii for mr bush and vernon jordan for mr kerry , did not return telephone calls tuesday but several people involved in the debate discussions said most of these details were demanded by the republicans none of this really matters , said christine anderson , a spokeswoman for mr kerry s debatenegotiation team what matters are the issues that are going to be discussed , the questions george bush needs to answer , the plans we 're going to lay for the future the rest is all details one new detail that democrats involved in the process say was the bush team s idea is having the commission and the moderators sign the document before , just the two campaigns signed at this point in time , we 're not sure we will sign the agreement , said frank j fahrenkopf , who has been the republican cochairman of the commission since its inception in 1987 we 've never done it before it really is an agreement between the two parties several of the journalists scheduled to moderate the debate expressed uncertainty about signing , which the agreement says they must do seven days before their scheduled debate in order to evidence his or her understanding and acceptance of , and agreement to , the provisions hereof , or else the campaigns will pick someone else i do n't think that news people like the idea of signing onto documents negotiated by politicians , said thomas e mann , a scholar at the brookings institution with expertise in debates mark wallace , mr bush s deputy campaign manager , said such signatures were necessary because of the more detailed guidelines set out for the forum and the other debates if you 're going to have those real rules , i think you have to have the buy in from the moderators , mr wallace said if they 're going to be moderators to a presidential debate , it makes sense that they uphold the rules on friday , the commission will determine which candidates meet its threshold of 15 percent support in five polls to qualify for the debates president bush and mr kerry would clearly qualify left on the sidelines would be the independent candidate ralph nader , whose poll numbers have been under 5 percent after that , the commission said in a news release , it will be pleased to finalize with the invited candidates debate ground rules and other technical matters , but will be guided by its goal of providing the american people with informative debates among the topics likely to come up are the timing lights in previous debates , only the candidates and the moderators could see the lights signaling they had run out of time , but the bush campaign pushed to have the lights visible to the audience and accompanied with audible cues , perhaps because of mr kerry s penchant for long answers the candidates are going to end up looking like game show hosts , one debate expert said
capt theodore c polet sr , an army counterintelligence officer at the detention camp for terrorism suspects at guant \? mo bay , cuba , had just begun investigating a report of suspicious behavior by a muslim chaplain at the prison last year when he received what he thought was alarming new information the fbi had found that a car belonging to the chaplain , capt james j yee , had been spotted twice outside the home of a muslim activist in the seattle area who , years earlier , had been a host for a visit from omar abdel rahman , the militant egyptian cleric convicted in a 1993 plot to blow up various new york landmarks although it was unclear what the activist had done or whether captain yee even knew him , captain polet took the report to the guant \? mo commander , maj gen geoffrey d miller , and laid it out in stark terms i said we had found something that connected yee with a known terrorist supporter in washington state , and at that point , he got very upset , captain polet said , noting that general miller s ears turned red with anger this became far more serious than a basic security violation the case was going to get bigger in fact , documents and interviews show that the case grew much bigger than has been publicly disclosed , spinning into a web of counterintelligence investigations that eventually involved more than a dozen suspects , a handful of military and civilian agencies and numerous agents in the united states and overseas within less than a year , however , the investigations into espionage and aiding the enemy grew into a major source of embarrassment for the pentagon , as the prosecutions of captain yee and another muslim serviceman at the base , airman ahmad i al halabi , unraveled dramatically even now , defense department officials refuse to explain in detail how the investigations originated and what drove them forward in the face of questions about much of the evidence military officials involved in the case have defended their actions , emphasizing that some of the inquiries continue but confidential government documents , court files and interviews show that the investigations drew significantly on questionable evidence and disparate bits of information that , like the car report , linked captain yee tenuously to people suspected of being muslim militants in the united states and abroad officials familiar with the inquiries said they also fed on petty personal conflicts antipathy between some muslim and nonmuslim troops at guant \? mo , rivalries between christian and muslim translators , even the complaint of an old boss who saw airman al halabi as a shirker the military s aggressive approach to the investigation was established at the outset by general miller , the hardcharging guant \? mo commander along the way , some investigators and prosecutors suggested that the job of ferreting out spies at the base had put them , too , on the front lines of the fight against terrorism perhaps the most aggressive was the lead air force investigator in the case of airman al halabi , lance r wega , a probationary agent who took over the inquiry after barely a month on the job while he was later commended by superiors and rewarded with a 1 , 986 bonus , testimony showed that agent wega had mishandled important evidence ultimately , air force prosecutors could not substantiate a vast majority of the charges they brought against airman al halabi , a translator at guant \? mo , who had faced the death penalty he pleaded guilty in september to four relatively minor charges of mishandling classified documents , taking two forbidden photographs of a guard tower and lying to investigators about the snapshots he was sentenced to the 10 months imprisonment he had already served , and is appealing a badconduct discharge captain yee , 36 , a west point graduate from springfield , nj , was held for 76 days in solitary confinement , charged with six criminal counts of mishandling classified information and suspected of leading a ring of subversive muslim servicemen he was found guilty only of noncriminal charges of adultery and downloading internet pornography that conviction was set aside in april , and his punishment was waived another guant \? mo interpreter , and sometime interrogator , ahmed f mehalba , has been jailed since september 2003 on federal charges that he lied to investigators who found that at least two classified documents on a compact disc he had taken with him on a trip to visit relatives in egypt he has pleaded not guilty coloring much of the episode , interviews and documents indicate , were simmering tensions over the military s treatment of the roughly 660 foreign men who were then held at guant \?

it s april , and in the new york area , the redbuds are beginning to bloom their clusters of tightly packed flowers on slim branches are turning this compact tree into a trend i planted three different kinds seven years ago , when redbuds \( cercis \) were still fairly rare at nurseries while they are easy to grow , they can be difficult to propagate , so most nurseries were stocking easily produced dogwoods , which like the redbud also offer lovely spring flowers and spectacular autumn leaves \( bright yellow for the redbud and burnished red for the dogwood \) then a strain of anthracnose fungus struck , killing thousands of dogwoods redbuds , which are not affected by this disease , suddenly gained notice redbuds offer an incredible genetic diversity they come in different shapes , from weeping like willows to growing in compact forms small enough to qualify as shrubs flowers can be mauve , magenta or white leaves range from small and glossy to large and soft , and leaf color from plum purple to rich green and variegated green and white along with their variety , i was attracted by the lowcare nature of these trees they require no pruning or special watering and have survived hard winters and dry summers in my new jersey garden their main threat is canker disease , which is widespread but slow growing typically , it limits the life span of redbuds to about 25 years forest pansy , a cultivar of the eastern redbud \( cercis canadensis \) , is my favorite this month its bare branches are covered with tightly packed clusters of rosepurple flowers just as the two to threeweek bloom period ends , reddish purple leaves emerge through sheer luck , i planted this tree in a perfect spot , one that is flooded with morning sun and shaded the rest of the day i chose the location because it is only six feet away from a living room window , allowing me to see the tree in all its colorful glory i have since learned that the sun helps to bring out the purple color and that the shade provides the coolness needed to hold it botanists have had a hard time classifying cercis the texas white cultivar , with white flowers and glossy leaves , illustrates the problem it was originally thought to be a separate species and was classified as c reniformis , a name under which it is often sold today but then botanists decided that all eastern redbuds found in the south , including texas white , were not a separate species but a subspecies c canadensis subspecies texensis or c canadensis ssp mexicana in yet another stroke of luck , i placed my texas white in a sunny area the glossy coating on the leaves prevents excess moisture evaporation , allowing this tree to flourish in hot areas my luck ran out when i planted my chinese redbud , c chinensis , in a spot with only an hour or so of morning sun many horticulturists consider this the most beautiful of redbuds native to central china , it flowers earlier and more profusely than the eastern redbuds and has lustrous dark green leaves it can be grown either as a shrub or a small tree the cultivar avondale is a highly sought tree form with striking magenta flowers none of these attributes were noticeable in my chinese redbud because i failed to plant it in full sun last month i moved it , looking forward to a fine display chinese redbuds , unlike most eastern varieties , are easy to propagate from cuttings at the national arboretum near washington , dr margaret pooler , a research geneticist , has released don egolf , a chinese redbud cultivar named for a renowned breeder at the arboretum bearing prolific rosymauve flowers , don egolf is compact \( reaching only nine feet after 15 years \) and exceptionally diseaseresistant at the jc raulston arboretum , part of north carolina state university , another horticulturist , dr dennis werner , is trying to create seedgrown hybrids he is working with beautiful eastern redbud cultivars like covey , which looks like a fivefoottall weeping willow drenched in rosy purple spring flowers flame , which features double flowers and silver cloud , with foliage that looks as if green paint had been flung onto a white background he hopes to start releasing his hybrids in about five years by that time , dr pooler suspects , my redbuds will probably have developed canker disease while it will be sad to lose the ones i have now , it is exciting to think of the beautiful new ones that will be ready to take their place a wide selection of redbuds are available from forestfarm , www forestfarm com or \( 541 \) 8467269 , and from roslyn nursery , www roslynnursery com or \( 631 \) 6439347
new york city has one memento from the 2004 republican national convention that seems destined to last an especially bitter dispute over the city s methods and motives in detaining hundreds of protesters , well beyond the ordinary legal time limit of 24 hours , without the usual access to lawyers at times , the police department kept people in custody for two days or more before issuing them tickets for offenses like disorderly conduct led by a vigorous defense from mayor michael r bloomberg , city officials say they did their best under a sudden and extraordinary flood of arrests , acknowledging that bystanders may have been swept up lawyers for a number of protesters say what the city did amounted to illegal preventive detention , a calculated effort to limit the chances of confrontation and possible embarrassment the full dimensions of the dispute may emerge in a contemptofcourt hearing for the city on sept 27 , and in civil lawsuits that have been filed or are threatened what is clear now from interviews , a review of newly released city and state records , and a decision from a previously undisclosed court hearing is that the city s new system for speedy processing of mass arrests failed its first major test that week at least one of the city s major justifications for delays in releasing protesters is not supported by state records in addition , the city chose not to abide by a state judge s direct order to grant lawyers immediate access to their clients when another judge gave deadlines for the release of certain prisoners who had been held at length , top city officials repeatedly came back to court to report that they could not track the prisoners down in time there were 1 , 781 arrests in all while the mayor has accurately noted that prosecutors have dropped very few of the arrests , it is also true that more than 600 of the cases have been provisionally dismissed , indicating that the police detention amounted to a more severe punishment than any the courts would impose the city s top lawyer , michael c cardozo , told a judge that much of the delay was not caused by the city , since it took five or six hours to get the fingerprints from albany , referring to criminal history records maintained by the state yet state officials have a different story they say that they sent 94 percent of the fingerprint reports to the city in one hour or less only one set of fingerprints of 3 , 620 processed by the state from aug 30 to sept 3 took as long as five hours to return to new york city authorities , according to a computer report provided by jessica scaperotti , a spokeswoman for the state s division of criminal justice services numerous lawyers said they could not see their clients while they were in city custody that state of affairs persisted even after a state supreme court judge in manhattan , emily jane goodman , drove to the courthouse at midnight on sept 1 , and signed an order requiring the city to allow defense lawyers to meet their clients forthwith yet when defense lawyers delivered her order to corrections guards at a jail in the courthouse at 2 30 am on sept 2 , they were kept waiting nearly two hours and then were denied entry , according to daniel l alterman , one of the lawyers the city refused to honor a lawful order of the court , mr alterman said numerous other lawyers said they , too , had not been allowed to meet their clients in city jails or at a hudson river pier used by the police department as a holding area mr cardozo , the city s corporation counsel , said that he believed state law gave the city the right to an automatic stay of justice goodman s order in order to appeal to a higher court john feinblatt , the city s criminal justice coordinator , said that for logistical reasons , lawyers normally are not permitted to see their clients until they are in courthouse pens for arraignment , a point strongly disputed by defense lawyers there could n't have been a night when safety reasons , security reasons , and efficiency reasons were more paramount , mr feinblatt said a second state judge , john cataldo of supreme court , gave the city a series of deadlines to bring prisoners before the court or release them during the last two days of the convention mr cardozo and mr feinblatt told the judge that locating the prisoners was complicated because there were four places where they might be nearly 24 hours after the judge began setting deadlines that were not met , he held the city in contempt of court in the next three hours , at least 311 people were released , records show mr bloomberg has said that the office of robert m morgenthau , the manhattan district attorney , had declined to prosecute only three of the arrests the district attorney obviously thinks we behaved correctly and arrested the right people , mr bloomberg said the prosecutor s office confirmed this week that it had dismissed only three cases still , of the 1 , 102 people who went before judges , 70 have pleaded guilty and 621 cases were adjourned in contemplation of dismissal , according to barbara thompson , a spokeswoman for mr morgenthau such dismissals require the person to stay out of trouble for six months they are a common outcome of minor arrests , including those made at major protests the uproar over the arrests and detentions began near the end of a tumultuous week of demonstrations during the convention , which were largely free of the violence and destruction that had been predicted by some authorities mr bloomberg has said that the larger picture shows that the city did an excellent job of keeping the streets safe and protecting civil rights mr bloomberg said that the city wanted to move faster in getting people out of jail , but that the police were stymied by an extraordinarily high number of arrests , including hundreds made within several hours on the tuesday of convention week he and his senior aides say the extended detentions were simply a byproduct of the city s diligence in maintaining public order , while ensuring that hundreds of thousands of people could safely exercise free speech rights in dozens of marches , protests and demonstrations for the lawyers of many of those arrested , however , the city seemed to have swept up protesters , then managed the arrest process to keep them away from judges and in police custody until president bush spoke on the last night of the convention the tactics amounted , said norman siegel , a civil rights lawyer , to preventative detention that charge was described as a patent lie by police commissioner raymond w kelly , who noted that protesters were moved through the system quickly until nearly 1 , 200 people were arrested in one fourhour period on aug 31 the system had been swamped , mr cardozo told justice cataldo yesterday was the largest number of arrests in the history of manhattan , he said in fact , while the total number of arrests on that evening 1 , 128 was extraordinarily high for any borough , it was 30 percent lower than the total on june 14 , 1982 that morning , 1 , 691 people were arrested at disarmament demonstrations in midtown justice cataldo took note of the circumstances of the mass arrests but pressed the city to begin releasing people who had been charged only with violations and had been in custody for more than 36 hours more than a decade ago , the state court of appeals said that in the absence of extraordinary circumstances that could not be foreseen , people who have been arrested must be brought before a judge within 24 hours on an ordinary day in manhattan , when roughly 260 people are arrested , they are brought before a judge , on average , in 237 hours , mr feinblatt said yesterday in repeated appearances before justice cataldo , mr cardozo and mr feinblatt said they were trying hard to comply with the order but were encountering significant problems in tracking down the prisoners during those proceedings , on sept 2 , mr siegel , mr alterman , and other lawyers from the legal aid society and the national lawyers guild obtained a writ of habeas corpus , one of the judiciary s most powerful , if sparingly used , tools issued by justice cataldo , it ordered the police department to bring the prisoners to court or release them deputy chief john j colgan , who oversaw the operations of the mass arrest facility at the west side pier , said each prisoner went through an intricate , careful process they were unloaded from buses , photographed with the arresting officer , and searched , he said their belongings were listed on an inventory everything was itemized , line by line , chief colgan said he and mr cardozo both said that web sites had advised people going to the protests to bring laden backpacks for the purpose of bogging down the system in addition , many of those arrested more than 60 percent were from out of state and were carrying all they had brought with them when they were arrested , said mr feinblatt of the mayor s office each case was also reviewed by lawyers from the police department s legal division before it was sent to the district attorney s office after that , the arrested people were taken from the pier to central booking in lower manhattan where they were fingerprinted , and a computer docket was created of their arrest justice cataldo wondered why the city had not simply dispensed with the fingerprinting process he noted that in the vast majority of the arrests , the offenses were so minor that state law did not require fingerprints , unless the police were dissatisfied with the proof of identity , or because they suspected that the person might be wanted on a warrant mr feinblatt said the fingerprints were essential it s criminal justice 101 , he said if you had forgone the printing , you 'd have no idea if there were warrants mr feinblatt was unable to say yesterday if anyone arrested at the protests was wanted elsewhere he was asked about the discrepancy between the city s assertion that it was taking five to six hours for fingerprint reports to come from albany , and the state report showing that nearly all were produced in less than an hour a number of them took much longer than five hours , he insisted the state report shows only one that took four to five hours to produce , and none that took more than five hours another source of delay in receiving the fingerprint reports could have been a backlog in computer printing , city officials suggested during the court proceedings , justice cataldo held the city in contempt for not bringing the prisoners to court or releasing them , as he had ordered mr cardozo said the city would appeal that order throughout those sessions , the judge and the defense lawyers repeatedly asked why people charged with such minor crimes were being held for so long near midnight on sept 2 , five protesters were still in custody mr cardozo urged the judge not to order their release unlike most of those arrested in demonstrations , they had been accused of felonies riot and assault using authentic credentials , they were among a group of 12 who got onto the floor of madison square garden and disrupted a speech by a white house aide mr cardozo said , i would also like to say that these are very serious offenses some of the people were seen on national television there was a serious threat in madison square garden their cases turned out to be not all that grave by the next morning , the manhattan district attorney s office had decided to drop the riot and assault charges all that remains of the original charges , according to robert gottlieb , a lawyer representing a number of protesters , is disorderly conduct

pleasantville , ny if any university in the new york suburbs was going to have a shepherd on the faculty , it figured to be pace university and if anyone at pace was going to fill the position , it was an absolute nobrainer that it would be james eyring pace , over the years , has made a name for itself with its programs in environmental studies and environmental law and mr eyring , a hobbitlike character with a preternatural bond with the falcons , owls , iguanas and prairie dogs he keeps on campus , is , by all indications , part man , part critter so on a lot of campuses it might seem strange to have a shaggy , bearded character with a shepherd s staff herding canada geese with two blackandwhite border collies or hollering out ancient shepherd commands come by , away to me , that 'll do as the dogs chase five sheep and one goat around a fenced pen but on pace s 200acre campus , having the university look like the film babe with backpacks and ipods is just business as usual mr eyring s path to shepherd status had a messy beginning like much of suburbia , the pace campus in pleasantville , one of seven the university has in new york city , westchester and the hudson valley , had a problem for years with one of nature s least loved creatures like hundreds of parks , golf courses and suburban backyards , pace had become increasingly overrun by geese and where there are geese there are droppings a single goose produces 15 pounds of droppings a day and defecates about every seven minutes \( with more than 32 million geese in the united states and a lifespan of 20 years , you do the math \) you had to tiptoe through the wasabi to get to class , said mr eyring , 46 , assistant director of the pace environmental center the school tried everything balloons with huge eyes , recordings of gunshots and predator howls , fences , spraying the grass with something that smelled like grape bubble gum they thought of it as salad dressing , he said finally , about seven years ago , the school decided to try something that s been done before in other places bring in border collies the dogs' instinct to obsessively ride herd applies to geese as well as sheep , and they are so insistent and scary about it that geese hate it enough to go elsewhere mr eyring was the shepherd apparent he had all but grown up in the kennel his father used to own in north salem he was an expert falconer with an amazing rapport with animals and he had a secret agenda he loved taking a dog to work , and as pace grew , taking dogs to work was n't something the university was comfortable with but if the dogs worked while he worked , that was another matter soon he was taking lessons on instructing dell , now 8 , and later he added abby , now 5 it was a perfect combination , he said the dogs are a little neurotic , very driven , they just love to work , and i'm kind of a compulsive myself , so we work real well together i ca n't leave the university on any day while there are canada geese around , and the dogs are the same way , even if we have to come back three , four , five times a day before too long , the dogs were a stunning success where there had been 257 geese on campus , there were soon none , as the dogs functioned like a hulking big brother ruining a sister s date always there , always watching , always exuding a sneaky , lupine presence that drove the geese crazy but success had its downside for border collies , the work is the reward if they drove the geese off every time they herded them , it ruined the fun , he said they just felt hurt , mr eyring said they 've been bred for centuries to return a flock to the shepherd so when the geese left , they just felt defeated they did n't want to work it s like there was no reward he consulted with a connecticut dog trainer who advised him to beef up his other stock and let the dogs work there when the geese are n't around and soon dell and abby were skulking around like wolves , running around the flock in a clockwise direction when he yelled , come by , running counterclockwise when he yelled , away to me , and in general just running the heck out of the sheep and the goat or a more unruly mess of indian runner ducks kept on campus in between , they 're out stalking the campus in search of any returning geese it s a limited solution the geese chased off pace are probably just hanging out nearby but absent a longterm solution , mr eyring gets to bring his dogs to work , the geese get run off almost as soon as they return , and the dogs get to work regularly , if not quite as often as they 'd like these dogs , he said admiringly , would work until they dropped dead if we let them our towns email peappl nytimescom
the bush administration expressed interest on thursday in a saudi proposal to send an allmuslim security force to iraq , but foreign policy experts voiced skepticism that the plan would result in substantial contributions of troops the proposal , made to secretary of state colin l powell this week during a visit to jidda , saudi arabia , aims to help stabilize iraq and lend regional credibility to the interim government in baghdad some members of the coalition in iraq are considering pulling out , having served through the june 28 transfer of authority to a new government ukraine , for example , said thursday that it had begun talks with the united states and poland on withdrawing its 1 , 600 troops nations are also under pressure from terrorists in iraq , which are increasingly using kidnapping and execution as a way to deter cooperation with the americans and the interim government five american allies have withdrawn their troops , including the philippines , which won the release of a hostage by departing ahead of schedule one possible contributor to a muslim force , pakistan , has engaged in highlevel talks with saudi officials about a role but pakistan was rocked by the news on thursday that islamist extremists had executed two pakistani hostages in iraq mr powell , in an appearance on thursday with iraq s interim prime minister , ayad allawi , called the saudi proposal an interesting idea he suggested that a muslim force could provide security for facilities or protection for united nations personnel the secretary said certain obstacles to muslim and arab nations' sending troops had been removed various muslim nations around the world have been considering participation , he said many of them said they needed to see a un mandate there is now a un mandate under 1546 , mr powell said , referring to a security council resolution approved on june 5 supporting formation of the interim government they also said they wished to see a sovereign government there is now a sovereign government that is up and running prime minister allawi , on a tour of the region , said he was reaching out to muslim nations who had largely opposed the american invasion of iraq , in the hope they would stand together to confront terrorism the conscience of the islamic world and the arab world should be the motive and the power behind that , he said these are challenges , and these challenges are harming the security of the region and these countries and we must confront them iraqi officials have said they do not want nations that border iraq to contribute to a security force , ruling out saudi arabia , kuwait , iran , turkey , syria and jordan crown prince abdullah of saudi arabia has spent three weeks sounding out nations in the region and consulting with secretary general kofi annan , according to saudi officials saudi arabia would provide aid but not troops the nations discussed as possible contributors of troops included pakistan , bangladesh , malaysia , indonesia , algeria , morocco , yemen and bahrain diplomats from algeria , tunisia and bahrain met this week with iraq s foreign minister , hoshyar zebari , to discuss the plan , agence francepresse reported steven a cook , an iraq expert at the council on foreign relations , said such a force , while vital to attempts to establish the new government s legitimacy , would have more symbolic than military significance , because none of the possible contributors field especially capable militaries also , he said , signs of opposition within the region were already emerging before the idea could be fully voiced in egypt , for example , officials dismissed the notion of selecting peacekeepers based on their religion these forces could be like any other un forces that include different troops from different countries , regardless of ethnicity and religion , magid abdul fattah , a spokesman for the egyptian president , said wednesday
frankfurt , oct 20 six months after the european union admitted 10 new members , capping their journey from communism to the free market , they got a blunt reminder that the club s inner sanctum , its currency union , will remain off limits to them for several years the european central bank said in a report issued wednesday that fewer than half the new members had met the fiscal requirements to adopt the euro none had met the political requirements , like compatibility of its central bank statutes with those of the european central bank , according to a companion report by the european commission the bank , the currency s guardian , said many of the countries were moving too slowly in cutting their budget deficits to levels below the ceiling mandated by the maastricht treaty , which created the monetary union they have their weak points and they have their strong points , and life is difficult for all of them , said the president of the bank , jeanclaude trichet , at a news conference here mr trichet said there was no timetable for countries to adopt the euro , echoing what is by now the conventional wisdom here with the exception of estonia and one or two of its baltic neighbors , none of these countries will be ready for the euro until the end of the decade that is a remarkable turnabout from the heady days just before the expansion of the european union , when political leaders in budapest , prague , warsaw and bratislava talked about adopting the euro in short order now , in prague , the finance ministry and the central bank are squabbling about whether the czech republic can meet even the less ambitious deadline of 2010 the reason for much of the backsliding , experts say , is the political upheaval that erupted in many countries after they entered the union the collapse of coalition governments and a revolving door of prime ministers has scrambled fiscal policies and raised doubts about the independence of their central banks some countries that were ahead fell back , in the context of elections , said otmar issing , the bank s chief economist , who oversaw the report that is the normal process in a democracy in some countries , the political tumult is taking on a lessthandemocratic flavor hungary s newly elected prime minister , ferenc gyurcsany , is pushing legislation in parliament that would allow him to appoint half the members of the governing board of the central bank mr gyurcsany , a millionaire businessman and onetime communist youth leader , is unhappy that the central bank has set interest rates at 11 percent the highest in europe to curb hungary s high 66 percent inflation the new law , if approved , could tilt the board in favor of the prime minister it s very dangerous , said a former president of the hungarian central bank , peter akos bod , in an interview it goes very much against european custom , and against the short history of the bank hungary s high rates are necessary to prevent runaway inflation , mr bod said the answer to the government s woes , he said , is to curb state borrowing its budget deficit is equal to 55 percent of gross domestic product well above the 3 percent cap mandated by brussels the czech republic has also struggled to stem a tide of red ink its deficit peaked at 126 percent of gross domestic product in 2003 , before falling to an estimated 5 percent this year that volatility prompted the deputy governor of the czech central bank , ludek niedermayer , to question whether the country will achieve its goal of reducing the deficit to below 3 percent by 2008 oliver st nnervenkatarama , an emerging market analyst at commerzbank , said it was no surprise that the czech republic was facing budget problems they 're under pressure because of the labor market , he said there are a few success stories estonia , with low inflation and almost no debt , has made amazing progress , according to mr issing it already pegs its currency to the euro , and could probably adopt the currency without disruption , analysts say but critics say that europe s demand for fiscal discipline is ringing hollow at a time when 5 of the 12 euro countries including the two largest , germany and france are in violation of the deficit rules mr trichet said the situation led to an obvious question regarding the deteriorating fiscal situation of the wouldbe members if germany and france do not abide by the rules , why should other countries \? still , the new countries have shown little sign of trying to use the germans and the french as an alibi for their own fiscal problems analysts say these countries recognize that they have to meet the requirements to get into the club before they can question the club s rules the bigger issue , some experts said , is that the race to adopt the euro has become less urgent for most countries they are struggling with thorny problems , like chronic unemployment , inflation and bankrupt pension systems , which a new currency will not solve it would n't be in the interest of these countries to be in the euro zone right now , said katinka barysch , the chief economist at the center for european reform in london it s not their main priority

raised questions about the suitability of the company s core product , an archaic and expensive type of mutual fund with sales fees that eat up half of an investor s firstyear contributions first command fought back it complained to the second mostpowerful general in the air force and it was heard the new york times has found that within three weeks of the legal office s posting , the air force issued a retraction , which it had allowed the company to edit it gave the company a letter of exoneration , signed by the air force s top legal officer , after letting the company edit that , too the air force legal staff stopped cooperating with a securities industry investigation into the company s practices and products and the air force effectively abandoned a broad inquiry of its own , letting local base authorities handle complaints one complaint was about a first command agent who had made veiled threats against a young officer in charleston , sc , suggesting he could be courtmartialed or sued for criticizing the company in an email message first command s success in its faceoff with air force lawyers was a stark illustration of how a company with strong military connections can influence the very people who are supposed to monitor its sales activities on bases one of those who felt that influence was thomas l farmer , who , from his pentagon office , worked on the first command inquiry for the judge advocate general s corps , which oversees the administration of justice and ethics for the air force mr farmer , who was a major at the time but has since left the service , said that neither the air force nor the company has acknowledged the chilling impact that the episode , especially the companyedited retraction , has had in the ranks most jag officers would take it as an endorsement of first command , mr farmer said of the retraction our being rebuked sends a message out to the field that 'well , they 're not going to be able to help us' when it comes to this company he added , when we tried to tackle it , first command could contact a fourstar general and stop us , to the point where first command is helping to write official air force material mercer bullard , president of fund democracy , an advocacy group for mutual fund shareholders' interests , said the episode underscored the danger of relying on the military to police the sale of financial products on bases the jag corps is the most independent , most likely agency in the military to stand up to these companies , said professor bullard , who teaches law at the university of mississippi if the jag corps ca n't do it , no one else in the military will be able to first command maintains that in appealing to the top ranks of the air force , it was seeking fair treatment , not special treatment what was put in that posting was inaccurate and unfair and harmed our company , said lanny j davis , a washington lawyer and former special counsel to the clinton administration who represents the company because we were concerned with getting a correction quickly , we could n't afford the luxury of going up the chain of command to get a remedy so we went as high as we could , to get it immediately the company went as high as gen t michael moseley , the air force vice chief of staff an air force spokesman , col gary halbert , said the general s role was fairly routine , intended only to ensure that the company got a prompt and appropriate response general moseley , the colonel said , did not intend to discourage the judge advocate general s corps from enforcing the rules that govern the sale of insurance and investments on military bases general moseley himself said in a written statement fighting and winning the global war on terrorism and providing support for our airmen are my top priorities we have made and will continue to make every effort to protect our airmen from unscrupulous salespeople and fraudulent products straight to the generals three events prompted mr farmer s office , the legal assistance and preventive law division , to send out the notice inquiring about first command the first was an email message in early july 2003 from vandenberg air force base in california complaining that some first command agents were using a senior officer s name without permission to get clerks to give them the telephone numbers of officer trainees a few weeks later , a brigadier general in the air national guard sent mr farmer s unit a copy of an article from kiplinger s personal finance magazine that criticized the expensive kind of mutual fund sold by first command then the office received a request for information from nasd , the securities industry regulatory group , which had opened an inquiry into first command the newsletter item , which also told field offices how to forward complaints to nasd , ran on aug 20 , 2003 , in the judge advocate general s corps internal electronic newsletter , the online news and it caught the attention of the air force unit in san antonio that oversees tops in blue , the touring air force talent show two days later , the program office asked first command about the item this was apparently the first the company had heard of it a spokesman for the judge advocate general , lt col doug murdock , said the item should never have gone beyond the jag corps unfortunately , he said , the article was interpreted as an indictment of first command s business practices lamar c smith , first command s chairman and chief executive , was quick to respond in an electronic memorandum titled thoughts , he acknowledged that the agent s threatening call to the young officer in charleston was an error and i will apologize for it but he also expressed his anger , adding , we have a real grievance against the officer shall we pursue our own remedies \? mr smith wrote if we do it will get harsh and expensive for the officer in a hurry the memo was sent to the air force by a senior vice president , kurt b anderson , a retired air force general a copy was obtained by the times , as were copies of other documents for this article , including email messages and handwritten notes of telephone conversations both the air force and first command verified the authenticity of the documents mr davis , the company s lawyer , said mr smith s thoughts had been written in the heat of the moment but he acknowledged that mr smith had been upset and frustrated with the air force and conveyed those feelings to senior officers one of them , the company said , was an old friend of mr smith , gen richard brown 3rd , now retired , who was the acting assistant vice chief of staff mr smith then sent a letter of outrage to general moseley , who had just become vice chief of staff the letter , dated aug 28 , cited the company s long support for tops in blue , condemned the kiplinger s article and complained that the jag item s author was inviting others to join his war on first command by filing complaints with regulators what the jag staff should have done , mr smith said , was report the vandenberg complaint and any others to first command the company would then have taken instant and withering action to discipline any agent involved , mr smith wrote he demanded that the jag office run a crystal clear retraction and advise officers in the field that the item should be disregarded the order is retracted a week later , the company said , another senior first command executive , rich giles , a former air force captain , telephoned general moseley , whom he had known for 30 years and on sept 5 , mr smith followed up with a second letter to general moseley warning that the company faced the early stages of a 'wild fire ' mr smith s complaint moved down the chain of command from general moseley to the judge advocate general , thomas j fiscus two days later , general fiscus called a staff member at home and loudly upbraided him for his staff s handling of the first command inquiry , notes in the jag files show he cited the letters and calls to general moseley and warned of possible litigation colonel murdock , the jag spokesman , said the general was reacting to his discovery that there were very limited complaints behind the office s original inquiry the staff was now directed to draft a retraction for the newsletter but its language did not satisfy general anderson , the first command executive , who was allowed to edit the item his version , published almost verbatim on sept 10 , 2003 , said that virtually no negative information about first command has been received as a result of the original item first command was allowed to edit the retraction because the air force believed that was appropriate to resolve the unfair impact of the item , colonel murdock said on sept 18 , first command got the letter of exoneration it had demanded the letter , too , was edited by the company , colonel murdock said one change , though small , was significant the air force s draft said the original item had been prompted by complaints first command proposed changing that to a single complaint lt col timothy guiden , mr farmer s boss , opposed the change , noting that four problems had been reported he was overruled , the documents show the letter tried to correct the record for their customers , undo any harm that had been done and level the playing field , colonel murdock said but military documents confirm that complaints continued to arrive , both in writing and made orally to general fiscus \( he temporarily stepped down last week pending the outcome of an unrelated air force investigation \) in each complaint , agents appeared to be trying to use command influence , the power of senior leaders to sway junior officers , on first command s behalf only the incidents at vandenberg and charleston were ever reported to first command , the company said its only disciplinary response was to counsel the agent in charleston , said mr davis , the company s lawyer the air force said that none of the other complaints had revealed any systemic problem and that all had been resolved at the local base level none were passed along to nasd , either after we got slapped down in such a public manner , continued cooperation with the nasd was off the table , mr farmer said nasd has nevertheless pursued its inquiry , which has been joined by the securities and exchange commission and should be concluded soon , congressional aides say since the times first examined first command s practices in a twopart series in july , the company has come under scrutiny in congress lawmakers are considering legislation to abolish the type of mutual funds the company sells and require the military to coordinate more closely with civilian regulators there was one small coda in january , first command notified the air force that it would no longer provide 150 , 000 a year to sponsor tops in blue the company said the decision was based on marketing considerations but one air force executive attributed the loss directly to the jag office s initial newsletter query about first command in an email message to general fiscus last jan 30 , the executive wrote this is 'water under the bridge' but wanted you to know the consequences of the article
wondo genet , ethiopia clothed in a white doctor s coat , lulseged tolla received patients on a recent day at the clinic in this dusty village along a rutted country road he advised a middleaged woman with abnormally heavy periods he examined an anemic woman suffering from lethargy as rain pattered on the roof , another woman walked in , a limp toddler draped on her shoulder mr tolla , 33 , looked down the boy s throat and listened to his breathing through a stethoscope , muttering , he has pneumonia he prescribed antibiotics and ordered a blood test to rule out malaria the mother thanked him respectfully , kissing her son s fevered forehead as she left in rural clinics across this impoverished nation , people like mr tolla are diagnosing and treating major killers diarrhea , pneumonia and malaria all of them have one thing in common they are trained to do the work of doctors , but none is actually a physician for that very reason , many international health specialists say these paraprofessionals offer a solution to one of the most vexing problems confronting african countries like ethiopia the brain drain of doctors to rich western nations and more prosperous african countries in mozambique , such health workers are already the mainstay of operating rooms , performing tens of thousands of lifesaving surgical procedures in malawi , they do emergency caesarean sections ethiopia , mozambique and malawi , desperately poor countries with extreme doctor shortages , are virtually doubling the still small number of such workers they are training while some raise concerns of whether the technicians' training is equal to the task , a few rigorous studies have found they provide decent care in fact , international health experts say the trend must accelerate if africa has any hope of grappling with its catastrophic epidemics of disease these substitute doctors are cheaper to train and pay than licensed doctors they are more willing to work in rural areas and they generally do not leave the country for greener pastures the joint learning initiative , a network of more than 100 scholars and experts studying the staffing crisis in health care , estimates that africa , which has 600 , 000 nurses and doctors , needs a million more there s no way for these countries to succeed with traditional doctors and nurses , said lincoln chen , a cochairman of the initiative and director of the global equity center at harvard university paraprofessional systems will have to be built throughout the continent to address this health crisis though these workers can help countries cope with the lack of doctors , they are not a panacea increasingly , they , too , are being lured away from public health by higher paying jobs in the private sector and expanding their ranks will not be simple typically , they receive three to five years of training after high school , depending on their level of specialization they are taught to tackle basic public health problems killing the most africans such programs have often run into determined opposition from influential surgeons and obstetricians the use of paraprofessionals in africa is not new in 1975 , after mozambique gained its independence from portugal , there were only 2 surgeons , 4 obstetricians and 80 doctors in a country of 14 million people the government put hundreds of high school graduates through three years of training and dispatched them to rural areas then , in the mid1980 s , it began giving some of them two extra years of training in surgery many women were dying in childbirth simply because there was no one to do emergency caesarean sections , a simple operation easily mastered through repetition in the past two decades , mozambique has managed to produce only 60 surgical technicians , but they still do most of the surgical procedures in rural areas where most people live last year , the country began training 27 more the majority of countries in africa do n't accept these kinds of workers , said fernando vaz , the surgeon in charge of their education they have doubts about their capacity but this is a solution for mozambique studies have documented that the quality of the technicians' work is good one compared caesarean sections performed by surgical technicians and obstetricians , detecting no statistically significant difference in outcomes of course , the technicos are usually better with their hands than most of the docs they work with , said dr colin mccord , an american surgeon who developed the mozambique curriculum and trained the first batch likewise , malawi also a deeply poor african country with a life expectancy of less than 40 years has doubled the number of such workers it trains to 90 per year malawi s sole medical school is just a dozen years old and has produced only 206 doctors the country has suffered a devastating exodus of nurses and midwives to the united kingdom the rate at which women die in childbirth doubled in the 1990 s malawi s paraprofessionals , known as clinical officers , now outnumber doctors three to one in the public health system they are at the forefront of emergency obstetrical care they are also the backbone of aids care as the country begins a rapid expansion of drug treatment the clinical officers are valued for their competence but also for the fact that they generally stay in malawi if you leave malawi as a clinical officer , what can you do \? asked michael o'carroll , senior technical adviser at the ministry of health if you leave malawi as a nurse , you can go anywhere in the world ethiopia , too , is turning to paraprofessionals , known here as health officers its mostly rural population of 69 million lives in a vast territory roughly as big as texas , oklahoma and new mexico combined the country is producing only 150 doctors a year at public expense , but two thirds of them never show up to work in public health as required many doctors , who make about 236 a month , go abroad and to other african countries or practice in the private sector more than 400 ethiopian doctors now work in the united states and canada , said dr ingida asfaw , a cardiothoracic surgeon in detroit who heads the ethiopian north american health professionals association ethiopia has found that health officers are less likely to avoid working in the public health system their numbers have risen to almost 500 in 2002 from 30 in 1996 the government is now making a major push to train health officers to perform caesarean sections without quick help , women with obstructed labors can bleed to death , die of infections or develop obstetric fistulas , a condition that allows urine and feces to run freely down the sufferer s legs we are not going to wait to produce surgeons , said girma azene , the health ministry s planning director surgeons are like gold dust you ca n't find them but health officers , too , can be tempted by better pay in ethiopia s private sector i do n't think any profession is immune from brain drain , said dr shiferaw teklemariam , who manages the public health system here in ethiopia s southern region the competing claims of public service and private profit are already tugging at mr tolla , who works in the rural clinic he is now finishing up the four years of service he owes the country for his education and is waiting to find out if he will be allowed to return to school for a master s degree if accepted , he will serve another four years in public health after he completes his degree if not , he said , he will quit for much higher pay in the private sector
in a single 17sentence document , the intelligence briefing delivered to president bush in august 2001 spells out the who , hints at the what and points toward the where of the terrorist attacks on new york and washington that followed 36 days later whether its disclosure does lasting damage to mr bush s presidency and reelection prospects may depend on whether the white house succeeds in persuading americans that , as a whole , its significance adds up to less than a sum of those parts in a written rebuttal twice as long as the document itself , the white house sought saturday night to drive home a single major point that the briefing did not warn of the 9 11 attacks the idea that al qaeda wanted to strike in the united states was already evident , senior officials argued they also said that while the document cited fresh details to make that case , they were insufficient to prompt any action still , after two years in which the white house sought to prevent the disclosure of the document , mr bush s critics are bound to seize on those details as evidence that the president had something to hide while the white house has insisted the document was mostly vague and historical , critics will certainly seek now to paint it as something historic at a time , in the summer of 2001 , when mr bush and his advisers have said that the vast bulk of intelligence information pointed to the danger of a terrorist attack abroad , the aug 6 briefing can be read as a clearcut warning that osama bin laden had his sights set on targets within the united states and had already launched operations within america s borders based in part on continuing investigations by the federal bureau of investigation and the central intelligence agency , the brief spelled out fresh reason for concern about qaeda attacks , very possibly using hijacked airplanes and conceivably in new york or washington depending on which side is arguing the point in this rancorous election year , the patterns of suspicious activity cited in the document will be presented either as yet another sign that the presept 11 warnings were always too vague to act on , as the white house has argued , or as new evidence that mr bush and his advisers were too slow to sense the danger at hand in making their case , white house officials who spoke to reporters in a conference call and issued a threepage fact sheet sought repeatedly to minimize the significance of the document none of the information relating to the 'patterns of suspicious activity' was later deemed to be related to the 9 11 attacks , the document issued by the white house said the idea that mr bin laden and his supporters wanted to carry out attacks in the united states , a senior official said , was already publicly known , while the fresh concerns outlined in the document about surveillance of federal buildings in new york , and a telephone warning to an american embassy in the persian gulf were being pursued aggressively by the appropriate agencies still , a preview of a very different assessment could be heard even last week , as democratic members of the independent commission on the sept 11 attacks confronted condoleezza rice , the national security adviser , with pointed questions about the briefing why , timothy j roemer , the former congressman , wanted to know in that session , had not mr bush , vacationing in texas , responded to the warnings at least by summoning cabinetlevel advisers for a meeting on terrorism , something that had not occurred by that point in his administration at a time when our intelligence experts were warning of a possible strike against the united states , it s clear that the administration did n't take the threat seriously enough to marshal the resources that might have possibly thwarted the attack , said senator john d rockefeller iv of west virginia , the top democrat on the intelligence committee in deciding to release the portion of the daily briefing document , something no previous white house has ever done , mr bush and his advisers were clearly attuned to the potential political damage that had been caused as its contents began to leak out following ms rice s testimony on thursday in taking the step , white house officials seemed determined to head off the protests before accounts in the sunday morning newspapers and on talk shows inflicted another round of damage but in taking the step after 6 pm on saturday , the day before easter , the white house may also have been seeking to shorten the time that critics might have to offer their own interpretations of the document particularly in recent weeks , after the former counterterrorism adviser richard a clarke accused the white house of having failed to treat terrorism as an urgent priority in the months before sept 11 , mr bush s advisers have asked that their actions be viewed in their proper context in the summer of 2001 , they have argued , the wave of warnings about possible attacks was indeed alarming , but it was almost always too vague to prompt any concrete action while the intelligence was often credible , they contend , it was rarely specific with the disclosure of the aug 6 document , however , the specific , contemporary nature of what it contained will almost certainly confront the white house with more questions asking what if \? of the specific , contemporary information , the most tantalizing may be the may 15 warning to the american embassy in the united arab emirates , saying that a group of bin laden supporters was in the us planning attacks with explosives white house officials said saturday they had no information connecting that call to the sept 11 attacks but they conceded that they could not rule out such a link nothing pointed to a specific attack in a specific location , a senior white house official said on saturday night , in trying to minimize the significance of the cia s concern about the patterns of suspicious activity whether that lack of specificity should have made it any less arresting as a call to action by mr bush and his aides will be debated in the days ahead , perhaps most importantly by the commission as it prepares to render a judgment about mr bush s performance
minneapolis , oct 8 thirtyfive days after kevin brown , a grown man of 39 years old , thought the best solution to a frustrating night was to punch a clubhouse wall , he was in position to help save or help spoil a season he could have damaged almost as much as his left hand brown got a chance at redemption with the yankees , a quick chance to dull an embarrassing episode even brown , a stubborn , ornery sort who utters about two sentences a week , realized how fortunate he was to be starting such a game when brown punched the clubhouse wall and broke his hand on sept 3 , he displayed a selfishness and silliness that could have delayed his next pitch until 2005 but brown was remorseful , he was rehabilitated and rejuvenated enough friday night to guide the yankees to an 84 victory over the minnesota twins in game 3 of their american league division series at the metrodome brown marched through six innings like a man who was in control and who would not be humiliated again i'm very happy with the results , obviously , brown said i think the guys were probably scared enough watching me pitch today and figured we better score a lot of runs gary sheffield , brown s closest friend on the team , said he told brown , we 've all been there maybe sheffield was trying to make brown feel better , but not every yankee has been banished to the corner like a 6yearold who cursed at dinner brown was in a rare , unenviable position as someone who made a foolish decision that impacted dozens of other people after friday night , brown and the yankees may call it even big victories can make big mistakes vanish brown , who apologized to the yankees after fracturing his hand , said his teammates were the only ones who could say if he had tidied up whatever mess he had created i think most of the guys understood where the frustration was coming from , and that it was not something that i did because i did n't care about the team , brown said it was quite the opposite if i did n't care , i would n't have been upset with the way things were going sheffield said brown did not have to redeem himself and called him one of the best pitchers in baseball he is also one of the gloomiest even after brown should have been relieved , even after he put the yankees within a victory of meeting the boston red sox in the league championship series , he acted as if he was about to have a wisdom tooth removed the reason brown was so disconsolate is because he is bothered by a stiff lower back and does not feel like himself while brown was pleased with the results , he was not pleased with the process it took to get them yet brown said he would continue to start the yankees made life easier for brown with 5 hits and 3 runs on 10 pitches in the second inning and 4 more runs in the sixth the twins had two runners thrown out trying to take extra bases while they trailed by six runs , awful mistakes that helped brown suddenly stale and sloppy , the twins could use johan santana to start games 4 and 5 to give them a prayer of surviving less than two weeks ago , the yankees were not expecting brown to start a postseason game he was hammered in his return start against the red sox and looked and sounded defeated but orlando hern ndez s dead arm and javier vazquez s ineffectiveness made brown necessary again , and he produced friday while giving up one earned run and eight hits the pitching coach mel stottlemyre has counseled brown to rely on his sinking twoseam fastball to produce grounders because his fourseam fastball is not powerful enough to pump past hitters brown , whose best fastball hit 91 miles an hour , grudgingly obeyed and recorded 10 outs in the infield , struck out one and walked none jacque jones smashed brown s 11th pitch into the leftfield seats to put the twins ahead , 10 could this be a repeat of the boston game with another firstinning massacre \? no chance brown allowed base runners in five of his six innings , but minnesota manager ron gardenhire lauded him for making adjustments catcher jorge posada asked brown a few times how he felt and brown said , do n't ask with santana looming in game 4 , the game had a doordie feeling for the yankees the yankees did not want to see santana , who has not lost since july 11 , in an elimination game brown did his part and did what he was supposed to do for 15 million he did nothing irrational , and he tossed a crisp game if the yankees hope to advance through a torturous postseason , they need brown to be one of their three effective starters thirtyfive days later , brown transformed the punch into a footnote and allowed the yankees to relax a little brown made a thoughtless move 35 days ago , but he smelled redemption and grabbed it he won so he is forgiven

with voters and the press fixated on the fiercest presidential race in decades , scant attention has been paid to a political revolution erupting on the west coast one that gov arnold schwarzenegger of california gave his support to this week on nov 2 , voters in washington state and california are expected to approve initiatives to abolish the political party primary as we know it voters in oregon may well pass a similar measure by 2006 in almost every state , voters in primary elections now nominate republican and democratic standardbearers for a wide range of offices , including united states senator and representative , state positions like governor , state legislator , even judge while this system is simple , choices are limited if you 're a registered republican or democrat , you can choose only from candidates of the same ilk \( socalled crossover primaries , in which voters registered in one party could help nominate candidates in a rival party , were declared unconstitutional by the united states supreme court in 2000 \) what if you 're an officially unaffiliated voter \? or if you signed up with a minor party , like the libertarians or greens \? in most places , either you 're forced to temporarily register in a major party and vote only within that party s primary , or you simply get a short ballot restricted to nonpartisan races like county sheriff in the end , voterapproved democratic and republican nominees automatically advance to the general election minorparty candidates typically nominated via caucuses or by petition can also qualify for the november ballot , but in most places have little hope of being elected this would all change under the socalled voter choice and open primary measures in california and washington if passed , these initiatives would jettison the current system for one in which every voter regardless of party registration , or the lack thereof would get the same ballot in the primary every voter could vote for his favorite candidate of any party for each office the top two votegetters whether they are registered to a particular party or not would then advance to the november election how would the voter choiceopen primary system change the dynamics of politics \? for one , it would almost certainly increase voter turnout during the 2004 election cycle , turnout of registered voters in state primary elections seldom exceeded 35 percent the median age of voters casting ballots was nearly 60 but most experts feel this would change under the new system , because every voter could participate fully in selecting the two major finalists for each office the measures would also treat all parties and candidates as equals no party would be guaranteed having a finalist on the general election ballot rather , every candidate would have to earn that right by getting enough votes in the primary round the change would give voters true freedom of registration citizens would suffer no disadvantage by registering in whatever party organization that most closely reflected their own viewpoints , or in none at all today , many people who register as republicans or democrats feel coerced into doing so , since they can vote in primary nomination elections only if they affiliate with a major party the ballot measures would also promote majority governance , as they would eliminate spoiler candidates with little or no hope of being elected with only two candidates on the ballot , nobody could be elected with less than 50 percent of the votes cast finally , the ballot measures would encourage candor by those running for office candidates could speak directly to all voters from the beginning of their campaigns , rather than having to run zigzag races that first cater to fierce partisans in the party primary , then shift to the center in the fall these reforms have gained support for a good reason because of demographic changes and the gerrymandering of legislative districts by both parties , an estimated 70 percent of congressional and legislative races are no longer competitive win the primary , and you 're virtually guaranteed election in november critics of the ballot measures argue that such reform will undermine the twoparty system that they feel has served america well for centuries but this is a selfserving myth perpetuated by party leaders whose influence would be vastly diminished in an open marketplace of political ideas indeed , the framers actually feared the excesses of partisanship and factionalism that now so dominate the landscape that is why any requirement that primary elections must be organized on a partisan basis is glaringly absent from the federal constitution and state constitutions nearly every state could switch to open primaries through statute amended either by state legislators or by voters in states with an initiative process and on the west coast , voters are ready to do exactly that in washington state , polls show this reform passing with more than 65 percent of the vote a 2003 survey of oregon voters showed 59 percent support with democrats and republicans as supportive of the change as nonaffiliated voters and proposition 62 now on the ballot in california enjoys a 20point lead as well as the endorsement of a wide range of business , civic , and political leaders , including the governor in the long run , the most dangerous threat to democracy is n't the fierceness of our debates or the clamor of those with heartfelt arguments rather , it s the indifference of growing numbers of citizens who no longer engage in politics open primary laws would not abolish partisanship in politics , but redefine it rather than a narrow partisanship focused primarily on party membership , labels and hot button issues the open primary aims to promote a healthier , more vigorous partisanship based on ideas oped contributor phil keisling , a democrat , was oregon secretary of state from 1991 to 1999 sam reed , a republican , is secretary of state of washington
kiril tzotchev has a problem figuring out how to live among the wealthy , even though he is n't really one of them to hear mr tzotchev tell it , he is just about the furthest one can be from rich he is an artist but those who buy his work tend to be in a higher tax bracket so when it came time to shop for a home , he kept in mind the old adage and followed the money my art , the wealthy people can afford it , said mr tzotchev , 42 , a naturalized citizen who came to the united states from his native bulgaria more than a dozen years ago i want to be around the rich people , he said with a chuckle that indicated he was only half joking as an artist , i have to be here so he focused his house hunt on the area around tiny roslyn heights , a place close to some of the most affluent communities on long island , yet known as a potential trove for middleincome bargain hunters still , the prices for places he liked were a bit outside sculptor range so he decided to wait out the market that was two years ago he s still waiting the price , mr tzotchev said , it keeps going up and up up is the operative word for home values everywhere in the new york metropolitan area , particularly with mortgage rates so low as to be virtually unprecedented those factors have combined to increase price tags even in places like 6 , 300person roslyn heights , which was once seen as a refuge for those with midlevel incomes but uppercrust aspirations according to sales figures for roslyn heights compiled by the multiple listing service , the sales database shared by real estate agents , buyers need more than twice as much money as they did just two years ago to get a foot on the bottom rung of the market the lowest sale price for a house in the hamlet has risen from 135 , 000 in 2000 to 322 , 000 today multiple offers on many properties are a given bidding wars are not uncommon and sociologists and other planning experts say that a byproduct of these escalating pricetags is that very often the middle class , who for decades formed the core of communities like roslyn heights , find themselves priced out of the market agents say it is n't hard to figure out what s driving values here so high lack of product period , said linda wohl , a vice president with daniel gale associates and manager of the real estate brokerage s roslyn office the school district is excellent the community is desirable because of that there s the accessibility we have more buyers than we have houses according to multiple listing service statistics for roslyn heights , the average sale price of a home has nearly doubled in the last four years , from 429 , 463 in 2000 to 848 , 926 today that s a sharp acceleration from the 1990 s , when home values in roslyn heights grew about 16 percent , according to census figures the market has changed , said ms wohl , who has sold real estate in the roslyn area for nearly three decades the market is a little bit of a slow roller coaster this is a seller s market still , i remember when interest rates were 17 percent and we still sold houses now , we have more buyers there are multiple offers the numbers are incredible and that is a sentiment shared by both agents and prospective buyers alike i do n't know where people get the money to afford it , mr tzotchev said if you do n't inherit , i do n't know where you get it downwardly mobile sociologists and economists say soaring real estate prices mean it simply costs more for a middleclass family to stay in the middle some experts see a widening gulf in the middle of the middle class , separating those who have and those who have more on long island there are great extremes of wealth and poverty , and then , somewhere in the middle , is a middle class whose definition is at best slippery nationally , if a family s annual income is 75 , 000 , by most definitions the family belongs to the middle class by that standard a low sixfigure income would put a long island family in the upper middle class nationally yet that family may well not be a position to buy a house in most of the island s communities more and more it s a case of winners and losers in the middle class , said susan s fainstein , a professor of urban planning at columbia university there are two groups if you have a secure and steady job , own a home , you can be doing quite well then there are all those people who are on a slippery slope who are afraid that they 're going to lose their job or that it will go off to india they 're the ones who are the forgotten middle class , she said dr fainstein said that those most affected by skyrocketing home values in the region are firsttime buyers and the young the people for whom it s really hard are people just entering the housing market , young couples , people without a nest egg or without parents who can help them , she said they 're the middle class that s downwardly mobile , because even if you have a decent income , who has 60 , 000 in the bank for a down payment when they just got out of college or graduate school or wherever \? the current tightening of the real estate market in the new york metropolitan region is simple supply and demand because there is little affordable housing being built , whatever existing quality housing stock remains is sometimes fought over by prospective buyers with dueling bids all of which serves to price large segments of the middle class out of some real estate markets i do n't know how people are doing it , said rachel ranis , a sociology professor at quinnipiac university in hamden , conn it s very hard for any family to buy in this market unless both parties are working at the same time it has become harder for many to enter the housing market , those who do make it want even more once they get there people s expectations have gotten higher , she said before , we were happy to have just one car in a household now , everyone has to have a car if you buy a house , everyone has to have a room people have changed a lot what has remained largely constant , professor ranis said , are the forces that drive homebuyers into the suburbs around the region the quest for bigger yards , better schools and perhaps a slower , more measured pace of living professor ranis noted that another factor appears to be playing a larger role worry one thing we find is that you 're worried that you will be able to duplicate what you 've always considered middleclass , she said the key value is how to keep yourself where you are and your children , how to give them the best start there s a lot of pressure on people to keep up with what they 're accustomed to , she said it s no longer about keeping up with the neighbor next door , it s their own wants and what they 're accustomed to but in the statusconscious suburbs , a larger home is still the no 1 symbol of success the ones who are doing well , you see people going out and getting bigger and bigger houses , dr fainstein said you look at some of these homes that have closets the size of my bedroom when i grew up and the reason size matters \? it s the symbol of your achievement , the symbol of your status , dr fainstein said it puts a premium on those homes with the center hall and the chandelier and all this space where you can demonstrate your lifestyle while practically no one would prefer that a community be poorer rather than richer , some experts wonder about the effects of such changes on the character of established middleclass communities all of the suburbs that have maintained quality housing have become more and more exclusive , dr fainstein said more exclusive perhaps , but also , say some , communities in highpriced markets grow less diverse and its residents less connected socially it has a huge impact of community connectedness , said robert fisher , the director of urban and community studies at the university of connecticut s west hartford campus the issue of social connectedness , a lot of that has to do with destabilization while bringing affluence into these communities , a lot of people are pushed out as well not to mention , dr fisher said , those who because of high prices never get to enter some communities in the first place what s happening is that the american dream is a little bit less within the reach of a lot of people , he said shaped by transportation for decades , roslyn heights has been a fairly typical long island bedroom community but its roots go deeper than those of most nassau or suffolk locales presentday nassau county was part of the dutch new netherlands colony , but myrna sloam , the archivist at the bryant public library in roslyn , said the first old world settlers in the roslyn area were the english , who crossed long island sound from connecticut and set up quarters at the head of hempstead harbor in 1643 as a first step toward establishing what is now hempstead about eight miles south the settlement became roslyn , and roslyn heights is one of a cluster of communities around it , also including roslyn estates , roslyn harbor , east hills and flower hill like countless other towns on the island , early life in the roslyns revolved around the water fishing and clamming but even from its beginnings , life here was a little bit different , ms sloam said it was almost an industrial village , she said there was farming on the outskirts , but there was a grist mill going back to the 1700 s there was a paper mill and other parts of a little industrial , craftsman community perhaps the most significant event in the area s early history was when the long island rail road came to the roslyn area in 1864 that made it easier for people to get out here , ms sloam said it also made it easier for residents to make their way into the city before the rails came , the preferred method of transportation into manhattan was by steamboat estimated travel time \? about 3 hours and that was the fast way , ms sloam said the roads could take 6 or 7 hours if it rained \( insert your own long island expressway joke here \) as the area entered the 20th century , the mills faded , the steamboats disappeared and roslyn heights began to grow up around the train station by the 1930 s the five main villages that make up the roslyns were in the middle of an uptick in home construction that would herald the population boom across the island after world war ii none of the other industries carried on in any other way , ms sloam said it just became a suburban community and , in some areas , a decidedly upscale suburban community at that but in a sea of affluence , roslyn heights had reputation as place where middleclass buyers could find bargains traditionally , the heights was more affordable , ms sloam but from what i'm hearing the prices have gone up making things more difficult for homebuyers here is the growth in home prices in surrounding communities two census tracts within seven miles of roslyn heights including communities like old westbury and brookville notched the highest percentage increases in home values on long island from 1990 to 2000 , according to census figures the spike in home prices here over the past few years came after a decade during which census figures show roslyn heights actually lost population in the 90 s , the population of the heights dipped about 2 percent its black population fell from 9 percent to 6 percent , while the number of asians \( 5 percent in 1990 \) and hispanics \( 4 percent in 1990 \) grew to 10 percent and 7 percent , respectively the community s growth has also been reflected in its schools , which agents say buyers frequently cite as a key draw more than half of the children of roslyn heights attend the roslyn union free school district the rest are in the mineola district barry edelson , the district s director of community relations , said that over the past decade and half the student population has grown by more than third , from 2 , 400 in 1990 to roughly 3 , 300 today we 've grown a lot in the last 10 to 12 years , said mr edelson , but not because many new homes had been built rather , he said , it s been strictly demographic we 're going from a town of people without children or whose children are not in school to younger families indeed , fully 40 percent of taxpayers in the district have schoolaged children , mr edelson said , an increase of about 15 percent from a low several years ago besides the area s school system , another attraction for potential buyers is the area s proximity to new york city located about 20 miles east of midtown manhattan and convenient to northern boulevard , the northern state parkway and the long island expressway , the roslyns are enticing for weary commuters people always talk to me in terms of access and accessibility , said renee hughes , an agent with daniel gale and when it comes to price tags \? ms hughes says she rarely sees customers who lapse into slackjawed sticker shock anymore it s about 5050 , she said some do but most people already know what they 're getting into a seller s market during an open house here last sunday , yami dotan , a century 21 agent in the roslyn heights area for a dozen years , frowned as she described a couple who had recently made an offer on a home that they coveted they made a low offer , ms dotan said i say to everyone , 'give your best offer , as close as you can to the asking price , ' because owners here will get the asking price ms dotan said she knows a handful of sellers who have increased their asking price after noticing what was happening in the market it s amazing , she said i remember days i would have a listing and i would open the door for an open house and the listing would expire and not go sold i would get so frustrated within 40 minutes of the sunday open house , four families had visited the asking price for the rather ordinarylooking , gray fourbedroom colonial built just after world war ii 729 , 000 prospective buyers have learned that such prices are just about par for the course here in roslyn heights , a pleasant though unremarkable community where much of the housing stock is postwar colonials and splitlevels sarah pak was one of those visiting the open house she said she had scoffed at the idea of paying in the upper six figures for a home in the area last year , much to her chagrin in just the past year , real estate sales figures show , the average price for a home here has jumped about 150 , 000 the demand is very high , said ms pak , 37 , who visited the gray colonial with her husband , yoon , 38 , and their children , curtis , 7 , and joseph 3 i'm not surprised we were looking last year the prices have gone up since then ms pak said that she and her husband are concerned about letting another year pass without buying something now , i realize , she said , this is the time the paks' story is familiar to ms dotan i had a customer two years ago , his friends told him , 'do n't buy , wait , the market s too high , it s going to crash , she said now he ca n't afford it because he has the same budget and the prices have gone up and up since ms dotan s prospective buyer balked in 2002 , the average price here has increased by more than a quarter million dollars , according to sales figures every time you think it s the top , ms dotan said of home prices here and then it goes up again part of what s driving the increases in home values here is what agents said was a spike in renovations and what are commonly known as knockdowns homes that have been purchased with the intent of being razed so that a new , more luxurious property can be built after leaving the gray colonial , ms dotan headed toward one property in the country club section of roslyn heights that was bought in the last five years or so for about a halfmillion dollars the original home had been rebuilt and reborn as a majestic fourbedroom colonial with a maple and granite gourmet kitchen and a walkin closet upstairs about the size of a freight elevator the owner was selling , asking 15 millionms dotan said it was n't farfetched for the owner to try to command that kind of asking price in fact , she said , he was one of the customers who raised his initial price after watching the market boom we had to raise the price here , ms dotan said he saw what s going on around here some people involved in construction and real estate on long island wonder whether the market for such opulent homes can be sustained i think anything over a million dollars and higher has plateaued , said muzzio tallini , a builder with signature homes in elmont i think people who spend that kind of money want value and they 're going to start asking , 'who are you to be charging that kind of dough \? a visitor to the country club colonial , mike youdim , was looking for a home in the roslyn heights area so that he and his wife , sharona , can be closer to his parents these prices are whew , he said , shaking his head as he made his way through the master bedroom upstairs it s ridiculous mr youdim told ms dotan that about four years ago he was looking for a home in the area and found that did n't want to pay for anything in the whatnowseemsprettyreasonable halfmillion dollar range we were hoping the prices were going to steady , mr youdim said but every year you wait , it goes up another 15 or 20 percent location , location kiril tzotchev knows from those kinds of increases even after more than two years of looking for a home in the roslyns , he still struggles to fathom how the market is able to sustain itself currently , he and his wife , irina , are renting a modest place in greenvale , about three miles northeast of roslyn heights we 're just trying to make a living , said mr tzotchev , who also rents an artist s studio down in sea cliff and while mr tzotchev dreams of home ownership , he fears that at the current rate he wo n't be able to afford anything he likes unless he hits the big time and he wonders if even that will help it s very expensive even if you are famous artist , he said not too long ago , he came upon a house that looked great on the outside and had a decent price tag 400 , 000 once inside , he realized that there was a catch it had only one bedroom four hundred thousand dollars , he said , disbelief dripping from every syllable for one bedroom in hindsight , he wishes that someone had warned him away from the area before he fell in love with it when i emigrated , i did n't even know where i was going , he said nobody said , 'this is the place to be for artists but he found that for him it was mr tzotchev is able to make a decent living between sales in a good year , he may sell a piece every month or so and teaching art courses at the nassau county museum of art indeed , he s so spoiled by the area s charms and its wellheeled art buyers that he seems determined to stick the market out i like the quietness of the area , mr tzotchev said as an artist i want to be not disturbed that s why i 'd like to be in a quiet area amongst the birds he paused , then added with a laugh amongst the rich people and the birds
senator john kerry , a lean athlete who is the picture of health as he skis , skates , cycles and windsurfs , is in robust condition , he and his doctors said in their first extended interviews discussing his medical history mr kerry , 60 , the democratic presidential nominee , and his doctors discussed in great detail his health , particularly the surgery to remove his cancerous prostate gland in february 2003 it was one of two operations that disrupted his campaign the second repaired a painful shoulder injury last march mr kerry could become the first cancer survivor to be elected president , but he rejected the term as creating an unfair stigma he is free of any vestiges of the cancer and characterized it as a nonissue in an interview in las vegas on sept 16 i am cured , he said i am cancerfree , and the percentages of me being cancerfree 10 years from now are about as good as they get mr kerry s doctors said they had told him that he was cured they based their optimism on an array of tests and concluded that he had a less than 3 percent chance of a recurrence in the next nine years even if the cancer came back , it could be treated without seriously interfering with presidential duties , mr kerry s doctors and experts said the likelihood that he is going to have a significant problem with this cancer is infinitesimally small , said dr patrick c walsh , the johns hopkins university urologist who performed the operation the fiveyear death rate for the kind of prostate cancer that mr kerry developed is virtually zero in a 20minute interview , mr kerry pledged to disclose any ailment he might develop as president if it s relevant to my ability to conduct my office or to affect the country in some way mr kerry , who has signed a living will outlining his wishes if he is incapacitated , said that he and his running mate , senator john edwards of north carolina , had not discussed how a transfer of power , if necessary , would be invoked under the 25th amendment he said he would do whatever s appropriate if a moment arrives he added people will tend to know when that moment s arrived they either happen with time to talk about it or they happen in a way that it s automatic mr kerry s participation in strenuous activities like windsurfing , bicycle races of up to 112 miles and weight lifting has kept him exceptionally fit , he said he would be in even better shape if he were not campaigning , mr kerry said , but for somebody who is running for president , i'm in about as good a shape as i think anybody could be to show his full recovery from the orthopedic surgery that he underwent last spring to repair tears in a biceps tendon and a muscle in his right shoulder , mr kerry thrust both arms straight up as if to signal a touchdown and smiled before the operation , pain and weakness hindered him from raising his right arm overhead or lifting an object occasionally , pain from the muscle tear awakened him mr kerry s injuries as a young man , however , seem to have given him more trouble political trouble , that is than his shoulder surgery a group of veterans has challenged the validity of the three purple hearts that mr kerry received for wounds he suffered while serving on swift boats in the vietnam war these critics suggested that the shrapnel that hit him in one mission was rice , not metal however , ct scan xrays taken at massachusetts general hospital in boston document that two pieces of metal shrapnel are embedded deep in mr kerry s left thigh , next to the femur , said dr gerald j doyle , mr kerry s personal physician in boston who reviewed the xrays at the request of this reporter , who is a physician doctors treating the wound in 1969 decided to leave the shrapnel in place one piece of shrapnel is about the size of a bullet , the other a bit smaller , dr doyle said mr kerry said , i ca n't tell you i really feel it , but it s back in here somewhere , as he slapped his thigh the author douglas brinkley wrote in tour of duty , his account of mr kerry s navy service , that the young officer injured his arm and suffered a slight concussion when he was thrown against the bulkhead of a swift boat mr kerry said that he hit his head but that in using the word concussion with the writer he meant the concussion of the explosion and never said he had a cerebral concussion because that diagnosis is not in my medical records mr kerry was confident , affable and answered all questions in the interview earlier , mr kerry gave three of his doctors permission to speak about his health with this reporter each doctor , interviewed separately , said that mr kerry had instructed him not to withhold any information about his medical history before presidential elections over the last 24 years , the new york times has looked into the health of presidential nominees in the past , white house and personal physicians have at times misrepresented or lied about a president s health for example , franklin d roosevelt s doctors did not disclose the heart and vascular disease that caused his death , and john f kennedy and his family denied reports that he had addison s disease , or adrenal insufficiency , and required hormone injections in 1992 , a democratic president candidate , senator paul e tsongas of massachusetts , and his doctors said he had been cured of a lymphoma cancer in fact , mr tsongas had had a recurrence of the disease and died of it a day short of what would have been the end of his first term had he been elected mr kerry , in expressing confidence that he was cured of prostate cancer , pointed to former senator bob dole of kansas , 81 , who underwent the same operation in 1991 , five years before he lost the presidential election to bill clinton mr dole is doing great today , mr kerry said there s your answer since his surgery , blood tests performed every six months to check mr kerry s prostatespecific antigen , or psa , a marker for cancer , have indicated no recurrence the latest test was performed sept 18 in a house call by dr doyle reasons for concern mr kerry s psa was in the normal range when his cancer was detected during an annual checkup in december 2002 but because the figure had risen by 70 percent over two years , both teresa heinz kerry , the senator s wife , and dr doyle independently felt the need to check further mrs heinz kerry keeps a sharp eye on her husband s health in an interview on sept 20 , she said that her husband told her in november 2002 that routine blood tests performed through the attending physician s office at the capitol were fine and that he was particularly pleased about a cholesterol count of 195 cholesterol is n't everything , she said she told him the psa test was a normal 324 nanograms per milliliter but mrs heinz kerry said she told her husband , it s low , but high for you and urged him to see dr doyle in boston and repeat the tests when the doctor examined mr kerry on dec 17 , 2002 , it was his patient s first checkup in nearly two years a standard digital examination and an ultrasound test found no nodules or other prostate abnormality that might signal cancer his new psa level was a normal 34 nanograms per milliliter nevertheless , dr doyle said he was concerned because the figure had crept up from 27 in feb 2001 and 20 in dec 1999 and nov 2000 so dr doyle consulted dr alex f althausen , a urologist , who recommended a biopsy the rate of increase was what alarmed us both , dr doyle said after learning that an ultrasound is n't a failsafe test , mr kerry decided he wanted a biopsy after fitting mr kerry into his schedule between surgeries on dec 20 , dr althausen told dr doyle that the biopsy specimens did not look suspicious to his naked eye , dr doyle said but the real test was viewing the biopsied tissue under a microscope , and the pathology report showed cancer in five of the pieces that were removed mr kerry was one of more than 200 , 000 men in the united states in whom prostate cancer is diagnosed each year about 1 in 6 american men will develop the disease at some point , but only 1 in 33 will die of it , the american cancer society says the reason is that prostate cancers often do not develop until men are in their 70 s or older and often grow slowly men who develop prostate cancer often die of other causes dr doyle wanted to inform mr kerry about the finding in person , as he usually does most patients are overwhelmed when they first learn they have cancer , and many lose their focus , he said but for four days over the long holiday weekend , \( christmas was midweek \) dr doyle s attempts to leave messages for mr kerry at his senate and local offices failed because the voice mailbox was full he finally reached mr kerry on christmas eve at his home in sun valley , idaho to have to tell someone over the phone is difficult , dr doyle said but i had to because we wanted to get things squared away as soon as possible when he delivered the news to his patient , dr doyle said , he did n't miss a beat and just asked all these appropriate questions right away as though it were someone other than himself what does this mean \? dr doyle said mr kerry asked him what are my options \? what is the time frame we are talking about here \? how soon can we get moving on it \? mr kerry recalled , a lot of things went through my mind , including memories of his father , who died of prostate cancer at age 85 in 2000 \( studies show that a family history of prostate cancer increases the risk of developing the disease but not the rate of its progression \) my dad had radiation , and i saw just how he lived at the end , and i did n't want to go through that , mr kerry said after consulting with people who had different treatments for prostate cancer , mr kerry said , i knew what i wanted and needed to do i made the decision , boom , and we booked the surgery , and 30 days later i did it , he said mrs heinz kerry said she had read about dr walsh , who had developed a nervesparing prostate operation that preserves continence and potency for many patients , and suggested the couple call him the decision to have the surgery in baltimore irked many doctors in his home , boston mr kerry said he regretted that attitude , and that he preferred to recuperate near his office in washington the operation , removing the entire prostate gland , was performed on feb 12 , 2003 and went by the book , dr walsh said his patient , though , did not allow himself much time to recover he needed to be at a major event out in california two weeks later , dr walsh said so he shortened his recovery schedule by a little bit just to make it fit mr kerry said , it takes you a little longer to get back up to speed than you think because they put a bunch of stitches in you , and i was surprised at how many the prostate slowed me down a little bit at a critical time , mr kerry said it was an annoyance it was aggravating the pathology report was the best that mr kerry could receive the cancer was confined to the left side of the prostate gland and on the gleason scale , a standard measure of the severity of prostate cancer , mr kerry s score was 6 out of 10 , considered a very favorable finding if mr kerry had a recurrence , dr walsh said , he would be astonished , and so would i , and i am telling you this with the very conscious understanding of what happened to senator tsongas dr peter t scardino , the chief urologist at memorial sloankettering cancer institute in manhattan , who is not connected with mr kerry s case , said that while there are no guarantees , he agreed with the prognosis given mr kerry something bizarre could happen as an exception to the rule , but it would be extremely surprising , dr scardino said if mr kerry s cancer did return , it could be controlled by radiation therapy over six weeks , dr scardino said that would almost certainly not interfere with his functioning as president except to limit travel during that period and for the fatigue that often follows radiation therapy , he said sports take a toll the shoulder operation last march was mr kerry s second on that joint he has also had surgery three other times for sportsrelated knee injuries , said dr bertram zarins , an orthopedist at massachusetts general hospital dr zarins said that mr kerry injured one knee twice \( skiing and soccer \) , and the other playing softball mr kerry s first shoulder injury was in may 1992 when he fell from a bicycle and broke his right clavicle the fracture healed but the scar tissue that formed put pressure on a nerve in the shoulder , which was relieved by minor surgery in 1993 , dr zarins said late last january , mr kerry grabbed a railing on a campaign bus when the vehicle lurched , tearing a biceps tendon and subscapularis muscle in the previously injured right shoulder dr zarins said he initially recommended that mr kerry wait for the injury to heal but mr kerry continued to have pain and weakness , limiting the function of his right , and dominant , arm timing for such surgery is critical results are better if it is performed soon after the injury if it is put off too long , the muscles and tendons wither and repair can become impossible after it became clear that the conservative treatment failed , the surgery was performed march 31 we waited longer than we normally would like because of mr kerry s campaign schedule , dr zarins said mr kerry s recovery was speedier than most patients' , dr zarins said , because he s very coordinated , a good athlete , has good pain tolerance and followed instructions well he did everything the way it should be , dr zarins said , and now there are no problems with the shoulder mr kerry takes no medications on a regular basis but last summer dr doyle said that he might recommend that mr kerry start taking a statin drug , which lowers cholesterol , after the election the reason was that tests of his total cholesterol and bad cholesterol , or ldl , showed that the counts had risen over the last two years cholesterol counts can be influenced by exercise and diet mr kerry s total cholesterol has fluctuated between a high of 238 in 1995 and a low of 167 last february it was at 228 last april , 215 in november 2003 and 195 in february 2003 \( risk of heart attacks rises at levels greater than 200 , the american heart association says \) over the same period , his bad cholesterol , or ldl , rose to 154 from 137 and 121 , raising the possibility of a statin prescription because dr doyle wanted to measure the lipids fatlike substances after an overnight fast to get a more accurate reading , he paid a house call to mr kerry in boston on sept 18 to draw blood for a new set of tests but when dr doyle arrived about 10 am , as scheduled , his patient had eaten breakfast an eye on cholesterol nevertheless , the new test results were better mr kerry s total cholesterol was 194 and his ldl 122 dr doyle said that he would like to lower mr kerry s ldl to below 100 , even to 70 , but that he was reluctant to prescribe a statin drug during the campaign , in part because of the risk of side effects like muscle weakness and liver damage he said he would reevaluate the situation later this year mr kerry s tests for thyroid and other functions were normal , dr doyle said mr kerry , who stands 6 feet 4 inches and has weighed between 180 and 185 pounds for many years , lost seven pounds campaigning earlier this year but he gained eight pounds after dr doyle recommended peanut butter sandwiches and ice cream to substitute for the meals that the senator often skipped because of a hectic schedule to hell with the cholesterol , said dr doyle , who offered his patient a political tip you ca n't have a gauntlooking person running for president because people will draw conclusions that are erroneous because of mr kerry s excellent performance in vigorous activities , dr doyle said he had not performed tests for heart disease , like an echocardiogram , exercise stress test or noninvasive ct scans mr kerry has had pneumonia twice , once from a virus while a student at yale , the other from pneumococcal bacteria while in the military in 1967 he has also had occasional bouts of bronchitis that have been treated with antibiotics , bronchial dilators and topical steroids his lung function is normal mr kerry also has mild asthma and suffers from seasonal allergies like hay fever , and occasionally takes medications for them dr doyle said until surgery in 1974 , mr kerry had a misalignment of his jaw that prevented him from biting properly and made a loud clicking noise when he ate it was exasperating , mr kerry said while critics have suggested the procedure was cosmetic , both he and his dental surgeon , dr walter c guralnick of massachusetts general hospital denied that mr kerry recently suffered a campaigner s nightmare hoarseness from laryngitis i am talking all day long , so the voice pays a price , he said in the interview he reduced the acidity in his food to minimize gastric reflux , which can aggravate the problem mr kerry has colonoscopies every three years because of polyps that were detected in 1985 and 1993 none were found on his last colonoscopy two years ago he has tested negative for hiv , and has never been in trouble with the law for drug or alcohol abuse
richard a grasso , the former chairman of the new york stock exchange , filed a countersuit yesterday against the exchange and john s reed , his successor at the big board , asking for 50 million in damages and contending that his contract was breached and his reputation was besmirched the countersuit , which was filed in federal district court in new york , adds yet another legal dimension to a bitter wall street story that is now approaching its oneyear anniversary and could well endure for a long time in litigation it underscores as well the deep rift between mr grasso , who grew up in queens and worked his whole life at the exchange , and mr reed , the aloof former chief executive of citicorp , who was brought in to revamp the exchange in the wake of mr grasso s ouster last year and sharply criticized mr grasso s compensation as excessive and embarrassing the countersuit minces few words , claiming that the exchange breached its contract with mr grasso by maliciously disparaging him through mr reed s false and defamatory statements it adds that mr reed and the exchange must be held accountable for their shameful conduct and the injury they have caused mr grasso it claims as well that according to his 1999 and 2003 contracts , mr grasso is owed at least 50 million in compensation and benefits because he was terminated from his job without cause the 48page countersuit was filed in response to a suit brought in may by the new york attorney general , eliot spitzer , asserting that the 190 million mr grasso was paid during his term as chief executive , from 1995 to 2003 , was excessive under new york state law regulating nonprofit institutions and that mr grasso should return at least 100 million of it shortly before he left the exchange , mr grasso agreed to forgo another 50 million in compensation that would have been due him through 2007 , which is the amount that he is now seeking in damages mr grasso has said publicly that mr spitzer s suit is without merit and even politically motivated , although his countersuit does not request that mr spitzer s case be dismissed in its entirety instead , it requests that just one of the eight counts which contends that mr grasso received 35 million in loans from the exchange and failed to pay interest on them be dismissed the motion states that the exchange , as a type a notforprofit corporation , does not have a charitable function in that it serves the financial benefit of its members and that , as a board of trade , it can make loans to its members in his counterclaim , mr grasso states that all the money he was awarded as chairman of the exchange was approved unanimously by the exchange s board and was justified by the big board s success in increasing its trading volume and attracting new offerings during his tenure in response to mr grasso s countersuit , mr spitzer said , we are going to win this case , for all the reasons in the complaint it was too much there were conflicts of interest and there were misrepresentations to the board the stock exchange said yesterday that it would contest mr grasso s claim that he was defamed none of these alleged statements meet the legal definition of defamation , said dan k webb , the lawyer representing mr reed and the stock exchange we will strenuously challenge these allegations in court mr grasso s assertion that mr reed disparaged him , in violation of his contract , revolves around a series of statements made by mr reed after his appointment as chairman while the two men have never met , mr reed said initially that he was willing to sit down with mr grasso over a cup of coffee and take up the issue of his pay but , after he read a report produced by mr webb , which contended that mr grasso kept his directors in the dark with regard to his ballooning pension account , mr reed took a hard line choosing not to meet with mr grasso and becoming more publicly critical of him the complaint cites a number of statements made by mr reed , including comments at a news conference in december when he referred to mr grasso s pay as embarrassing and compared the problems at the exchange to other corporate scandals mr reed also suggested that mr grasso might have wanted to withdraw the money before a new board might have prevented him from doing so if you thought that this thing would be reviewed by a new board and it might not be approved , there is some implication that , 'gee , this thing could n't stand the light of day , mr reed said in an interview with the new york times that was cited in the counterclaim the suit also quotes mr reed saying that serious damage has been inflicted on the exchange by unreasonable compensation of the previous chairman while such comments may well be offensive to mr grasso , who is described by those who know him as fiercely protective of his reputation and deeply proud of his time at the exchange , it is unclear whether they can clear the higher legal bar of public defamation if you are a public figure , you have to show a deliberate attempt to injure , said john c coffee , a professor of securities law at columbia university that s going to be hard here mr reed was relying on the advice of experts , which undercuts the argument that he was acting with actual malice another unresolved issue is where the case will be heard while the countersuit was filed in federal court , mr spitzer filed a brief on monday asking that the case against mr grasso be returned to new york state court the federal judge , gerald e lynch , has yet to rule on the matter
a top new york police officer defended plans yesterday to use foursided barricades to control demonstrators at the republican national convention , saying the police want to keep streets open to allow any emergency evacuation of the area chief of department joseph j esposito , the highestranking uniformed officer , said the police wanted to keep all their tactical options open for a big demonstration on aug 29 , the day before the convention is scheduled to begin but he said the police were not planning to conduct general searches of backpacks and purses , because they did not have enough officers to search everyone in a crowd possibly numbering 250 , 000 people chief esposito testified in federal court in manhattan in a civil suit against the police department by the new york civil liberties union and three people who say they were treated roughly by the police in february 2003 at a protest against the iraq war near the united nations the suit seeks a court order barring universal bag searches , requiring the police to broadly publicize any streets that will be closed near the march , and discouraging the use of metal barricades , called pens , that keep demonstrators within the length of each block talks are under way between the police and united for peace and justice , the lead group organizing the august demonstration , about the march route leslie cagan , the national coordinator , said the group had rejected a police offer of a route up 11th avenue because it would not pass by madison square garden , the convention site in the next meeting , on june 11 , they will press for an eighth avenue route , she said chief esposito said that preventing a terrorist attack and making plans to cope if one occurs were the overriding concerns for the police in organizing for the convention we 'd have to be out of our minds not to have that as the most paramount concern in approaching these events , he said the police want the option of dividing up the rally by setting up the foursided pens because they limit movement flow and help keep cross streets open for ambulances and police cars a major , major consideration is a mass evacuation , chief esposito said in the event you had an explosion or a terrorist attack , if people were allowed to swarm , it s much harder to get them out the hearing recalled clashes between the police and protesters at the 2003 demonstration , when tens of thousands of people never made it to the first avenue rally because of metal barricades that divide the crowd and closed side streets in an effort to move access northward as the avenue near the event filled up ann stauber , who went to that protest in a wheelchair she uses because of a hereditary disease , testified that she became very uncomfortable in one of the barricade pens and tried to leave according to witnesses , police officer marvina c lawrence seized the steering handle of ms stauber s motorized chair and swung it around , breaking it , blocking her from leaving for an hour ms stauber said she was trapped in her home for weeks after the rally while her chair was being repaired i had no way to leave my home , she said i was stuck i was emotionally devastated , i was shattered , i spent a lot of time crying the civilian review board that monitors the police substantiated her complaint ms stauber said she wanted to attend the republican convention rally but was very frightened of encountering the same barricades another plaintiff , jeremy conrad , was trampled by a police horse at the protest , according to testimony the civil liberties group wants the court to order the police to provide special training on deployment of the mounted police to officials who will be in charge of the aug 29 operation the suit does not seek to ban the use of foursided barricades , only to ensure that people can get in and out easily under questioning by christopher dunn , the lawyer for the civil liberties union , chief esposito acknowledged that none of the measures the group was seeking with the suit would limit the police department s antiterrorism measures the police have set an informal deadline of june 15 for applications for convention march permits police officials are frustrated with what they call the slow pace of the discussions with united for peace and justice , said paul j browne , a deputy commissioner he said the group had declined several offers for meetings in the past 10 days , leaving the next one for june 11 we 're the ones who want to nail it down , he said
after insisting for months that iraqis must determine their future under a kind of passive american supervision , the bush administration is being forced to take sides in several iraqi disputes and running into friction with groups long friendly to washington how these new confrontations are resolved will probably determine the staying power and effectiveness of iraq s future government and , ultimately , even its territorial integrity after the united states transfers sovereignty to baghdad among the difficulties are the american efforts , so far unsuccessful , to convince a leading shiite cleric of the legitimacy of the administration s plan to transfer sovereignty to iraq on june 30 , and american wrangling with islamic groups over the role of islam in iraq s laws and constitution in addition , the united states has had to dash the hopes of several iraqi exile leaders who had worked with washington to plan the iraq war and now want to stay in power even if they are not selected as part of the government in a future iraq but the biggest dispute , which has become public only in the last few days , is with the kurds in the north , whose regional state has been democratically run , largely autonomous and protected by the american military since the end of the first persian gulf war in 1991 for years , the united states has stated as a matter of policy that even though it encouraged the existence of an autonomous kurdish regional government under saddam hussein , a posthussein iraq should be divided into provinces based on geography rather than ethnic identity the american fear is that an ethnically divided iraq would stir instability in the region , especially in turkey , which has a large and restive kurdish population saudi arabia , a sunni muslim country , also fears that a kurdish withdrawal from iraq would give too much power to the nation s remaining shiites , who the saudis fear would be sympathetic to largely shiite iran it was not until last friday , however , that the kurds got word from l paul bremer iii , the american administrator in iraq , that the united states wanted them to give up their powers over security , oil resources and other matters and accede to the authority of the new iraqi state that is about to be born it was not a happy meeting from our point of view , said a kurdish official it was totally contradictory to the spirit of the relationship we have had with the united states as allies in the war against saddam kurdish spokesmen say that mr bremer was rebuffed and that he came back for another meeting with kurdish leaders on wednesday , expressing flexibility on the idea of autonomy evidently aware that his maximalist approach had simply provoked an angry counterreaction , mr bremer was more conciliatory the second time around , while still insisting that the kurds back down on at least some of their demands for full powers he did n't go through the laundry list of all the requirements he laid down earlier , said an administration official essentially , he said to the kurds , 'what i need from you is flexibility' he went to the bigger picture some in the bush administration speculate that the united states , in the end , will have no choice but to accept kurdish autonomy there is not enough time to change the status quo , they say , given the timetable for a new transitional iraqi government to take full sovereignty after june 30 concern about angering the kurds is also prevalent at the pentagon , where officials remain grateful for the role kurds played in the war in a recent memo to defense secretary donald h rumsfeld , secretary of state colin l powell and condoleezza rice , the national security adviser , mr bremer warned that american opposition to ethnic federalism espoused by the kurds would create political problems where none currently exists forcing the kurds to back down , he wrote in the memo , a copy of which was obtained by the new york times , will likely require the expenditure of significant political capital on our part and also surely upset the political stability we have enjoyed thus far in northern iraq some kurds , expecting the united states to back down , wonder if mr bremer was not pressing a tough line with the kurds only to be able to tell turkey , saudi arabia and other nations that he tried as hard as he could before giving in to the creation of a kurdish state meanwhile , a senior turkish official , watching the situation closely , said it seemed that the united states had already gone too far in letting the kurds hijack the process of drafting a federal setup for iraq we find these events very disturbing , said the turkish official the united states cannot let the kurds abuse their current privileged status in iraq he explained that he was referring not only to their leverage within iraq but also to their ties to the pentagon part of the american problem is that the kurds have actually won support for retaining their autonomy from other members of the iraqi governing council , the americancreated body that now manages iraqi affairs and is planning for the transition to selfrule though the kurds have only five votes on the 25member council , they have a unique status because they actually can claim a mandate from the kurdish population , under elections held in 1992 the kurds also can use their five votes to get support from nonkurds by promising to support what other groups want thus the united states may actually have to oppose the wishes of the council , a body that is essentially its own creation given the difficulties of standing up to the kurds and to other iraqis who are america s allies , many experts say the united states may have no choice , in the end , but to accept kurdish demands this will get resolved one way or another , said a western diplomat involved in the situation i wo n't be surprised to see it resolved in the kurds' favor
washington , oct 14 with less than three weeks before the election , ralph nader is emerging as just the threat that democrats feared , with a potential to tip the balance in up to nine states where president bush and senator john kerry are running neck and neck despite a concerted effort by democrats to derail his independent candidacy , as well as his being struck off the pennsylvania ballot on wednesday , mr nader will be on the ballots in more than 30 states polls show that he could influence the outcomes in nine by drawing support from mr kerry they are colorado , florida , iowa , maine , minnesota , nevada , new hampshire , new mexico and wisconsin moreover , six colorado , maine , minnesota , new hampshire , new mexico and wisconsin were among the top 20 where mr nader drew his strongest support in 2000 if the vote for mr bush and mr kerry is as evenly divided as the polls suggest , the electoral votes in any one of those states could determine who becomes president mr nader repeated this week that he had no intention of leaving the race he said no one from the kerry campaign or democratic national committee was pressing him behind the scenes to quit , and he said he thought that mr kerry would not make a good president anyway he s not his own man , mr nader said on tuesday in a telephone interview from california because he takes the liberals for granted , he s allowing bush to pull him in his direction it does n't show much for his character that is a change from may , when mr nader met mr kerry at his campaign headquarters and afterward praised him as very presidential mr kerry did not ask him to withdraw then , but now the party is in a fullthroated plea , with its chairman , terry mcauliffe , saying on thursday that mr nader should end the charade of a campaign being kept afloat by corporate backers although mr nader s support is negligible in much of the country , and scant in some of the nine states , even a tiny nader vote could make a difference , as it did in 2000 in florida and new hampshire democrats belittle mr nader s efforts , portraying his campaign as a ragtag version of its former self , with the candidate s appearances limited to easytobook locations like college campuses but they acknowledge that he could make a difference , and even mr kerry has adjusted his stump speech in part to try to appeal to potential nader voters , who tend to loathe corporate america and fiercely oppose the iraq war mr kerry now casts mr bush as a tool of rich and powerful special interests , and he has sharpened his critique of mr bush s handling of iraq several democratic and leftleaning groups sprung up this year to try to keep mr nader off the ballot in the swing states , fearing he could siphon votes from mr kerry as he did from al gore in 2000 in florida that year , mr nader won 16 percent of the vote that accounted for 97 , 488 votes , and mr bush beat mr gore there by 537 in 2000 , mr nader won 27 percent of the vote nationally pollsters say that this year , mr nader s national support has dwindled , from a peak of 5 percent in may to 15 percent now in some states it is higher this year in iowa , the average of the latest polls shows mr kerry with 475 percent of the vote , mr bush with 466 percent and mr nader with 4 percent the average of polls in minnesota shows 455 percent for mr kerry , 455 percent for bush and 27 percent for mr nader mr nader is still in litigation to be on the ballot in ohio , where mr bush and mr kerry are in a dead heat and where mr nader draws 1 percent of the vote mr nader is also appealing a court s throwing him off the pennsylvania ballot polls also show mr nader drawing some support from mr bush , though at a much lower level than from mr kerry , which explains why republicans have been supporting and encouraging his efforts to get on ballots while democrats have mounted an orchestrated effort to keep him off though he hurts kerry more than bush , there s a potential that he hurts bush , too , said anna greenberg , a democratic pollster who has examined nader voters , although she said potential nader voters were difficult to find and hard to track mr nader maintained in the interview there is no evidence that he takes votes from mr kerry he said surveys by zogby showed him pulling equally from mr bush and mr kerry a spokeswoman for zogby international , shawnta walcott , said that zogby polls showed mr nader drawing far more from mr kerry she said the polls , aggregated from march through last month , showed that if mr nader was not an option , 41 percent of his supporters went to mr kerry and 15 percent went to mr bush thirty percent went elsewhere and 13 percent were undecided ms greenberg said that the profile of likely nader supporters was changing and beginning to resemble that of voters who supported h ross perot , the thirdparty candidate , in 1996 , rather than those who supported mr nader in 2000 indeed , several celebrities and liberal activists who supported mr nader in 2000 have renounced him and urged other former supporters to vote for mr kerry , because defeating mr bush is their top priority mr nader s former running mate , winona laduke , has endorsed mr kerry voters who supported mr nader in 2000 tended to split equally between men and women and who were white , liberal and college educated ms greenberg said voters who supported him tended to be white men , blue collar , fiscally conservative , populist , against open trade , angry about the high cost of health care and prescription drugs and virulently opposed to the iraq war she said mr kerry had helped diminish mr nader s appeal to some of those voters through his advertising and in the debates nader is taking less out of kerry now , she said so the leftover nader vote is more conservative , meaning that they were bush supporters originally but have defected , probably because he has allowed the deficit to balloon still , the nader factor seems wildly unpredictable nader is appealing to people who think neither party represents their interests , said david jones , who runs an antinader web site , thenaderfactorcom i do n't know if we 're dealing with the old 2000 voter or the new 2004 voter the real question about them is will they vote \? in the interview , mr nader rejected the idea that he was a spoiler i deny the designation entirely , he said everyone is trying to get votes from everyone else so we 're all spoilers or none of us are spoilers mr nader said his campaign was at the very least producing great data for him to use after the election to fight what he says are restrictive and unfair ballotaccess laws he said that in the long term his current fight would help destroy the twoparty dominance of american politics , which he said was his goal we lose to win , eventually , he said that s the story of social justice you have to be willing to lose and fight , and lose and fight , and lose and fight until the agenda is won
when valery craane took the microphone and addressed david h komansky at merrill lynch s shareholders meeting last year , the faceoff illustrated just how much had changed since she joined the company in 1972 and perhaps just how little ms craane , one of the firm s most successful female stockbrokers , rose to speak on behalf of a group of women who had accused merrill of sexual discrimination it was clear that she was no stranger to mr komansky , who was making his farewell appearance as chairman of merrill he called her valery the two even worked on the same floor of the firm s headquarters in lower manhattan in the early 1970 s , before mr komansky headed onto the fast track to senior management ms craane , 65 , remains a broker in new york , one of 14 , 000 at the company , but an exceptional one she and her daughter , janine , 43 , also a merrill broker , manage more than 900 million for a roster of clients around the world at the annual meeting , mr komansky listened patiently as ms craane and other current and former brokers voiced grievances about merrill s treatment of women then he splashed fuel on their smoldering ire there is nothing we would like better than to end this once and for all , he said what we will not do is be blackmailed into paying an outrageous amount of money his words still burned in the ears of valery and janine craane last week when they filed detailed complaints of sexual and racial discrimination , harassment and retaliation essentially lawsuits , the complaints were filed thursday in a private system of mediation and arbitration that was created to settle a class action filed against merrill in 1997 their cases will be the final stage in an internal struggle that has dragged on for more than five years through it all , the craanes have kept working from adjacent offices in a merrill branch in the citicorp center in midtown manhattan they are the most productive brokers there , said their lawyer , linda d friedman until they filed their complaints , they had declined to tell their story publicly it s just not a level playing field for us women , valery craane said this is all about a profound lack of respect for who we are and what we do the craanes are among about 30 holdouts in a group of more than 900 women who filed discrimination and harassment claims against merrill in 1999 the firm has already paid more than 100 million to settle those claims , but the cases coming to a head this year could be the costliest valery craane s claim states that she lost tens of millions of dollars in compensation as a result of her treatment at merrill lynch and that the team of brokers and assistants she leads , known as the craane group , lost hundreds of millions of dollars in client assets , and therefore will continue to lose income terry kassel , the head of human resources at merrill , said that valery and janine are some of our best producers and are one of our only and most precious hispanic women teams but , ms kassel said , the craanes will have to prove their claims in arbitration because merrill believes either that they do not have merit or that the craanes were making excessive settlement demands in the last four months , merrill and another big wall street firm , morgan stanley , have made three payouts to former employees who lodged similar complaints in late april , a panel of arbitrators found that merrill had engaged in a pattern and practice of discrimination and ordered it to pay 22 million to hydie sumner , a broker who worked for the firm in san antonio then , on the brink of a trial last month , morgan stanley agreed to pay 54 million to settle a discrimination lawsuit filed by the federal equal employment opportunity commission on behalf of about 340 women who worked in a division of its investment bank a few days before morgan settled , merrill did , too , paying an undisclosed sum to a lawyer in london who had contended that she was the victim of retaliation after reporting that a senior merrill lawyer had made lewd comments to her those results showed that women s complaints of inequality on wall street continued to resonate eight years after ms friedman and her law partner , mary stowell , filed the boomboom room lawsuit against the smith barney brokerage unit of the company now known as citigroup that suit exposed fraternitystyle hazing and physical abuse of women at some smith barney branches and contended that there was systemic discrimination that limited the chances that women would succeed there some current and former employees at merrill say that the behavior of the men there was similarly lewd at times nancy thomas , a former merrill broker , contends that a supervisor once forcefully kissed her at a party and that other male coworkers routinely harassed her and other women in branches in manhattan and atlanta one day , she opened a gift box she found on her desk inside it were a dildo , some hand lotion and a sheet of perverse poetry , she contends her complaint of discrimination and harassment is scheduled for a final hearing in midseptember the craanes' complaint is not filled with allegations of harassment of an overtly sexual nature instead , it contends that they and women who worked around them were demeaned by male managers and coworkers and denied a fair share of opportunities to gain clients and make money clearly , the craanes are not poorly compensated they say their team brings in more than 45 million in annual revenue , which would yield considerably more than 1 million to the craanes janine craane declined to comment on the specifics of their income but like many other women who filed complaints , they argue that men still receive most of the good accounts that are redistributed when a broker leaves the firm some young men , the craanes say , get an advantage by being handed sizable assets to manage , a break that women rarely get their lawyer , ms friedman , said that over a 10year period , accounts worth nearly 2 billion were distributed among the brokers in the craanes' office , and that the craanes received only a negligible amount from 1994 through 1998 , their complaint states , about half of all the redistributed assets went to seven male brokers , while the craanes received slightly more than 2 percent they also say they were slighted when merrill doled out shares of new stocks , which were much in demand during the tech stock boom of the late 1990 s from 1995 through 1999 , the hottest period for initial public offerings , the craanes received less than 1 percent of the ipo shares allocated to brokers in their office , which their complaint contends were worth hundreds of millions of dollars ms kassel said on friday that she had not seen the craanes' latest complaints and was not prepared to discuss their contentions in detail much of the problem , the craanes said , lies in the way the brokerage business is structured no matter how wealthy and successful brokers become , they still rely on the firms that employ them for basics like office space , clerical support and sales assistants control of the resources that are needed by brokers rests in the hands of branch managers and sales managers , and at merrill most of these were men in 1995 , according to a statistical analysis by an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the classaction suit , 95 percent of all vice presidents , 98 percent of sales managers and 86 percent of brokers at merrill were men ms kassel said that the percentage of female brokers at merrill had remained flat , at about 15 percent , for several years , but that women s share of management jobs in the brokerage operation had risen since the lawsuit to 14 percent from 4 percent indeed , she noted , the firm recently appointed a woman to manage the branch in the citicorp center in the entire industry in 2003 , about 16 percent of brokers and 12 percent of branch managers were women , according to a survey conducted by the securities industry association merrill has been criticized for three decades as lacking in gender diversity in 1973 , helen o'bannon , who was rejected for a broker s job in pennsylvania , sued the firm the equal employment opportunity commission took up her case and found that there was evidence of sex discrimination at merrill the firm had given applicants a test that included this question which quality in a woman do you consider most important \? the choices were beauty , intelligence , dependency , independence and affectionateness applicants received two points for answering dependency or affectionateness , one point for choosing beauty and none for picking intelligence or independence the firm entered into a consent decree with the commission and agreed to hire more women as brokers and to stop giving applicants that test but for the next 20 years , merrill failed to meet its hiring goals it s very difficult to think in terms of numbers or percentages when we 're in a contraction as we 've been , mr komansky said at the 2003 annual meeting but he assured the shareholders that for women , it is a far different environment at merrill lynch today than it was in 2000 ms kassel reaffirmed that view last week , saying the firm had made many changes in how it manages diversity i would go so far as to say quite comfortably that nothing is the same , she said valery craane disagrees not only is the environment not much different than it was four years ago , she said , it has not changed all that much since she wrote a letter of resignation and briefly left the firm a quartercentury ago ms craane said she quit merrill in 1977 , when a male coworker made a comment about her that she found offensive she had started there after she was driven into the work force by the death of her husband , who was working as an auditor for the international accounting firm arthur andersen when he suffered a fatal heart attack at 36 ms craane , who was born in aruba , was a young mother of two children living in caracas , venezuela she moved to new york and enrolled at new york university s school of continuing education to study business fluent in dutch , spanish and portuguese , she joined the international division of merrill , where she had to share a desk and a phone with a male colleague after five frustrating years at merrill , she joined white weld , an investment banking firm that had offices in the same building in her merrill resignation letter , ms craane wrote that she had been treated like a clerk and could no longer endure painful struggles for the basic essential tools one must have when selling , including most importantly proper sales help that , she said in a recent interview , is the gist of her complaint today in many ways , she said , nothing has changed since then at the time she quit , she said , merrill owed her 10 , 000 in back pay , which for me was a lot of money in those days a panel of arbitrators heard her case but did not award her any money less than two years later , her career took a strange twist merrill bought white weld , meaning her old employer was her new employer ms craane said she refused to stay unless she got the 10 , 000 that she still contended she was owed this time , she prevailed back in the fold at merrill , she said , she resolved to try to overcome any bias she encountered it put me in overdrive , she recalled all i wanted to do is show them several years later , when janine was finishing her undergraduate studies at amherst college , merrill recruited her for its corporate intern program in 1983 , with a bachelor s degree in spanish literature and fluent in four languages , she joined merrill with the idea of working in its global investment banking division , which she said she believed would be more meritocratic than the brokerage operation but when she was offered a job on a trading desk there , it was at a starting salary 10 , 000 below what men were getting to do the same job , she said concluding that trading was a severely unfriendly environment for women , she chose instead to be a brokertrainee in the firm s prestigious branch on park avenue in her third year as a fullfledged broker , janine craane produced 700 , 000 in revenue for the firm , according to her complaint her fast start earned her a win smith fellowship , an award given to brokers who surpass 550 , 000 in annual sales before their sixth year the award is named for winthrop h smith , a founder of the firm , which was once known as merrill lynch , pierce , fenner smith in 1986 , valery craane moved to midtown to work in the same office as her daughter , though it was not until 1996 that they officially became what merrill calls a team , sharing commissions and fees from their accounts while the firm has long favored the idea of having male brokers groom their sons to succeed them , the craanes said they received no encouragement from their managers to join forces still , merrill promoted the craanes as the embodiment of virtually every facet the firm wanted to show off they were worldly , smart , successful and they were women merrill officials basked in the reflected glow as the craanes were profiled in newspapers and glossy magazines like fortune back at the office , they contend , the reception was not so warm the administrative manager for a merrill office on fifth avenue where they worked used slurs to refer to hispanics and women in general and the craanes in particular , they contend in their complaints when asked about these accusations , a merrill spokesman said the conduct alleged is more than a decade old and , the manager accused denies saying the things the craanes have alleged such conduct , if it were true , would be reprehensible , unacceptable and repugnant to the firm the craanes say their complaints to branch managers and to their supervisors , the district directors , were largely ignored the managers often went to strip clubs with male brokers and once held a meeting at stringfellows , a strip club in manhattan , they contend in their complaints managers also allowed brokers to hire strippers to perform in the office , the craanes say janine craane said discrimination persisted on wall street because each of its firms was like a fraternity they feel that women do n't belong in that club , she said you have your boys , your soldiers , the guys that you trust whether they 're not so talented is maybe not so important as their loyalty to the group despite the way they say they were treated , the craanes did not join the group of women who filed suit against the firm in 1997 , because they feared that their managers would take it out of our hide , janine said if you want to succeed in this business , she added , a lot of the things that happen , you just swallow but when asked by company lawyers what they thought , she recalled , she told them that there was a problem with the way female employees were being treated she also said the firm could head it off without costly litigation after merrill settled the suit by agreeing to let every woman with a complaint of harassment or discrimination file a claim in a special resolution process , the craanes faced a tougher decision having built a thriving business over a combined 40 years at the firm , they had a lot to lose ultimately , valery craane said , i had to file because this had to change janine craane said that her mother knew that when she filed , a lot of other women at the firm would take courage and file as well she added we felt that if we stood together and we filed , the firm would get a clear message in all , 912 current and former employees filed claims , about a dozen of them from the office where the craanes worked it must be in my character to take abuse , valery craane said , explaining why she is willing to continue battling with her employer i feel that i owe it to my daughter to see that we have a change in tactics here
sean combs s shadow precedes him at the royale theater that s literally as well as figuratively in the moment before mr combs makes his hotly awaited entrance in the seriously offcenter revival of lorraine hansberry s raisin in the sun , which opened last night , his wavering shadow is cast from offstage , heralding his arrival like a soft , urgent fanfare audra mcdonald , the firstrate actress playing his wife , calls his character s name walter lee , it s time for you to get up ! and you can feel the audience drawing a collective breath mr combs , of course , is the entertainment mogul , hiphop artist , fashion entrepreneur and professional famous person better known as p diddy \( and formerly known as puff daddy \) his participation makes this production of hansberry s epochal drama , which is directed by kenny leon and also stars phylicia rashad , a highly suspenseful event in a season when theatrically green celebrities from farrah fawcett to ashley judd have turned to road kill on new york stages mr combs s anticipatory shadow thus hovers like a question mark over thomas lynch s scrupulously shabby evocation of a lowermiddleclass apartment in southside chicago in the 1950 s will the very 21stcentury figure who is mr combs , whose career has been a sustained triumph of nerve over probability , be able to turn into a man of continually thwarted dreams of the mid20th century \? will he prove that you do n't need long years of experience and training to knock 'em dead on broadway \? for as much as 10 minutes after mr combs hits the stage , looking appealingly tousled and sleepyeyed , these questions are left hanging portraying walter lee younger , a role immortalized by sidney poitier on broadway in 1959 and in the 1961 film , mr combs seems at first to have made a daring actor s choice that he just might pull off raisin in the sun depicts walter lee s belated emergence into manhood and in his opening scene as he pouts and teases with his wife , ruth \( ms mcdonald \) mr combs s walter evokes a man who in his 30 s is still marooned in early adolescence you might even mistake this walter for the older brother of travis \( alexander mitchell \) , the little boy who is in fact his son clearly , mr combs has left lots of space for walter to grow unfortunately , that space is never filled this omission makes the revival a lopsided and ultimately dreary affair though the production features sterling work from ms mcdonald and ms rashad , who plays walter lee s formidable mother , it lacks the fully developed central performance from mr combs that would hold the show together this walter lee never appears to change , in big ways or small happy or sad , drunk or sober , angry or placating , his evenly measured words and debating team captain s gestures remain pretty much the same this is a significant problem , since walter lee is meant to represent a new generational spirit among africanamericans in a time of social transition and neither mr combs nor the exceptionally pretty sanaa lathan as walter lee s ambitious sister , beneatha , who is studying to be a doctor makes an argument for this generation as one to pin your hopes on from beginning to end , they register as petulant , spoiled overgrown children with none of the complexity of the maternal figures played by ms mcdonald and ms rashad this raisin is all about the kids versus the grownups , and not in the sense that hansberry meant it instead of contrasting the forces of conservative , godfearing womanhood with a fresh revolutionary spirit , the show becomes an ungainly counterpoint of mature and callow acting styles it s an approach that deprives audiences of an empathetic handle on the trials of the lee family , headed by the widowed lena \( ms rashad \) and it never lets this sturdy kitchensink drama involve you even as a soap opera the plot built on the younger family s squabbles over what to do with the 10 , 000 life insurance policy on walter lee s father that has come due may seem creaky in the best of productions but as was evident in the more consistent revival at the williamstown theater festival five years ago , raisin was remarkably prescient in identifying issues that would continue to shape africanamerican life black men s struggles for selfassertion in households dominated by strong women the movement to separate african from american identities christianity as both an oppressive and redemptive power the restlessness of women imprisoned by domesticity all these elements come into play in hansberry s drama and that s not to mention the plot pivot in which the younger family plans to move into a white neighborhood abstract conflicts are given engagingly particular life by ms mcdonald , a threetime tony winner , and by ms rashad her natural radiance clouded with boneweariness , ms mcdonald s ruth is a life force on the verge of extinction , tethered to an ironing board and her husband s selfcenteredness an unrecognizably folksy , motherhenish ms rashad , who played a very different sort of matriarch on the cosby show on television , admirably finds both the strengths and weaknesses in blind maternal love these women become invaluable touchstones whenever you want to read the emotional content of a scene , it s their faces you must look to if they 're not onstage , you 're in trouble , since mr leon has otherwise emphasized the singlenote , highpitched , perky style of sitcoms \( the audience laughs at bewilderingly unexpected places \) mr combs is not the wholesale embarrassment that connoisseurs of schadenfreude were hoping for the donald trumplike confidence that has made him the success he is keeps him from dissolving into a spotlighted puddle but he comes across as smaller than you might expect , as madonna did when she made her broadway debut in speed the plow most disspiriting , though , is his lack of variety though his eyes gleam promisingly in the early scenes , there is rarely a flicker of transforming feeling on his handsome , selfassured face you can only sympathize with mr leon , who has come up with various devices for working around this stolidity , like having walter lee freeze with his back to the audience to stare moodily out the window in the climactic moment when walter lee discovers that he may have destroyed his family s prospects for happiness , mr combs simply buries his face in his hands , while occasionally registering anguish by massaging his scalp all things considered , this was probably the right choice a

by now , new yorkers should be used to seeing themselves portrayed in architectural renderings over the past year or so , in image after image , we have seen ourselves shown gazing at the wonders that will someday be built in lower manhattan on thursday , we got yet another glimpse of the future , when santiago calatrava s design for the new transportation hub at ground zero was revealed if anything , the new yorkers pictured in the computer renderings of this design appear too complacent they should be pictured with looks of surprise and gratitude on their faces for the past two years , many of us have been waiting for a building that embodies grace and simplicity to fill the aching space tragically created on 9 11 mr calatrava s station may well be that building he explains its soaring twinwinged glass and steel arc with the image of a child releasing a dove , which is the kind of anticipatory architectural symbolism that has become familiar over the past few months he quotes matisse on the character of new york s extraordinary light something we do n't often pause to notice and suggests that this station is itself a sculpture made out of that light but this permanent path station , which will replace the temporary one now in service , is likely to become the kind of creation that is iconic in its own right , that needs no explanatory buttressing its functional virtues will be as obvious as its aesthetic ones only appropriate in a station as construction winds down in several years on this building and on the new daniel patrick moynihan station , new york will probably find itself in the extravagant position of possessing three of the greatest stations ever built it s worth noting that mr calatrava s design came about in an oldfashioned way a client hired an architect no public process , none of the constant oversight that has helped shape other designs in lower manhattan in this case , the client is the port authority a few years ago , the thought that the port authority of new york and new jersey could have grasped the eloquence of mr calatrava s idiom would have seemed almost absurd but as mr calatrava points out , he discovered , in working with the men and women of the port authority , a hidden emotion the echo , of course , of what they lost on sept 11 we do not usually suspect such institutions of having emotions , hidden or otherwise it is the extraordinary achievement of this building that it catches that emotion and translates it for us to share
the fight is a deflating look back at a sports rivalry burdened by the geopolitical heft of the 1930 s , when the africanamerican champ joe louis and the german prizefighter max schmeling were duking it out louis , the mildmannered slugger , accrued more cultural significance than he sought , and the documentary sags with long looks at his weary and reluctant face it was not as if louis avoided fame and fortune he threw roundhouse punches with a survivor s gusto and threw himself into all the pleasures that prize money could buy born in alabama and bought up in detroit , he built muscles as a ford autoworker and an iceblock delivery man louis s friends from those years attest that punching power is a perfectible skill for many , but for louis it was an inherent gift in this depressionera portrait , which will be shown tonight on most pbs stations , the fighters' pain comes not merely from bruises and swollen eyelids , but from a chipping away at their identities born joseph louis barrow , louis dropped his surname , and his handlers pushed him into a marriage to mask his crosscountry tomcatting more generally , the historian jeffrey sammons says , louis had to be a biblereading , motherloving , godfearing individual , and not too black louis had to spiff up his image in part to confront the bigotry that then kept africanamerican boxers out of contention for major title fights and there was also the lingering legacy of jack johnson , an outspoken scrapper from earlier decades , whose swagger had heightened racial tensions louis had to fashion himself as a role model , burying his impulses and answering hostility with tranquillity \( the film also attributes his silent manner to a stammer \) his legendary rival schmeling also retooled his persona schmeling was at first a freeliving celebrity who was something of a fetish object for weimar berliners , his burly physique enthralling bon vivants but as hitler asserted new powers , schmeling noticed that many of his jewish and gay fans had disappeared he took orders from publicimage overlords , just as louis did schmeling s minders , however , included joseph goebbels , the nazi propagandist , who is shown in photos with the boxer s chosen bride , a blonde czechoslovak film star who was a favorite of hitler s eventually schmeling s every foray into an american arena became a public relations opportunity for the third reich after one knockout he led a sieg heil ! salute among attendants and fans , a moment extravagantly described in the film as high wagnerian pageantry schmeling s promoter , an american jew , even got into the act , which displeased the nazis for reasons including but not limited to the lit cigar in his saluting hand the louisschmeling fights , both in yankee stadium , were phenomenal public events and fierce sports contests schmeling knocked out louis in the first , in 1936 , a surprising upset louis brutally beat schmeling in the rematch in 1938 , knocking him out in the first round but the true brutality was reserved for the loser of each fight louis endured animal comparisons in newspapers and taunts from detroit kids , the film recalls with snowflakes on his lapel , schmeling is shown making a lonely return to germany after his defeat , with none of the hoopla of his previous homecoming in a fanfilled zeppelin field in the end , the documentary turns dreary , with all the rahrahs drained from the rousing victories the writer david margolick , a consultant to the production , tries t0 subvert one of the fight s closing grace notes decades after they fought , louis and schmeling often met for the benefit of the cameras , though the relationship seems to have gone deeper we learn that schmeling , by then a cocacola bottling executive , chipped in for louis s 1981 funeral costs but mr margolick says sourly , i do n't think they were great friends , they were barely friends schmeling and lewis often come across in the fight as surprisingly powerless , given the might that they demonstrate in the ring they had enormous expectations placed on their broad shoulders , as the media presented them as exemplars of not merely nations but also of entire races the saddest moments come as they buckle under the directives of image managers , who led each to tinker with his persona to maximize a fan base in resisting these forces neither boxer put up much of a fight the fight american experience pbs , tonight at 9 check local listings barak goodman , producer , director and writer john maggio , coproducer david margolick , consulting producer lewis erskine , editor music by edward bilous courtney b vance , narrator mark samels , series executive producer sharon grimberg , series editor produced by social media productions for american experience
the everrising tide of sales of the da vinci code has lifted some pretty odd boats , and none odder than the dodgy yet magisterial holy blood , holy grail , by michael baigent , richard leigh and henry lincoln a best seller in the 1980 s , grail is climbing the paperback charts again on the strength of its relationship to dan brown s thriller \( which has , in turn , inspired a crop of new nonfiction books coming out this spring , from breaking the da vinci code to secrets of the code the unauthorized guide to the mysteries behind the da vinci code \) the da vinci code is one long chase scene in which the main characters flee a sinister parisian policeman and an albino monk assassin , but its rudimentary suspense alone could n't have made it a hit at regular intervals , the book brings its pellmell plot to a screeching halt and emits a pellet of information concerning a centuriesold conspiracy that purports to have preserved a tremendous secret about the roots of christianity itself this nonfiction material gives the da vinci code its frisson of authenticity , and it s lifted from holy blood , holy grail , one of the alltime great works of pop pseudohistory but what seems increasingly clear \( to cop a favorite phrase from the authors of grail \) is that the da vinci code , like holy blood , holy grail , is based on a notorious hoax the back story to both books , like most conspiracy theories , is devilishly hard to summarize both narratives begin with a mystery that leads sleuths to vaster and more sinister intrigues in brown s novel , it s the murder of a curator at the louvre in grail , it s the unusual affluence of a priest in a village in the south of france in the late 1960 s , henry lincoln , a british tv writer , became interested in renneslech teau , a town that had become the french equivalent of roswell or loch ness as a result of popular books by g rard de s de de s de promulgated a story about parchments supposedly found in a hollowedout pillar by the town priest in the 1890 s , parchments containing coded messages that the priest somehow parlayed into oodles of cash lincoln worked on several unsolved mysteriesstyle documentaries about renneslech teau , then enlisted baigent and leigh for a more indepth investigation what eventually emerges from the welter of names , dates , maps and genealogical tables crammed into holy blood , holy grail is a yarn about a secret and hugely influential society called the priory of sion , founded in jerusalem in 1099 this cabal is said to have guarded documents and other proof that mary magdalene was the wife of jesus \( who may or may not have died on the cross \) and that she carried his child with her when she fled to what is now france after the crucifixion , becoming , figuratively , the holy grail in whom jesus' blood was preserved their progeny intermarried with the locals , eventually founding the merovingian dynasty of frankish monarchs although deposed in the eighth century , the merovingian lineage has not been lost the priory has kept watch over its descendants , awaiting an auspicious moment when it will reveal the astonishing truth and return the rightful monarch to the throne of france , or perhaps even a restored holy roman empire all the usual suspects and accouterments of paranoid history get caught up in this 1 , 000year jaunt the cathar heretics , the knights templar , the rosicrucians , the vatican , the freemasons , nazis , the dead sea scrolls , the protocols of the elders of zion , the order of the golden dawn everyone but the abominable snowman seems to be in on the game holy blood , holy grail is a masterpiece of insinuation and supposition , employing all the techniques of pseudohistory to symphonic effect , justifying this sleight of hand as an innovative scholarly technique called synthesis , previously considered too speculative by those whose thinking has been unduly shaped by the socalled enlightenment of the 18th century comparing themselves to the reporters who uncovered the watergate scandal , the authors maintain that only by such synthesis can one discern the underlying continuity , the unified and coherent fabric , which lies at the core of any historical problem to do so , one must realize that it is not sufficient to confine oneself exclusively to facts thus liberated , lincoln et al concoct an argument that is not so much factual as factish dozens of credible details are heaped up in order to provide a legitimizing cushion for rank nonsense unremarkable legends \( that merovingian kings were thought to have a healing touch , for example \) are characterized as suggestive clues or puzzles demanding solution highly contested interpretations \( that , say , an early grail romance depicts the sacred object as being guarded by templars \) are presented as established truth sources such as the new testament are qualified as questionable and derivative when they contradict the conspiracy theory , then microscopically scrutinized for inconsistencies that might support it the authors spin one gossamer strand of conjecture over another , forming a web dense enough to create the illusion of solidity though bogus , it s an impressive piece of work finally , though , the legitimacy of the priory of sion history rests on a cache of clippings and pseudonymous documents that even the authors of holy blood , holy grail suggest were planted in the biblioth que nationale by a man named pierre plantard as early as the 1970 s , one of plantard s confederates had admitted to helping him fabricate the materials , including genealogical tables portraying plantard as a descendant of the merovingians \( and , presumably , of jesus christ \) and a list of the priory s past grand masters this patently silly catalog of intellectual celebrities stars botticelli , isaac newton , jean cocteau and , of course , leonardo da vinci and it s the same list dan brown trumpets , along with the alleged ninecentury pedigree of the priory , in the front matter for the da vinci code , under the heading of fact plantard , it eventually came out , was an inveterate rascal with a criminal record for fraud and affiliations with wartime antisemitic and rightwing groups the actual priory of sion was a tiny , harmless group of likeminded friends formed in 1956 plantard s hoax was debunked by a series of \( as yet untranslated \) french books and a 1996 bbc documentary , but curiously enough , this set of shocking revelations has n't proved as popular as the fantasia of holy blood , holy grail , or , for that matter , as the da vinci code the only thing more powerful than a worldwide conspiracy , it seems , is our desire to believe in one
spain s government has conceded that there is no evidence linking the basque separatist group eta to the terrorist bombings of commuter trains in madrid on march 11 interior minister ngel acebes , whose popular party suffered a surprise defeat in the national elections three days after the blasts , had repeatedly insisted that eta was responsible even as mounting evidence pointed to militants linked to al qaeda but in an interview published monday in the conservative daily abc , mr acebes was asked whether there were any indications that linked eta to the attacks he responded plainly , in the investigation , none whatsoever prime minister jos mar a aznar s government , a staunch supporter of the united statesled war in iraq despite its unpopularity with the spanish public , had trumpeted its record in fighting basque separatists in the campaign leading up to the march 14 elections , which it was expected to win instead , it was decisively defeated , in a reversal that several political analysts attributed in part to outrage by voters who felt the government had withheld the truth in the investigation hours after the bombing , mr aznar had called the editors of spanish newspapers to emphasize the government s conviction that eta was responsible a catalonian daily published a special edition blaming the violent basque group , which had failed in an attempt to set off a bomb in a train station in madrid on dec 24 later in the day , the foreign ministry called for a united nations resolution condemning the eta terrorist attacks foreign minister ana palacio sent a memo instructing diplomats to say eta had committed the bombings mr acebes continued to insist that eta was the principal suspect until the eve of the election , when he said a second line of inquiry was being pursued based on new evidence , including a video claiming responsibility in the name of al qaeda and the arrest of several moroccans the prime ministerelect , jos luis rodr guez zapatero , who opposed the war in iraq and campaigned on promises to withdraw the spanish troops in the absence of a clear united nations mandate , has repeatedly countered accusations that his victory was prompted by fears of future terrorist attacks on monday , a spokesman for the interior ministry qualified mr acebes s blunt statement , saying that in an investigation this complex , all lines of inquiry must remain open he added , however , that right now there s nothing pointing to the basque separatists mr acebes , who will become secretary general of his party when the socialist administration takes office next month , has not called a news conference on the investigation since the elections , citing security reasons days after , however , he presented a declassified document , which he said proved that the government had lied or concealed information since the attacks , at least 20 people have been arrested and 12 sent to prison , most of them moroccan they face provisional charges of murder and terrorism two more , a moroccan and a syrian , were arrested and charged on monday , the associated press reported , quoting court officials three of those arrested earlier were released in the abc interview , mr acebes said the government should not be blamed for failing to prevent the attacks islamic terrorism is extremely complex , he said the security and antiterrorist services have functioned and have not been careless about this type of terrorism he also said he had no regrets about how the government handled the information on the investigation minute by minute , i told the spanish people what i thought they should know , without harming the investigation , but with total clarity , thinking only of the victims and the right of the spanish people to be properly informed , he said we did what we had to do without thinking about the electoral consequences
court philippe chatrier at the french open was halfempty early thursday and a little bit dead , as jennifer capriati put it her secondround opponent , kveta peschke of the czech republic , carried a special injury ranking of 146 into the match because of a major knee operation given the uninspired setting , capriati had to find a spark from within it flickered on and off in her 75 , 63 victory , but capriati did not seem overly concerned i did what i had to do to basically win the match , she said the crowd offered little feedback on a quiet morning , and capriati acknowledged that it was just hard to get going a little bit the seventhseeded capriati , perhaps the most comfortable on clay among the americans , will face no 25 elena bovina in the third round capriati , 28 , had been impressive in her last tournament in rome , where she defeated serena williams for the first time in nine matches in a semifinal she lost to am lie mauresmo of france in the championship game capriati also played well in reaching the semifinals of berlin s claycourt event a back injury kept capriati out of the australian open and indian wells earlier this year , undermining her fitness in 1 hour 13 minutes against peschke , she racked up 30 unforced errors and had to squirm out of a 53 deficit in the first set capriati bailed herself out by dropping only four points while capturing the last four games of the set in the second set , pechske saved two match points before capriati stabbed awkwardly at a backhand and pechske slapped a volley into the net the going had been tougher in the previous round for capriati she fell behind by 03 in the third set against yulia beygelzimer i think she has the fitness in the head , peschke said she s very strong the good news for capriati is that none of the top women have dominated and that topseeded justine heninhardenne lost on wednesday capriati still bludgeons the ball at the baseline , and at times she overwhelmed peschke in other exchanges , capriati s court sense seemed to betray her , and she had to remind herself to seize the initiative i ca n't expect to just turn it on , you know , like later on in the week , she said i think this is the time to get more confident , kind of practice things in these matches for when you might really need them later roland garros has been friendly territory for capriati she captured the french open in 2001 as part of a comeback year and followed with an appearance in the semifinals in 2002 and a spot in the round of 16 last year capriati made her french open debut in 1990 as a 14yearold , reaching the semifinals then she went through wellchronicled growing pains and extended layoffs from tennis last month , capriati hired steffi graf s former coach , heinz gunthardt , on a tournamentbytournament basis to replace her father , stefano maybe when you 're used to hearing the same thing over and over , it does n't really register anymore , capriati said
ralph g allen , a guggenheimwinning theater historian who parlayed a scholarly paper on the pratfalls , bawdy humor and very bad puns of american burlesque into the book of the hit broadway musical sugar babies , died on thursday after a walk in manhattan he was 70 and lived in manhattan and knoxville , tenn no cause of death was given , but his wife , harriet nichols , said dr allen had suffered from heart trouble and diabetes for some time sugar babies , starring ann miller and mickey rooney in his broadway debut , was a loving homage to the oldfashioned burlesque revue conceived by dr allen and harry rigby , with music by jimmy mchugh and lyrics by dorothy fields and al dubin , the show opened at the mark hellinger theater in october 1979 a hit with both critics and audiences , it ran for nearly three years , with 1 , 208 performancesdr allen s book , based on the traditional routines that he had adored as a young man , was nominated for a tony award reviewing the show in the new york times , walter kerr called it an entertainment that is impurely and simply honest about the wild way things once were by day , dr allen , was a respected scholar for many years a professor of theater at the university of tennessee , also taught at new york university , ucla and the university of pittsburgh but the afterhours world of the burlesque house , with its spraying seltzer bottles , scantily clad chorus girls and creaky but remarkably funny jokes , was never far from his mind dr allen was born on jan 7 , 1934 , in philadelphia , and saw his first burlesque show as a teenager at first all the boys went down there to see the girls , dr allen s wife recalled but he found that he loved the jokes none are printable in a family newspaper he kept going back , first as an enthusiast , eventually as an academic dr allen held a bachelor s degree from amherst college and a doctorate from the yale school of drama , where he met his wife , an actress and translator she is his only immediate survivor in moments stolen from his academic work \( he was an authority on , among other things , the 18thcentury painter philip james de loutherbourg , who designed scenery for david garrick \) dr allen visited theaters around the country , sitting with elderly comics and taking down their routines he amassed a collection of some 5 , 000 comedy sketches he considered writing a book , but dr allen realized it would be much more fun to put on a show he wrote a revue , based on the sketches , which was performed at the university of tennessee some time later , dr allen gave a talk in new york at a conference on early20thcentury popular entertainment as part of his lecture , he read the script of his revue afterward , he was approached by a member of the audience , mr rigby , a producer you 've got something really funny here , mr rigby said , and the two men began work on what would become sugar babies when the show opened on broadway , it featured not only period songs \( including i ca n't give you anything but love , sunny side of the street \) and tap dance \( starring ms miller s stillfabulous gams \) , but also a fan dance , a flock of doves , ms miller whacking mr rooney s wig off his head with a rolledup newspaper and mr rooney waddling gamely around the stage in drag dr allen s other stage work included a revival of ibsen s ghosts , which he produced for the kennedy center in 1982 in collaboration with david campbell , he also wrote the book and lyrics for the broadway musical honky tonk nights , about black vaudeville it ran for just four performances in 1986 in later years dr allen continued to combine his scholarly and popular pursuits , teaching classes on the history of vaudeville and lecturing on jokes and their meanings but it was sugar babies , a musical with a singular distinction , of which he was most proud it became the only scholarly paper , dr allen s wife explained , to be made into a broadway show
germany s social democratic party , which has headed its governing coalition for six years , has always been the party of the country s working class that is why when the leader of the country s biggest trade union called the government a failure the other day , it seemed as if something was fundamentally out of kilter in german politics things seem to get worse and worse for the social democrats and for germany s beleaguered chancellor , gerhard schr der he is widely regarded as one of europe s canniest politicians , but he is not only setting record lows in german public opinion polls but also seems in danger now of losing his core constituency , the labor unions his one consolation , however , is that he has good company in europe whatever their ideology or position on the spectrum , the governing parties of many countries , certainly the biggest ones , are experiencing troubles similar to his in france and italy , governed by conservative parties , and in britain and here in germany , governed from the traditional left , the governing parties have been soundly defeated in recent local or european elections , as their rankings in the polls have continued to decline the fact that both leftist and rightist governing parties are in such trouble suggests that something deep is at work in europe , a general distrust of traditional parties that transcends ideology and bespeaks a pessimism about the ability of the standard politics of either the left or the right to work in the future there s a tremendous amount of disillusionment with politics altogether , said timothy garton ash , the oxford university historian and commentator people feel that the mainstream parties do n't represent them , and this is strong right across europe , old and new , and that s why you get these extraordinary protest votes , which was dramatic in britain we live in a slightly paradoxical time , he continued , when people are disillusioned with politics , but they also do n't think that politics matter that much anyway they feel they 're going to live comfortably anyway , so they can afford a protest vote the situation , not surprisingly , is different in each of the biggest european countries in spain , the socialist party took power in march when voters turned out the conservative government after it appeared to have withheld information about the madrid terror bombings that killed 191 people in britain , prime minister tony blair s political troubles have a great deal to do with his support for the war in iraq in other words , while in germany and france the governing parties are getting no reward for their opposition to the iraq war , in britain mr blair has clearly been punished because of his firm support of it , with the failure of the occupying forces to find illicit weapons hurting his standing perhaps more than any other issue the irritation at mr blair is well summed up by his widespread portrayal as president bush s poodle , a lapdog who is viewed as having deceived the public to justify britain s participation the feeling was that iraq had gone wrong , david blunkett , britain s home secretary , said recently , after mr blair s labor party got a scant 26 percent of the vote in local elections , compared with the conservatives' 38 percent two days later , mr blair s party received less than 23 percent of the vote in the european parliamentary elections those elections were a stunning reprimand too for leaders of the other big european countries in italy , the party of prime minister silvio berlusconi got just 21 percent of the vote after he loudly predicted that it would get 25 percent mr schr der s social democrats received 23 percent , the party s worst national showing in 50 years , and the conservative party of president jacques chirac of france got a mere 166 percent of the votes , compared with 29 percent for the socialists three months earlier , moreover , mr chirac s party was drubbed in local french elections , losing control of all but one of the 12 regional governments it controlled before the election this does not mean that any of those four leaders are in imminent danger of losing office indeed , france , italy and germany do not have national elections for at least two years the british labor party , though suffering in the polls , is still seen as likely to win the next general election , possibly next year , in part because of disarray in the ranks of the conservative opposition moreover , the leaders in question are tough political tacticians who have battled back from difficulties in the past but the election results , and the persistent low standings of major european leaders in the polls , reflect an antiincumbent mood in europe that , experts in the various countries say , reflects two elements in the picture one is a widespread public perception that things are going badly even as governments are asking for sacrifices from ordinary people the other is the failure of the governing parties to enunciate a vision to find a churchillian language , mr ash said , worthy of the moment that can overcome the public s pessimism the main problem for schr der is that there are no results , said klaus hillenbrand , the editor of tageszeitung , a small , often satirical daily in germany people have to work longer hours , and they get less social security , and all this was done because the government said we need more jobs , but there are no more jobs the labor leader who criticized mr schr der , frank bsirske , who heads the 26 million member united services union , known by its german abbreviation as verdi , said in an interview with the newspaper welt am sonntag , measured against his claim that he would create jobs , reduce joblessness and pep up the economy , gerhard schr der has been a failure there are paradoxes in the european leaders' current situation , among them that among the four leaders , mr blair s economic record is probably the best mr schr der , mr chirac and mr berlusconi are staking their governments on economic reform programs intended to make their countries more competitive , but none have shown strong results on sunday , 40 german trade union and leftist members of the social democrats , united in opposition to what they see as his probusiness agenda , took the first step toward forming a new farleft party all parties , in other words , are struggling to deal with a new era in europe , where social protections have become too expensive and a globalized economy , with jobs being outsourced to poland , slovakia and , especially , china , has made vigorous economic growth almost a memory in theory , and according to polls , people are in favor of reforms , said peter l sche , a professor of political science at g ttingen university in reality , however , if they feel hurt by the reforms , they are opposed to the current government in power it s as simple as that in italy , where mr berlusconi has long promised lower taxes , a streamlining of the bureaucracy and more competition in protected areas of economic life , including many who previously supported him , have defected , saying they are disillusioned that , contrary to his promises , the reforms have not been carried out there is a specific problem with the leadership of mr berlusconi , paolo gentiloni , a member of the centerleft opposition , said in an interview just before the european elections for many years , he was considered a sort of magician , who could take a very difficult situation and change it for the good he seems to be no more capable of this his communication tricks are not working all of the leaders in political difficulty are in partnership with other parties to form governing coalitions , and that has meant that ideological differences are often more intense inside the governing group than between it and the formal opposition in germany , for example , mr schr der s party , as mr bsirske s criticism shows , is deeply divided internally , with much of the traditional labor union constituency of the party demanding that the government deal with the country s economic stagnation by increased spending and by higher taxes on the rich he has an old party that clings to old values that they want to reestablish , said wolfgang nowak , a former adviser to mr schr der who is now an official at deutsche bank schr der ca n't give a design for the future , because if he does , the party will break into pieces it is no longer a motor for change

with his heroic instincts and superhuman powers , spiderman has saved countless old ladies , at least one screaming heroine and an entire subway of new yorkers but his biggest save yet in the big apple may be that of his creator , marvel enterprises marvel , which owns the rights to the spiderman character , has seen its fortunes soar from the spiderman movies over the last four years , thanks in large part to a steady stream of spideyrelated revenue , marvel has gone from losing tens of millions of dollars a year to turning a profit of 152 million on revenue of 348 million in 2003 in addition to financial stability , spiderman s huge box office success \( 821 million worldwide for the first movie and 285 million to date for spiderman 2 \) has afforded marvel unusual clout in hollywood for movie deals featuring its other characters yet , particularly since the sequel opened at the end of june , marvel s stock has been hammered , dropping from its 52week high of 2382 to 1592 as of friday the apparent disconnect is partly explained by classic wall street logic some analysts and investors worry that marvel will be hard pressed to top spiderman , and that after two xmen films , two blade films , hulk , daredevil and the punisher , it has used up all its wellknown characters show us which film other than spiderman' has been really successful on the toy shelves , said peter mirsky , an analyst at oppenheimer , noting that toys and other filmrelated merchandise are marvel s biggest generators of revenue and profit marvel executives insist that with a library of 4 , 700 comic properties , they have plenty of material blade was totally unknown and those two movies were very successful and we 're going into the third movie , marvel s chief executive , allen s lipson , said and unless you were in the comic book world , you did n't know daredevil the two blade films generated combined box office sales of 278 million worldwide daredevil made 178 million with the average worldwide box office of marvel s eight films at 280 million , hollywood executives are excited about the company s prospects spiderman , ' 'xmen' and 'harry potter' are the three continuing tripleaplus , solidgold franchises in the business right now , and marvel s got two of them , says tom rothman , cochairman of fox filmed entertainment , which produced xmen and daredevil and is making three more marvel films begun 65 years ago , marvel produces 60 comic book titles a month and maintains a loyal fan base and dominance in the market but comic publishing contributes just 15 percent of the company s operating profits licensing revenue from films and related merchandise contributes 83 percent somebody once joked to me that marvel is nothing more than a bunch of lawyers and accountants , said mr lipson , who is himself a lawyer and joined marvel in 1999 as its general counsel in the late 1990 s , marvel was in dire need of the skills of a good contract lawyer not only was the place a financial mess , having been plagued with a contentious , yearlong bankruptcy and a revolving door of chief executives , but marvel had been giving away the crown jewels marvel , for example , received a small upfront payment of several million dollars for rights to men in black , but got none of the 587 million the film pulled in at the worldwide box office determined to extract more value from marvel s characters , mr lipson joined f peter cuneo , vice chairman of the marvel board , and avi arad , chief executive of marvel studios in los angeles , and renegotiated all the deals for films not yet released eventually , marvel extracted better and better terms , especially after the releases of xmen in 2000 and spiderman in 2002 generally speaking , today marvel receives 2 percent to 3 percent of a film s worldwide sales , including dvd and cable but in some deals , like the one with lions gate entertainment for the punisher , marvel receives half of the studio s profit it is a measure of marvel s elevated status in hollywood that while the company contributes none of the capital for film production or marketing , it maintains considerable influence over the creative process for spiderman , mr arad submitted an approved list of names from which sony could choose a director no changes , like costume alterations or additions of superpowers , can be done without marvel s approval spiderman , for instance , is not permitted to kill anyone these characters are our lifeblood , mr lipson said we ca n't let a studio ruin a character for us late last year , mr lipson and his team decided to extract more revenue from marvel s license agreements with merchandisers mr lipson said he felt that having many companies selling the same product was keeping wholesale prices down now , instead of 12 producers of spiderman , hulk and xmen candy and 4 producers of sneakers , there is one of each , and the price they pay marvel has gone up but mr cuneo , the vice chairman , acknowledges that marvel is probably approaching its limit for negotiating better licensing terms , meaning that increased revenue will have to come either from higher box office sales or more films there are risks , however , to pumping out too many movies mr mirsky , the oppenheimer analyst , said he did not think america s toy shelves would support too many more superhero characters marvel executives say they are not worried about how to increase licensing revenue mr lipson said that international sales were a huge untapped resource , and marvel also has plans to expand into other media last year the company published a youngadult novel based on spiderman s love interest , mary jane , and mr arad s group signed a deal with lions gate for eight animated dvd s for children this time , however , marvel will do all the development and creative work and receive not just a sizable cut of profits , but a majority of them , said david maisel , chief operating officer of marvel studios i do n't know any other company in hollywood that could do that , he said

pnc financial services , the pittsburgh bank , said friday that it would acquire the venerable and beleaguered riggs national corporation for 779 million in stock and cash the deal ends riggs s independence , but does not fully put to rest all the problems engulfing the bank riggs , which is based here , is mired in investigations of possible money laundering and terrorist financing through saudi arabian and equatorial guinean accounts at the bank the sale comes after a scathing senate report released late wednesday that portrays riggs as a willing facilitator of possibly illicit financial deals involving a corrupt , brutal regime in the oilrich equatorial guinea as well as years of shady interactions with chile s former dictator , gen augusto pinochet while the sale is fairly small by standard valuations , it is significant because the scandal enveloping riggs has been watched with great apprehension by other banks wary that it will force regulators to police the industry much more strictly a senate hearing thursday on riggs s problems was attended by an overflow crowd that included banking lobbyists , senior regulators , current and former riggs executives , public relations specialists , oil industry executives and journalists the problems at riggs have exposed a federal regulatory apparatus that congressional critics say is loosely coordinated and recalcitrant about dealing forcefully with serious international moneylaundering problems that have plagued american banks for at least the last decade moneylaundering scandals involving citigroup , the bank of new york and other leading companies were swept under the rug by regulators and bankers anxious for quiet resolutions , and the riggs sale appears to be in keeping with that tradition , critics say regulators have already acknowledged lapses in their oversight of riggs i was amused by the comment of the pnc people on the conference call today that regulators , and i'm paraphrasing , were more than thrilled by this sale they were doing cartwheels , said gary b townsend , a banking analyst with friedman , billings , ramsey two people close to the sale negotiations , one a member of the regulatory community and another who advised one of the banks , said that regulators did not force riggs to made a deal with pnc regulators never said you 've got to sell the bank , but the riggs board saw a very high mountain to climb in terms of dealing with all the regulatory demands , the adviser said and pnc came in with a very high price that made it easy to consider a sale riggs , with assets of 6 billion , is a midsize institution whose value lies in an underdeveloped branch banking network concentrated in metropolitan washington its highprofile international and embassy operations were loosely monitored and barely profitable pnc , with assets of 74 billion , is concentrated in the midwest and the east riggs s strong banking franchise gives us an excellent platform on which to build in the extremely appealing metropolitan washington marketplace , said james e rohr , pnc s chairman and chief executive pnc would be responsible for paying the legal bills of anyone at riggs charged in a civil lawsuit related to the current investigation , but not for paying any civil fines corporate laws preclude pnc from paying the legal bills of anyone at riggs charged with a crime pnc executives said that they expected the regulatory problems at riggs to be wrapped up before the transaction s closing date , which was scheduled for early next year pnc deployed 90 people to scour operations at riggs and consult with regulators before a deal was struck and they said in a conference call friday that they were not anticipating any surprises the sale contract includes a material regulatory impairment clause that allows pnc to back out should unforeseen problems arise in may , regulators fined riggs national s subsidiary , riggs bank , 25 million for failing to comply adequately with antimoneylaundering practices regulators also issued a ceaseanddesist order that limited the bank s operational autonomy and forced it to comply with more onerous regulatory procedures except for simon p kareri , a former riggs executive who is the subject of a grand jury investigation , none of riggs s officers , managers or directors have faced regulatory penalties or legal action , and the bank has denied any wrongdoing the justice department is conducting a criminal investigation of activity in riggs s accounts what has been swept under the rug for years is criminal activity , said charles intriago , publisher of money laundering alert , a newsletter banking regulators have been asleep at the switch and i'm worried that the justice department is going to be their bunkmates a riggs sale had been opposed by joe l allbritton , the bank s former chief executive whose family owns a controlling block of riggs shares the allbrittons declined to respond to an interview request , but banking analysts and others said that the weight of scandal and the regulatory efficacy of a sale finally forced the family s hand the regulators did n't force the sale but they did n't discourage it either and in fact encouraged riggs to be realistic about their options , said the member of the regulatory community it s worth remembering that joe allbritton is somebody who was deadset against ever doing anything like this pnc said it would pay riggs investors 2425 a share , a modest premium to its closing price of 2267 on thursday riggs stock , which closed friday at 2272 , is trading at its highest since late 1998 analysts say the performance of the stock shows how long riggs was dragged down by inept management and heavy spending including operating a gulfstream jet that mr allbritton used frequently for personal travel before this year s scandal made the bank a takeover target riggs shareholders , after many years of suffering , have been somewhat rewarded given the current condition of the company , said gerard s cassidy , a banking analyst with rbc capital markets pnc is paying a rich price for riggs given the fractured nature of the bank s operation , but pnc s stock was down only slightly friday afternoon on heavy volume the shares closed today at 5056 , off about 13 percent
after hemming and hawing and bobbing and weaving , the board of directors of fannie mae finally jettisoned franklin d raines , the mortgage finance giant s former chief executive , and timothy howard , its former chief financial officer , last week they appear to have done so only under duress from fannie s chief regulator , the office of federal housing enterprise oversight , which in september put the company on notice that its improper accounting had vastly overstated profits and misrepresented its financial position the board s reluctance to defenestrate mr raines and mr howard , who appear to have misstated their company s financial statements to the tune of around 9 billion , fed suspicions that fannie mae s directors were loyal to management first , and shareholders second questions of allegiance were also raised when it became clear that fannie s directors allowed mr raines to retire rather than to be fired outright that distinction meant that he will reap millions of dollars in benefits and stock awards that he might otherwise have lost regulators are now investigating the compensation awarded to fannie s executives mr raines will receive an annual pension of more than 1 million under the terms of his exit with a new year approaching , it seems a perfect time for the fannie board to look hard and long at their own roles in the mess but because nobody ever takes responsibility for wrongdoing today especially not highpowered directors of public companies a rigorous selfanalysis from fannie s board is unlikely maybe we should do it for them here s the question just how independent are fannie mae s independent directors \? under its charter , it has 18 directors thirteen are elected annually by shareholders and five are appointed by the president two presidential appointees were on the audit committee at the end of 2003 , but they are no longer associated with company president bush has declined to appoint new directors to the board , leaving those seats vacant in any enormous accounting debacle , all eyes turn first to a company s audit committee the company considers all of them to be independent as of last year , they included thomas p gerrity , the chairman and a former dean of the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania frederic v malek , the chairman of thayer capital partners , a private equity firm anne m mulcahy , the chief executive of xerox and joe k pickett , the retired chief executive of homeside international , parent of a mortgage lending company the two presidential appointees on the committee at the time were taylor c segue iii , a lawyer in michigan at howard howard and william r harvey , president of hampton university in hampton , va fannie s audit committee is charged with overseeing the accounting , reporting and financial practices of fannie , including the integrity of its financial statements and its compliance with regulatory requirements hmmm sound like they sort of fell down on the job \? yes , indeed , said greg taxin , chief executive of glass lewis , an institutional advisory firm that advised fannie shareholders to vote against all audit committee members up for reelection at fannie mae last year the point of that committee is to protect shareholders from precisely what happened here , he said this audit committee needs to be replaced a fannie mae spokesman said that none of the company s directors were available to comment for this article mr segue did not return a phone call seeking comment and mr harvey could not be reached ms mulcahy left fannie s board last september , a few days before ofheo s devastating report was made public she joined the board of citigroup and said that she could not be a director at two financial services concerns simultaneously she can run , but because she became a director at fannie in 2000 she will not be able to hide from scrutiny of the board s actions during the years it was found to have cooked its books a spokesman for xerox did not return a request for comment from ms mulcahy while the audit committee members had an obligation to monitor fannie s accounting , they are not the only directors bearing responsibility for the debacle at the company the entire board should don a hair shirt take ann korologos she is fannie mae s presiding director and the person heading the special review committee of the board her tenure at fannie mae has been long , since 1994 the vice chairwoman of the rand corporation board of trustees and former secretary of labor under president ronald reagan , ms korologos must now oversee the investigation of fannie mae s accounting practices , governance and structure and executive compensation but ms korologos s other affiliations show links to fannie mae she is chairwoman emeritus of the aspen institute , a nonprofit group in washington that has received 280 , 000 in grants from the fannie mae foundation , a nonprofit arm that works for affordable housing , between 1996 and 2002 she was the institute s chairwoman for the first four of those years mr malek , another fannie audit committee member , joins ms korologos at aspen he is an active trustee there \( the aspen institute s original goal , according to its web site , was for american business leaders to lift their sights above the possessions which possess them , to confront their own nature as human beings , to regain control over their own humanity by becoming more selfaware , more selfcorrecting and hence more selffulfilling \) ms korologos has also been a visiting fellow at the urban institute , which has received 265 million in grants from the fannie mae foundation since 1990 , and she sits on the corporate council of the conservation fund , a nonprofit group that works to protect the nation s land and water resources the conservation fund has received 54 , 000 from the fannie mae foundation since 1995 another recipient of fannie mae foundation grants 125 , 000 since 1993 is the federal city council , a nonprofit organization based in washington that works to improve the city ms korologos was the council s president from 1990 to 1995 and h patrick swygert , the president of howard university and a fannie director since 2000 , also has ties to the federal city council fannie also considers mr swygert to be independent but fannie employed his son in its technology unit until late last spring and since 1989 , the fannie mae foundation has dispensed 35 grants to howard university , totaling 555 , 186 almost 400 , 000 of those grants went to the university during the years that mr swygert was sitting on fannie s board then there is mr malek , the private investor with close ties to fannie managers he is a partner with mr raines in the washington baseball club , which is bringing the montreal expos to the nation s capital a fannie spokesman said the company s criteria for independence were far stricter than those of the new york stock exchange since the company changed its guidelines in 2003 , donations to charities with which directors are affiliated do not exceed 100 , 000 a year he said the directors acted quickly and appropriately when its regulator , ofheo , made the findings of its investigation public after the securities and exchange commission said it had agreed with ofheo that fannie had misrepresented its financial position , the board chose to act more deliberately to make sure the decisions it made were the right ones , the spokesman said it is altogether possible that fannie mae s board has acted entirely properly and in the shareholders' interests at all times but the appearance of conflicts still resonates , especially in its lumbering approach to ousting mr raines and mr howard this board has all the classic hallmarks of a cozy , friendly board , mr taxin , the institutional investors' adviser , said everything from the personal and professional relationships that go back many years between all these people , to the charity and business relationships that exist after being accused of billiondollar misstatements and having received warnings from the regulator , this board really had to think quite hard whether the ceo and cfo had to be fired in this era , that should have been a fairly easy decision to make gretchen morgenson correction january 2 , 2005 , sunday the gretchen

five seasons in the nfl and no playoff victories in three attempts had made peyton manning an easy target for criticism , jokes and even ridicule he said that not only was there a monkey on my back , but that it was on there pretty tight so , sunday afternoon , in his sixth season and fourth playoff game , manning began to peel off that extra load , decision after decision , pass after pass , touchdown after touchdown in a sparkling serving of technique , talent , will and showmanship , manning became the first nfl player to throw five touchdown passes in three games in one season his fourth playoff appearance , this one against the denver broncos , produced an array of all that is special about manning the quarterback and distinctive about manning the competitor as indianapolis toyed with denver , 4110 , before 56 , 586 at the rca dome the colts \( 134 \) advance to face the chiefs \( 133 \) in a divisional playoff game next sunday in kansas city , mo denver \( 107 \) ended its season in shambles largely because it confronted a quarterback ready for retribution and a team prepared to deliver an awesome day i was just glad to have another playoff opportunity , that we were n't an 88 team and i was sitting at home , manning said the 03 thing in the playoffs was just a fact i did n't run and hide from it no , he ended it with a wondrous 22of26 , 377yard , 5touchdown game , and a perfect passer rating that was a great game plan and it was executed as well as i 've ever seen , broncos coach mike shanahan said we came into a hornet s nest once he gets a beat on you , he is hard to stop tom moore , the colts' offensive coordinator , said peyton took the challenge he made all the proper reads , did n't force anything he had the type of game where you look at it and say , 'how did this happen like this \? ' and the answer is , i do n't know perhaps colts cornerback david macklin , who made two interceptions of denver quarterback jake plummer , had the answer it s all or nothing in the playoffs , macklin said we got tired of the nothing edgerrin james outrushed denver s clinton portis , 78 yards to 68 yards manning made plummer \( 23 of 30 , 181 yards , one touchdown , 2 interceptions \) look average colts receiver marvin harrison grabbed 7 passes for 133 yards and 2 touchdowns while no bronco caught more than 5 passes or gained more than 66 receiving yards end dwight freeney and tackle montae reagor each gained a sack linebacker david thornton led in tackles with 10 , and denver did not score its touchdown until 7 minutes 4 seconds were left in the game the score was 313 by halftime and denver was alternately outplayed and embarrassed manning torched denver for four touchdown passes in the first half and set a franchise playoff record for touchdown passes in a game \( no colt , including johnny unitas , had thrown for more than two scores in a playoff game \) with 7 28 left in the half , manning had connected on 11 of his first 12 passes and was only 9 yards short of 200 it was really awesome to see from the sideline , colts coach tony dungy said i hope people think this was a big game because i 've heard about him not being able to win big games by halftime , manning s numbers were startling 16 of 18 for 327 yards with 4 touchdown passes and no interceptions and a highestpossible passer rating of 1583 that rating would last the entire game , and it was only the fourth one accomplished in a playoff game indianapolis was making its fourth playoff appearance in the last five seasons , and denver was playing in its second game here in three weeks on dec 21 , denver strutted in here and smothered indianapolis , 3117 and everyone around the league remembered that last season the colts played the jets in a firstround playoff game and were bullied , 410 but on sunday , indianapolis buried all doubt early denver looked like a team that had played a listless regularseason finale at green bay , where it lost , 313 , only to suffer a severe hangover it s our second year with coach dungy , our second year in his scheme , and he just told us to go do what we do , freeney said our offense pretty much opened the gates for us the colts' scoring spree began only 3 05 into the the game when manning found receiver brandon stokley running free deep across the field for a 31yard touchdown pass indianapolis set up the play with 3 passes for 28 yards to james as the denver defense crept forward to negate james , manning and stokley took advantage manning was 4 for 4 on his initial drive and plummer responded with a 5for5 first drive that resulted in a 49yard field goal by jason elam although denver stalled at the indianapolis 30 , the broncos felt good about getting points and letting the colts know that this game could easily become a backandforth scoring affair but those were the only points denver would score in the half and while the broncos stalled , the colts rolled indianapolis s second touchdown of the first quarter helped set the stage for denver s free fall in an embarrassing play for denver , harrison caught a thirdand8 pass on a post pattern for 16 yards , leaping and falling to the ground that play was special enough but then three broncos cornerback kelly herndon , safety kenoy kennedy and linebacker al wilson stood circling harrison in disgust over the completion none of them bothered to touch harrison while he was on the ground to ensure that the play was over so harrison got up and ran the final 30 yards into the end zone , untouched on the play from beginning to end that freaky 46yard touchdown catch with 24 seconds left in the first quarter gave indianapolis a 143 lead they just assumed the guy was down , shanahan said very embarrassing it was all downhill , full speed , for denver after that stokley burst behind the defense for an 87yard touchdown with 7 28 left before halftime with 55 seconds left , macklin intercepted a plummer pass and returned the ball 21 yards to the indianapolis 42yard line manning drove the colts closer and , as time expired in the first half , mike vanderjagt kicked a 27yard field goal , his 42nd straight , and the rout was in full bloom manning looked much like the most valuable player of the season , an award he shared last week with tennessee quarterback steve mcnair manning attacked the broncos fearlessly in the same manner the entire colts team did in a dominating half that led to a dominating victory i hope we convinced everyone and that peyton did , too , freeney said but if we did n't , that s all right we have another chance to now
throughout the eightweek murder trial of daniel pelosi , janet albertson s voice had been her weapon of choice ms albertson , the lead prosecutor on the case , laced her words with scorn and condescending disdain , made rapidfire arguments and ridiculed mr pelosi with wilting sarcasm but when she stood to give her closing arguments last week , ms albertson s tone was cool and deliberate she argued that mr pelosi , a 41yearold electrician from center moriches , had driven to east hampton on oct 21 , 2001 , and killed his lover s multimillionaire husband , the investment banker r theodore ammon , to plunder his 80 million fortune she spoke for two hours without notes her voice was soft the jurors were riveted this is not a whodunit , ms albertson , 42 , said this was not some man , not the gay man , and not the boogeyman it was that man and she pointed at mr pelosi three days later , mr pelosi was found guilty of seconddegree murder , and ms albertson won one of long island s mostwatched murder cases in years the victory in a largely circumstantial case vindicated ms albertson , a tough , smart police officer s daughter , raising her profile in legal circles across the region , said lawyers who followed the case i think the sky s the limit with her , said william keahon , a long island defense lawyer she could be a great judge if she wanted to run for da herself , she 'd be a great candidate but ms albertson , the deputy chief of the suffolk district attorney s homicide bureau , said she has no plans to go anywhere but for a threeweek vacation the victory was also a boost for the district attorney , thomas j spota , whose deputies are in a courtroom just a few doors away arguing against seemingly powerful evidence that martin tankleff was rightly convicted of murdering his mother and father in their belle terre home in 1988 from the grand jury to the verdict , mr pelosi s murder case was more of a pressurecooker than any ms albertson had ever prosecuted , coworkers said , consuming the last two years of her life during the trial , she ran a daily gantlet of reporters and tv cameras she stayed up at night thinking about the case her weight dropped to 94 pounds when mr pelosi was accused of threatening her and her children \( her husband , a lawyer , was apparently not threatened \) , the police guarded her house and installed a panic button you have no idea how hard it was at times , she said the case twisted and turned through stories of betrayal , adultery , gambling and greed , but at its heart was an uneducated social climber accused of murder mr pelosi stumbled onto otherworldly wealth when he met mr ammon s estranged wife , generosa , while renovating her upper east side town house the two began an affair around thanksgiving of 2000 , while the ammons were locked in a rancorous divorce mr pelosi gorged himself on the ammons' money , spending thousands on gambling , luxuriating in their east hampton home and funneling thousands to his family in suffolk county mr pelosi was charged with murder two years after mr ammon s death at the time , other lawyers said ms albertson s case looked weak because she had no eyewitnesses , damning physical evidence or confessions mr pelosi made to the police this was probably the toughest case any homicide prosecutor in the county ever had to prosecute , mr keahon said in the threering media circus of the trial , ms albertson , who is about 5foot2 , sometimes seemed engulfed by the television cameras , reporters , lawyers and courtroom spectators thronging around her she lugged armloads of files back and forth from the courtroom and rolled her eyes at reporters' questions , paced and gobbled chocolate during recesses she pored over boxes of testimony and evidence she knew the story of the pelosi and ammon families as if they were close relatives she showed she had mastered the sound bite when she said that mr pelosi was presumed innocent , not intelligent in her fifthfloor office in the county court building in riverhead , ms albertson vented to anyone who would listen , said emily constant , the chief of investigations fresh out of st john s university law school , ms albertson joined the suffolk district attorney s office in 1987 she started off prosecuting misdemeanors and traffic violations but was promoted to major cases after less than two years i wanted to come out to suffolk because this is where i was born and raised , she said i'm comfortable out here she has been prosecuting homicides since 1994 , and the district attorney s office says she has not lost a single murder trial she has a reputation for being fair , honest and accommodating with defense lawyers in conferences , and acidic and tenacious in open court she wears a tiny religious medallion around her neck , and her attitude on her sleeve she s feisty as all hell , said matthew rosenblum , a defense lawyer who has faced her on several cases you really ca n't shake her and in april 2002 , she was assigned to the murder of mr ammon john collins , the district attorney s homicide bureau chief , said ms albertson was handpicked to take on the case i was n't lobbying for this baby , ms albertson said potential defendants and mr pelosi s family had insulated themselves with lawyers and were not talking , so a grand jury was impaneled to investigate the killing acting on the grand jury s indictment , the police arrested mr pelosi last march the trial shaped up as a battle of two bright lawyers ms albertson and mr pelosi s lead lawyer , gerald shargel , who has represented many organized crime figures and was dubbed one of the most brilliant criminaldefense attorneys in america in a 1994 profile in the new yorker in an interview with newsday before the pelosi trial , mr shargel called ms albertson not the best lawyer he had faced , but not the worst i think he clearly underestimated me , ms albertson said he probably assumed that being out from suffolk county and being a young female prosecutor , that i did n't have the experience and courtroom skill some critics said she was too caustic and too snide in the pelosi trial and warned that she would rankle the jury one snippy exchange caught the attention of justice robert w doyle , who called ms albertson to the bench and said he had had enough of her behavior now sit down ! he growled none of that mattered in the end as ms albertson called witness after witness , lawyers following the trial began to marvel at how she was wringing the reasonable doubt from mr pelosi s case a former lover , tracey riebenfeld , testified that mr pelosi told her he had beaten mr ammon to death while he cried and begged for his life mr pelosi s father testified that mr pelosi had asked him how to hide something so no one could ever find it ms ammon s nanny testified that mr pelosi confessed to the murder ms albertson punctured a defense argument that a gay lover could have killed mr ammon the defense had said a mysterious pubic hair had been found on mr ammon s shoulder , but ms albertson called an investigator , who testified that the hair was actually growing from mr ammon s shoulder her most important witness was mr pelosi himself , who bucked his lawyers' advice and decided to testify in his own defense the interesting thing about him is that he personalizes most of his relationships , including his feelings about me , ms albertson said he really thinks he s the smartest boy in the courtroom , and he wants to show everybody he was going to show everybody that he was way smarter than me ms albertson crossexamined him in a deadpan , jumped from topic to topic and drew contradictory and vague answers from mr pelosi when mr pelosi joked that he had enjoyed zapping his coworkers with a stun gun , ms albertson pounced that s what you did to ted ammon \? she asked i did n't do nothing to mr ammon , mr pelosi said did you enjoy beating ted ammon \? mr pelosi paused and said , where are you going \? mr pelosi insisted that he and a friend had been buying beer at a gas station the night of the murder , and had gone nowhere near east hampton ms albertson never pierced his denials , but jurors said that mr pelosi s testimony seemed hollow the faceoff between prosecutor and defendant was personal for both mr pelosi , fuming at ms albertson s insults and digs , had glowered at her and called her trailer park trash prosecutors said that while in jail , mr pelosi talked about threatening ms albertson and her two children lawyers who followed the case disagree about whether it was ms albertson s skill or mr pelosi s arrogance that produced the guilty verdict jurors said it was a little of both rosemarie brady , a juror , said she marveled at ms albertson s closing argument another juror , patricia campbell , was impressed by ms albertson s force and her demeanor we really listened to her , ms campbell said little by little , some of us on said , 'did you hear what she said \? ' she made us remember things that we had not remembered to look at ms albertson will next prosecute chris parrino , a friend of mr pelosi s , on charges that he helped destroy evidence of the ammon killing now , she said she is recovering from weeks of eating doughnuts and chocolate at her desk and of being recognized by strangers she said that a few weeks after every trial the details of the case begin to recede from her thoughts , but for now , they are still ricocheting around in her mind i relive it in my head all the time , she said

and systems nothing helps the new alpine architecture like the grandeur of the old alpine landscape , but this show confirms the point so often lost on american builders that elegance , sustainability

more than three years after the world trade center was destroyed , city health officials released data yesterday from a twoyear study showing that thousands of people in the vicinity of the towers on sept 11 , 2001 , said they had increased respiratory problems and suffered higher rates of emotional distress the findings are the result of interviews with 61 , 087 people who could have been directly affected by the terrorist attack , all of whom volunteered to be part of the world trade center health registry we now know that tens of thousands of registry enrollees reported significant respiratory and mental health symptoms , said dr thomas r frieden , commissioner of the city department of health and mental hygiene dr frieden said the registry , the largest of its kind ever attempted in the united states , would eventually help to assess the attack s longterm effect on health and could facilitate treatment in the areas where it is most needed health officials do not know whether registry members continue to suffer from the respiratory symptoms they described because they were asked only about their experiences around the time of the attack therefore , there is still no solid understanding of the severity of the problems many people face dr frieden said that each of the registry members would continue to be monitored over the next two decades , during which time health officials hope to interview them periodically and to be able to use new information to identify trends and patterns of illness none of the registry members received medical examinations as part of the survey , and there is no federal treatment program currently available for those who may be ill in fact , financing for treatment , as well as the federal government s initial reaction to possible air quality problems around ground zero , have been heatedly debated since the environmental protection agency announced soon after the attack that it was safe to return to the area since that time , there has been a growing consensus that many people may have grown ill because of a toxic mix of dust , debris , smoke and chemicals that was released into the air however , there is still no definitive knowledge of what was in the dust , how long it posed a risk and how many people were sickened fire commissioner nicholas scoppetta , who joined dr frieden and other officials at a news conference yesterday , said firefighters were among the first to experience respiratory problems , but many have gotten better with time , he noted dr frieden , who joined the health department in 2002 , presented no conclusions about the response of the federal government in the immediate aftermath of the attack , saying the full effect of the air quality would take years to study however , he did say that more financing was needed to maintain the registry and to provide treatment the registry alone costs more than 1 million a year to maintain a study by the government accountability office said anywhere from 250 , 000 to 400 , 000 people could have been affected by the dust and debris while new yorkers make up the largest portion of those surveyed , 47 , 230 people in the registry are from outside the state , and represent all 50 states plus puerto rico and nine foreign countries in order to qualify for the registry , a person had to meet one of the following criteria on 9 11 living south of canal street being inside one of the towers or on the subway south of chambers street being involved in rescue or cleanup or being an enrollee or staff member at a school or day care center south of canal street nearly half of those interviewed , 42 percent , said they had experienced problems with shortness of breath even more people , 47 percent , said they had sinus problems other common respiratory complaints included wheezing , 38 percent a persistent cough , 37 percent and throat irritation , 38 percent another area of focus was on mental health 8 percent of registry members reported symptoms of psychological distress , 60 percent higher than the city average of 5 percent dr frieden said he was aware of the widespread skepticism about government announcements having anything to do with air quality at ground zero , which was part of the reason they were making the data public we are committed to transparency , he said correction november 24 , 2004 , wednesday because of an editing error , an article yesterday about a study of health problems among people near the world trade center on sept 11 , 2001 , referred incorrectly in some copies to the home regions of the people surveyed of the 61 , 087 , a total of 47 , 230 were new york state residents , not from out of state the others were from the other 49 states , puerto rico and nine foreign countries

detroit s big rebates and interestfree financing deals have strengthened car sales for the last three years but they have also eroded the resale value of many american automotive brands , and that could cost consumers thousands of dollars when they trade in their vehicles none of the traditional american brands are among the 10 vehicles expected to retain the most value over the next halfdecade , according to a new report from kelley blue book , a company that tracks used car values but american brands dominate the other end of the spectrum , the vehicles expected to lose the most value car prices were going up through the end of the 80 s and into the mid90 s , but what s happened is , with all these rebates and incentives in the last couple years , newvehicle prices have stabilized and actually gone down in relation to inflation , said charlie vogelheim , executive editor at kelley blue book cheap new cars lead to cheaper used cars that applies especially to new models with heavy incentives , which can reinforce stereotypes of certain brands being cutrate other factors also tend to lower resale values , as when certain brands are sold into rental car fleets or have unusual designs that do not stand the test of time vehicles from five japanese and five european brands were expected to retain the most value , including lexus gx 470 , made by toyota , and the bmw 5 series sedan , according to the kelley report these vehicles are forecast to hold about half of their initial value after five years but vehicles like the chevrolet aveo , made by general motors , and the mercury sable from the ford motor company were among the worst they were forecast to hold about 20 percent of their value not all of the top vehicles are expensive luxury cars included among the top 10 are bmw s mini cooper , which starts at about 20 , 000 , and nissan s 350z , which starts below 27 , 000 and one relatively inexpensive and highvolume luxury vehicle , ford s jaguar xtype , was among those expected to hold the least value this year , sales of the xtype , which starts at about 30 , 000 , are down 11 percent through july despite heavy incentive offers the xtype can also be rented through ford s hertz division there was a silver lining for ford among foreign models that placed in the top 10 , two were brands controlled by ford the mazda rx8 and the volvo xc90 differences in resale values can add up for instance , a fourwheeldrive 2005 ford explorer limited selling for 40 , 480 is projected to lose 64 percent of its value in four years , meaning that it would fall to 14 , 525 , according to the automotive lease guide , another company that tracks used car values by comparison , a 2005 toyota 4runner limited with fourwheel drive , selling for 38 , 500 , is expected to retain 47 percent of its value and resell for about 20 , 000 while domestic automakers have recently made gains in some quality rankings , it takes years for auto brands to win consumers' respect , and that respect is reflected in resale values what really plays into it , more than actual quality , is perceived quality , said matthew walker , manager of business development for the automotive lease guide you still see large differences in how customers perceive quality from one brand to the next george pipas , ford s top sales analyst , said we absolutely recognize the issue , the concern and the problem ford , he added , has been reducing its sales to the rental car market and scaling back its capacity by closing a few plants it also plans to limit production of new models the process of improving residuals ca n't be done overnight , mr pipas said it relates to image you can make quality improvements but that does n't mean the perception is going to change there are usually lags the options that buyers choose make a difference , too bland colors are best , preferably white , black or silver purple is bad , kelley reports customized paint jobs are worse the broadest market appeal is going to support the highest value in the end , mr vogelheim said among the choices that help improve resale values are opting for larger engines , leather seats and power windows and door locks if the option is available , a third row of seats can also help , kelley said your core functional stuff moon roof , leather , power seats certain items like that hold resale value better , mr walker said technology might not be as good on a luxury car , you might get a 400 return on a navigation system that cost you , say , 2 , 000 your used car buyer is looking for value and not every frill out there , typically

ambition and humanity an accompanying display , indexing the world , is a gem , providing a brisk , buoyantly eccentric overview of the dubious role of photography in the quest to index the world it is often remarked that sander photographed one era turning into another , weimar germany into nazi germany , which is true his work , despite its scientific pretense , is suffused with the unconscious melancholy of a world he could see was already fading another way to describe him is to say that his project was deeply reactionary and revolutionary , and this tension became the central ,

al qaeda operatives updated surveillance conducted at five financial institutions in new york , new jersey and washington as recently as this spring , according to a senior white house official who said on thursday that the authorities still had no direct evidence of an active terror plot until thursday , officials had said that the surveillance , which was carried out primarily in 2000 and 2001 , had been updated no later than january but additional analysis of computer records seized in pakistan showed that they were updated in the spring , the white house official said the discovery of the surveillance operations led to a terrorism alert on aug 1 because , the authorities said , they thought the information might be connected to separate intelligence indicating that al qaeda hoped to launch a major strike in the united states this year to disrupt the fall elections new intelligence from that channel said there was a greater risk of attack this month and next the period covering the republican national convention and the first phase of the fall campaign than in october or november , the official said the evidence that surveillance reports on the financial institutions were updated is based on forensic examinations of computer materials seized last month in pakistan after the arrest of mohammed naeem noor khan , the official said , adding that none of the information indicated that al qaeda had abandoned plans to attack the financial centers the official offered a few additional details about the threat information , saying that intelligence suggested attacks were possible in new york and other cities like washington and los angeles the threat has been building , the official said we know they are building toward an attack in the united states and that information becomes increasingly refined it is still unclear exactly how the computer files were updated , although officials have said that dates on the computer records show when the files were opened by a user i have not seen evidence of an imminent operation , said the official , who has reviewed classified information and analytical reports about terrorist threats to the united states the official added , i have no indication that this was a plan they set aside the official would not discuss specifics about who was suspected of carrying out the highly detailed surveillance activities , citing the risk of compromising intelligence operations and possible prosecutions in britain it is still not clear , the official said , whether the reconnaissance was carried out by one person gathering data over a long period of time or was the work of several people operating as a team last week , 11 men were arrested by british authorities , including issa alhindi , who is believed by american intelligence officials to have directed the surveillance operations at the five financial institutions mr alhindi was found through email messages and other information found in mr khan s computers security officials in britain have complained to american officials about the disclosure of information about the arrests of mr alhindi and others , suggesting that leaks could jeopardize criminal cases that are expected to be filed soon the united states official said that the arrests in pakistan and britain represented a strategic penetration of al qaeda , saying that mr khan represented an important operational node in the operational chain of the terror network officials say that mr khan , while not highranking himself , has given them a new picture of the inner workings of al qaeda as it regenerates itself in pakistan and the region the disclosure of mr khan s arrest has stirred controversy in pakistan and britain , where officials said that american pressure to apprehend the communications expert had put his confederates on notice that he had been captured and may have compromised efforts to locate additional qaeda operatives in response , the white house official said that it appeared mr khan s name had been first disclosed by officials overseas , not in the united states in any event , the official said , the arrest of suspected terrorists , even when unannounced , is often quickly detected by their families and associates american officials have denied news accounts that mr khan was working as a mole , or an informant for pakistan , when he was arrested in another development , the government s troubled case against three men who were convicted last year in detroit on terrorism charges suffered another blow when a witness said that a video tape shown to the jury as a possible terrorist surveillance video contained only sightseeing pictures taken on a student trip the witness , a tunisian man who is pictured in the videotape of landmarks in new york , las vegas and california , was arrested in january on immigration charges the witness s statement , which was first reported by the associated press , has been turned over to defense lawyers by the justice department after the verdict last year , the justice department said that prosecutors had broken up a significant terror group three of four men on trial were convicted karim koubriti , 25 abdelilah elmardoudi , 38 , were convicted on terrorism and fraud charges , and ahmed hannan , 36 , was convicted of fraud the convictions have seemed to be threatened for months after justice department officials disclosed the existence of documents that prosecutors failed to turn over to defense lawyers and that might have helped the defendants' cases the justice department is reviewing the prosecutor s conduct in the case
when mariano rivera fails in october , you know it is fright night , an early halloween , at yankee stadium when a twins gametying rally in the eighth inning begins with a batter reaching first base on a thirdstrike wild pitch , you know that george steinbrenner is ready to pitch a fit when the familiar playoff formula of pitching and long balls falls apart , when the yankees are two outs from facing a pair of elimination games on the road , and when kevin brown has been tabbed to start the first one , you know why yankee fans were feeling so much stress late last night , they needed to punch something to relieve it in the interests of avoiding unnecessary pain that brown can certainly attest to , alex rodriguez finally punched in as a yankee worth his pinstripes with a solo home run and a runscoring single in the books , rodriguez launched a gametying double to left field in the 12th inning last night off minnesota closer joe nathan , setting up the winning run in a 76 yankees victory that probably saved their season it was a war out there , rodriguez said after earning his first purple heart it was rodriguez s pal derek jeter who scored the winning run , on hideki matsui s sacrifice fly to right in a game that jeter led off for the yankees with a long home run to center , there was the feel of classic yankee postseason symmetry , from the crisis of a onegame deficit in their bestoffive division series to the avoidance of a certified catastrophe about three or four times during the game , i said , 'what am i doing this for \? ' yankees manager joe torre said without a meaningful october inning to his major league credit , jon lieber was entrusted by torre with replacing a man who not long ago was called irreplaceable six and twothirds innings and 78 pitches later , lieber was given a standing ovation for starring in the role of andy pettitte , who had pitched in nine straight division series game 2 s for the yankees , eight for torre sometimes choices are made because the manager has no choice considering the fragile state of the yankees' rotation , torre s only option was to convince himself that lieber possessed pettitte s blessed fortitude and guess what when lieber gave way to tom gordon with two outs in the seventh , with a string of four and twothirds scoreless innings after a shaky start , that s exactly what he had showed he would have had his first postseason victory , 12 short of pettitte , the career coleader , had gordon not bounced a third strike to jacque jones and had rivera not come on to surrender two runs charged to gordon by the 12th inning , with rivera still glumly contemplating his vulnerability in the dugout , torii hunter homered to left off tanyon sturtze , and the stadium was so quiet you could almost hear steinbrenner having a good scream consider the start to the boss s postseason the red sox mauled the angels in game 1 of their division series roger clemens climbed out of a sickbed to pitch the astros to a 93 victory yesterday in atlanta but just when you were thinking that this could be the last night of the torre dynasty , rodriguez stepped up with two runners on , one out in the 12th , and erased a season of too many failures in the clutch one latenight october swing and all was forgiven , at least until tomorrow i think it s important to win games , rodriguez said , looking like the big city slicker in his gq suit and sounding like the ordained yankee sophisticate what i do is a secondary story as long as his 250 million salary is second to none , that will never be the case and from steinbrenner s point of view , merely tying the division series will not be enough now the yankees , the most expensive team in baseball history , take to the road in the same predicament they were in last season , when they confidently sent clemens and david wells to the mound in the metrodome and the result was a combined two runs allowed in 14 2 3 innings consider torre s options for games 3 and 4 , brown and most likely javier vazquez , and you can understand why last night s rally may yet be remembered as no more than a reprieve twins manager ron gardenhire affirmed yesterday that johan santana , who shut the yankees down in game 1 , would pitch game 4 on saturday as long as his arm responds to three days' rest in that case , the burden falls on brown to keep the yankees from having to face baseball s hottest pitcher in a potential elimination game , on the dome turf that enhances the twins' speed game but the ride to minneapolis was at least made much shorter by rodriguez , after twins closer nathan walked miguel cairo and jeter even when we fell behind in the 12th , we felt there was a window of opportunity with nathan going out for a third inning , rodriguez said all season long , he has waited for this moment , as much as the city has waited on him silly him silly us everyone should have known that on this team , in this town , such memories can be made only in october
gary barnett , the suspended university of colorado football coach , told an investigative panel on tuesday that he believed there was inappropriate behavior at a 2001 party attended by football players and recruits , during which two women said they were raped but barnett said that all those at the party shared the blame in 2001 , 10 young people , 4 of whom were my students , made poor decisions , said barnett , speaking for the first time before the panel there is no question in my mind that inappropriate behavior occurred there is also no question in my mind that the behavior of the 10 young people involved was the result of their own poor decisions under the influence of alcohol four colorado football players and two recruits attended the offcampus party two women have come forward to say they were raped at the party a third has said she was raped afterward at a dormitory the three are suing the university in federal court in all , at least eight women since 1997 have come forward with rape allegations against colorado football players barnett is on paid suspension after making comments about the placekicking skills of the former colorado player katie hnida while discussing her charge that she was raped by a teammate in 2000 the university s president , elizabeth hoffman , reprimanded barnett for the comments while placing him on leave she said she was equally troubled by a police report in which an unidentified woman accused another colorado player of rape and said barnett had told her he would side with the player 100 percent if she pressed charges barnett appeared before the panel for about five hours the commission was established by the university in february to determine if sex , alcohol and drugs were being used to lure recruits to the university the panel voted to request more time to finish its work , meaning a report would not come out until late may the state attorney general is conducting a separate investigation into recruiting improprieties at colorado on tuesday , addressing hnida s charge , barnett said he had spoken to hnida s friends , former teammates and a rape counselor and that none had heard hnida talk about harassment or an assault i could n't find anybody to substantiate one single claim , and i was looking to substantiate it , barnett said he also said it did not matter to him that hnida lacked kicking talent , because he wanted to give her a chance i felt it was time for college football to have more diversity , he said this was a chance to have her on our team , and it did n't make any difference to me how bad she was barnett said that he has repeatedly and publicly asked hnida , who has not filed charges , to give him the names of those who she said had harassed and assaulted her on monday , a letter from dave hnida , katie hnida s father , to a lawyer for the commission was made public hnida , a military doctor serving in iraq , wrote we both have been distressed at the information we read coming from the university , as well as gary barnett to be blunt , there is quite a bit of lying and deception right now once again , i am stunned to read how they now say they had no knowledge of problems with katie and the team referring to barnett , hnida wrote , he is quite aware of those who sexually harassed katie verbally and physically barnett told the panel that as head coach of the colorado team , he had tried to implement higher standards than those at other programs barnett noted that while 18yearolds had legally entered a strip club , and it was not against university policy , such activity violates barnett s team rules he said he had penalized players for taking recruits to such places the accusation that we use alcohol and sex as recruiting tools speaks to an environment that is a winatallcosts environment , he said this is simply not true at the university of colorado
the chinese government on monday continued its aggressive efforts to stamp out a new sars outbreak by increasing the number of people under quarantine to nearly 500 and dispatching special medical teams to review government laboratories that work with the deadly virus the government continued increasing health screenings at airports and train stations and is rushing to prevent wider spread of the disease before millions of people begin traveling for the may day holiday celebration last year , the government interrupted the holiday because of fears of sars severe acute respiratory syndrome this year s outbreak is much more limited , and seemingly has been contained on monday , the chinese ministry of health announced no new suspected or confirmed cases of the virus , while provincial health officials said an emergency review of hospitals across the country had found no increase in the number of new pneumonialike cases the world health organization has urged vigilance but has said the current outbreak does not represent a significant public health threat yet the outbreak does appear to have exposed more failings in the chinese health care system and has prompted government officials to invite the who to help investigate what went wrong two confirmed and six suspected sars cases have been identified , each traceable to the government s main virology institute in beijing , where sars research is conducted the essential figure appears to be a 26yearold graduate student who worked in the laboratory in march the student , surnamed song , became ill after returning to her home province , anhui yet weeks passed before she was given a diagnosis of sars she went to at least three hospitals and was allowed to travel on at least three trains ms song was often cared for by her mother , who became sick with symptoms compatible with sars and died last monday there appear to have been serious errors along the way , said robert dietz , a spokesman for the who office in beijing he said an international medical team would arrive in beijing this week to join health ministry officials in examining crucial questions about the latest outbreak , including how ms song became infected and why she was allowed to travel the government is trying to find anyone who might have come into contact with ms song when she was traveling by train still , despite ms song s travels , it appears that the disease has not spread beyond the people who had close contact with her , with a nurse who cared for her or with the laboratory the beijing municipal government quarantined roughly 270 employees of the government virology lab , though none have yet exhibited any sars symptoms the primary focus of the investigation will be the institute of virology at china s centers for disease control , where ms song worked besides her , another medical graduate student , surnamed yang , is now suspected of having sars on monday , the englishlanguage china daily , citing a health ministry spokesman , reported that neither ms song nor mr yang were doing research that required direct contact with the sars virus the official new china news agency published an interview with the director of the hospital now treating ms song zhu qixing , president of anhui medical university , said that her symptoms differed in several ways from those exhibited by sars patients last year and that those factors delayed the correct diagnosis
when asked how she came to write mysteries , p d james has a ready answer as a child she wondered about humpty dumpty did he fall or was he pushed \? in ms james s novels about cmdr adam dalgliesh , death is never well , hardly ever accidental in the case of the first character to die in her new book , the murder room , there is no question that someone torched a car with the driver at the wheel and dalgliesh , the poetdetective , is alert to every hint of a clue a master of police procedure , he painstakingly reconstructs the crime and identifies the culprit , but not until a full house of suspects have been subjected to his genteel but inquisitorial gaze as for ms james baroness james of holland park at 83 , with her gray hair and her natural politesse , she may seem like a comforting grandmother , or in her case a greatgrandmother , but she has lost none of her zest for writing intricate detective stories and for contemplating the act of murder i suppose that it is the one act for which we can never make reparation , taking away something we did n't give and can never replace , she said during a recent visit to new york and yet an awful lot of murderers according to john mortimer , who defended them are just ordinary people who get into a certain situation and murder seems the way out then she posed a question do you know the age group which is 13 times more likely to be murdered than any other \? under the age of 1 infants my age group is the least likely to be victims in her new book , her 18th , there is a murder room in the small dupayne family museum on hampstead heath in london in it is a gallery of famous british crimes , some of which will be reenacted in the present , as the dupaynes battle for control of the museum those historical crimes are borrowed from the author s own library , a kind of murder room in her london home she especially savors those that are edwardian or victorian in flavor , for the outward formality , the seething emotions underneath her stories , however , are contemporary , in this instance including a private sex club her novels always begin with a place i 've done the church , a publishing house , a forensic science laboratory , but i had n't done a museum still on her short list is the house of lords i 'd love to do the house of lords , she said , but there are problems for one nobody dies in the palace of westminster you 're shoved into an ambulance and you die on the way to the hospital for each novel she does voluminous research with the murder room , she visited many museums as well as the forensics science laboratory in london \( when she worked at the british home office , she was in the forensic and criminal justice department for a time \) i never start until the whole of the story is very clear in my mind , and indeed down in the notebooks , she said i know the suspects i know what their motives are despite the careful preparation , i never get exactly the book i thought i was writing her books are more about character than place this time her cast includes the three very diverse dupayne siblings and their employees , starting with tally clutton , who is a kind of museum housekeeper for ms james , tally is a pivotal character , a woman of sound common sense and morality , rather a touchstone for other people s more dubious moralities ms james is primarily a storyteller , but there is a streak of social consciousness in her mysteries the new book , she said , touches not only on the violence in our schools but also the inadequacies in our mental health services her keen sense of reality is one of her basic differences from mystery writers of another era , beginning with the writer she refers to as dear old agatha in nevernever land the methods in agatha christie and even dorothy sayers novels could n't possibly work in real life , mrs james said you do n't expect the plots to be logical it s an ingenious puzzle of course , today s detectives , like dalgliesh , are helped by modern forensics and dna she admitted that she did not often read other mystery writers \( except her friend ruth rendell , with whom she often shares public platforms \) and preferred to spend her time with jane austen but she likes the novels of ian rankin and his harddrinking detective , rebus , who has very little in common with dalgliesh , except that each has a sharp eye for detail and for uncovering the unexpected the main reason for writing detective fiction , she said , is to bring order out of chaos , and secondarily to bring justice out of injustice it s not real justice , she said at least you solve the problem i think that s the virtue of the modern detective story , if it s well written with dear old agatha , the peace of that mythical little village is totally restored once the murder is solved but with my novels , everybody who comes in touch with that very contaminating crime is changed you do n't get things back to what they were one distinction of the murder room is that dalgliesh , a melancholic widower , becomes romantically involved with emma lavenham , a lecturer at cambridge university at the end of the book , he sends her a love letter proposing marriage up to then , she said , with dalgliesh there has been a holding back of being committed to another human being she cited something c p snow said in one of his novels there is great dignity in being an observer of life but if you do it long enough you lose yourself will adam and emma marry in the next book \? perhaps , but she said at least they are going to start living together insofar as people can live together when one is in london and one is in cambridge she said she also planned to give kate miskin , dalgliesh s earnest assistant , a love life as for dalgliesh , she will continue writing about him as long as i have something to say and can find the words to say it , unlike colin dexter , who killed off his detective , morse dalgliesh , she said , can go when i go we 'll go together
the boston manager took pedro mart nez out of a playoff game against the yankees last night , but once again it was too late mart nez had already passed his magic number of 100 , and it cost him and the red sox grady little s decision to let mart nez pitch the eighth inning of game 7 last year in the american league championship series cost the red sox a trip to the world series and the manager his job terry francona is expected to manage the red sox in game 3 of this year s league series tomorrow night even though his decision to leave mart nez in last night beyond 100 pitches proved costly once again there is nothing automatic about 100 pitches , but baseball people have determined in recent years that pitchers often tire once they go past that number and the veteran mart nez is a case in point in last year s game 7 , little left mart nez in the game long enough to throw 123 pitches , and the yankees rallied for three runs against him in the eighth inning for a 55 tie in boston last month , it was d j vu all over again francona let mart nez start the eighth inning against the yankees even though he had thrown 101 pitches , and on the second pitch of the inning , the 103rd of the game for mart nez , hideki matsui slugged a gametying home run with mart nez still in the game , bernie williams doubled and scored on ruben sierra s single then came last night mart nez had allowed only one run in a 10 game , but he went past pitch no 100 during a oneout walk to jorge posada in the sixth inning francona did n't blink he left mart nez in the game , and on pitch 106 , john olerud walloped a home run into the rightfield stands the home run was the difference in the 31 victory that gave the yankees a twogamestonone lead in the bestofsevengame series the yankees have now beaten boston s best two pitchers , curt schilling and mart nez , behind outstanding pitching performances by mike mussina and jon lieber no , i did not feel tired , mart nez said it was a fastball , but i wanted it away i did n't release it well and he took full advantage of it jason varitek , the red sox catcher , backed mart nez s claim that he was n't tired he pitched well enough to win , varitek said we did n't do the job on the other side mart nez said he hit my pitch limit , although he declined to say what that limit was but he did say he expected to make his second start of the series if it goes that far on short rest because of the uncertainty surrounding schilling and his ailing ankle schilling may miss the rest of the series when the seventh inning began , mart nez was no longer on the mound mike timlin , alan embree and keith foulke finished the game out of the bullpen while mart nez was in the game , thousands of yankee stadium fans serenaded him with a singsong who s your daddy \? it was a reference to his bizarre statement after a september game in boston that the yankees were his daddy it actually made me feel really , really good , mart nez said i actually realize that i was somebody important because i caught the attention of 60 , 000 people today i was the center of attention of all of new york , he added i do n't like to brag about myself , but they did make me feel important timlin and embree followed mart nez in the game , just as they did a year ago in that fateful game 7 in each instance , they were brought in too late , although the situation last night was nowhere nearly as extreme as last year , when the red sox were only five outs from the world series in game 1 on tuesday night , francona used six relief pitchers , but derek lowe was not one of them even though francona does not plan to use lowe as a starter unless schilling cannot start again i was live last night , and they held me out , lowe said , clearly confused over his role i 've always been under the impression that when the fifth guy is sent to the bullpen and the starter has trouble , that s when he comes in to take pressure off and take innings from the other guys lowe was a disappointment as a starter this season even though he won 14 games still , lowe , a 31yearold righthander , was n't sure about why francona dropped him from the postseason rotation i have no idea , lowe said i try to make sense of it myself i 'll be the first to tell you my last three games stunk but i'm proud of what i 've done over the last four years i think i 've done some good things and won games and pitched in allstar games and to get relegated to this role is kind of frustrating because you feel like you can help out and contribute , but you 're not given an opportunity to do so you feel like you 've contributed nothing on the yankees' side , mariano rivera gained his second save in two games , securing the final four outs as he did in game 1 , he replaced tom gordon , who was not particularly effective gordon gave up a tworun triple to david ortiz on tuesday night and a double and a runscoring groundout last night the pitch count got to mart nez rivera rescued the yankees some scripts never change
to step into the narrow cavern that is the ckl hardware company on canal street is to be transported back to an era when stores in the city were neighborhood institutions , a peculiar nexus of an owner s passions and a client s needs here , patrons have long since worn through the linoleum to the ancient floorboards underneath as they scoured the cluttered shelves for oddsize wrenches or the right grade of sandpaper clients ignored the halfinch of dust that had collected on products like black swan staysoft plumber s putty for a chance to lazily poke through scores of small tin bins , each containing a different collection of screws regulars knew they could stay for hours , buy one fiveinch carriage bolt for 149 and still be warmly treated by a staff that loved tinkering as much as they a decade ago , there were seven such specialized hardware stores within a block and a half of the store , at canal and mercer streets , but when ckl , the oldest and bestknown of the bunch , closes its doors today there will be none , according to ron katz , a coowner home improvement goliaths like home depot had been chipping away at his profits for a decade , mr katz said , and in the end , ckl became one of the last casualties of manhattan s fastvanishing industrial base when ckl was started by mr katz s father , robert , and two partners in 1952 c , k and l are the last initials of the founders it was a surplus operation that bought odd lots of merchandise at auction and resold it at bargain prices , like almost all of its neighbors along the chokedup thoroughfare in those days , mr katz recalls , the store was much more eclectic than it is today you might see fur coats and screwdrivers right next to each other , he said mr katz , who took over the business when his father retired in 1980 and now coowns it with jeff diamond , his brother s brotherinlaw , said we used to have guys who would come in every day just to see what we had we had maybe a hundred customers like that that would come in every day but many of those guys worked as technicians over at the att building before it closed , or in another industrial job , before they vanished from lower manhattan many were also the artists and gallery owners who reclaimed the lofts in soho , coming in for spackle to patch up walls and wires to hang paintings on many of those men left , too , as soho gentrified into a luxury shopping district one by one , the electronics wholesalers and oddparts stores that served gritty tinkerers went out of business then , about two years ago , the wooden stalls and pushcarts that carry knockoff louis vuitton and gucci bags blossomed up and down the street the lure of cheap purses now draws throngs of tourists , who clog the street and are n't much interested in buying an extra trisonic soldering gun or selfsticking velour pads , mr katz said no offense it used to be 90 percent men walking down canal street , he said now it is women and tourists so when a wirelessphone vendor coldcalled mr katz and proposed leasing the store and remodeling it for a very lucrative amount , it did n't take long for the two partners to agree yesterday , as longterm customers were told the end was nigh , many reacted with shock and despair well , with as much shock and despair as guys in sleeveless tshirts and calloused hands ever show this is a really , really important place , fumed john newman , a sculptor with a studio on franklin street who says he comes to ckl at least four times a day for life sblood items like glue and screws i do n't know what i 'll do now while visibly touched by the outpouring of love , mr katz says he is at peace with the decision look , we will keep the property in the family , i 'll have a good income and there will be plenty of free time for golf and grandchildren , he said all i can say is thank god we bought the place when we had the chance , he said real estate is really the only reliable way to make money in this town
the human life teeming through carandiru , hector babenco s sprawling portrait of brazil s criminal class crowded within a notorious s o paulo penitentiary , exudes a throbbing fleshandblood intensity so compelling that it s impossible to avert your eyes watching this messy epic is a little like being jammed into an unairconditioned subway car on a steamy summer night as it rattles through an urban wasteland at any second things could explode and eventually they do if the sense of danger makes you feel vulnerable , it also tunes you fiercely into the moment as the movie lays out a loosely connected series of vignettes that tell the stories of assorted prisoners , the ripe scents of sweat and junk food seem to waft from the screen in a heady , slightly sickening vapor once you 've adjusted to the charged , humid atmosphere , the movie is n't quite as scary as it appears in the opening scene , when lula \( dion sio neto \) , a desperate inmate , attacks dagger \( milhem cortaz \) , the sleek , tattooed killerforhire who murdered lula s father order is restored when a fellow prisoner , moacir \( ivan de almeida \) , the unit s unofficial mediator , steps in at the same time , a mildmannered doctor \( luiz carlos vasconcelos \) , whose deepening connections with the prisoners unlock the film s flashbacks , is escorted into the cellblock to test them for hiv it is the 1980 s , and the setting is the real s o paolo house of detention , known as carandiru , which was torn down in 2002 , a decade after a riot led to the massacre of 111 inmates by the police at its peak of occupancy , the prison , designed for 3 , 000 men , held 8 , 000 when carandiru was filmed \( before the demolition \) in an empty cellblock , it still housed 6 , 000 much of the prison , which has the color , noise and volatile climate of a festering housing project , is controlled by the inmates , who decorate the cells and have established a pecking order the strong inhabit grubby individual suites , while the weak are jammed together , as many as 16 sharing a 90squarefoot cell the film , which opens today in new york and los angeles , is a splashy return to form by mr babenco , the celebrated director of pixote and kiss of the spider woman in some ways , it is an update of pixote , the portrait of a 10yearold runaway and petty criminal in s o paulo that made mr babenco internationally famous more than two decades ago any one of several violent characters in carandiru could be a boy like pixote , grown up and hardened in examining social ills , mr babenco is the furthest thing from a detached clinician beneath its documentarylike sprawl , carandiru is a handson movie passionately engaged in its characters' personal dramas even dagger , the coldblooded killerforhire , is eventually revealed to have a tormented conscience the film s unwavering belief in redemption makes its savage brutality palatable , if at times suspiciously sentimental no matter how vicious the behavior , there are always explanations and a possibility of something better carandiru is a hotbed of drugs and diseases \( aids and tuberculosis lead the list \) the film s most ominous , most charismatic character , highness \( ailton gra a \) , is a handsome , swaggering drug lord who orders inside executions he also juggles two hotblooded women , dalva \( maria luisa

outside , floats handmade balloons in the prison yard and waxes philosophical about the wisdom gained in solitary confinement for seriocomic relief , the regal , wisecracking lady di \( rodrigo

the movie threatens to go soft , carandiru erupts in what may be the most horrific and sustained prison riot ever filmed by the end of the movie s jawdropping recreation of the 1992 mass slaughter by the police \( who lost none of their own \) , its stairs are ankledeep in streaming blood , mud and trash but there s a small , troubling hole at the center of the movie when all is said and done , the calm , sympathetic doctor who volunteers his services at carandiru and becomes a trusted visitor remains a benign cipher , an almost entirely forgettable presence despite its confusion and the broadness of many of its strokes , the movie belongs to a latin american tradition of heartfelt social realism in which the struggles of ordinary people assume a heroic dimension the film is undeniably the work of an artist with the strength to gaze into the abyss and return , his humanity fortified carandiruis rated r \( under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian \) for

the interim iraqi government is preparing to appoint 43 ambassadors abroad as it reopens diplomatic ties with other nations , hoshyar zebari , the foreign minister , said in an interview on saturday at the same time , he said , the government wants countries in the region to show mutual respect by not getting involved in iraq s internal affairs and by clamping down on any crossborder flow of foreign fighters or aid to the insurgency here all of iraq s neighbors are interfering in many ways some more than others in the internal affairs of this country , mr zebari contended the new iraq will be responsible and conscious and mindful of your national security needs , mr zebari said , referring to middle eastern countries , in the hourlong interview in his office near the fortified american headquarters at the same time , we need you to respect iraq s sovereignty and unity and internal affairs this is to establish the rules of being good neighbors mr zebari was planning to attend a meeting of european union officials in brussels on monday to discuss how european nations can help in the reconstruction of iraq he was expected to represent prime minister iyad allawi , who turned down an invitation last week from the dutch presidency of the 25member union because of the security situation at home mr zebari flew from baghdad on sunday afternoon mr zebari , who once worked in the kurdish opposition against saddam hussein , has been trying to rebuild his ministry since his appointment on june 1 under mr hussein s rule , iraqi embassies were used as strongholds for intelligence services and bases from which agents tried to assassinate or intimidate iraqis abroad , especially opposition leaders to overhaul the foreign ministry is akin to uprooting weeds in an untended garden , mr zebari said the new ministry has already sent 250 diplomats to 19 countries , from egypt to japan , he said they were mostly chosen from the ranks of the old ministry , though many are young , meaning they were not polluted by the ways of the former ruling baath party , mr zebari added i think we have moved a great deal in establishing a good working environment here , he said the foreign ministry is also coordinating with the interior ministry to establish a new visa process to control the flow of foreigners into the country american military officials have acknowledged that leaving the borders of iraq open since the toppling of mr hussein s government in april 2003 has allowed foreigner fighters to slip into the country with ease though such fighters are thought to make up only a tiny percentage of the insurgency the justice minister said last week that only 29 were being held in abu ghraib prison they are suspected of being responsible for some of the most spectacular and deadly suicide bombings mr zebari declined to say which countries in the region he considers to be meddling the most in iraq s affairs but in a june 8 speech at the council on foreign relations in new york , he said that syria was not being very helpful , while iran appeared to be taking a friendlier stand western and iraqi officials have said that iranian officials generally want to maintain stability in iraq and are backing a range of shiite groups here in the hopes that one or more will emerge victorious in the general elections scheduled for january 2005 last week , the president of syria , bashar alassad , paid a surprise twoday visit to tehran and held a news conference with mohammad khatami , the iranian president , in which the two denounced the presence of american troops in iraq there is no ambiguity between us and syria where iraq is concerned , mr khatami said , according to agence francepresse the solution is the quick end to the occupation , the installation of a government comprising all elements of the iraqi people and the cooperation of the international community to bring stability and reconstruction the iraqi government has also discovered that money is being funneled from some persian gulf states to groups of iraqi salafis , extremely conservative sunni muslims , mr zebari said but he added that it is very difficult in general to pin down any state sponsorship of aid to the insurgency here the iraqi government wants to establish rules with neighbors on matters like border control and extradition arrangements , he said a senior american military official said in a recent email message that the military continues to see small numbers of foreign fighters coming through the porous borders of syria and saudi arabia financing and weapons also come from those countries , though none of it has been linked directly so far to the governments , the official said saudi financiers of terrorist groups send in money , as do couriers crossing the syrian border who bring money collected from outside syria once foreign fighters and aid flow into iraq often via old smuggling routes they end up helping extremist groups such as the zarqawi network or being channeled north to the sunni triangle to support iraqi cells , the official said , referring to jordanian militant abu musab alzarqawi some aid is funneled to groups as far north as mosul or down to basra near the persian gulf mr zebari said he believed that neighboring countries had involved themselves in iraqi internal affairs because of false premises that they hold namely that the american forces here will invade those countries next or disrupt the stability of those countries you are making a mistake , he said , again addressing those countries , because it is in your interests to have a strong , prosperous , democratic iraq an unstable iraq will only ignite unrest in countries in the region , mr zebari said a strong iraq will be able to act independently of the united states and forge its own foreign policy , he added he gave as one example the fact that the new iraqi government has refused to accept the presence on its soil of troops from neighboring countries , even though the united states had been encouraging countries like jordan to send soldiers we iraqis do not want the support of any forces from neighboring countries , mr zebari said they will use this to advance their interests
celebrating the return of a republican majority to the southampton town board during its yearly organizational meeting on monday , councilwoman linda kabot described it as a new day for town government while councilman dennis suskind , a democrat , grumbled that there are those on long island who believe southampton is run by cronyism , deceit and unethical practices politics as usual , to be sure but the new day dawned under a cloud that has hung over town hall for a month , since a majority of the town ethics board resigned to protest what it described as the town supervisor s obstruction of a board investigation last spring , mr suskind filed a complaint with the ethics board alleging that the town supervisor , patrick heaney , strongarmed a candidate for town attorney by threatening to expose the lawyer s arrest record if he did not withdraw from consideration mr heaney , in an interview on tuesday , denied making any threats , saying he only offered advice that the record could become known if the lawyer , john shields , continued to pursue the job town justice court records show mr shields was charged on jan 9 , 2003 , with driving while intoxicated and refusing to take a sobriety test , both misdemeanors , and at the same time received a traffic ticket for driving outside his lane the records also show that on feb 25 , 2003 , justice thomas demayo approved a settlement in which mr shields s dwi was reduced to a speeding ticket , for which he was fined 135 , and the other two charges were dismissed in a march 27 letter , mr shields , an assistant state attorney general , notified the board that he was withdrawing from consideration for the appointed town post a copy of an aborted town board resolution approving mr shields s appointment was cosponsored by all the town board members except mr heaney in may , stephen brown was appointed to the post on a parttime basis at a 73 , 200 annual salary , and was reappointed on monday with a fulltime salary of 94 , 700 on dec 8 , five of the ethics board s six members resigned christine merser , the board s former chairwoman , said members tried for several months to interview mr heaney but were rebuffed we really did have no choice but to resign , she said it became about why the town should have an ethics board at all if it is going to be rendered completely useless the board is empowered to advise town employees on ethical questions and to report to the town board on whether an allegation of impropriety has merit , deserves a full investigation , or should be referred to law enforcement mr heaney called the resignations an empty gesture one might speculate , he said , that a majority of the ethics board , at the time their departure occurred , knew they were not likely to be appointed the terms of all six members were to have expired on dec 31 a new board was appointed last week the supervisor also contended that mr suskind was trying to position himself for a run for town supervisor in two years this was all about 'how can i embarrass my potential opponent \? mr heaney said mr suskind acknowledged that one of the resigned ethics board members , ms merser , worked as a strategist on his campaign two years ago , and that another , gail davenport , is married to a town democratic committeeman but all three rebutted mr heaney s charge of a partisan setup we were so careful to not be political , ms davenport said we waited until after the election to resign , and we really tried to uphold the integrity of anyone who came before us citing confidentiality rules , none of the former members would comment publicly on the specifics of their inquiry before the resignations , the board suggested that mr suskind seek a criminal investigation by the district attorney s office last week , he said he was still considering it he had filed a complaint with the da months ago , but prosecutors said the matter could not be pursued because mr shields declined to help so mr suskind went to the ethics board in his memo to the board , he alleged that because mr heaney could not dissuade the four council members from appointing mr shields , he threatened to ruin mr shields s reputation , embarrass his family , and , if appointed , to not let him into the supervisor s office the memo goes on to say that , when confronted in a closeddoor meeting , mr heaney admitted saying those things in asking for a determination on whether the supervisor violated either the town or state ethics codes , mr suskind wrote , the issue is , i believe , whether his behavior was in excess of his authority , perhaps illegal , but clearly unacceptable behavior by an elected official mr heaney vehemently denied making any threats he claimed mr shields failed to disclose pertinent information my crime is that i stood my ground and could not possibly support this individual , he said of mr shields i only told him he was taking an extreme risk i told him , 'i know more about you than you could ever want me to know , and you 're a damned fool if you go forward with this the town attorney , mr brown , wrote on dec 16 that he did not think mr heaney had violated any law even if mr suskind s allegations are true , he wrote , a 'threat' to disclose factual matters breaches neither ethical nor legal proscriptions mr shields , who was a deputy town attorney before joining the state attorney general s office , said he had become a political football this is a dispute between two people , he said , referring to mr heaney and mr suskind , but i'm the one who s going to suffer from this the ramifications for me are so farreaching you ca n't even imagine he declined further comment

two days before new year s john gregory dunne , one of the shrewdest observers of hollywood \( and so much else \) , died suddenly in new york john dunne was my friend , but decades before i met him in life , i met him in print , through the studio , a book about the movie business that s unlikely to be surpassed in the mid1960 s , john somehow persuaded richard zanuck , son and deputy to darryl zanuck , the titan of 20th century fox , to give him complete ontherecord access to the studio for a full year it was not a great year drunk on the financial success of the sound of music , fox rolled the dice on three breakthebank musical star vehicles dr dolittle with rex harrison , star ! with julie andrews and hello , dolly ! with barbra streisand john s unblinking account of every last costly miscalculation on this road to fiscal madness , etched in wry deadpan , was published in 1969 still in print today , the studio is a permanent freeze frame of hollywood on the brink of generational change , just before it was overrun by a new crop of young directors shaped by the 60 s the new wave that was on its way epitomized by films like chinatown , the godfather and taxi driver was as aesthetically removed from the sound of music , and its america , as it could be little of the hollywood in the studio remains what was 20th century fox is now but a small component of fox , which itself is just one component of rupert murdoch s vast news corporation the idea that any reporter would be allowed to spend an afternoon , let alone a year , with full access to any studio is laughable much of what passes today for journalism about the film industry much , though not all of it , on tv is tightly policed by publicists the disconnect between appearance , as it is presented in the media , and the reality of what actually occurs behind the scenes is as great in hollywood as it is in washington , if not greater , the journalist peter biskind writes in his new book , down and dirty pictures miramax , sundance , and the rise of independent film , published this week mr biskind s book has been anticipated in part because his previous easy riders , raging bulls was the definitive account of hollywood in the 70 s , indeed of the coppolascorsese era that swept away the hollywood of the studio in down and dirty pictures mr biskind takes on the movie industry of the 1990 s and again gets the story , despite the lack of any zanucks to give him the keys to the lot in the process he adds perspective to our ongoing moment of cultural sea change much as john dunne s book presaged a wild cultural shift almost 40 years ago down and dirty pictures was also anticipated because of prepublication rumors of its unblinkered accounts of miramax s harvey weinstein and sundance s robert redford the book does not stint in that respect , especially in the case of mr weinstein and his partner in blood and commerce , bob weinstein they have a reputation for brilliance , but also for malice and brutality , mr biskind writes at the outset before going on to supply enough extravagant examples of both to keep readers sated for months to come miramax s brilliance is revealed in its ability to market idiosyncratic \( and firstrate \) movies from sex , lies and videotape to the crying game to pulp fiction , even if the movies or their creators are slapped around in the process as for malice , mr biskind writes finesse was never part of harvey s arsenal he tore phones out of walls and hurled them he slammed doors and overturned tables almost anything within reach could become a weapon none of this is likely to surprise anyone and we are legion who has been on the receiving end of a weinstein tirade but like mr biskind s previous book , his new one celebrates a revolution in moviemaking even while refusing to sentimentalize the revolutionaries although 2003 was no more a watershed year for independent films than it was for studio blockbusters , that revolution is here to stay just as down and dirty pictures was being shipped to bookstores , there were signs that today s show business establishment , for all its might , is not as impregnable as it often seems hollywood asks has pop culture pooped out \? read a frontpage headline in variety this week the question was prompted by the final accounting of a movie year that , the los angeles times reported , had the biggest decline in admissions in more than a decade there are significant signs that the mainstream audience for movies may be drifting away in the same slow but relentless pattern that s afflicting broadcast television and music , writes peter bart , variety s editor even the stars who were supposed to ride to the rescue in the final reel lacked the audience mandates that turn holiday vehicles into runaway hits the last samurai \( tom cruise \) , master and commander \( russell crowe \) , mona lisa smile \( julia roberts \) and paycheck \( ben affleck \) are all boxoffice disappointments , though the panaceas of dvd sales and foreign revenues may ultimately push some of them into profit in 2003 the films that went through the roof finding nemo , pirates of the caribbean and the return of the king were all fantasies , set either in the briny deep or on middle , as opposed to actual , earth though there are sporadic exceptions \( mystic river , any farce starring steve martin or jack nicholson \) , real people and real places are most likely to be found in movies from indies actual independent film companies or the boutique subdivisions that major studios acquired or invented to mimic the genuine indies surveying the splintered audience in variety , peter bart writes longingly of once walking through a small town and finding every tv tuned to the same show \( alas , it was lawrence welk \) he found a true comfort in his glimpse into the mainstream it may have been boring , but it was unifying a heartland america existed after all that heartland , if it ever existed , long ago gave way to nicheland as james poniewozik of time concluded at year s end , the massmedia audience as we have known it is a distant memory it is no longer possible to please most of the people most of the time for those who cherish a vital pop culture this is good news while 2003 was a year marked by the further consolidation of power by a handful of megamedia companies , the audience is not without some power to fight against them the more we reject embarrassing bigticket stunts like charlie s angels full throttle and coupling , the riskier it becomes to produce bloated wouldbe crowdpleasers chasing after a theoretically homogeneous crowd vanity and perhaps the possibility of found money might even drive the media giants to bolster their output of more diversified , less costly and perhaps better products that speak to our various niches movies like last year s lost in translation , capturing the friedmans , american splendor , monster , thirteen , in america , fog of war and spellbound the trouble for these monster corporations is that an america of niches does n't always play to their strengths topheavy conglomerates are geared up for producing masscommondenominator products , but when that mass common denominator disperses , they can be flummoxed in tv , where the networks' 2003 audience falloff has caused real panic to set in , nbc s jeff zucker has already pinned the year s flops on the too many people involved in the creative process , mainly his own network s executives it was the small corporate sibling of nbc , bravo , that produced this season s hit , queer eye for the straight guy , in much the same way that the niche disney channel , with lilo stitch and lizzie mcguire , upstaged disney s broadcast giant , abc and that fox searchlight released in america and thirteen in the year of fox s master and commander and stuck on you the question for such niche divisions embedded in big corporations is whether they can coexist indefinitely with their masters inhouse indies came to blows with their own studio siblings this fall over the issue of sending video screeners to oscar voters nor is it certain that they can maintain the creative independence that makes their projects distinctive in the first place in this sense harvey weinstein becomes an almost i stress , almost poignant figure in down and dirty pictures because he seems to have misplaced the meaning of his own success his problem is not that he is a bully as john dunne writes in his other nonfiction account of the movie business , the 1997 monster , there s a case to be made for the effectiveness of bully boy producers , from otto preminger to don simpson the trouble comes when the bullies join the establishment , a process that arguably began for miramax once it was bought by disney in 1993 as mr biskind suggests , miramax s cold mountain says more about that company today than whatever ashtrays mr weinstein has thrown at his underlings while by no means a terrible movie , it is indicative of how much a renegade operation built by gambling on onetime wild cards like quentin tarantino and kevin smith has bought into the bigstudio mentality it once countered yes , miramax released some genuine indie movies this year , like the station agent , but cold mountain is miramax s costliest investment yet \( at least 80 million , by its account \) , and so it strains to appeal to a phantom heartland that may be as extinct as lawrence welk its civil war is stripped of its messy racial divisions , and its love story is so glossily executed that its handtomouth heroine \( nicole kidman \) seems to have stepped onto tobacco road directly from an armani showroom except for its ferocious battle scenes , this is a film that , in both its strengths and defects , could have been made by mgm in 1939 , though in truth gone with the wind had more eroticism , grit and \( dare i say it \? \) cognizance of slavery cold mountain will no doubt be promoted , in ace miramax fashion , into the oscars sweepstakes but this is a new era when even the oscar show , no longer the automatic mass draw it once was , has had to switch its date and retool itself to fend off the golden globes as john dunne would be the first to point out , however , an oscar was never an unalloyed blessing after it hit the jackpot with chicago last year , miramax went out and acquired the rights to three more musicals \( guys and dolls , pippin and damn yankees \) , in uncanny , if presumably unconscious , emulation of the misguided zanucks all those hollywoods ago
the most galling part of watching the new york legislature in action is the sight of thousands of students innocently touring the state capitol their teachers are usually telling them about how democracy works , how teddy roosevelt and al smith once roamed these very halls , how mr bill becomes mr law in albany in reality , what these crowds of young people see is men and women on public salaries , going through the motions the whole place might as well be made out of cardboard as a report released last week from the brennan center for justice at nyu school of law has documented , new york s capitol houses a potemkin legislature the capitol s splendid chambers are for show voting is automatic once a legislator swipes a card or waves at a clerk at the beginning of each putative workday legislation that goes to the floor always passes always because the leader in each house has more power than most dictators the other 210 members either follow their leaders or watch their backs public debate is rare when assembly members began a verbal exchange on the floor last month about the horrors of junk food versus the joys of chocolate , the moment was viewed by albany veterans as an extremely good day for democracy it is not hyperbole to say that new york s legislature is one of the least democratic in the country the brennan center has done the math and suggested changes in the rules that would help here are a few of their numbers , with a little explanation about how new york s strange legislative beast really works the busywork of billmaking new york s legislators do not actually enact many laws they do , however , introduce more bills than any other state legislature in the union two years ago , 16 , 892 bills were introduced in new york s two houses that s almost twice as many as in the illinois general assembly , which ranks second but how many of albany s bills actually become law \? about 4 percent , the thirdlowest percentage in the country \( illinois may have started out with only half as many proposals , but it managed to enact 746 laws compared with 693 in new york \) what about the other 16 , 199 bills that did not make it into law \? most are for the record only some bills are meant to allow legislators to boast to voters \( in statepaid mailings \) that they tried to do something for them other bills are meant to convince albany s flush lobbyists that a legislator did enough to earn a nice , fat campaign contribution all these bills do accomplish one thing , however they waste reams of paper and hours of time and overtime and an unbelievable amount of money , considering the final product to do all that extra work , albany s legislators apparently need a lot of people more than any other state legislature in the country last year , for example , new york had 3 , 428 people on the legislature s payroll pennsylvania was in second place with 2 , 947 and california came in third with 2 , 359 in 2001 , the new york legislature cost the taxpayers 197 million or about 333 , 000 per actual law obviously , a lot of legislative ideas deserve a swift death , and there is serious work that requires skilled staff members even though the lawmakers have not passed a budget on time in two decades , the budget bills still need to be put together by experts but sometimes the budget is virtually the only legislation of substance that survives an accounting of bills enacted in 2001 shows that few had statewide impact \( one did ban drivers from talking on handheld cellphones , even though that change apparently is still news to a lot of new york motorists \) in general the new laws were narrow , pegged to some very parochial need many offered tax breaks to churches , synagogues and , in one case , to anyone in the business of handling manure others tweaked the state legal code podiatrists won the right to be certified as acupuncturists , for example , and loitering on school buses was prohibited perhaps the statistic that speaks loudest about the meaninglessness of a legislator s job is the number of bills defeated on the floors of the assembly and senate a whopping zero and nobody can remember the last time an amendment to a bill was added on the floor joseph bruno , the senate majority leader , and sheldon silver , the assembly speaker , decide which bills make it to the floor of their respective chambers , and their blessing makes the legislation invulnerable whatever hits the floor is a done deal for example , from 1997 to 2001 , the senate approved 7 , 109 bills and defeated none the assembly , in a threeyear period , passed 4 , 365 bills and defeated none it is a record that the kremlin of yore could admire committees everywhere in a normal , modern legislature , the committee is where bills are drafted , after research by the staff , public hearings and consultations with the experts new york s committees are not normal or modern they are set up to rubberstamp bills drafted in the many backrooms of the state capitol most committee meetings last less than a few minutes they are so brief that when the brennan center tried to find records for committee meetings in the senate , they were told such documents mostly do not exist votes are recorded that s about it still , new york s legislature has a lot of committees the senate has 32 more than the upper houses of any other state except mississippi the assembly has 37 , ranking third for number of committees in the nation s lower houses experts say that having too many committees is not good it leads to overlap and forces members to run from one meeting to another rather than do real work on legislation at this point , that does n't matter in albany , of course the legislators are hardly involved in the process anyway the committee staff does the legislation , and the staff works for mr bruno or mr silver , not for the committee members lawmakers in other states find public hearings provide a good chance to get input from state residents on legislation they are considering even if they complain that sitting through them takes a lot of time no problem in albany in a fiveyear period , the brennan center found that the assembly committees held only 10 hearings on matters that inspired major laws the senate s many committees held nine such hearings committee chairmen who do hold hearings like assemblyman richard brodsky of westchester , who has been vigorously pursuing missteps by state authorities are generally considered by their colleagues to be publicity hounds or spoilers trying to make everybody else look bad the real reason albany has so many committees is to provide patronage for mr bruno and mr silver , who dispense the chairmanships to grateful soldiers in their respective armies committee chairmen get bonuses of 9 , 000 or more to add to their salary of 79 , 500 for what is essentially a parttime job failing to read the fine print the citizens budget commission sent letters earlier this month to all members of the legislature , pleading with them to insist on having three full days to review the budget new york s budget , due on april 1 , is habitually late allowing three more days for legislators , staff members and especially the public to study the budget will not make much difference in the long run the goal of the letter was to head off the usual scene in albany when legislators wind up voting to commit the entire state all 19 million people to a budget that is basically still wrapped in plastic the state constitution requires a threeday aging process for any bill , but it made a loophole for emergencies so , as anybody who knows governments could have predicted , there are now a lot of emergencies in albany the emergencies have grown so routine , in fact , that over a fiveyear period , almost 27 percent of the bills that were passed in at least one chamber came hot , often literally , off the capitol presses after almost seven months of backroom negotiations by gov george e pataki , mr bruno and mr silver , it would be unconscionable for these three to argue that this year s 100 billion budget must be passed right away another three days will not matter in a rigged system like albany s but it will give the public interest groups a chance to see what horrors are being committed in the name of urgency and of course , that s one of the reasons the leaders prefer to see the budget documents pass unread changing the autocratic rules perhaps the worst part of this long list of failings is that new york s legislature could improve its performance and its standing among legislatures in this country fairly easily the people who make the rules , mainly mr bruno and mr silver , could simply change them the brennan center study has come up with a good working list of improvements that could be made at the beginning of the next legislative session the center s authors are handing out the list now because they want voters to start demanding that their local representatives push for changes that could make them more than figureheads in albany it s a good list , and one every voter should bring along when preparing to meet the candidates this fall put an end to emptyseat voting the assembly should junk its ezvoting machines , which allow members or sometimes even someone on their staff to swipe their cards every morning and thus vote yes automatically until the close of business the senate , where a member can walk in , wave at the front desk and then leave for the day , will merely have to change the rules no other state allows such nonsense make it easier for legislators to bring bills to the floor right now , if a bill is on the senate calendar scheduled for debate , mr bruno need only add a star next to it to put the legislation in limbo indefinitely mr silver has much the same power , just achieved more indirectly convene conference committees more often to iron out differences in bills from both houses that would cut down on the passage of mock bills that die of inaction because they are passed in different versions by the two chambers albany s favorite way of getting the credit without actually passing the law limit bills to 20 for each member of the assembly and 30 for each senator it s time to focus on what matters , not what fills the air , the member s newsletter and the campaign treasury assign no member to more than three standing committees these should be real legislative committees that have actual power and responsibility for passing serious legislation \( check california for an example of how it can work \) minutes and attendance should be taken by a stenographer and proxy voting should be prohibited the fact that none of that exists now raises a question if these legislators are not on the floor and they are not burdened by long committee meetings , where are they \? do voters need some version of a parolee s anklet for their elected representatives \? require that all legislation sent to the floor be accompanied by a committee report of some depth if no decent report is attached to the bill , members on the floor should start challenging the sponsor for details as the idea catches hold , perhaps some members will begin to realize that it is actually possible to vote no when your party proposes a real stinker of a bill allow each committee to hire and fire its own professional staff this is basic the committees will never work properly without some financial independence the brennan center report concludes that on most important counts , new york has the worst legislature in the country one that deprives the public of any real representation , because legislators obey their leaders more than voters the people have almost no access to the real process of lawmaking , which goes on behind closed doors among the two leaders and the governor and it is inefficient we have only to look at this year s stalled budget to see a glaring example of inefficient autocracy mr bruno and mr silver , who could change these suffocating rules , were dismissive of the very idea mr bruno called the proposals third world country stuff clearly new york s leaders need to get around more especially to other statehouses in the united states
directed by michael radford \( best known for il postino \) , the merchant of venice , which stars jeremy irons , al pacino , joseph fiennes and lynn collins , is betterthanaverage screen shakespeare intelligent without being showily clever , and motivated more by genuine fascination with the play s language and ideas than by a desire to cannibalize its author s cultural prestige judiciously trimmed to manageable movie length , this merchant is , for the most part , faithful in letter and spirit to its source material i say for the most part because the merchant of venice has become , over the past century , perhaps the most vexed single play in the shakespearean canon , and the first task of any modern adaptation is to confront the antijewish bigotry that propels its plot and informs its poetry mr radford s approach to the problem of shylock \( mr pacino \) is to contextualize not only is the story punctually announced as taking place in venice , 1596 a kind of specification wholly alien to the time but introductory titles provide some background about the marginal status and civic oppression of that city s jewish population as in other parts of europe , venetian jews practiced usury because they were denied access to other economic activities , and because lending money at interest , vital to the prosperity of the citystate and its merchants , was something christians would not do none of which quite explains the character of shylock , or dispels the taint of blood libel from the play an impossibility in any case the only real choice is either to declare the merchant of venice off limits or to allow its uglier qualities to continue to complicate its gorgeous flights of rhetoric and its brilliant inquiries into law , loyalty , the ethics of making promises and the quality of mercy after a bumpy beginning shakespearean dramas take longer to come into focus than do movies , whose audiences are accustomed to having everything in place after 10 minutes mr radford , who also wrote the screenplay , succeeds in rendering the complexities with clarity and vigor too many productions of shakespeare s plays , on stage and on screen , either push them into a contrived modern setting or chase after an irrelevant ideal of authenticity mr radford , helped by bruno rubeo , the production designer , and the exquisitely gifted cinematographer beno t delhomme , ingeniously views shakespeare through the lens of his artistic peers and \( approximate \) contemporaries watching the film is like seeing a gallery of renaissance paintings come to life , and while the effect is occasionally contrived \( the dwarves attending a spanish suitor might as well have vel zquez logos sewn onto their clothes \) , it mostly deepens the wonder and strangeness of the play to imagine the people envisioned and captured by rembrandt , vermeer , caravaggio and titian performing shakespeare is to appreciate anew both the strangeness and vitality of early modern europe , and to approach a visual understanding of the intellectual and artistic eclecticism that characterized the age but every production of shakespeare , however well designed or sensitively directed , depends finally on the quality of the acting i must confess i approached this film , in which mr pacino s name figures so prominently , with some trepidation , preparing myself for the latest installment in his scenerychewing parade of jewish monsters through the ages since he had done herod on broadway and roy cohn on hbo , shylock was only to be expected , and also perhaps dreaded , given the histrionic isolation that has distinguished his recent work he restrains himself here , however , emphasizing shylock s grief as much as his viciousness more than that , his estrangement from the other actors , a liability in more conventional movie dramas , makes sense , given shylock s status as an outsider , who speaks a rougher verse than his christian antagonists of these , mr irons , as antonio , the depressive merchant of the title , is quietly mesmerizing mr fiennes , as his young friend bassanio \( whose courtship of portia impels antonio to mortgage his pound of flesh to shylock \) , recites his lines beautifully , but is upstaged by kris marshall , as his feisty second , gratiano , and also by ms collins , whose handful of television and movie appearances hardly prepare one for the radiant authority she brings to the role of portia her charisma is crucial to mr radford s conception of the play , which places portia both a wily seductress and an exacting ethical intelligence at its center portia s defeat of shylock becomes one of the great courtroom scenes in recent movies , a dense , emotionally volatile tableau of cruelty and beauty , much like the rest of mr radford s welljudged interpretation of this impossible play the merchant of venice is rated r \( under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian \) it has some nudity 'the merchant of venice' directed by michael radford written by mr radford , based on the play by william shakespeare director of photography , beno t delhomme edited by lucia zucchetti music by jocelyn pook

around 1 pm yesterday , television news helicopters were hovering over northern manhattan , following a white limousine as it sped through midday traffic the limousine soon stopped at 145th street , as did the five or six cars full of reporters and photographers who had trailed it on what some described as a highspeed chase all the way from the southport correctional facility in pine city , ny , near elmira state parole officers ran to the limousine , opened the door and brought out joel b steinberg , the man convicted of beating a 6yearold in his care , lisa steinberg , to death over 16 years ago the parole officers whisked mr steinberg , 63 , from the limousine , which was rented from a car service by mr steinberg s lawyer , into a blue chevrolet impala they then drove to the fortune academy , a fortresslike building that is a temporary residence for exprisoners there , the officers led a terrifiedlooking mr steinberg through a frenzied scrum of photographers and reporters to the stone steps that lead to the building s entrance halfway up the steps , mr steinberg fell , losing his baseball cap , and was all but dragged the remaining distance and through the heavy wooden doors so went mr steinberg s first day out of prison we knew there was going to be media attention , said joanne page , executive director of the fortune society , the nonprofit organization that runs the fortune academy i did n't expect helicopters i guess i'm amazed by how much there is we did n't expect quite this intensity while there is no way to accurately say what much of new york thought of mr steinberg s release after some 17 years behind bars , mr steinberg s arrival at the fortune academy building the castle , as it is often called appalled some local residents i'm worried about the little children , said joanne singleton , who lives in the apartment building across the street , adding that she was not confident that mr steinberg had changed in prison but mr steinberg was not the only newcomer that she was unhappy about it s been real nice and quiet around here , she said , staring at a dozen or so reporters nearby it s going to get loud now with all the media the news media attention related to mr steinberg reached a fever pitch yesterday the cover of the daily news displayed a grainy photo of mr steinberg , and , while an editorial inside the paper discouraged new yorkers from physically assaulting him on the street , it did say on the cover let him feel every new york eye burning straight through his rotten soul this is a man who committed a heinous act , killed a little girl and has never shown , in our view , the proper remorse for that , said arthur browne , editorial page editor of the daily news mr browne added that anyone who worried that the language on the front page could put mr steinberg in danger was vesting that editorial with far more power than it deserves he added , i certainly do n't think new yorkers would read that and begin beating him with sticks gov george e pataki contributed to the heated environment , saying in a statement the fact that a despicable child killer like joel steinberg is being released from prison before serving his full sentence is not only wrong it s an outrage a little before 9 am , when he got into the white limousine , mr steinberg officially left the custody of the state mr steinberg s release was required by a law which has since been changed by the sentencing reform act of 1995 that held that a prisoner must be released after serving twothirds of his maximum sentence unless his prison misconduct rose to a certain level mr steinberg was sentenced to 81 3 to 25 years though he was guilty of some minor offenses while in prison , none of these offenses rose to the level that prevented his conditional release so yesterday , he walked free with the 104 that he had earned while working in prison , and wearing a stateissued sweater , jeans and sneakers darnay hoffman , mr steinberg s lawyer , had rented a limousine for the ride to new york because , he said , he wanted mr steinberg to enjoy his first ride out of prison the trip was anything but leisurely i can tell you that it was a very tense ride , said mr hoffman at mr steinberg s request , two cars with state personnel accompanied the limousine to new york , mr hoffman said they were very concerned that he get down there in one piece , mr hoffman said we were going about 80 miles per hour most of the time , said noreen lark , a producer for channel 11 , who was following in one of the cars she calculated that there were about eight cars in all , including the press cars , the officials' cars and the limousine itself the drive intensified once the caravan left the bronx , and came to a halt when the limousine pulled over at 145th street and riverside drive at this point , according to ms lark , state parole officers jumped out of one of the other cars , asked mr steinberg to identify himself at the door of the limousine , and then pulled him into the blue impala that continued to the fortune academy the transfer , mr hoffman said , had been planned according to scott e steinhardt , a spokesman for the division of parole , as well as mr hoffman , the parole officers who provided protection at the scene were requested by mr steinberg they accommodated mr steinberg s request and facilitated his entrance into his approved residence , said mr steinhardt , adding that , despite the unusual circumstance of this case , the primary role of the division of parole remained to supervise mr steinberg once he has returned to the community the conditions of mr steinberg s parole include not making contact with the victims of his crime in any way , not making contact with anyone under the age of 18 without permission from the division of parole , abiding by a strict curfew and attending an anger management program the fortune academy also has a set of strict rules , though all residents are there voluntarily ms page , the director of the fortune society , said that mr steinberg would be treated like any other resident for a few days or perhaps weeks he will live in a room on the top floor with several other residents , until permanent housing is found either in the academy or outside residents are required to either work at a job or receive counseling , or both , for 35 hours a week , in addition to attending daily programs and performing 10 hours of community service a week ms page added that all residents were evaluated for any risk they could pose to the surrounding community before being allowed to stay at the academy but outside of these rules , if mr steinberg has any problems now , he picks up the phone and calls the police like any other new yorker asked whether he was concerned for mr steinberg s safety , police commissioner raymond w kelly said , i have no reason to question his safety this is a big city , and i have no indication that he s at risk in any way mr hoffman said that although he had set up an apartment for mr steinberg , they had decided that the fortune academy would be a better place for him to stay for reasons of security and rehabilitation he also said that he was not very worried about mr steinberg s safety giselle polo , 35 , a special education teacher who lives up the street , was not as confident we 're not going to be safe , she said , holding her 12yearold daughter s hand on the sidewalk in front of the building i do n't think he s going to be safe either

today s test consists of only one question , so think carefully the a in sat stands for \( a \) aptitude \( b \) achievement \( c \) assessment \( d \) all of the above \( e \) none of the above the correct answer is \( e \) , with partial credit for \( d \) , and if you flubbed , that s understandable for the last decade or so , the sat , that dread saturdaymorning rite of passage endured every year by collegebound high school students , has been going through an identity crisis it used to be called the scholastic aptitude test sat was an abbreviation , in other words and the individual subjects tests \( in chemistry , american history and the like \) were commonly called achievement tests in 1993 , apparently because the aptitude part of the label was thought to hint too much of iq testing , the college board , a membership association of schools and colleges that owns and administers the test , began referring to the sat i reasoning test and sat ii subject tests , and together the two kinds of exam were called the scholastic assessment test got that straight \? good because now we have the socalled new sat , and the letters do n't stand for anything they 're just the name for a test that has become increasingly controversial as parents and educators have questioned the role of standardized testing in the collegeadmission process the revised test will beef up the math component drop the old verbal analogies , beloved by some but detested by others include more reading passages in the verbal section , which will be renamed critical reading add grammar and usage questions and require students to write an actual essay on the spot the new test , optional for this year s college applicants , will be introduced in march , and starting next fall it will become official for everyone in some ways , the changes themselves are not particularly earthshaking the grammar and usage portion will be familiar to students who take the psat , where similar questions have been included for years the essay component is in large part a recycling of the sat ii writing test , which thousands of students submit to voluntarily but taken together the revisions amount to a sea change , a quiet revolution in the way the college board sees its role in american education they are an attempt to transform the sat from a measure of general reasoning ability to a test of what students learn in the classroom to make it , in short , more like its rival test , the act \( which is adding an optional essay in february \) in the process , the college board leadership also hopes not just to assess students' performance but to alter the curriculum itself the truth is that whatever the administrators called it , the sat for a long time was an iq test of sorts as nicholas lemann explains in the big test , his history of the sat , the test had its origins back in the 20 s , when america was flush with enthusiasm over the potential of the psychological testing movement the sat was meant to be , in mr lemann s nice formulation , a kind of glass slipper a way of discovering the hidden academic royalty among the high school population in time , however , it turned into something more nearly like the sorting hat they use at hogwarts school to decide who gets into what house it had become an instrument , that is , not for identifying the select and unusual few but for sifting through and ranking the entire collegebound population and deciding , in effect , who is admitted into what school by the end of this last century , the test had become inextricably woven into the fabric of higher education , even as its claims to measure academic aptitude , as opposed to academic attainment , came to seem increasingly dubious for one thing , it turned out that you could prep for the test , and in fact an entire industry developed around books and tutorials that promised to help students increase their scores for another , it proved much harder for poor and minority students to do well on the test than for pupils who were better off something that should n't have happened , or not to the same degree , if it really were a test of ability , not of how well educated or well prepared you were as mr lemann says , far from ripping aside the veil of social class to reveal the pure individual merit that lay behind it , the sat in fact favored the prosperous and penalized the rest though historically slow to respond to criticism , the college board sooner or later would have had to do something its hand was forced , though , by richard c atkinson , then the president of the university of california , who in 2001 gave an outspoken speech in which he declared that for admissions purposes the university of california would henceforth require only standardized tests that assess mastery of specific subject areas rather than undefined notions of 'aptitude' mr atkinson appears to have been motivated in part by expediency he wanted a test that more poor and minority californians would do better on he took particular objection to the verbal analogy section , the one that asks students to see that clay is to potter as stone is to sculptor in fact , there is some evidence that minority students actually did better on the analogy part of the test than on , say , the reading comprehension david lohman , a university of iowa psychology professor writing in rethinking the sat , a collection of papers in response to the atkinson speech , says that in general , the gap between minority and white students is smaller on tests that measure verbal and mathematical reasoning ability than those that measure actual high school achievement , which suggests that the real problem with the sat may be that it s not enough of an aptitude test and that it has n't sufficiently weeded out the kinds of questions that the classroom teaches you to answer but this is a moot argument , because as gaston caperton , head of the college board , has remarked , when the president of the university of california speaks up , the college board listens the roughly 76 , 000 students who apply every year to the university of california constitute the sat s biggest single customer base , and annually contribute more than 2 million to college board coffers not that it took much listening mr caperton was actually a willing ally , with an agenda of his own a former twoterm governor of west virginia , he is the first head of the college board who is not a professional educator or psychometrician , and he is more aggressive than any of his predecessors about using his position as a pulpit mr caperton , who was severely dyslexic as a child and struggled through school , is intent , he readily admits , on redefining the college board s mission so that it is not just a testing company that determines who goes to what college the mission , he says , is also to connect students to college success once they get there to that end , the college board is trying to influence curriculum , both by developing supplemental programs \( like instructional materials for teachers \) and by using its enormous leverage among the collegebound and those who prepare them \( act inc is doing much the same thing concerned that most high school students are simply not ready either for college or for the workplace , the organization released a report in october urging schools to adopt a more rigorous core curriculum of courses in biology , chemistry , physics and upperlevel math \) in this context , changes like the new writing test amount to a kind of armtwisting the college board is adding an essay in part to force schools to pay more attention to the teaching of writing , which mr caperton believes is being shamefully neglected he s not the only one who thinks so in 2003 , the national commission on writing in america s schools and colleges , a study group convened by the college board , discovered , among other things , that most fourthgrade students spend less than three hours a week writing , or a fraction of the time they spend watching television that nearly twothirds of high school seniors do not write a threepage paper as often as once a month for their english classes and that the long research paper has pretty much become a thing of the past one result is that by the time they get to college , more than 50 percent of incoming freshmen are unable to produce papers relatively free of language errors and to analyze arguments or synthesize information actually , the writing problem in america is even worse than that , if you can judge by documents prepared by the national commission and by the national writing program , an organization dedicated to improving the teaching of writing in american schools some of these documents are themselves not entirely free of language errors \( because writing matters , a teaching guide prepared by the national writing program , has two grammatical mistakes a dangling modifier and a subjectverb disagreement on its very first page \) and they tend to be written in committeespeak stiff , colorless , repetitious language that suggests that , among the writing bureaucracy at least , the greatest stylistic influence is not e b white but powerpoint how , for example , would you grade this little bromide from the neglected 'r , ' a report by the national commission on writing expert writers , like skilled sculptors , cooperate with the material at hand in a sense they participate with it , so that anything that might get in the way of appreciating what they are trying to do is carved away to permit the central idea to emerge no one denies that american high school students ought to write better , but a number of people have questioned whether a 25minute essay \( that s all the time the sat allows \) , written under pressure , is a reasonable test of anything other than a student s ability to churn out more formulaic committeespeak andrew dunn , an english teacher at northern highlands regional high school in allendale , nj , says a writing test of only 25 minutes seems to go contrary to every innovation in the teaching of writing over the last few years , which has been to encourage students to take more time , not less , with brainstorming , prewriting and so on i just ca n't see how this test is going to recognize good writing mr dunn adds even if the test does encourage some schools to spend more time on writing , you 're going to see a wider gap between a suburban school like ours , where i have only 90 students and can give a lot of writing assignments , and a school where the teacher has 150 students those kids are going to be at a further disadvantage even if the idea was really to create more equity john katzman is even more outspoken mr katzman , founder and chief executive of the princeton review , has been one of the college board s harshest and most persistent critics , even as he has profited very nicely from coaching test takers and teaching them how to outwit the sat of the new writing test , he says rather than improving the teaching of writing , it will dumb it down the new test is going to work a lot like the old sat ii writing test , and that s a bad test the scoring correlates mostly with just simple essay length and number of paragraphs state your thesis , give three paragraphs of examples , and sum up it s a boilerplate , and kids applying to selective schools should n't be pushed to this they should have learned it in the seventh grade fundamentally , the whole sat is a middleschool test , and this new version is not going to make collegebound students better writers or better thinkers to get ready for the test , he advises students to prepare in advance some big words and some examples from books or from history examples of what \? of almost anything , he says , explaining that he expects the essay topic to be so insipid that students could plug in details almost at random brian a bremen , an english professor at the university of texas at austin and a member of the committee that developed the new test , says i have no illusion about the kind of writing ability we 're testing in 25 minutes it s the ability to produce a first draft both mr bremen and bernard a phelan , an english teacher at homewoodflossmoor high school in flossmoor , ill , who was also on the testdevelopment committee , believe that a lot can nevertheless be learned from a first draft , and they claim that the prompt , or essay topic , on the new test has been designed to head off the kind of mechanical essay mr katzman foresees , or at least to allow for other possibilities on the old sat ii writing test , the prompts tended to resemble zen koans or chinese fortune cookie slogans the new test asks students to read , evaluate and respond to a short passage or two \( in an explanatory booklet for teachers , counselors and administrators , the college board gives as an example two contrasting statements , one defending , one challenging the role of secrecy in a democratic society \) we want to give the students as many handholds as possible , mr phelan says we 've tried to open up the invention process james hamilton , principal of south river high school in anne arundel county , md , is one of many educators encouraging teachers to rethink their writing curriculums to reflect these new prompts and to give students more practice in writing in response to them i think it s appropriate that schools should use this occasion to take a look at the persuasive essay and to start to examine the way they 're teaching writing , he says it s foolish to think that we should n't revisit whatever we did in the past it does fundamentally change the ballgame when you change the assessment the english department at southern high in harwood , md , started to prepare for the new test a year ago , concentrating not on writing at first but on discussion students need to understand argument , says sue murphy , the department head , and they need to discover confidence in their ideas before they 're prepared to write the power of the college board has actually put it in a slightly awkward position the board wants to encourage the teaching of writing , but not formulaic writing designed to please college board examiners inevitably , though , teachers will wind up teaching to the test you ca n't teacherproof anything , bernard phelan says and you ca n't get around the fact that there are some folks who feel that the whole purpose of writing is for it to be easy for teachers to read george gadda , who heads the writing programs at the university of california at los angeles and presides over the sat writingdevelopment committee , admits that teachers who are harried or overly concerned about results are apt to hook onto something they believe will guarantee some success for writing teachers , such a crutch is the oldfashioned fiveparagraph essay thesisstating beginning , three supporting paragraphs , and one paragraph summation the popularity of this model , mr gadda believes , is that it s an allpurpose blueprint that can be taught independent of subject matter or of a rhetorical setup some teachers even break it down line by line , he says , so you 'll have a student who will look at a piece of writing and say , 'oh , that s a 3b sentence ' to me , this test is a compromise , says jane mallison , a longtime english teacher at trinity school in new york city in a perfect world there would be portfolios of students' work , and you 'd judge them across a range of assignments , including creative writing but it s not a perfect world and some compromises are good ones will the new test slightly favor kids who can do it more rapidly \? sure it will and for most of them it will probably be a little more stressful the anxiety factor will go up a bit but all our students have always taken the sat ii writing test , and for them and for students who are used to the psat , it s not going to be that much of an upheaval patricia bishop , supervisor of secondary language arts for the school in hillsborough county , fla , feels much the same way we already have a statewide writing test in the 10th grade , she says , and i think the new sat will just reinforce what we have already been doing but the objective part , that s the rub , ms bishop continues our students do well on timed writing , but where our curriculum will have to be beefed up is in more indepth testing of grammar and all the facets of standard english usage we 're not going to go back to what we call 'drill and kill , ' but we 're going to teach more understanding and application of grammar and usage many teachers are concerned about the grading of the new test , which the college board is farming out to pearson educational measurement , an iowabased division of the pearson publishing conglomerate in the past , the grading of the sat ii writing test and the advanced placement english exam , which also requires written essays , has always been done in house , with the college board convening roomfuls of english teachers who divide up into committees and over the course of a week or more grade the essays the actual student manuscripts on the spot these grading sessions were social occasions of a sort , with a lot of camaraderie and shoptalk , and they also gave the teachers a feeling of proprietorship over the process we used to have a lot of discussion about what we were doing , jane mallison recalls we even had nicknames for some of the kinds of essays we were seeing there was the cookie cutter , for example , and the energizer bunny in the new system , the essays will be scanned and then sent electronically to the graders , who , working alone at their home computers , will evaluate them under conditions that sound vaguely big brotherish supervisors will be reading over the graders' shoulders , so to speak , looking for those whose ratings are consistently out of whack with their peers , and every time a grader logs on he or she will have to qualify , by correctly scoring a series of sample essays , before being allowed to proceed to the real thing two readers will score each essay independently , and if scores differ by more than a point , it will automatically be sent to a third a lot of us mourn the passage of the old facetoface grading system , george gadda says and in principle , i'm not a proponent of doing things online , but logistically the old kind of interchange just is n't possible anymore you could n't get that many papers graded quickly enough people like bernard phelan and brian bremen , on the other hand , believe that the new system is actually an improvement , because it allows for more monitoring , more quality control the graders will be instructed , moreover , to consider the papers holistically to form a general impression , that is , rather than knocking off or awarding points for this or that flaw or trait and as part of their training they will be shown successful essays in forms other than the fiveparagraph boilerplate model mr phelan says , we want them to understand that there are many different ways to the same goal the new test will be graded on a scale of 1 to 6 , with 1 indicating an essay that is fundamentally lacking , demonstrating very little or no mastery and flawed by structural and grammatical errors , and 6 an essay that is outstanding , demonstrating clear and consistent mastery , although it may have a few minor errors for schools that are used to socalled rubric scoring , this is a considerable change and one that may take some adjustment rubric scoring , which is the way many state writing tests are graded , is essentially scoring by a formula , with graders looking for specific characteristics in an essay proper transitions , elaborations , use of evidence and so on in many cases , the papers are scored on an assembly line , with individual graders looking for specific traits and ignoring everything else with the help of the college board , which runs scoring workshops for teachers , elaine berry , the coordinator for english and reading in the baltimore county schools , has been trying to instruct her teachers in the new system so that they can better evaluate the students' practice essays even our students know that the rubric , or a lot of it , is just a checklist , she says , adding , the new test is going to be scored as a first draft so then how do we finish the process \? my fear is that the draft is where we could end up but i do think the new test does reflect what s going on in the classroom more than the old research paper it s more like the kind of essay you might actually have to write in an exam it will take years before we know whether the college board s experiment has had any effect on the way americans write , and even then the evidence will most likely be ambiguous in the meantime , the danger of a dumbeddown writing curriculum at better schools seems partly offset by the fact that writing will now be taught , or paid lip service to , in schools where it has not received much attention even the fiveparagraph formula essay is better than no essay at all nor does it seem a bad idea for students to pay a little more attention to the mechanics of grammar and usage , though good grammar is not necessarily a guarantee of good writing \( a number of professional teachers organizations have actively opposed the formal teaching of grammar , in fact , on the ground that worrying about correctness discourages a student s creativity \) as for the more immediate application of the sat as a tool for beleaguered admissions officers trying to select an incoming freshman class the new test may have an interesting and unintended consequence a great deal of highpriced admissions counseling and application strategizing these days is all about polishing and packaging the applicant about creating on paper a student who presents an airbrushed and thematically enhanced version of him or herself henceforth , an admissions officer confronted by such a portfolio , and especially by an application essay that seems suspiciously smooth and well turned , has at his disposal a new tool with the press of a button , he can call onto his screen the very essay the student wrote for the sat under pressure and without spell check and grammar check he can look over a student in the unvarnished , roughdraft version , which in a way is what the college board has promised to provide sample essay topic a sense of happiness and fulfillment , not personal gain , is the best motivation and reward for one s achievements expecting a reward of wealth or recognition for achieving a goal can lead to disappointment and frustration if we want to be happy in what we do in life , we should not seek achievement for the sake of winning wealth

the notion that stan van gundy s miami heat would qualify for the playoffs before jeff van gundy s houston rockets was laughable a few months ago , even a few weeks ago but that is exactly what has happened while the surging heat entered the weekend fighting for homecourt advantage in the first round of the eastern conference playoffs , the reeling rockets needed a tense 106103 victory friday night against denver to claim the postseason slot that once seemed a sure bet behind the stifling defense that has come to characterize jeff van gundy s teams , the rockets were 13 games over 500 on march 13 but that defense suddenly turned porous , causing houston to lose 9 of its next 12 games , including five straight , before wednesday s victory over the struggling clippers the rockets lost again last night , 8269 to the jazz the late collapse had put the rockets in jeopardy of becoming the first team to miss the playoffs after being 10 games over 500 with less than nine games remaining since the current playoff format was instituted in 198384 we 're not playing as hard , said van gundy , whose team allowed 98 points a game during its fivegame losing streak it wrenches my gut there s plenty of blame to go around right now , and it starts with me i 've got to get the team playing better the rockets' recent struggles were the latest for van gundy , the former knicks coach who made the transition from the broadcasting booth , as an analyst for tnt , to his first season with houston accustomed to the laidback approach of rudy tomjanovich , the rockets , particularly the starting guards , steve francis and cuttino mobley , were initially taken aback by van gundy s intensity last week , francis said that players were playing too tight because they were afraid of making mistakes mobley said we did n't buy in right away we bumped heads a little bit steve and i came in with rudy and we spent five years with him , so he was like a father figure so to have somebody new come in was a process but jeff s a great dude he s passionate , and he s actually a funny , funny guy he s like smartalecky van gundy found nothing funny about a controversy involving francis , a threetime allstar guard , on super bowl sunday after francis missed the team s flight from houston to phoenix , van gundy said francis told him he had skipped the flight to attend the super bowl , which was held in houston van gundy suspended francis for the next night s game at phoenix francis and his agent , jeff fried , denied van gundy s account , saying that francis was tending to a family issue and did not attend the super bowl to this day , the two sides have yet to agree on what happened but van gundy and francis deny any disagreement exists i do n't have a problem at all with steve , van gundy said last week i think steve has worked diligently to try to be what i want him to be but you 're never going to go through a season without disagreements everybody wants to harken back to the missed planesuper bowl thing , and to me , that s a blip on the radar screen i did what i thought i had to do , and that was it asked if the disagreement would lead to an offseason trade of francis , van gundy said , absolutely not francis is averaging about 16 points a game on 40 percent shooting , both career lows but he is in the playoffs for the first time in his fiveyear career if i ever look at my season individually , that would be selfish because the years when i did do a lot of scoring and a lot of things individually i was looked at as a person who looks for numbers , francis said now that my points are down , and my team is in a great position , i'm definitely happy with that as far as me and jeff , i do n't really see anything people can assume whatever they want i'm just going to concentrate on our goal , and that s to help our team win he s given me an excellent game plan to help our team win me and coach are on the same page as far as the progress of this team the question heading into the weekend was if the rockets were still progressing a busy summer awaits this summer could be one of the most active in recent memory , with several bigname players on the move kobe bryant has said he will opt out of his contract with the los angeles lakers to test free agency , and philadelphia \( allen iverson \) , toronto \( vince carter \) and houston \( francis \) have reasons to shop their superstars if sacramento fizzles in the playoffs , chris webber could be put on the trading block , and with tracy mcgrady able to opt out of his contract after next season , orlando might entertain offers for him mcgrady , a native of florida , sounds as if he wants to stay in orlando , but he said he would understand if the magic sought to trade him if they feel that i'm going to leave , then obviously they do n't want to lose me for nothing , so it would be in their best interest to trade me , said mcgrady , who will win his second straight scoring title i would be cool with that , but hopefully it s a mutual thing where if that does occur both parties will be on the same page mcgrady said he would tell the magic if he planned to leave , so the team could search for a trade partner rather than lose him for nothing i definitely do n't want to just leave and have them not gain anything because they 've helped me grow into the person that i am and i have a lot of respect for the organization , he said farm team not for milicic one reason commissioner david stern wants to turn the nba s developmental league into a baseballstyle minor league is to help young players like detroit s darko milicic who fail to earn meaningful minutes as rookies under stern s plan , milicic , the second pick of the draft , could play for detroit s farm team and be called up by the pistons when they felt he was ready to contribute but milicic wants no part of such a system i never would want to play in the nbdl , he said i 'd rather play in europe because europe has good leagues with really good players i do n't want to say that there s no good players in the nbdl , but it s not for me if i'm over here , i want to play in nba road less traveled to mvp minnesota s kevin garnett appears to be headed for his first most valuable player award should he win , garnett , the league s leading rebounder and one of the top scorers , would become the first player who entered the nba out of high school to win the award since moses malone won it for the third time in 198283 besides the reigning most valuable player , tim duncan of the spurs , none of the other three leading candidates jermaine o'neal of the pacers , peja stojakovic of the kings and kobe bryant played college basketball
when steve stone , an unlikely 25game winner , won the american league cy young award in 1980 , he earned a 10 , 000 bonus what on earth was steve stone doing with a contract provision calling for a bonus if he won the cy young award \? when he signed the contract with baltimore as a free agent two years earlier , stone had a 6772 career record , hardly credentials for projecting an award winner a bonus for a winning season would have made more sense , stone had said en route to the award it was like an insurance salesman telling you , 'we 'll give you 50 , 000 if an elephant falls on you , ' because he knows darn well an elephant is n't going to fall on you hank peters , then the orioles' general manager , offered the bonus provision to several of his pitchers , hoping it would serve as an inducement to perform more effectively today general managers routinely include contract provisions for award bonuses star packages , they 're called not as inducements but as a way of placating star players for whom their enormous salaries and signing bonuses are n't enough just last week , barry bonds and vladimir guerrero each gained a 500 , 000 bonus for winning his league s most valuable player award bonds s salary and prorated share of his signing bonus totaled 18 million this year , guerrero s 11 million a year ago , alex rodriguez , the man with the 252 million contract , was the al mvp and earned a 500 , 000 bonus on top of his 22 million guaranteed income for the year it s one thing for a losing pitcher to win a 10 , 000 bonus on top of his 175 , 000 salary it s quite another for players of the magnitude and salaries of bonds and rodriguez to win bonuses of any amount are they not being paid millions in salaries for performing like most valuable players , whether or not they win the award \? you 're supposed to deliver an mvp or cy young performance , or be in the top vote getters that s the basic principle , brian cashman , the yankees' general manager , said since assuming his position in 1998 , cashman said , he has not included star packages in player contracts , and he has signed some of the biggest contracts in baseball history agents respect our practice , he said if they know you do n't do it and you 've had a series of years where you 've enforced that , no one questions it when gary sheffield signed with the yankees last winter , he left behind atlanta and a contract that included star bonuses but he had none with the yankees , so he did n't earn extra money when he finished second last week in the mvp voting nevertheless , even the yankees have to pay the bonuses at times we 've inherited those clauses from trades , cashman said everyone makes individual choices after a hardfought negotiation , it s a gimme but in the big contracts , i do n't understand it one of those inherited contracts belongs to rodriguez , but the yankees did n't have to pay him an mvp bonus this year because he finished 15th in the voting rodriguez gets a bonus not only if he wins the award , but also if he finishes in the top 10 with the texas rangers , whose owner , tom hicks , gave him the star package , rodriguez received 200 , 000 for finishing second and 50 , 000 for finishing sixth this year , maybe he should give money back for not finishing in the top 10 doug melvin , now in milwaukee , was the rangers' general manager when they signed rodriguez giving him the award bonuses was a case of every other star player gets them , so why does n't he get them \? melvin said , quoting the agent manny ramirez has a similar arrangement with boston on mvp voting he earned a 100 , 000 bonus for finishing third in the voting last week ramirez s guaranteed income for this year 225 million i would n't begrudge anyone those bonuses if they were the product of goodfaith negotiation , said theo epstein , who became the red sox' general manager two years after ramirez signed his eightyear , 160 million contract we have our own club philosophy , but i do n't discuss it publicly but epstein added the player s base salary is for the player to go out and perform we try to use incentives in situations where they make sense mvp bonuses are not the only ones ramirez makes among his others , he has earned 100 , 000 each of the last four years for winning the silver slugger award , given to the best hitters at each position if bonuses are meant to serve as incentives , it would make more sense if ramirez had a bonus clause for getting a gold glove award for defense but he would never win that one , so his agent did n't even ask for it randy johnson had a fouryear contract with arizona , covering 1999 through 2002 , that paid him a guaranteed 494 million but the diamondbacks also gave him a total of 225 million in bonuses for winning the cy young award in each of those four years this year , johnson earned a 150 , 000 bonus for finishing second in the voting bonds has lucrative bonus potential well beyond the 90 million guaranteed in his fiveyear contract in each of the past three seasons , the san francisco giants have paid him 500 , 000 for being the national league mvp , 100 , 000 for being on the allstar team and 50 , 000 for being a silver slugger in addition , in two of the past three years they have paid him 100 , 000 for winning the hank aaron award ramirez won the al aaron award this year but received no bonus for it somehow his agent overlooked that award most valuable runnersup the yankees have won 18 mvp awards , more than any other team in the major leagues they have not won the award , however , in 19 years , not in any of their four recent world series championship seasons , not in their run of seven successive division championships , not during their streak of 10 consecutive postseason appearances don mattingly was the last member of the yankees to win the award he did it in 1985 in the 19 years since , the yankees have had three players finish second in the voting by the 28member panel of the baseball writers association of america mattingly in 1986 , tino martinez in '97 and gary sheffield this year but the closest any george steinbrenner employee has come to winning in that period was last year jorge posada finished 48 points behind alex rodriguez , then with texas , in placing third only two other yankees have finished less than 100 points behind the winner sixthplace derek jeter in 1999 , 75 points behind ivan rodriguez , and secondplace mattingly in '86 , 81 points behind roger clemens in three years , 1990 through 1992 , 70 players received votes on the 10line ballots , none of them yankees bonds the disciplinarian when he won his seventh most valuable player award last week , barry bonds said he never thought he would have a chance to win any awards because he had been walked so frequently but the walks have become an intriguing part of bonds s career how , he was asked , is he able to concentrate with all of the balls he sees \? it s getting a lot harder , he said i try to explain to players it s a lot harder to walk than hit a ground ball and jog back to the dugout teams wear me down i know they do it intentionally it s not something you want to do for 162 games , or 140 some that i played in you need discipline to do that , or you need a manager to give you a day or two off in accepting walks and not swinging at pitches close to the strike zone , bonds has demonstrated remarkable discipline i 've been that way my whole life , even when i was a younger player , he said i 've always been a disciplined hitter , since i 've been in college i learned that with jeff pentland in college , and i learned that from my father , who struck out a lot i wanted to be a contact hitter , unlike my father i did n't want to strike out a lot among other topics , bonds also talked about his ability to perform so well at age 40 my dad was an alcoholic , he said of bobby bonds a lot of players in those days drank and stayed out late if they had kept themselves healthy , our numbers probably would n't compare i think a lot of them would have played in their 40 s would their numbers have exceeded ours \? probably on baseball correction november 27 , 2004 , saturday a sports picture caption in some copies on sunday with the on baseball column , about player bonuses , misidentified the two players shown alex rodriguez was at the left , not the right the player at the right was barry bonds \( not bobby , his late father , who was also mentioned in the column \)
calagero s is no firecracker , but it has enough sparkle to light up its franklin avenue block in garden city it s the kind of italian restaurant every neighborhood needs a casual cafe with friendly hailfellowwellmet waiters , good food and reasonable \( for the most part \) prices the look is familiar a long , narrow storefront with bare wood floors , white butcher paper over tablecloths , a service bar up front and butteryellow walls punctuated with brightly colored , framed posters \( cinzano and others \) original to this restaurant are rows of framed , blackandwhite snapshots of the calagero family from past decades motioning to one , our waiter pointed out the owner s father on the day of his high school graduation on a busy saturday , service was super speedy , accurate and concerned midweek , the chatty fellow we drew needed a nudge to refill water glasses , bring more bread and rescue the soft drink we had ordered , which had been languishing on the bar for 10 minutes as is frequently the case at italian restaurants , appetizers were the best course a couple of salads were standouts baby spinach blessed with marinated artichoke hearts , roasted peppers , ovenroasted tomatoes , gorgonzola cheese and pignoli nuts in a mustard vinaigrette and warm portobellos over baby greens , with justcooked green beans , ovenroasted tomatoes , sliced carrots and walnuts the caesar , though , was merely routine slices of panseared tuna were served rare , paired with a green salad that was dressed in a tangy strawberry vinaigrette the combination did n't sound appealing , but it worked we also liked a special napoleon of fresh mozzarella layered with tomatoes , roasted peppers , portobello mushrooms and prosciutto two italian restaurant mainstays were way above par at calagero s bruschetta and hot antipasto the first consisted of six warm slices of toasted tuscan bread with a flavorpacked topping of diced tomatoes , tiny cubes of fresh mozzarella , garlic , basil and romano cheese the antipasto was not the usual soggy mismatched suspects but four yummy partners two warm grilled shrimp , tender crispy calamari rings , fried mozzarella enlivened with sundried tomatoes , and basil and eggplant rollatine , which was extremely light with more spinach than cheese in the filling all main courses were priced in the teens except one seafood pasta and an entree of blackened tuna \( each 21 \) so it was no wonder that we suffered sticker shock when the bill listed a special of filet mignon \( an ordinary steak with gorgonzola crust \) at 33 on a return visit , rack of lamb , another special , was also overpriced at 33 better than either were the veal milanese \( 17 \) from the menu , a crispy cutlet topped with chopped salad with roasted new potatoes on the plate , and a special of softshell crabs \( 24 \) with two big crunchy crabs drizzled with a red pepper aioli and set upon an arugula salad bolstered with julienne strips of cucumber , roasted red peppers , cherry tomatoes and three grilled scallops panroasted salmon , however , was overcooked , and breast of chicken scarpariello was like none other i 've ever seen it consisted of two cutlets topped with a few slices of sausage , all in a tasteless brown balsamicthyme sauce the two pastas that we tried got thumbs up but did n't blow us away an economical bowl of spaghetti in a pomodoro sauce crowned with four big meatballs \( 12 \) and a fettuccine special \( 19 \) of four tender clams \( in the shell \) , four scallops and sundried tomatoes in a creamy pink vodka sauce desserts , a mix of housemade and commercial , all made the grade creamy new york cheesecake with a smooth , freshtasting strawberry sauce an especially toothsome tiramis the familiar but still

huangmengying , china wang lincheng began his accounting at the brick hut of a farmer dead of cancer , he said flatly , his dress shoes sinking in the mud dead of cancer , he repeated , glancing at another vacant house mr wang , head of the communist party in this village , ignored a june rain and trudged past mudbrick houses , ticking off other deaths , other empty homes he did not seem to notice a small cornfield where someone had dug a burial mound of fresh red dirt finally , he stopped at the door of a sickened young mother her home was beside a stream turned greenishblack from dumping by nearby factories polluted water that had contaminated drinking wells cancer had been rare when the stream was clear , but last year cancer accounted for 13 of the 17 deaths in the village all the water we drink around here is polluted , mr wang said you can taste it it s acrid and bitter now the victims are starting to come out , people dying of cancer and tumors and unusual causes the stream in huangmengying is one tiny canal in the huai river basin , a vast system that has become a grossly polluted waste outlet for thousands of factories in central china there are 150 million people in the huai basin , many of them poor farmers now threatened by water too toxic to touch , much less drink pollution is pervasive in china , as anyone who has visited the smogchoked cities can attest on the world bank s list of 20 cities with the worst air , 16 are chinese but leaders are now starting to clean up major cities , partly because urbanites with rising incomes are demanding better air and water in beijing and shanghai , officials are forcing out the dirtiest polluters to prepare for the 2008 olympics by contrast , the countryside , home to twothirds of china s population , is increasingly becoming a dumping ground local officials , desperate to generate jobs and tax revenues , protect factories that have polluted for years refineries and smelters forced out of cities have moved to rural areas so have some foreign companies , to escape regulation at home the losers are hundreds of millions of peasants already at the bottom of a society now sharply divided between rich and poor they are farmers and fishermen who depend on land and water for their basic existence in july and august , officials measured an 82mile band of polluted water moving through the huai basin china rates its waterways on a scale of 1 to 5 , with 5 being too toxic even to touch this water was rated 5 for fishermen , it may as well have been poison if i had wanted to , i could have gone on the river and filled a boat with dead fish , said song dexi , 64 , a fisherman in yumin it was smelly , like toilet water all our fish and shrimp died we do n't have anything to live on now the huai was supposed to be a communist party success story ten years ago , the central government vowed to clean up the basin after a pollution tide killed fish and sickened thousands of people three years ago , a top chinese official called the cleanup a success but the huai is now a symbol of the failure of environmental regulation in china the central government promotes big solutions but gives regulators little power to enforce them local officials have few incentives to crack down on polluters because their promotion system is based primarily on economic growth , not public health it is a game that leaves poorer , rural regions clinging to the worst polluters no doubt there is an economic food chain , and the lower you are , the worse off your environmental problems are likely to be , said elizabeth c economy , author of the river runs black \( cornell university press , 2004 \) , a study of china s environment one city after the next is offloading its polluting industries outside its city limits , and polluting industries themselves are seeking poorer areas china is facing an ecological and health crisis heavy air pollution contributes to respiratory illnesses that kill up to 300 , 000 people a year , many in cities but also in rural areas , the world bank estimates liver and stomach cancer , linked in some studies to water pollution , are among the leading causes of death in the countryside over the past 20 years in china , there has been a singleminded focus on economic growth with the belief that economic growth can solve all problems , said pan yue , the outspoken deputy director of china s state environmental protection administration but this has left environmental protection badly behind too poor to flee , or to get well few places bear that out more than eastern henan province , which includes huangmengying the isolated region has tanneries , paper mills and other highpolluting industries dumping directly into the rivers one of the biggest polluters is the lianhua gourmet powder company , china s largest producer of monosodium glutamate , or msg , the flavor enhancer but the company s political influence is so vast that environmental regulators who have tried to challenge the company have done so in vain the huai river basin has neither the history of the yellow river nor the mystique of the yangtze yet the huai , with its spider s web of canals and broad tributaries , irrigates a huge swath of china s agricultural heartland farmers once spent lifetimes tilling the same plot of corn or wheat but in the past decade , millions of farmers , unable to earn a living from the land , have left henan for migrant work in cities , leaving behind villages of old people and young mothers one of those mothers is kong heqin , 30 , who was the last stop on mr wang s cancer tour in june she stumbled into her dirt courtyard , disheveled and groggy from an afternoon nap her face was bloated and her legs were swollen she had already had three operations for cancer , and new tumors were growing in her large intestine earlier in the year , doctors had prescribed chemotherapy but treatments cost 500 a series , nearly a year s income she had borrowed 250 to pay spring school fees for her two sons , and she worried that chemotherapy would drain the family s meager resources away from her children so she stopped chemotherapy we 've wasted so much money on medical treatment , she said i think the best thing would be to give up on it her rising medical bills were one reason her husband left a few years ago for construction work in a northern metropolis , tianjin he returns twice a year to plant or harvest crops on good months , he sends home 60 , but ms kong says months go by with nothing in the mail her illness shapes family life her elderly mother tends her husband s fields because she is too weak her sons wash the clothes she grows a ragged garden in her courtyard because the pesticides coating vegetables at local markets make her sick the plate of boiled eggs on her dresser was a gift from sympathetic relatives asked about pollution , she seemed confused , as if unaware of the concept but she has noticed that her well water smells bad and has changed in taste she knows that others are sick , too there s a family next door with a case of cancer , she said but they do n't like to talk about it people here are scared to talk about these things epidemiological research for cancer in the huai basin is scant none has been done in huangmengying nor does any scientific evidence prove that pollution is causing the rising cancer rate what is clear is the wide range of pollutants , from fertilizer runoff to the dumping of factory wastes but dr zhao meiqin , chief of radiology at the county hospital , said cancer cases in the area rose sharply after heavy industry arrived in the 1980 s and 90 s before , the area had about 10 cases a year now , in a year , there are hundreds of cases , she said , putting the number as high as 400 , mostly stomach and intestinal tumors originally , most of the patients were in their 50 s and 60 s but now it tends to strike earlier i 've even treated one patient who is only 7 dr zhao said most cancer patients came from villages close to the factories along the shaying river , a major tributary in the huai basin mr wang , the village party chief , also said the highest concentrations of cancer were found in the homes closest to the village stream , which draws its water directly from the shaying polluters hiding in plain sight health problems began appearing slowly in the early 1990 s mr wang said he learned that the water was severely polluted after an environmental official came on a personal visit farmers also began complaining that their fields were producing less grain because of polluted irrigation water today , pollution corrodes daily life here farmers too poor to buy bottled water instead drink well water that curdles with scum when it is boiled xiao junhai is 57 but looks two decades older in june , he shivered under a quilt in a dark room , summer flies flitting at his head , cancer knotting his stomach he could not lift himself from his crude bed i grew up drinking the water here , and i still drink it , he said i do n't know what pollution is , but i do know it means the water is bad his daughter , xiao li , 24 , anguished over the dilemma that her father s illness had thrust upon her she says her father takes traditional chinese remedies and eats rice porridge because the family cannot afford treatment if she returned to her migrant job on the coast , in hangzhou , she might earn enough money to pay for it but no one else can care for him so she has stayed the water in the river used to be clean , but now it s black and changing colors all the time , she said the water is being destroyed the lianhua gourmet powder company is based in xiangcheng , upstream from huangmengying it is the area s largest employer , with more than 8 , 000 workers , and the largest taxpayer in xiangcheng for henan province , lianhua gourmet is a signature company , the biggest producer of msg in china an analysis by a chinese credit rating service , xinhua far east , found that in 2001 the factory produced more than 133 , 000 tons of msg and has plans to raise production to 200 , 000 tons under any circumstances , the company s sheer size would translate into significant political clout but lianhua , basically , is the government lianhua is traded on the shanghai stock exchange , but according to the credit analysis , its majority stockholder is a holding company owned by the xiangcheng city government this type of governmentcontrolled enterprise is not unusual in china , but the potential for a conflict of interest is glaring the production of msg leaves potentially harmful byproducts , including ammonia nitrate and other pollutants that are supposed to be treated to meet environmental standards a damning report last year by the state environmental protection administration blamed local officials for lax enforcement the report said lianhua had dumped 124 , 000 tons of untreated water every day through secret channels connected to the xiangcheng city sewage system the water eventually flowed into the shaying river , almost quadrupling pollution levels this constitutes a grave threat to the lives and livelihoods of people downstream , the report stated officials at lianhua did not respond to repeated written and telephone requests for interviews neither did officials in xiangcheng nor with henan province but one retired local communist party official said party cadres had always protected lianhua he said a soninlaw of a lianhua chief executive once even headed the city s environmental protection bureau there are a lot of officials who do n't care about pollution , said the official , who asked not to be identified some leaders are just interested in making money he said the company often broke promises about cleaning up what they said and what they did were different things , he said they even said they would stop production if they were n't able to meet pollution standards but they never did that a stream of black water this june , a reporter saw a noxious liquid flowing from a waste outlet into a stream near a lianhua factory on the outskirts of xiangcheng a sign above the outlet said , lianhua company , no3 waste outlet another sign said the outlet was under the oversight of the city environmental bureau the acrid smell was so strong that it was difficult to stand nearby less than a mile downstream from the waste outlet , wang haiqing watched his seven goats chew on weeds mr wang lived on the other side of the stream , in wangguo , and said several neighbors had contracted cancer or other intestinal ailments he said his goats vomited if they drank from the blackened water to reach clean drinking water , he said villagers must dig wells 130 feet deep most cannot afford to do so it s been so polluted by the msg factory , said mr wang , 60 it tastes metallic even after you boil it and skim the stuff off it but it s the only water we have to drink and to use for cooking the rains of june in huangmengying had given way to boiling humidity by the middle of august mr wang , the village chief , wore shorts and sandals as he again walked beside the village stream he said four more people had died since june , two of cancer but much had also changed in the two months the 10th anniversary of the government s promise to clean up the huai had become a major embarrassment for the communist party roughly 8 billion had been spent to improve the basin , but the state environmental protection administration concluded this year that some areas were more polluted than before china s press , often given freer rein on environmental issues , published critical articles over the summer the newspaper operated by the state environmental protection administration blamed local officials for allowing powerful companies , including lianhua , to continue polluting even tiny huangmengying got attention a crew from state television visited in july officials , fearing a humiliating expos , hurriedly started digging a deeper well for the village but the gesture was dwarfed by what henan officials did for lianhua for more than a year , the company had been in financial trouble , suffering from bad investments and a slowdown in the msg market for months , banks pressured it for roughly 217 million in unpaid loans the henan province government stepped into the breach the henan governor , li chengyu , organized a meeting at lianhua headquarters in july to devise a plan to save the company the henan government also gave the company more than 25 million the government is confident and the business is confident that lianhua gourmet can be brought around , mr li said , according to the chinese financial press the banks should support lianhua gourmet the signal was clear henan s government would make certain lianhua survived in huangmengying , mr wang again visited ms kong , the young mother with cancer , who was also struggling to survive her resolve in june to forego chemotherapy had withered with her health by august she was pale and coughing as she explained that she had again borrowed money for more treatment she would leave in a few days but it meant that she could not pay her sons' school fees for the fall semester her husband could not find work and had no money to send and the friends who had loaned her money said they could loan her no more i'm scared , she said only an hour earlier , mr wang had been walking to visit ms kong when a woman rushed toward him and knelt in a formal kowtow , touching her lips against the dirt her husband had dropped dead doctors had examined the body and discovered a tumor she needed mr wang to help with funeral arrangements he asked where she and her husband lived in a small brick hut , about 50 yards from the village stream , answered the woman , liu sumei ms liu , 50 , led mr wang to a friend s home , where her husband s body lay in a coffin under a large poster of mao zedong ms liu had not known her husband had cancer , only that he was in poor health but in huangmengying , she said , poor health is not unusual every family has someone who is sick , she said all the neighbors the great divide articles in this series are examining the widening gap between the rural poor and urban rich that has made china , the world s fastestgrowing economy , also one of its most unequal societies the first article , and an audio report by jim yardley , are online at nytimescom world

we call it dodoland because that s where she s able to compensate she does whatever she has to in order to control the point drop shot , slice , you name it if her shoulder hurts and she ca n't serve overhand , she 'll serve underhand ailments and adjustments aside , cheney is the topranked american woman in the supersenior age group , 85 and over , a distinction she has achieved again and again , through a remarkable tennis tale touching the turn of two centuries cheney s mother , may sutton bundy , won wimbledon in 1905 and 1907 , the united states championships in 1904 and was elected to the hall of fame in 1956 her daughter , nicknamed dodo by a garbling baby brother , was the first american woman to win the australian open precursor , the australian national championships , in 1938 world war ii cut short her singles career , then came raising a family and eventually middle age , which she laughed at by beginning a run of united states tennis association senior titles that now exceeds 300 as i 've grown older , i 've grown much more competitive , cheney said i really love to win no slowdown or semiretirement for cheney , who hurt her back almost four decades ago , at 50 , the prime age for the classic recreational surrender , from backhand to bogey instead , cheney embarked on a regimen of back exercises , which she continues , morning and night , so she may keep moving , competing , roaming , the united states and abroad for her , tennis really is a game for life the best way to get dodo cheney s attention , christine putnam says , is to engage her in competition board game word jumble tennis match two years ago , they won the national supersenior grasscourt motherdaughter championship playing doubles with dodo was like slipping into a glove , she said and we thought jack mckeon , sitting on his 72yearold derriere in the florida marlins' dugout last fall , was some senior stud we argued that 47yearold martina navratilova proved herself at wimbledon to be the most devoted tennis player in the history of the sport put it this way i play 10 tournaments a year and dodo plays more than i do , said cheney s son , brian , a former college no 1 at the university of arizona and a teaching pro just last year , his sister , may , accompanied their mother to a tournament in austria , which was a radical departure from dodo cheney s stateside routine of traveling with an entourage of none she has outlived three brothers and her husband , arthur , a former pilot for western airlines , who arranged a lifetime pass for his wife to accommodate her tennis travels no reservation , no cellphone , just a suitcase and a no 1 seeding for this octogenarian flying standby she ca n't get on a flight , she just waits around the airport for the next one , christine putnam said she s gone so much , i ca n't worry about her i 'd drive myself crazy and she s not going to let anything stop her tennis has been her life how to define such a life , beyond induction into the hall of fame in the masters category \? christine putnam and brian cheney offer the title , life as a game dodo cheney s game , though not one that reduces her to the role of spectator in a recent telephone interview , she conceded that she had watched only a little bit of sharapova s spectacular wimbledon breakout , a sort of inverse story to her own she admitted to not closely following a women s professional tour that has evolved into something very different from what she knew when she s not on the road , this genuine classic from the purely amateur days of yore lives within walking distance of her tennis club i'm too busy , dodo cheney said
the interrogation effort at abu ghraib prison in iraq took on such urgency last fall that untrained personnel were pressed into service as analysts and even interrogators , according to accounts spelled out in documents and interviews the pace accelerated last december , after the capture of saddam hussein , which led to a neardoubling of the number of twoperson tiger teams assigned to an interrogation center at the prison , which operated under the control of lt gen ricardo s sanchez s top deputy for intelligence the accounts depict a highpressure environment at the prison , particularly within the interrogation center , where military intelligence personnel exerted substantial influence over a cellblock where most of the notorious abuses at abu ghraib apparently took place in interviews , some soldiers who served in military intelligence units at the prison said the sense of urgency contributed to the loosened standards and the abuses that followed when you let people take power in their own hands , it s going to happen , said a soldier who served as a military intelligence analyst at the prison there was no higher authority really the accounts are among the first from military intelligence personnel at the prison , and they include acknowledgments by some of those soldiers that the military intelligence units , as well as the military police , may have played a role in the abuses they were given in interviews with the new york times , or in statements to army investigators that were obtained by the times , by people who served under the overall command of the 205th military intelligence brigade , a unit based in germany under col thomas m pappas , the highestranking activeduty officer known to be under scrutiny in army investigations into the abuses some of the accounts identified lt col steve jordan , the director of the interrogation center , as an officer who gave military intelligence officers and the military police a great deal of latitude when the red cross said that the place was not well run , he said , 'it s better than it was under saddam , ' sgt samuel provance , of the 302nd military intelligence battalion , said of colonel jordan an army report by maj gen antonio m taguba has identified colonel jordan as among two officers and two civilian contractors who were directly or indirectly responsible for the abuses at the prison the interrogation center at abu ghraib focused its efforts on iraqis identified as security prisoners who might have knowledge about the fighting against american troops but military and civilian intelligence officials have said that the interrogation center produced little valuable information about who was fighting , how they were organized and other details the degree to which the pace of interrogations at abu ghraib intensified through december and into january , after the capture of mr hussein on dec 13 , had not previously been known most of the publicized photographs of abuses appear to have been taken in october or november , but the one army report to have been made public says abuses continued through december by early january , the number of interrogation teams at the center had gone from about 16 to 30 , all to help run down leads about the opposition , said a senior army officer who served in iraq these tiger teams consisted of an interrogator and an intelligence analyst , who would usually be accompanied by a translator during interrogations while two facilities containing special interrogation booths with twoway mirrors were built at the prison , interrogations were often conducted in stairwells , showers and in the cellblock itself , officers and soldiers said members of the 372nd military police company , which guarded the cellblock , remain the only personnel charged with crimes in connection with the abuses during its service in iraq , the 205th brigade was unusually large , made up of eight battalions and an additional company , more than double its normal threebattalion complement colonel pappas , who is now with his brigade in germany , and colonel jordan , now assigned to the american headquarters in iraq , have both declined interview requests through spokesmen all fall , said sergeant provance , personnel just started coming faster and faster , there was more and more stuff , more expansion , and it just never slowed down most of the intelligence officers who worked in the interrogation center said they had been assigned to their posts in october or november , the period when the worst abuses are believed to have taken place , according to the documents and interviews we all came there because they were shorthanded , said the intelligence analyst , who asked that he not be identified none of us did the jobs we were trained for in written answers to questions posed by army investigators this year , after the abuses first became the subject of a criminal investigation , nearly all among at least three dozen soldiers and civilian translators assigned to the interrogation said they had never witnessed any acts of abuse or mistreatment while working at abu ghraib the answers , included in the documents obtained by the times , include denials of any knowledge from stephen stefanowicz and john b israel , civilian contractors who were identified in an army report as among four people who may have been directly or indirectly responsible for the abuses the taguba report said that denials by mr stefanowicz and mr israel had been contradicted by other witness statements but in other answers , some soldiers acknowledged having witnessed acts of abuse or maltreatment in an interview , the military intelligence analyst said he had seen iraqi prisoners stripped naked , by military police officers , who served as the guards in the cellblock , and by military intelligence personnel who oversaw the unit and served as interrogators a civilian linguist , identified as bakeer naseef , a jordanianamerican who was working as a security guard in austin , tex , before he began work as a translator in iraq , says in one written statement that he witnessed nudity , sexual approach , excessive language among what he regarded as acts of abuse or maltreatment at least two soldiers , including one officer , capt brent fitch of the 519th military intelligence battalion , described an incident of sexually tinged abuse against an iraqi woman by three enlisted members of the battalion , in which the woman was kissed and threatened with being left alone with a naked male prisoner those soldiers , who have not publicly been identified , were fined and demoted , the military has said sergeant provance , who has also spoken to other news organizations , was interviewed by telephone from germany last week you could n't keep track of who was from what unit it was really weird how many mi people were there , said sergeant provance , a technician who did internet and database maintenance for the interrogation center even the interrogators were encouraging the analysts to interrogate , and some of them some of them did lead interrogations within his own intelligence battalion , sergeant provance said , some enlisted soldiers with primarily technical expertise were moved from assignments in which they tracked vehicles on computer screens to new roles as intelligence analysts iraq update truce with rebels american forces and militiamen of a radical cleric who set off an uprising seven weeks ago agreed to stop fighting in najaf under a deal that keeps the militia intact but off the streets and requires a pullback of american troops page a10 ambushed politician gunmen fired on a convoy carrying a member of iraq s governing council aides said she escaped , but a bodyguard was killed and her son was missing after his car plunged into a canal page a10 more british troops defense minister geoff hoon said another 370 soldiers would be deployed to iraq , bringing the british contingent there to 8 , 900 britain is still considering whether to send thousands more troops page a10 deadly attack japanese officials were investigating reports that a car carrying two japanese civilians was attacked by gunmen and one person was killed if confirmed , it would be the first japanese death in iraq since two diplomats were killed in november
when the justice department opened an investigation a year ago into the question of how robert novak obtained the name of a covert central intelligence agency operative for publication in his syndicated column , we expressed two basic concerns the first was the need for an independent inquiry led by someone without attorney general john ashcroft s ultraclose ties to the white house that was addressed belatedly with the naming of a special prosecutor , patrick fitzgerald , to pursue the accusations that unnamed bush administration officials illegally leaked the woman s undercover role in an effort to stifle criticism of iraq policy by her husband , former ambassador joseph wilson iv unfortunately , our second , overriding fear has become a reality the focus of the leak inquiry has lately shifted from the bush white house , where it properly belongs , to an attempt to compel journalists to testify and reveal their sources in an ominous development for freedom of the press and government accountability that hits particularly close to home , a federal judge in washington has ordered a reporter for the new york times , judith miller , to testify before a grand jury investigating the disclosure of the covert operative s identity and to describe any conversations she had with a specified executive branch official the subpoena was upheld even though neither ms miller nor this newspaper had any involvement in the matter at hand the public naming of an undercover agent making matters worse , the newly released decision by judge thomas hogan takes the absolutist position that there is no protection whatsoever for journalists who are called to appear before grand juries this chilling rejection of both first amendment principles and evolving common law notions of a privilege protecting a reporter s confidential sources cries out for rejection on appeal , as does the undue secrecy surrounding the special prosecutor s filings in the case mr novak has refused to say whether he received a subpoena but other journalists have acknowledged getting subpoenas and some have testified about their contacts with i lewis libby , vice president dick cheney s chief of staff they say they did so based on his consent , but consent granted by government employees under a threat of dismissal hardly seems voluntary once again , none of these journalists were involved in the central issue the initial public identification of mr wilson s wife if an official at the white house intentionally triggered publication of the name of a cia operative to undermine mr wilson s credibility and silence criticism of iraq policy , it was a serious abuse of power the legacy of the investigation should not be a perverse legal precedent that makes it easy for prosecutors to undo a reporter s pledge of confidentiality , thereby discouraging people with knowledge of real abuses to blow the whistle to the press
mahwah even after the sun had sunk behind the hills , the brooksbanks waited patiently in a line that snaked around the bill bradley sports and recreation center the new jersey nets or what is left of them were holding an open practice at ramapo college here when kim brooksbank overheard another fan saying he thought the team would perform ok this year , she answered with a bitter hah ! i think it s going to be a really tough year , said brooksbank , a 41yearold seasonticket holder from new city , ny , who remembers watching the team play on the rutgers campus in piscataway she shepherded her three children and a friend into the building they 're basically starting from scratch , she complained not exactly scratch , but the changes have been so sweeping that fans have been left confused about which of their favorite players are still on the team not to mention who owns the franchise and how long the team will be playing on this side of the hudson in january , bruce ratner , a real estate magnate , led a group that bought the nets for 300 million beating out a bid offered by senator jon s corzine and charles kushner , a new jerseybased real estate developer with the intention of moving the team lock , stock and backboard from the meadowlands to a disputed swath of property in brooklyn fans of the nets who were never really in such great supply to begin with are reeling by events my favorite player is jason kidd , said sean , brooksbank s 11yearold son second favorite is richard jefferson but he s gone did n't he mean kenyon martin \? oh , yeah , martin when the nets open their season on nov 3 against a miami heat team led by shaquille o'neal , fans might be forgiven for wondering what happened to their team consider this over the summer , just months after winning its third consecutive atlantic division title , the nets jettisoned martin , their allstar power forward , and quickly traded their most reliable outside shooter , kerry kittles , and then released two of their backups in all , they lost four of their top six scorers from a season ago kidd , the allstar point guard around whom the team revolves , is out indefinitely with a knee injury , but his hurt goes beyond the physical privately he is seething , according to numerous reports publicly , he has not done a good job of hiding those feelings , comparing his situation to being dealt a bad poker hand and making nonetoosubtle statements about leaving the team i dream about it , kidd said recently , but i have n't asked to be traded even the team s chief executive , rod thorn , acknowledged in a burst of candor that the hemorrhaging of players would probably make the nets alsorans unless we get very fortunate , thorn said after trading martin , we are not going to be a championship contender no small words from a man who had the foresight to draft michael jordan enraged newspaper columnists and fans alike have called for a boycott of the team when tickets went on sale for single games , only a dozen people lined up outside continental airlines arena , far fewer than in past years and despite the talent drain and lameduck nature of the franchise , the nets raised ticket prices on many season ticket holders though the team has also offered a batch of 15 tickets for each game the marketing people for the new york knicks apparently more agile than some of the teams that organization has fielded recently were quick to pick up on this emotional void and began an aggressive campaign to woo gilted nets fans they targeted billboards , took out newspapers ads and sponsored youth basketball programs it could have been worse for the nets , of course the team came very close to being bought by kushner , who is awaiting sentencing next month for his conviction on federal tax fraud charges but who really captured the public s attention after having a prostitute seduce his brotherinlaw and sending his sister the pictures earlier this year , kushner , a major fundraiser for governor mcgreevey , had lobbied to get 25 million to make his bid more competitive , but mcgreevey declined this enraged kushner , who erupted in an expletivefilled rant aimed at the governor , people familiar with the conversation said as one state official in the negotiations said in a recent interview thank god we did n't do the deal because then we 'd be dealing with a guy who s going to jail ratner whose company , forest city ratner , is the new york times company s partner in developing the new times headquarters on eighth avenue in manhattan plans to move the team to a new arena in the prospect heights section of brooklyn along with 2 billion worth of housing , office and retail space to make matters worse , the limboladen nets could be stuck in the swamp for three or four years while a new arena is built , an interregnum that will all but insure a huge fan defection a concern of national basketball association officials the move to brooklyn is no slam dunk while state and city officials in new york are trying their best to smooth the way for the development of the frank gehrydesigned arena and residential complex , some neighborhood groups in brooklyn are planning to file a suit to stop ratner from developing the site in addition , in the spring the united states supreme court will heara case on the constitutionality of eminent domain , the seizure of private property for public use and the linchpin for this project in an interview last week , ratner said that if the brooklyn deal fell through , he would make do in new jersey i think it would be in a situation , we 'd probably rework the meadowlands or redo the arena somehow , he said i'm not as negative on the meadowlands as some think as for the summer purge , he insisted that it was not a costcutting thing but rather an unfortunate series of events yet through it all , most longsuffering fans have quietly accepted their fate unfortunately , i'm a nets fan , said bob peterson , a 12year seasonticket holder from fords , who attended the scrimmage in ramapo with his wife what am i going to do \? back to the same old nets back to what they used to be peterson paused , looked down at the floor and back up and said , nothing lasts forever , right \? for whatever reason , the nets never generated the kind of fan frenzy like sacramento or dallas , places that have recently begun enjoying success the hohum attitude from hohokus to secaucus to succasunna persisted , even after the nets excelled last year the team ranked 26 out of 29 in attendance a drop from the previous year and a woeful figure particularly for a team that finished first in its division three consecutive seasons many nets officials had assumed that the team s success would help fill the 20 , 174seat arena , but that has not been the case the nets managed only three sellouts last year , and an average attendance of 14 , 952 not surprisingly , players and coaches have been critical of the lack of support a year ago the former coach , byron scott , lashed out at fans who had been booing at a game and just two weeks ago kidd took a swipe at the fans , charging that despite the team s success , empty seats still abounded now , kidd said , nets management has an even bigger challenge they 're going to have to be pretty creative in marketing , he said with all the stuff that s gone on , there s not too much to sell even diehard fans like peterson , a retired lucent worker , was hardpressed to understand how one of the best teams in the league could not attract fans it amazed me that when they got good , they did n't draw , he said it s bizarre when jason kidd came , it was superexciting for most of their 37year existence , the nets have been inept at best , a laughingstock at worst this is a team that once had to cancel a playoff game in part because the circus was in town and needed to use the arena and in the 90 s , the team went so far as to pump canned crowd noise into the largely fanfree arena but much had changed over the last three years , and the team seemed to shake off its losing past anything seemed possible , even backtoback appearances in the nba finals most believed that an intact nets team could have challenged for the title again this year , and the new owner has taken the brunt of the abuse over the changes it s like any other major corporation , ms brooksbank said you have to cut overhead , and when you do that , you cut in the wrong places what s more important , cutting salary and expenses or winning games \? obviously , bruce ratner does n't know anything about basketball the ferocity of the fans' ire has stunned even a savvy businessman like ratner concerned by the negative coverage , the owner has met individually with many reporters who cover the team as ratner recently told the daily news personally , it was not the easiest summer , obviously , but we made it through it was tough but you know what , we made it through and i really think we are going to do well the nets practice in a brightly lit place called the champion center a neverending source of glee among reporters an anonymous , lowslung building nestled among a string of warehouses on an industrial stretch off route 17 on the first day of training camp a few weeks ago , players gathered and then stepped up to a microphone set up in a corner of the court each of the players sat under a banner commemorating the first of two titles the franchise won in 1974 , which proclaimed aba champions ny nets for many reporters , it was the first chance to speak to the players since the summer gutting the reporters smelled blood , and they peppered players and the coach alike relentlessly about the state of a team that will be minus twofifths of last season s starting lineup alonzo mourning , the seventime allstar center , who is recovering from a rare kidney disease that forced him to miss most of the last season , had nothing but unkind words for his employer asked if it would be difficult to play for a team that had indicated it did not want him at camp , he shot back is it going to make it more difficult to play \? to play where you 're not wanted \? you answer that nor was that all the reason why i came here was a , to win and b , to play with a great point guard , he said both of those factors are in question right now they 've taken a huge step backward from where they were i look at the decisions made behind all of it and i'm baffled by it gary sussman , the nets' vice president for public relations , was at that moment leaning against a wall near mourning sussman s mouth opened wide as a look of disbelief washed across his face \( he later insisted he was not surprised by what mourning said and was instead looking at a reporter \) even the coach , lawrence frank , said that he understood that there might be some fans who harbored cynicism and pessimism over the changes to the team still , not everything was negative that day richard jefferson , a forward whom the team resigned over the summer to a sixyear , 76million contract extension , insisted that the team would be a contender i'm insanely optimistic , jefferson said finally there was kidd , who smiled and spoke in his customary low drone that sounds as if he is just getting over a cold am i satisfied \? yeah , what can i do \? i'm an employee i mean , you can be a disgruntled employee or you can be a happy employee so i'm choosing to be a happy employee because i 've been blessed with the opportunity to play a great game he was not finished , however but we know we 're not going to win a championship this year or next year , he said i mean , not with the caliber of guys that we have right now for the next several days , the newspapers were filled with these remarks luckily for the nets , few sports fans probably noticed in the region s sports diet , the nets are probably the sixth or seventh course , an afterdinner mint , even on good days that may be a blessing this year indeed , the best thing that has happened to the nets this fall has been the jets , the giants and the yankees , who have drawn the attention away from the ugly noises coming out of east rutherford while kidd and mourning sounded as though they were leading a rebel faction on the team , most of the press was over in the bronx , covering the baseball playoffs the quotes about kidd s dreams of playing elsewhere and mourning s bafflement over the offseason moves were largely relegated to the back pages yet inexplicably , an advertisement has been on the radio for the past few months it s all about being here ! it s what your soul understands it s all about being here , the meadowlands ! huh \? all the while , local officials were reminding the nets of their impending obsolescence at a news conference that coincided with the team s first day of training camp they were trumpeting the lease for what is being called xanadu , a 13 billion entertainment , office , sports and shopping project that will be built in the parking lot around where the nets play bergen county officials proposed that some sort of entertainment complex be developed when it became apparent that the nets and the devils were desperate to move yet now , while the devils seem close to sealing a deal to move to newark , it is possible that if the nets do not go soon , the team may be trapped in the meadowlands , a strange purgatory in a place where they are not wanted , and a place they do not want to be george zoffinger , the president and chief executive of the new jersey sports and exposition authority , which oversees the site , said that even if the nets do not move before the team s lease runs out in 2008 , the new project could work around them we made sure that we segregated the arena , so we will always have the arena , zoffinger said in a recent interview we 'd like to have the teams stay in new jersey and stay in the facility a strange thing happened in new jersey over the past few years while having trouble luring fans to the arena , on the streets of newark , and paterson , bogota and pequannock , young men can be seen wearing jerseys that say nets instead of knicks after years of struggle and anonymity , the team had finally achieved a level of respectability one of those young men , aaron moore , a 16yearold basketball player from westfield , was with his mother at the nets' practice aaron , slumped low in his seat , was wearing a jersey with a large , blue 6 kenyon martin s number aaron , who said he had been really mad when he learned that his favorite player , martin , had been traded , sounded the bitter refrain of many here the owner s cheap , he said all he wants to do is move the team to new york in an appearance on the cable channel cnbc last february , ratner tried his best to explain that moving to brooklyn was not really an abandonment of new jersey first of all , new jersey fans are very important , he said this is a regional team , really , and it has to be recognized as that while it s moving to brooklyn , it does n't mean that it s not for the whole region the number of people who have a relationship to brooklyn or the city that live in new jersey is huge so the first thing is , we encourage new jersey fans to continue going second , once the team moves to a new arena , a new arena will attract a lot of new people maybe it is better to look to the children christina weingroff , 9 , who was sitting with a group of friends on the last row of rafters in ramapo , was asked whether the offseason moves by the team concerned her not really , christina responded as she looked out at the team fielding such marquee players as zoran planinic , awvee storey and damon buford they 're really good new jersey correction november 7 , 2004 , sunday an article on oct 24 about fading loyalty among fans and players of the new jersey nets , with the team planning to move to brooklyn , misstated the surname of one of the team s new players he is rodney buford , not damon
after many years of cleanshaven , allamerican affability , tom hanks has lately begun to explore the possibilities of facial hair and regional accents the harsh new england vowels of catch me if you can , for example , and also the thin mustache of road to perdition and the shaggy fouryear growth of cast away in the ladykillers , an uneven , prankish caper comedy by joel and ethan coen , he sports a resplendent old south vandyke , with orotund diction to match giddy with the joy of playing , at long last , a bona fide villain , mr hanks swans through the role of g h dorr , phd , a supposed professor of classics whose true vocation is crime , with a vaudevillian relish that would be unseemly if it were not contagious his laugh , issuing through what appears to be prosthetic \( and in any case none too clean \) teeth , is a stuttering whinny , and his mouth also unleashes a flood of florid mississippi nonsense hand on heart he reels off lines from edgar allan poe and paeans to the bygone glories of greece and rome to hear mr hanks pronounce the word cinquecento if this were a play you might need an umbrella is almost worth the price of the ticket since miller s crossing the coen brothers have frequently dabbled in an inimitable form of antiquarian pastiche , mining old styles and genres to remake movies that were never made in the first place the ladykillers , which follows last year s underrated neoscrewball intolerable cruelty , is an actual remake , transplanting alexander mackendrick s 1955 british farce into the rich topsoil of the american south there is , as ever , a strong argument for leaving the original alone it would be hard for any cast to measure up to one that included alec guinness and peter sellers but while this ladykillers is a bit of a throwaway , it does have its moments it starts on a high note , with a verbal barrage that is one of the funniest opening scenes since preston sturges s sullivan s travels , to which the coens paid homage in o brother where art thou marva munson , a devout africanamerican widow \( played with stereotypedestroying gusto by the amazing irma p hall \) , arrives at a smalltown sheriff s office in high dudgeon , complaining about young people and their hippetyhop music , much to the puzzlement of the impatient sheriff \( george wallace \) soon after , professor dorr arrives at the house mrs munson shares with her orange cat and a glowering portrait of her late husband , othar , inquiring about renting a room with the help of a raggedy crew of crooks absurdly masquerading as an amateur earlymusic ensemble he plans to dig a tunnel into the vault where proceeds from the local riverboat casino are kept the plans , as you might expect , are complicated both by mrs munson s inconvenient presence and by tensions within the gang of wouldbe master thieves pancake , the phlegmatic demolition expert \( j k simmons \) , is perpetually at odds with gawain \( marlon wayans \) , who is full of hippetyhop attitude mr simmons and mr wayans , irrepressible showboaters , overshadow the two remaining conspirators , a vietnamese general \( tzi ma \) and a dumb football player \( ryan hurst \) , who are pretty much onejoke characters the movie itself is one long joke , and there are long stretches where its inventiveness flags and its humor wears thin it would be hard to think of a more threadbare premise i will not bore you with a catalog of recent heist pictures if you have seen any besides oceans eleven and heist you will be plenty bored already and the coens do not seem interested in investing it with new life rather , the story is a flimsy frame to be ornamented with diverting bricabrac , and the movie as a whole is something of a paradox a work of elaborate and painstaking craftsmanship that is at the same time a piece of junk but one man s junk is another man s collectible , and i am happy to add the ladykillers to my boxed set of coeniana compared with o brother and the man who was n't there it is unquestionably minor , perhaps deliberately so , but it is nonetheless intermittently delightful the cinematography , by roger deakins , is as toothsome as homemade praline , and there are the requisite grisly touches a severed finger that becomes a cat toy , a spate of sudden fatalities at the end what keeps the movie going aside from the rambunctious performances of ms hall and mr hanks is the coens' obsessive devotion to the american vernacular few screenwriters take such virtuosic delight in the cacophonous music of american english , and these hyperactive filmmakers seem happiest when they sit still and listen to the various cadences of speech , from professor dorr s highflown erudition to mrs munson s righteousness to gawain s profane improvisations you sometimes suspect that the whole enterprise was cooked up to produce nonsensical lines like i was a positive lemur and \( my personal favorite \) othar never blowed no shofar perhaps not but the ladykillers , which opens nationwide today , nonetheless swells with sanctified harmonies as they did for o brother , the coens , aided once again by t bone burnett , have assembled a rich soundtrack full of halfforgotten , unforgettable american music , in this case mostly gospel the sublime sounds of the rev thomas dorsey , the soul stirrers , blind willie johnson and the swan silvertones \( whose version of a christian s plea is sampled in an amazing hiphop track by the nappy roots \) are immune to mockery , and they provide a curiously effective counterpoint and

when the july employment numbers are released today , the bush administration will hail them as proof that the economy is doing well , and it will have a point but despite rapid job growth this year , many americans continue to believe there is a job crisis why is that \? some blame an overly negative press , but the real answer may be found by delving into the statistics new numbers from the labor department show that the job downturn of 2001 and 2002 was surprisingly damaging to experienced workers , particularly older ones during that downturn , the unemployment rate never rose above 63 percent , a figure that would have been considered excellent in previous downturns the latest number , for june , is 56 percent in the late 1990 s , american employers had to hire almost anyone who wanted work there were reports of employers hiring consultants to help them find exconvicts to take jobs it stood to reason that when the bust came , it would be a case of lasthired , firstfired reliable longterm workers would be safe as it happened , many newly hired workers did suffer but they were not alone the labor department periodically surveys what it calls longtenured displaced workers , people who lost jobs they had held for at least three years , and lost them not because they were fired for cause but for other reasons like a plant closing or the elimination of a position in a dynamic economy , of course , some such workers are always losing their jobs in the late 1990 s , there were relatively few of them and most found new jobs quickly but by early 2004 after anyone laid off in 2001 or 2002 had had more than a year to find work many longtenured workers who lost jobs in the downturn were still suffering during 2001 and 2002 , tenured workers were more likely to lose their jobs than in any downturn since 198182 , when the unemployment rate hit 108 percent and those who found new jobs took bigger pay cuts an average of 187 percent than in the past it used to be that even among experienced workers , the age group most likely to suffer in a downturn was workers who were 25 to 34 years old it s never fun to lose a job , but the young are more likely to be resilient and less likely to have family responsibilities over all , young workers were still most likely to lose jobs in the last downturn but among workers with at least three years on the job , the most vulnerable workers were those 55 to 64 of those experienced workers who lost their jobs in 20012 , 361 percent stayed out of work so long that they exhausted their unemployment benefits that number is much higher than in the 199091 downturn there are limits to what can be shown with such data , but the numbers are consistent with a surge in outsourcing of jobs such outsourcing may be affecting longestablished plants and companies , which are more likely to have experienced , older workers who will have trouble finding jobs comparable to the ones they lost and people who see friends losing such jobs may be more likely to conclude that the job market is bad , whatever the statistics say none of that changes the fact that the economy is expanding , although the pace of growth has slowed , and it should be noted that the layoff numbers are based on a january survey that was just before hiring accelerated but the bad experience helps to explain current perceptions the conference board asks people every month whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get the jobless rate now is almost exactly where it was in the summer of 1996 , when bill clinton was cruising to reelection , but the public s view of the job picture today is far more negative those tenured workers who suffered in the downturn and their friends still feel the pain
bar anticipation , where summer never ends or so the sign out front says is spilling over with hundreds of tanned bodies of the young and the notsoyoung , drinks in hand and eyes fixed on the crowd this is , after all , open season at the new jersey shore we 're together yet again , says mary frank , who claims to be 23 and from somewhere in central jersey ms frank is hanging on to her gin and tonic in one hand and the shoulder of a wellmuscled rob marion with the other yes , yet again , answers mr marion , who says he has been coming to bar anticipation almost every friday night since he reached the legal drinking age three years ago in truth , mr marion and ms frank met only a week earlier but there are precious few weeks to any summer , and this season is rapidly fading a large part of young adulthood along the new jersey shore revolves around places like bar anticipation affectionately known as bar a to its loyalists the noisy , sweaty , anticipatory watering holes that dot the coast from sandy hook to cape may marriages have surely been forged from alliances in such places , and others dissolved but one thing is certain summer lust is a shore staple at bar anticipation and scores of similar party and pickup places for every player there is a cellphone , and for every cellphone there is a sculptured body \( some more so than others \) covered with a strap tshirt or a thong the beer and liquor \( and maybe more \) flow freely , the pickup lines are neverending and sometimes they work that s what the shore is for , or so they thinking goes , otherwise god would have made it a desert eagles , eagles ! goes a cheer above the rockmusic soundtrack by a halfdozen large philadelphiaarea types gooooooo , giants ! a similar crew roars back , and then they all laugh and raise their drinks to each other bar a bars none flags out front wave for the giants , the mets , the phillies , and the yankees belmar is just a smidgen north of central at the jersey shore , and playing favorites would not be good business on a good summer day , you can get 3 , 000 people coming in and out of bar anticipation , said steve tarkanish , president of stars productions , a booking agency that has been getting bands into shore clubs since 1966 there is no doubt that it sells more beer than any other shore bar it is right off route 35 and has an inside and an outside , with a great volleyball area it may not be right on the beach , but it seems to have what people want yet these days , being situated on the beach can be a threat to a bar s longevity two popular places in the northern part of the state will be closing , both victims of rising beachfront property values the tradewinds in sea bright plans to close its doors at summer s end after 30 years , and joey harrison s surf club in ortley beach may have one more season after this but both will eventually be the site of condominium development instead of beerswilling rock 'n' roll we 're losing two great places , mr tarkanish said but if you can get 400 , 000 for a condo , what is rock 'n' roll worth \? well , it is worth something down at the osprey nightclub , a rambling , white stucco building with blue trim , a block from the beach in manasquan , that has been packing in the central new jersey shore faithful for 58 summers if someone dropped in from another planet and wanted to see the quintessential jersey shore bar , the osprey would have to be it , mr tarkanish said the osprey , a barnlike place , has a staggering 10 bars inside , and while spotlight bands like the benjamins or the nerds or screaming broccolli do n't end up on mtv or vh1 , they fill the osprey with enough young men and women every summer to keep the owners from turning it into yet another condo complex my husband has an old osprey tshirt and one day someone saw him with it and offered him , i do n't know , 25 or something , said jeanne deyoung , the head of the monmouth county tourism office it may be falling apart , but the osprey is an important landmark he 'd never sell it farther south , in atlantic city , four casino hotels have opened beach bars in the last three summers in an effort to lure pleasure seekers down to a surf that has been largely abandoned in recent years amid the newly chic martini bars and waning trend of frozen drinks with paper umbrellas , the biggest and best jersey shore bars remain the beer joints i'm not proud , said monty jefferson , 26 , a computer programmer from hazlet who was at jenkinson s , the sprawling club on the beach in point pleasant beer is just fine with me on this particular wednesday night , the nerds , a popular mockretro band of 20 years' standing , is playing in its regular time slot if i want to go fancy , maybe it s a corona with a lime , mr jefferson said otherwise , if someone asks , bud is just fine the beer companies are big sponsors of special nights at some of the shore bars at the osprey , for instance , sundays are mostly the bud band showcase , where three to five bands looking for the chance to be the next shore staple start playing at 7 pm you 're looking at the demographic from 21 to 27 , the party and pickup crowd , and that is what the beer companies want to target down the shore , mr tarkanish said that is what dominates the jersey shore nightlife these days it s a simple formula why mess with it \? one of the reasons beer is the winner these days , he explained , is because new jersey lowered the bloodalcohol limit for driving under the influence , making hard liquor less tenable that s a big weapon against the nightclub industry , he said cops are all around the clubs it just makes sense to be vigilant but that does n't mean no one goes over the top some traditions never die for that eventuality , more and more , club owners have van services , taxis on call , and bartenders who try to keep drunks off the road in atlantic city , the trend is to have them just sleep over i 'd say most of the clientele for the new beach bars are stayovers , said ken condon , president of bally s atlantic city , the sister property of the atlantic city hilton and caesars atlantic city , which all now have bars on the beach that are open and playing live music until about 2 am on weekends bally s bikini beach bar , which opened this summer , is the newest of the beachfront spots the hilton opened its spot first , in 2002 , with caesars and then trump plaza opening places last year unlike most shore scenes , where clubgoers pick their bar for the night and stay there \( maybe because of cover charges , maybe because of slim pickings \) , people flit between the beach bars , which are close by each other , or take a walk on the beach or boardwalk for a while and then return it has created a new critical mass of nightlife that atlantic city has not seen in decades i remember when the scene , the biggest thing at the jersey shore , was the club harlem on kentucky avenue , said jerry blavat , a longtime philadelphia deejay , who started coming to the shore as in the 1950 s as a teenage american bandstand dancer you met everyone you knew there it was a place like no other these days , mr blavat owns memories , the busiest club in margate , a town situated south of atlantic city on absecon island memories caters primarily to an older crowd , which dances to oldies on friday and saturday nights yet dancing , he lamented , has largely gone out of fashion at clubs down the shore i do n't know when it stopped , but generally , people do n't go out and dance any more , mr blavat said in margate , you used to have the gables , the old tavern , the beacon inn people rocked and danced now you have restaurants , like tomatoes and steve and cookie s good restaurants , but not dance clubs mr blavat said that in the late 1950 s until the mid1960 s , wildwood was the king of shore nightlife , where weekend night crawlers would seek out love and such while watching the best rock and pop entertainment available major artists the four seasons , chubby checker , the isley brothers would have a song they wanted to test and put an act together to go to wildwood because the shore crowd would be there , he said the rainbow , the hurricane , the beachcomber , the riptide , the martinique all along pacific avenue , they would appear because wildwood was where you honed your craft lovers would come from all over just to be there now the scene in wildwood is centered around new jersey avenue , at the northern end of the island mr tarkanish said the beach house , at spruce and new jersey avenues , is the hottest bar in that area of north wildwood these days , but it is buttressed by other places within walking distance like moore s inlet , the anglesea pub and keenan s irish pub if there is a distinguishing mark separating clubs at the shore , it is that in the northern part of the state , there tend to be megabars , places that can hold hundreds of customers for instance , jenkinson s , bar anticipation , the osprey and joey harrison s surf club as well as joe pop s in ship bottom , on long beach island , are huge places set off by themselves , good for getting lost if the pickup line is too far off the mark in south jersey , the places tend to be smaller and clustered in a partyarea part of town in addition to the north wildwood cluster and the atlantic city beach bars , there is a cache of clubs around 40th street and landis avenue in sea isle city the springfield inn , the ocean drive , the la costa we do n't promote things that way , but we make people aware of the towns that tend to have nightlife , said diane wieland , the director of the cape may county tourism office we do remind them that ocean city and wildwood crest are dry , but i guess people who are looking to hang out in a big jersey shore bar know that unlike in the bigcity nightclub scene , where chicness and ofthemoment rule , tradition and familiarity more often than not outweigh other factors down the shore maybe you want to meet a new woman , but you want to first be with your friends in a place where you know what is happening , said harry morris , 27 , a financial consultant from middletown , bellying up to a budweiser at bar anticipation i think the familiarity makes meeting someone easier if you strike out , you do n't have to crawl out of the place in shame you shrug your shoulders , go back to hanging with your friends and try again when a bar does fade in popularity , either by demise or by a newer and trendier place , it is viewed with sadness , not derision , much like an old baseball player losing his muscle after many seasons of stardom the tradewinds was a landmark , hosting everyone from bruce springsteen to the nerds , and it is sad to see it go , mr tarkanish said take fred s tavern in stone harbor , he said , which has declined in popularity largely because of the upscale nature of the town you go in their liquor store and you see 400 bottles of wine , he said you do n't need to have a rock bar when you can sell that for his part , mr tarkanish said he spends most of his summer weekdays driving up and down the 127milelong new jersey shore , evaluating the scene so for seekers of surf , suds and something else , he has worked up a scouting report tuesday the sea shell in beach haven , with dog voices , is the hottest tuesday at the shore , he said dog voices , a cover band , features rob monte , an energetic lead singer , who leaps around the stage la mick jagger wednesday the hottest wednesday by far is jenkinson s with the nerds , he said the nerds dress up in mismatched plaid and design shirts and shorts and heavy black glasses and play their sometimes twisted versions of old rock songs thursday i would have to go back to jenkinson s for big orange cone , mr tarkanish said big orange cone attracts a young crowd , covering bands like the goo goo dolls and rage against the machine friday the best friday i would have to give to the princeton inn in avalon it is the perfect place to stop when you just drive down from work and want to unwind , he said saturday in the summer , saturday nights are a given anywhere , to the point where many places just dispense with bands , he said go to your favorite spot sunday undisputed , the band at the idle hour in point pleasant , is the strong sunday spot , said mr tarkanish , although he added that late sunday afternoon is a great time at almost any shore bar , a time to reflect and maybe restrategize and on monday \? everybody needs one day of rest , said mr morris at bar anticipation even fun needs a day off
trenton in the waning days and weeks of his aborted administration , governor mcgreevey has drawn unwelcome attention including from his successor , senate president richard j codey by making nearly 200 nominations for an array of prestigious , sensitive and sometimes lucrative public positions , although it has evoked little in the way of a public outcry the state senate , which has confirmed some of the nominations , is poised to act favorably on the rest even though some legislators have privately expressed unease over the flood of the selections put forward by a governor who is stepping down because of a controversial choice for homeland security adviser early in his administration indeed , many lawmakers including some of the most vociferous critics of the governor s behavior have spent much of the last two months scrambling behind the scenes to ensure that their own choices are acted on interestingly , this was also done by the governor who in the past few weeks issued an executive order aimed at a phenomenon called paytoplay , new jersey s winkingandnodding way of handing out lucrative business contracts to political contributors i think , given past practice , it would be somewhat hypocritical to be too critical of the governor sort of padding the midnight appointments , as appears to be occurring in this case , said state senator robert martin , a republican from morris plains who is a member of the judiciary committee i have been on this committee long enough to see what took place under governor florio , governor whitman and acting governor defrancesco in each case , there was an obvious attempt to take care of those who had been working close to the governor after he or she departed mr martin , who has shown an independent streak in the past by criticizing nominees from both parties , explained the current situation in almost apologetic terms , saying he doubted that legislators from either party would attack a practice that has become so standard that few people in or out of politics even notice it s a little hard to be overcritical , he said , when most people do n't think there s something wrong yet in a shortlived administration that has left in its wake a disgraced governor and federal investigations into two leading fundraisers and two of mr mcgreevey s top aides , even the most hardened political bosses are at least for now talking like reformers according to some political observers , the unusual circumstances surrounding mr mcgreevey s departure he admitted having an extramarital affair with a man later identified as a staff member may mean that this round of appointments will receive a greater level of public scrutiny , and that regardless of the candidates' qualifications the very perception of patronage could be politically significant the governor is leaving his own office in disgrace , and part of the reason is influencepeddling that he practiced in his administration , said david rebovich , the director of the institute for new jersey politics at rider university now , weeks before he formally resigns , he s still peddling influence by helping friends and associates remain on the payroll and increase their eligibility for pensions i think the average citizen will see this they do n't want this kind of favoritism anymore the bumper crop of lateterm appointees 189 nominations have been released since governor mcgreevey announced his plans to resign on aug 12 is liberally studded with names familiar to any observer of the mcgreevey administration , like james p fox , the governor s chief of staff michael decotiis , the chief counsel and kevin hagan , the executive director of the state s democratic party the fact that people have close relationships with the governor should n't bar them from public service , said mr decotiis , who has been managing partner of a law firm and deputy director of the port authority of new york and new jersey i would just ask people to judge me on what i 've done and where i 've been mr fox , who is now in line for a 206 , 000ayearjob as deputy director of the port authority , was plucked for the local finance board , which regulates the fiscal operations of towns , counties and authorities mr decotiis was selected for the casino reinvestment development authority , which distributes millions of dollars in casinogenerated taxes to some of the state s blighted areas and mr hagan was given a spot on the real estate commission , which regulates the licensing and practices of realtors in addition , all three appointments , which pay relatively modest salaries , qualify the occupants for state pension benefits thirtyeight other nominations , scheduled to be heard and voted on by the judiciary committee on monday , include that of reni erdos , the director of consumer affairs , whose name has been put forward to head the state s parole board , considered a prize appointment and carrying a 104 , 000 a year salary there is also curtis bashaw , the cape may hotel owner who governor mcgreevey picked about a year ago to head the casino reinvestment and development authority mr bashaw , who has become a close adviser to mr mcgreevey , has been nominated for an unpaid position on the board of richard stockton state college in pomona then there are the dozens of other appointments , which do not require legislative approval but are still positions of influence how appointments are made the confirmation process is a study in cooperative politics , and goes some way toward explaining why there is rarely much public debate over potential appointees it is common practice for the nominees to be signed off on long before they actually come up for a vote in the senate for instance , etiquette dictates that the names be approved not only by the senate president and the head of the judiciary committee , but by the senator or senators from the home county of the nominee this preconfirmation is a political process in itself , in which the local senators exert their prerogative and assert their own selfinterest in negotiations with the governor and other legislators with territorial claims once the senators have had their say , the names go on the lists released by the governor s office and by the time the judiciary committee releases the names to be voted on by the full senate , there is little question that they will be approved john adler , a democrat from camden county who is chairman of the judiciary committee , seemed to indicate that the process this year would not be significantly different i do n't think the presumption suddenly becomes that because they 're mcgreevey appointments they 're somehow suspect , mr adler said we evaluate them on a casebycase basis so far , mr adler said , he had not yet come across any candidates with any obviously disqualifying defects or lack of credentials , and said that any objections could be raised at the hearings few objections raised in fact , there have been few public objections to any of the nominees the closest thing to any organized resistance has been over a nomination to an unpaid position on the board of rutgers university a group of students at the state university , led by the president of the student government association , objected to the naming of george zoffinger , the president of the new jersey sports and exposition authority and a political ally of mr mcgreevey , on the ground that he is already on the board of the new brunswick development corporation , a nonprofit agency that funnels public and private investment into projects in the city in other words , his opponents complained , in the natural order of town versus gown , mr zoffinger would have a difficult time straddling both camps if you have an individual helping determine the future of this campus who has other interests in terms of those projects , it should be a major cause for concern , said adam cooper , president of the rutgers college governing association mr zoffinger has dismissed the notion that membership on both boards represented a conflict of interest , and offered to give up one of the positions i want no stone unturned to make sure there s not even the appearance of a conflict here , he said micah rasmussen , a spokesman for governor mcgreevey , rejected the notion that there was anything out of the ordinary with the 189 nominations put forward since aug 12 , and said that all of the candidates were qualified for their posts the caliber of the people that are being appointed is second to none , mr rasmussen said you 're talking about people who have had a hand in running state government for the last three years still , there does seem to be heightened awareness this year , particularly among democrats , of the potential perils the gubernatorial appointments could represent going into statewide elections next year this has produced something of a consensus that the appointments should be dealt with as quickly and quietly as possible codey said to be uneasy for instance , mr codey who declined to comment for this article is said by associates to be uneasy with the sheer number of nominations made by mr mcgreevey mr codey s chief of staff , pete cammarano , raised the issue with mr fox in an effort to limit the number of spots that mr mcgreevey would seek to fill on his way out of office , according to sources familiar with the process the last thing dick codey , or any of the democrats , want to do here is to institutionalize a bunch of bad appointments , said one powerful democrat familiar with the process but none of them are going to want to make any waves here , or to make any enemies unnecessarily even if the appointments are approved without incident , as seems likely , democrats could be dealing with them for some time to come for one thing , the appointments have already been something of a distraction , setting off chain reactions of contributors calling party officials and other operatives to lobby for various positions one major democratic fundraiser told of receiving a call , shortly after mr mcgreevey s resignation announcement , from a frequent donor who wanted to be reappointed to his unpaid seat on a college board the fundraiser , in turn , called his friends on the donor s behalf at the same time , the donor was making his own calls , even as other candidates lobbied for his seat he starts calling the same people i'm calling , the fundraiser said , and i think he would have gone to see mcgreevey himself if he could have then of course , the people he calls start calling other people there must have been 50 calls made about this seat and this is all during a period of time when we should have been working on winning this year s election in the end , the donor was not reappointed , and as a result is unlikely to make any more contributions any time soon these sorts of distractions aside , the slew of appointments could also turn out to be something of a political handicap with reform very much on the agenda , aspiring politicians of all stripes have been racing to outdo each other with proposals to reform campaign finance and simplify voting the democrats , who control the governor s office and both houses of the legislature , may find themselves particularly vulnerable during next year s gubernatorial and legislative elections to attacks on a range of reformrelated issues for now , most republicans are muting their criticism , looking forward perhaps to a time when they will be the ones filling governmental vacancies the senate traditionally has thought that a democratic governor going into a democratic administration will appoint democratic appointees , said state senator thomas kean jr , a democrat from union county and when a republican succeeds the incoming administration , that governor will appoint people of different points of view but such collegiality is temporary they may be reluctant to say something now , said mr rebovich , speaking about the republicans lawmakers , but wait until the elections next year as for the democrats , mr rebovich said , they just want the governor to slip away as quickly as possible
washington , wednesday , sept 15 hundreds of airliners around the country were held on the ground for hours on tuesday night when the air traffic control center that handles longdistance flights in southern california lost voice communications with 800 planes in flight because of a technical problem the los angeles air route traffic control center in palmdale , one of 20 such centers in the continental united states , lost its primary radio system about 8 pm eastern time , said laura j brown , a spokeswoman for the federal aviation administration in washington a secondary system also failed , ms brown said they can still see everything on radar , but they ca n't talk to the airplanes , she said the system was restored before midnight eastern time , but by that time , many flights had been canceled and other planes were so late that their next flights would also be disrupted the los angeles center handles all longdistance , highaltitude traffic in a territory that includes the airports in los angeles , san diego and las vegas about 800 planes were in the air at the time , and control was assumed by the southern california terminal radar approach control , which usually handles loweraltitude traffic and traffic that is on approach or departure from airports , and the albuquerque center , ms brown said airplanes bound for the area that had not taken off were held on the ground , she said ms brown said she did not know the cause of the failure the aviation agency did not divert any planes to other airports , but some airlines chose to do so rather than risk having their planes stranded in the region for the duration of the problem the situation disrupted airports throughout the region in albuquerque , passengers waited for hours before they could leave their planes as the authorities waited in vain for the technical problem to be solved los angeles international airport was a beehive of activity as travelers tried to decide whether to change their plans , or wait it out walaa zeidan , 20 , had been ready to board an air canada plane back home to victoria , british columbia , when she and other passengers were told there was a communications problem through much of the west coast everyone freaked out , ms zeidan said , and there were all these rumors flying around as airlines were given the allclear to use the los angeles airport again around 9 pm , airplanes began appearing on the horizon , their lights shining in orderly rows as the lined up to land the bustle of the airport resumed its noisy rhythm , as announcements started up again on the public address systems and disembarking passengers appeared bearing luggage passengers from a plane arriving from hawaii said they had had no idea anything was wrong , although several remarked that it had sseemed odd that so many planes were landing in rapid sucession i saw all these planes on the same level as us , out over the ocean , said a passenger , joan ireland that always makes me a little nervous we did n't know a thing president bush was in the las vegas area earlier in the day , but air force one took off for andrews air force base , near washington , before the problem developed , ms brown said a plane carrying reporters who accompany the president was not so fortunate and was stranded in las vegas several flights headed to southern california were diverted to northern california airports , including san jose , san francisco and oakland , which are controlled by a different air traffic control center ten flights that were supposed to land in los angeles were rerouted to san francisco international airport , where they sat on the runway for several hours , said dennis nevis , an airport duty manager an official at john wayne airport in orange county , which has a 10 pm curfew for departures and an 11 pm curfew for arrivals , said it was difficult to know how many flights had been affected at mccarran international airport in las vegas , the grounding ended just before the latenight peak , from 9 pm to 1 am pacific time , said randall walker , director of aviation for clark county dozens of flights had been delayed and canceled there , mr walker said , but none had been diverted to other airports these are the kind of problems we were having before sept 11 , and i think we are going to see it popping it up again and again , mr walker said we have more flights than ever now , and the more flights you have , the longer it takes to recover
as nissim elmann tells it , he could control much of what went on in the matrimonial section of the brooklyn state supreme court arranging favorable custody and property rights for his clients was simple mr elmann is not a judge or even a lawyer he was a brooklyn electronics salesman his only experience in court came when he was a divorce litigant appearing in front of judge gerald p garson in 2000 but in transcripts read to jurors yesterday , mr elmann claimed he had everyone including judge garson in his pocket , and could make deals nicely and quietly with lawyers as frieda hanimov , the woman who first told the brooklyn district attorney about alleged wrongdoing in judge garson s courtroom , took the stand yesterday , jurors heard more about what prosecutors say is a complicated web of corruption in which the divorce lawyer paul siminovsky s cases would be steered to judge garson mr garson , who is charged with accepting cash , cigars and meals from mr siminovsky , would then coach the lawyer and rule in favor of his clients , according to prosecutors prosecutors say that mr elmann , who is accused of paying bribes , was an intermediary between mr siminovsky , the lawyer s clients and court employees i'm fighting for you , mr elmann says in a telephone conversation with a divorce client that was read in court yesterday i'm killing myself i have a judge participate , i have attorneys participate he also says , people are standing in line for me to do what i have done for you in october 2002 , ms hanimov went to mr elmann to see if he could help her , but he told her she was too late because her exhusband had already made payments to receive a favorable ruling , ms hanimov said she then complained to the district attorney investigators asked her to record her conversations with mr elmann , which were in hebrew mr hanimov does not face any charges your husband paid money , a lot of money , mr elmann tells ms hanimov in an october 18 , 2002 , conversation at his electronics warehouse that was read in court yesterday and he has the upper hand none of the tape transcripts read yesterday referred to the defendants in the case paul sarnell , a clerk for judge garson and louis salerno , a court officer their lawyers voiced frustration that only a small part of the evidence presented so far focused on their clients mr elmann is to face trial later this year prosecutors read transcripts of the conversations between ms hanimov and mr elmann judge garson heard the case between ms hanimov and her exhusband , yuri hanimov , four years ago , and ms hanimov says the judge unfairly favored mr hanimov when mr siminovsky was representing his case the judge would yell at ms hanimov in court and tell her to settle the case in order to keep custody of their three children , she has said mr hanimov later took ms hanimov back to court in a custody dispute , after she was arrested on charges that she beat their 14yearold son those charges were later dropped , but the couple is still in a custody battle over the son , now 16 ms hanimov , who immigrated from israel in 1987 , has said she could not afford a lawyer in 2002 and was confused by the legal system in one recorded conversation , ms hanimov asks mr elmann what the judge has said about her case i do n't need for him to tell me , he responds it depends on me it does n't depend on him i 'll tell him he will he 'll do regarding the outcome of one client s case , mr elmann says , i have to speak with garson there is no evidence that mr elmann did , in fact , speak with the judge directly an investigator in the case testified last week that mr elmann would be lying if he said he knew judge garson but mr elmann repeatedly tells ms hanimov that he communicates with the judge regularly that claim , defense lawyers contend , undermines mr elmann s credibility and shows that references he makes in other tapes , on which mr salerno and mr sarnell are heard , may not be true

revolutionary bloodline , his wife was told she was rejected because of an interview she gave last year to the new york times and because she had greeted the 2003 nobel peace prize winner , shirin ebadi , an iranian human rights activist , when ms ebadi returned from receiving her award the two brothers have risen politically together and remain close , the younger mr khatami says he said he wrote his brother s speeches during the president s first two years in office but since 2000 , when mohammad reza khatami became the leader of their political party , differences have emerged like many of the president s supporters , mr khatami has encouraged iranians to shun the coming election and blames his brother , 16 years his senior , for his hesitancy in the current crisis and for acquiescing in a vote that critics say is fundamentally flawed the president believes that he needs to compromise to keep reforms alive , mr khatami said , but i believe that this is a killing poison for it we all know what people want , and they wo n't give up on their demands in an interview , mr khatami said he worried that the reform movement might now be crippled by the disqualifications and consigned to the political sidelines for years even so , he says , a broader awakening is taking place in iran that even exclusion from the election cannot undo society is more conscious of its rights , he said , and there are many civil institutions that we can use mr khatami is representative of the evolution that many in the reform movement have undergone after the revolution in 1979 he shared the animosity toward the west common in the political vanguard and advocated limiting social and political freedoms , particularly for women , to raise a generation devoted to revolutionary ideals but with the death of ayatollah khomeini in 1989 , many of those close to the leader were marginalized by supporters of his successor , ayatollah khamenei , in much the same way the reformers have been pushed aside today mr khatami said he had come to realize since then that the country needed to emerge from its political isolation to move toward greater development and democracy he and others , including his brother , took that time to rethink their political agenda , he said there were a series of ideals at the time of the revolution which were forgotten right away , mr khatami recalled we think the revolution should have put the country on the course toward democracy that was the need , and we have to adopt modern methods to move that way mr khatami himself lived for a year and a half in london on a postdoctoral fellowship and left his medical practice to return to politics when his brother entered the presidential race in 1997 he said that at that time the reform group , not yet a political party , was not seeking power we just wanted to use the election as a platform and spread new ideas about democracy and civil society , he said we did not have a good understanding of society and were caught by surprise when people so overwhelmingly supported our ideas the party s westernstyle campaign , with concerts and promises for more political and social opening , attracted young people who were frustrated with the religious strictures his wife became the first wife of a politician to campaign along with her husband since then the party suffered many setbacks at the hands of its conservative opponents , including the exclusion of its candidates from the current election still , he says , whether or not the reformers sit in parliament , their movement is not going away we learned that we cannot believe the whole world is against us , he said we can have common interests with other countries and can collaborate with the world we learned that human rights , which we argued was a political instrument against us , was indeed a value we learned that we cannot limit people s freedom for the sake of independence
the new york subway is one of the city s more famously rude places , and it was in hopes of witnessing some good oldfashioned new york incivility that i spent some time the other day with one of new york city transit s new customer assistance representatives a transit spokesman had explained that the employees who volunteer for the program at 10 of the busiest stations are trained to deal with unruly people , and the opportunity to watch one of them dispense cheer to purplefaced commuters on the verge of becoming unhinged seemed too good to pass up dorothy rivera , 38 , a transit worker for 13 years , is probably about as daring as they come a selfdescribed people person and a native of brooklyn , she said she asked to be posted at grand central , which has 400 , 000 daily riders before her current stint , which began last month , she worked mostly in token booths , meeting plenty of angry customers now she roams grand central terminal from 7 am to 3 pm , in a blue blazer , slacks and a gold name tag that reads , may i help you \? as people charged down escalators and plowed through turnstiles in frightening waves , ms rivera plunged into the vortex of the morning rush with surprising gusto you gotta run with me , she said after sending some members of the spanish national fencing team on their way , she helped a befuddled man in a backpack and a japanese tourist an irritated woman demanded to know why the metrocard machine was not taking her atm card i do n't know if there s a problem with your card , ms rivera said no , the woman said with a glare ms rivera thought the woman might be removing her atm card too quickly , but decided not to reach over and try it herself \( some people get angry when you touch their card , she said \) she told the woman she could give her access to the system for now mollified , the woman walked through a door ms rivera held open i usually let them vent , ms rivera said and i speak in a calm tone to bring them down but by 8 40 am , a crisis had developed none of the metrocard machines was taking credit or atm cards i waited expectantly for the coming tsunami i think the system is down , ms rivera told one woman sorry about that it s ok , the woman said , heading to the token booth instead ms rivera repeated the same line to another customer and another she rushed back and forth between the two banks of machines , breaking the news but no one exploded by 9 30 am , the deluge of riders had passed then ms rivera spied yet another woman trying to use her credit card in a machine ma'am , the system is not working , ms rivera told her oh , ok , she answered thanks thanks \? michael luo
after a year away from track and field while on maternity leave , marion jones returns to competition in the 60 meters on friday night at the millrose games at madison square garden as the summer olympics in athens approach along with another potential attempt at five gold medals jones , 28 , is seeking to restore her speed and , in a sense , her credibility there has been no evidence that she has taken performanceenhancing drugs , and she has not been accused of it , but she stars in a sport where the use of illicit substances is believed by many to be epidemic her affiliation with ben johnson s former coach last winter and her connection to a bay area laboratory that has been the center of an investigation into the steroid thg have raised questions about her decisionmaking and the legitimacy of her performances in a telephone conference call yesterday , jones acknowledged that she had been on the periphery of a number of scandals , but said , i do n't believe in guilt by association in the least she said she did not use performanceenhancing drugs i ca n't control everyone s opinion , she said i can only go out and run fast and continue to express that i'm for drugfree sport and always will be even as jones won three gold medals at the 2000 sydney olympics , her achievements were tempered by the revelation that her husband at the time , the shotputter c j hunter , tested positive for the steroid nandrolone before the games began they have since divorced in a sport where the atmosphere is poisoned and every outstanding performance brings immediate suspicion , track officials and other experts in the sport have said that jones has made decisions that have not served her well whatever allamerican girl image she had , none of them have it anymore , said dr charles yesalis , a penn state professor and an expert on steroids speaking of track and field in general , he said , tell me which rose has the bloom yet to come off of jones has served as an ambassador for her sport with her graciousness , intelligence and outstanding achievement , said dr steven ungerleider , a psychologist who has worked with a number of olympic athletes and who wrote the book faust s gold about east germany s doping program i think she s a very decent person , ungerleider said having said that , i'm a bit saddened because she s made some very bad decisions we all have to be real careful who we associate with we are entering a new threshold of integrity , where it is no longer sufficient for an athlete to sign a disclosure form saying that he or she is drug free athletes at the elite level have to take complete responsibility for their behavior last november , jones and her companion , the sprinter tim montgomery , testified before a federal grand jury investigating balco , a nutritionalsupplement company drugtesting officials have accused the lab of being a source of thg , or tetrahydrogestrinone the lab s owner , victor conte , has denied the charge jones said she met conte a number of years ago and had a very limited relationship with him \( he traveled to sydney in 2000 to defend hunter , jones s former husband , saying that the nandrolone came from contaminated nutritional supplements , not from an attempt to cheat \) contrary to published reports , jones said she had no relationship with the balco lab , had never been a member of zma , a track club affiliated with balco , and had never used the company s supplements have i ever taken thg \? no , jones said later , she added , i 've never used anything from that company jones and every other athlete in elite sports track and field in particular find themselves in an awkward position because drug testing has loopholes and no tests exist for some drugs that are believed to be widely used , like human growth hormone , those who are not using illicit substances cannot prove their innocence i still think you have to believe people are innocent until they are proved guilty , said dr gary wadler , a professor of medicine at new york university and an expert on performanceenhancing drugs i can think of nothing worse for an athlete who has devoted a lifetime to the pursuit of excellence , at great sacrifice , and to have someone point the finger and say , 'the only way you got there was by cheating' unfortunately , those who set records are viewed through suspect glasses yesterday , jones noted that she was a young girl during the 1988 summer olympics , when the sprinter ben johnson was stripped of his gold medal in the 100 meters after testing positive for steroids his coach , charlie francis , later admitted facilitating the steroid use when jones and montgomery began training with francis last winter , the johnson scandal never crossed her mind , she said she has said that she sought out francis because of his technical skill as a coach their affiliation ended last february after concern was expressed by meet promoters and track s world governing body yesalis , the penn state professor , said he would not criticize the jonesfrancis relationship because he considered francis a superb coach and more forthright about drugs than sports officials were others have been less understanding michael johnson , the retired olympic champion sprinter , said in an interview last summer that the relationship with francis was very damaging for marion when you are the leader of the sport , you are expected to conduct yourself in a way that helps the sport , johnson said of jones at the national track and field championships yesterday , jones answered all questions but preferred to speak about her son , tim montgomery jr , born last june , and her refined form in the long jump after a long layoff , she hungers for competition she is not concerned about clearing the air , she said , only running and leaping through it more expertly than anyone else people who have really followed my career from the time i was 7 years old until now can see my steady progression and see the type of person and athlete that i am , jones said
bloomfield township , mich please , do n't ever think of the european ryder cup team as an underdog with their 18 1 29 1 2 rout of the united states , the europeans have won four of the last five competitions and 7 of the last 10 , all with the american golfers considered the favorites if a baseball , pro football or pro basketball team had a similar run , it would be considered a dynasty it just goes to show how image can be so wrong how game can mean so much more than name and how the world ranking system can be so meaningless tiger woods , phil mickelson and davis love iii rank as three of the world s top six golfers padraig harrington of ireland has the highest ranking , at no 8 , on the european team but over three days at oakland hills , the tougher europeans , led by the world s 62ndranked golfer , the 41yearold colin montgomerie of scotland , and sergio garc a of spain , did n't just retain the cup , they trounced all those celebrated american golfers say this for davis love iii he accepted responsibility tiger woods , davis love , phil mickelson , he said of america s three best players , we did n't lead this team certainly not with their 491 wonlosthalved record woods and mickelson had their chance , paired together as they were friday by hal sutton , the united states captain , in both the fourball and alternateshot formats but they lost both matches as the europeans jumped to a 6 1 21 1 2 lead and never looked back woods and love also lost their alternateshot match saturday and after woods won the opening singles yesterday , mickelson lost to garc a , 3 and 2 , and love watched a 1up lead on darren clarke after the 16th hole dissolve into an allsquare finish just when the americans needed to get 3 quick points to put some pressure on the europeans , they got only 1 1 2 too little , too early after the needed halfpoint slipped away , love called it a fun day not what you 've ever heard other losing competitors in other sports say that s golf , the last gentleman s game clarke even talked about how he has been smoking cigars , sometimes in the team matches , that love gave him as a gift maybe such friendlyenemy thinking is why the american golfers do n't seem to take the ryder cup as seriously as the europeans do and why , as heavy favorites , they continue to lose playing for their country certainly has n't aroused them , at least not in the matches themselves they all talk about how proud and eager they are to make the team , and they probably are but when the matches begin , it s as if they have called in sick for all their major championships , pga tour victories and millions in prize money , woods , mickelson and love have abysmal career ryder cup records woods is the worst of the three at 8112 mickelson is 9103 and love 9105 maybe there is n't enough prize money to arouse the americans' competitive juices \? actually , there is no prize money in addition to receiving expenses , each of the 12 players and the captain designate 100 , 000 to charities of their choice and another 100 , 000 to colleges of their choice as millionaire individual contractors who usually play only for themselves and who mostly go their own way in their own chartered jets , maybe the americans just do n't know how to accept the team concept and with so much emphasis on the world ranking , maybe the americans just ca n't believe that all those lowerranked europeans can possibly beat them in yesterday s 12 singles , a european golfer had a higher ranking than his american opponent in only two of the matches but five europeans montgomerie , garc a , lee westwood , ian poulter and paul mcginley defeated a higherranked american , and clarke halved his match believe it or not , garc a said after saturday s matches , there s people that can play golf outside the states maybe it s time the world ranking system provided more weight for the european tour events as all losing american captains are , sutton will be secondguessed , mostly for putting woods and mickelson together in the team matches when he and everybody in golf knew they were n't bosom buddies , to use sutton s term together , they showed none of the togetherness that the europeans have thrived on as underdogs all these years when they have really been top dogs sutton took a football coach s approach , telling his golfers thursday night to throw all of your hearts out there on the ground and play for them but when the americans lost their hearts , it did n't seem as if they cared that much because ryder cup captains usually serve only one term , there will be a new american captain at the kclub in dublin for the matches in 2006 paul azinger and mark o'meara appear to be the leading candidates , but no matter who the captain is , if tiger woods , phil mickelson and davis love iii do n't have a winning record , the topdog europeans will win again
nobody called todd williams or helena echegoyan the nword when they were growing up it is not a word they use as a rule or a word they particularly like but as adults mr williams , a film director , and ms echegoyan , a producer , have become champions of open debate on the merits and complexities of one of american society s most explosive racial slurs nigger in their new documentary , the n word , being broadcast sunday on the trio cable network , mr williams and ms echegoyan trace the history of the slur back to the 17th century they call on commentators from stanley crouch , the cultural critic , to chuck d , the rapper , to the taboobreaking comics george carlin and chris rock to argue the pros and cons of the term the perspectives diverge widely young hiphop artists defiantly state their right to use the word whenever they wish an unidentified teenage white girl explains carefully that niggaz is completely different from niggers and thus acceptable yet critics like mr crouch observe that no matter how thoroughly black iconoclasts have embraced the word , intending to deflate its impact as richard pryor did in the 1980 s and chris rock did in the 1990 s the word retains its sting mr crouch also deplores the coarsening that comes with its unhesitant use men and women say things to each other in private , at the dinner table , that they 're not going to say to somebody in public , he said now if you get to the point where that becomes chic , the private thing is said in public , then you 're going down a decadent road none of that , the filmmakers say , persuades them that any word should be stricken from discussion that s the crux of the issue why do n't we talk about the stuff that s hanging in the air \? asked ms echegoyan , a bronx native who has worked in hollywood for more than a decade nothing is going to get better unless you can speak your mind both mr williams , who grew up in north carolina and brooklyn , and ms echegoyan say they are disturbed by the kneejerk reactions dictated by contemporary political correctness when the eddie murphy comedy trading places is shown on television , they observed , a scene has been deleted in which the character played by the actor don ameche uses the slur in explaining that he would never let mr murphy s character run his company that s a critical scene , and it s been edited out , mr williams said there s a real danger in doing that if you can say a word never existed , you can say jim crow never existed ms echegoyan chimed in it s a denial of historical accuracy , she said mr williams , 32 , was brought up in an uppermiddleclass family and remembers hearing someone call him nigger only once a poor whitetrash kid , as he put it , in summer camp ms echegoyan , who appears to be in her late 30 s \( she declined to give her age \) , said that she had never heard the word during a working class childhood but their professional experience is a central motivator of their argument the filmmakers were talking about their movie in a chic restaurant full of hollywood actors , producers and agents , and they were the only nonwhite customers hollywood s dominant culture , they note , is white and , they contend , politically correct to a fault in hollywood , just because they do n't call me nigger does n't mean they do n't treat me like one every single day , mr williams said i'm still treated like a secondclass citizen he has worked for a couple of companies that he said he considers colorblind adam sandler s happy madison productions and mgm but it s so rare , mr williams said people are likely to only give me a 'black project' ms echegoyan concurred but then you get caught in the 'you 're not black enough' thing , she said , treated as if she were too educated and literate to fully understand black culture to some degree the filmmakers are using the debate over language as an emblem for a host of uncomfortable racial issues that are pushed to the side , in hollywood as in other parts of american society nigger is n't going anywhere , ms echegoyan said it s here to stay the dominant culture is asking us to decide use it or do n't use it that s so binary you ca n't police every aspect of the culture
tim thomas lingered on the foul line with 131 seconds to play , his wrist locked in followthrough , as the second of his two free throws plopped into the net fans in the seats behind the basket at the bradley center put down their oblong plastic noisemakers , and thomas took satisfaction in the quiet knicks coach lenny wilkens had been anything but quiet at halftime , after the knicks lollygagged on defense through the first half and trailed the bucks by 22 points i guess i was a little wild , wilkens said but after falling behind by 26 points early in the third quarter , the knicks woke up and stormed back for a critical 103100 victory sunday afternoon the comeback was the second biggest from a halftime deficit in club history , trailing only a 23point comeback on april 6 , 1987 , against philadelphia the victory enabled the knicks to split the fourgame season series with the bucks , which may be important for playoff seedings and it provided a muchneeded boost after friday night s doubleovertime loss in philadelphia thomas , returning here for the first time since the threeway trade that sent him to the knicks and keith van horn to the bucks , provided much of the boost getting over a stomach ailment and a head cold , thomas scored 11 of his 20 points in the final 5 minutes 14 seconds van horn had 18 points none in the second half though thomas tried to play down the van horn comparisons , constant reminders of how much better van horn has played for milwaukee than he has for the knicks clearly bothered him thomas expected to be booed , and the fans proved him right every time he touched the ball , especially in a first half when van horn outscored him , 182 they 're supposed to boo , thomas said i'm in new york now wilkens grew angry at his team for its poor defense i did n't care if they fouled out , wilkens said we needed to come out and set an aggressive tone when that happened , better offense followed down by 26 , the knicks answered with 15 consecutive points in a span of 2 44 , with stephon marbury contributing 6 points and 2 assists van horn went cold , failing to score in the final 31 minutes , and he eventually stopped looking to shoot he was 0 for 7 in the second half i got some good looks , van horn said i missed some easy shots in the second half , shots i usually would make i 'd take the same shots again thomas said i do n't know what was going on in his mind when you get in a nice rhythm , you keep it going but he decided to pass the ball i'm not going to complain as the knicks increased the pressure on defense , thomas became more aggressive on offense the knicks trimmed the bucks' lead to 8584 with 6 02 to play on consecutive 3pointers by penny hardaway thomas tied it a little more than two minutes later on a 3pointer from the left corner marbury , who finished with 21 points and 16 assists , put the knicks ahead for good with 2 01 to play with a 3pointer thomas then hit two foul shots and marbury a jumper to give the knicks a 10093 lead with 1 08 left milwaukee closed to 101100 , then van horn fouled thomas thomas made both free throws milwaukee s toni kukoc misfired an offbalance 3pointer in the final seconds it clanged short off the rim and out of bounds you guys thought i was going to come here and miss some free throws \? thomas said you crazy \? you absolutely crazy \? if you think i'm going to miss free throws at that time , you 've got another thing coming rebounds knicks coach lenny wilkens is unsure if dikembe mutombo , who had abdominal surgery , can practice this week not having had that surgery , i do n't know how you run very well , but we 'll see , wilkens said bucks coach terry porter , a teammate of stephon marbury s with the minnesota timberwolves from 1996 to 1998 , said he thought minnesota s streak of seven consecutive firstround playoff losses would not have happened had the team kept marbury and tom gugliotta alongside kevin garnett gugliotta left as a free agent in the 199899 season , joining phoenix , and marbury was traded to the nets in march 1999 they definitely would have had a playoff series win by now if they stayed together , but you never know , porter said
the patriots had just been humiliated on opening day by the bills and the patriots' spurned safety lawyer milloy , 310 then came the bigger joke for the rookie eugene wilson on monday morning , when the patriots returned to work , josh mcdaniels , a defensive assistant , told wilson , a cornerback who was a secondround draft pick out of illinois , that he was about to become a free safety one more thing he was going to start in six days wilson thought it was a prank i said , 'oh yeah \? ok , ' wilson said he was like , 'no , no , really' until then , wilson had played safety only in a video game he had not taken a single snap at safety during training camp but he has played it ever since , grabbing four interceptions and playing well enough to help stabilize a unit that was in flux during the first weeks of the season so went one of the first , and most daring , of a series of lineup shuffles the patriots \( 142 \) survived this season on their way to the nfl s best record they will be host to tennessee \( 134 \) saturday night in a divisional playoff game because of a string of injuries and personnel decisions like the release of milloy just days before the regularseason opener , the patriots used 42 different starters this season , an unusually high number for a successful team according to the elias sports bureau , only oakland , houston , cleveland and atlanta used more starters this season none of them won more than five games one day during the week before the patriots played washington on sept 28 , during the worst of the injury siege , coach bill belichick told reporters that if they had to play that day , he would not have been able to dress 45 players against the redskins , all seven of the patriots' inactive players were opening day starters despite operating with smoke and mirrors and plenty of bandages , the patriots did not lose another regularseason game after losing to washington , 2017 they raced into the playoffs with a 12game winning streak , the league s seventhranked defense and a turnover differential of plus17 , the second best in the league since joining the patriots , belichick has built a roster that stresses flexibility , with players able to perform several jobs , giving the team the ability to withstand the battering of injury and belichick s constantly changing schemes it is a philosophy that offers few certified stars \( just two players were voted to the pro bowl \) but plenty of movable parts and it was tested this season as it rarely has in the nfl not since the 1969 minnesota vikings has a division champion used so many starters but the patriots insist that the roster instability was never overwhelming you put together the best you can with the resources that you have , belichick said we felt like every week that we have walked out there we could be competitive with our opponent every team is in some kind of transition in that third , fourth , fifth or sixth week of the regular season , whatever the circumstances are then at some point , you become more stable i am not saying things fall into place , but it seems like there are less moving parts and there is more continuity the patriots avoided a serious injury to their most important player , quarterback tom brady but they did not achieve continuity until they welcomed back the players who had been injured to a team that was already solidified by the last weeks of the regular season , the inactive list looked normal again , even though five opening day starters were on injured reserve when the patriots played the titans on oct 5 , the left tackle and right guard were the only positions in which the regular starters played the opening day center , damien woody , who missed two games with a chest injury , had moved to left guard because the opening day starter there , mike compton , was on injured reserve so was adrian klemm , the right tackle on opening day the backup right tackle tom ashworth , whose previous playing experience consisted of reserve duty at tight end in one game last season , started in place of klemm , and the rookie dan koppen started at center for woody in a 3830 victory , the patriots rushed for 161 yards against the titans , who would finish the season with the topranked run defense in the league it matched the patriots' highest point total of the season and was the first of their 12 straight victories it also came without nose tackle ted washington and linebackers willie mcginest and mike vrabel it s unbelievable , said jets coach herman edwards , whose team lost twice to the patriots the thing i like about them is they win all different ways they won a lot of close games and won some shootout games when you start winning that way , you get confident that somebody is going to make a play , always the patriots may have been better equipped to deal with the tumult than most after all , even the pro bowl defensive end richard seymour plays every position on the line eight rookies from the 2003 draft played , and six started at least one game the rookie dan klecko started one game at nose tackle , but also played linebacker and fullback and the back end of the roster was always subject to tinkering larry centers , who started at fullback in the third and fourth games of the season , was released on oct 18 , resigned dec 10 and was starting again against the jets on dec 20 coaches spent considerable time every week debating the inactive list i think we have more transactions than any team in the league , especially that bottom half of the roster , said matt chatham , a special teams player who started four games at linebacker they 'll mess with guys all year long we 're a gameplan team we like to do something different each week , so you have to have that flexibility with guys it s geared toward guys that are able to do multiple things when the patriots won the super bowl after the 2001 season , they thrived with a few dominant stars and after a huge personnel change replacing quarterback drew bledsoe with brady after bledsoe was hurt it was the decision that shaped that season the patriots have made several of them this season this team has really meshed , ashworth said that s the big part we may not be the most talented team in the league but we play well together
a gift under our christmas tree was a twodvd album of david bowie s collected videos mr bowie has been a composer of songs and their video visualization for 32 years , since his earliest efforts for the bbc , and video vignette after video vignette was both musically appealing and visually engaging yet after a dozen of them my interest waned too many discrete songs , one after the other , is like reading a joke book or eating candies they do n't make an album , or a novel , or a meal which got me to thinking about popular music and its decadeslong , stumbling quest for a successful extended form when i retired myself as chief rock critic of this newspaper in 1980 , one reason was the tiresome predictability of the same short song structures , the same idioms , the same mannerisms the bedrock of tradition is one thing the deep rut of routine quite another not that pop composers have n't tried to stretch out we 've had rock operas , like the who s tommy or neil young s recent greendale , which were really successions of songs , even if they told a story in that sense they were like the concept albums , first lp s and later cd s , in which musicians tried to set a mood \( frank sinatra s premiere collection of lostlove ballads , only the lonely \) , create a world \( the beatles' sgt pepper s lonely heart s club band \) or make a statement \( pink floyd s wall \) but there seems now to be a widespread fear , in this era of the downloading of singles on the internet , that the album as a marketable package and artistic statement is slipping away the whole music business is in trouble , but album sales declined 20 percent over the last three years , reports nielsen soundscan people want to grab the songs they particularly like , free or for 99 cents , burn them onto their own cd s in their own order and ignore the rest i see the demise as inevitable , david bowie himself said , as quoted in the dallas morning news for some rock 'n' roll purists this is merely a restoration of the true and natural order of the universe rock was originally about singles , and a lot of albums consisted , or consist , of padding around a couple of hits the padding became all the more patent when albums expanded from the lp s 40minute length to the cd s 70 minutes if the album goes away , so , some might hope , will pop padding , pretension and pomposity take that , all you hopeless english artrock bands of the 70 s , like emerson , lake and palmer , and all the way up to paul mccartney s clueless requiem when technically limited pop artists try to emulate orchestral classics as david byrne did in his music to robert wilson s forest or as stewart copeland did in his dreadful opera holy blood and crescent moon they either turn their skeletal song inspirations over to hack classical arrangers or they ape the surface characteristics of classical music with none of its muscle and heart yet artists and the public have shown a perennial need for music that transcends a three or fourminute limit in instrumental music , that s not so hard , as any number of jazz or disco and techno numbers or blearyeared jams \( the grateful dead \) attest through sheer , dogged repetition of their basic elements on a more artistically elevated level , the folk guitarist john fahey showed and the jazz pianist keith jarrett shows a wonderful skill in knitting together fragments of music into albumlength improvisations \( mr jarrett s k ln concert \) but songs with lyrics are harder to expand , unless instrumentally fleshed out \( led zeppelin s stairway to heaven \) songs knit together sequentially are a revue , or a musical songs more seamlessly knit become modernday opera that was why i found jeanine tesori s score for her collaboration with tony kushner , caroline , or change , so promising this has been billed as a musical , and may well move as such to broadway from the public theater but lovers of olderfashioned musicals remain puzzled by it they lament the score s lack of hummable tunes , even if they profess respect for ms tesori s work they fret that it s chilly and emotionally distant , even confusing , as pop idioms are juggled from \( embedded \) song to fragment to snippet what ms tesori has done is to create a successful pop longform composition an opera if you will there are plenty of moments when her singers can rear back and belt , even if not all the singers at the public have the vocal chops to do so but what s ingenious is the continuity of the text and music , the way everything flows together at no cost \( to my ears \) to the vitality of the moment it s exciting to read that ms tesori and mr kushner have planned more projects together on one hand this kind of work i'm also thinking of fellow newmusicals composers like michael john lachiusa , stephen flaherty , jason robert brown , adam guettel and most recently stephin merritt , although some of these are so far sticking with linked songs represents a new fusion of the musical and opera this is a subject already much written about , going all the way back to virgil thomson and george gershwin to kurt weill and gian carlo menotti in the 50 s through leonard bernstein and on to stephen sondheim but maybe the lines of influence can flow the other way , whereby composers of musicals can help invigorate pop music there would be a certain symmetry in this rock 'n' roll arose in the 50 s as a challenge to pop standards , which were \( in often debased form \) the songs from the golden age of the american musical if composers like ms tesori can circle around and inspire a pop composer like , say , alicia keys to stretch herself beyond the singles format , everyone might profit these new longform composers will need to keep themselves communicative , connected to some kind of real and viable audience sheer performing or composing virtuosity can please musicians but alienate audiences a pop composer of extended forms needs to know not just the vast range of musical idioms now suitable for transformation , but also the harmonic and theoretical underpinnings needed to effect such transformations yet all that knowledge ca n't usurp the need to thrill people or move them or fascinate them learning must be worn lightly in this time of crisis for pop music and the popmusic business , it s time for a rethinking of basic assumptions , even at the price of a little pomposity the album as a set of loosely linked songs may be moribund but long live the album , or the stage , as a home for a new kind of popular music , one that appeals equally to head and heart
the bipartisan commission investigating the sept 11 terrorist attacks further called into question on wednesday one of president bush s rationales for the war with iraq , and again put him on the defensive over an issue the white house was once confident would be a political plus in questioning the extent of any ties between iraq and al qaeda , the commission weakened the already spotty scorecard on mr bush s justifications for sending the military to topple saddam hussein banned biological and chemical weapons none yet found percentage of iraqis who view americanled forces as liberators 2 , according to a poll commissioned last month by the coalition provisional authority number of possible al qaeda associates known to have been in iraq in recent years one , abu musab alzarqawi , whose links to the terrorist group and mr hussein s government remain sketchy that is the difficult reality mr bush faces 15 months after ordering the invasion of iraq , and less than five months before he faces the voters at home the commission s latest findings fueled fresh partisan attacks on his credibility and handling of the war , attacks that now seem unlikely to be silenced even if the return of sovereignty to the iraqis comes off successfully in two weeks senator john kerry , the presumed democratic presidential nominee , was quick to seize on the commission s report to reprise his contention that mr bush misled the american people about the need for the war even some independentminded members of mr bush s own party said they sensed danger the problem the administration has is that the predicates it laid down for the war have not played out , said warren b rudman , the former republican senator from new hampshire , who has extensive experience in assessing intelligence about terrorism that could spell political trouble for the president , there s no question mr bush has said that he knows of no direct involvement by mr hussein and his government in the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon but the president has repeatedly asserted that there were ties between iraq and al qaeda , a position he stuck to on tuesday when he was asked about vice president dick cheney s statement a day earlier that mr hussein had longestablished ties with al qaeda mr bush pointed specifically on tuesday to the presence in iraq of mr zarqawi , a jordanian jihadist who sought help from al qaeda in waging the antiamerican insurgency after the fall of mr hussein , and who has been implicated by american intelligence officials in the killing of nicholas berg , the 26yearold american who was beheaded by militants in iraq in march the white house said wednesday that there was a distinction between mr bush s position and the commission s determination that iraq did not cooperate with al qaeda on attacks on the united states the commission s report did not specifically address that distinction or mr zarqawi s role it found that an iraqi intelligence officer met with osama bin laden in sudan in 1994 , but that iraq never responded to mr bin laden s subsequent request for space to set up training camps and help in buying weapons it said there were reports of later contacts between iraq and al qaeda , but they do not appear to have resulted in a collaborative relationship it quoted two senior associates of mr bin laden denying adamantly that any ties existed between al qaeda and iraq it concluded that there never was a meeting in prague between an iraqi intelligence officer and mohammed atta , the leader of the sept 11 hijackers in an interview with national public radio in january , mr cheney cited intelligence reports about the possibility of such a meeting in asserting that there was not confirmation one way or another about links between iraq and the sept 11 attacks democratic strategists said there was now no question that mr bush would be dogged through the rest of the campaign by questions about whether the war was necessary , justified and sufficiently well planned but mr bush s supporters said that in political terms , the amazing thing was how well he had weathered the problems thrown at him by iraq if you look at the last eight months at the white house and in particular the last 90 days , i 've never seen more negative stories come out in a concentrated period , said sig rogich , a veteran republican advertising consultant and fundraiser yet despite all that , the president is still even with john kerry or , if you count the electoral college votes in the battleground states , ahead then there s a creeping plus for george bush , which is that the economy is taking off james m lindsay of the council on foreign relations , who studies the interplay between foreign policy and domestic politics , said the issue now was less whether mr bush was wrong in asserting a tie between iraq and al qaeda than whether he could stabilize iraq and show progress in bringing american forces home does the commission s finding make it easier for the democrats to say , look , the administration got it wrong \? mr lindsay said the answer is yes but the bigger question for the administration is whether it can succeed in getting iraq to be stable if it does that it will largely neutralize the threat the iraq issue poses to the president s reelection the commission s findings were the latest in a string of iraqrelated developments this year that have kept mr bush s campaign on the defensive , helping mr kerry during a period when the white house s political strategy had hoped he would be especially vulnerable the official white house strategy for wednesday may have been to deny any real differences with the commission but on this day as on many others recently , its real goal appeared to be to stick a bandage on whatever wound it might have suffered , keep moving toward june 30 , when the united states will return sovereignty to the iraqis , and then bank on its ability to redefine the election on terms more favorable to mr bush in one indication of the white house s doggedness , mr bush s campaign manager , ken mehlman , held a conference call with reporters about the same time the commission was delivering its description of the sept 11 plot his topic the economy

new amsterdam , circa 1655 asser levy , a member of the first little colony of jews that arrived from brazil to escape religious persecution , petitions peter stuyvesant , the governor of the colony , for the right to join the local militia in what proved to be one of the first official acts of antisemitism in america , stuyvesant refused an autocratic man with a peg leg , he was determined to drive all jews , catholics and blacks out of new amsterdam when levy refused to pay the tax in support of a militia he could not join , stuyvesant threatened to put him in jail and did put him in jail , said rabbi alvin kass , chief chaplain of the new york police department ultimately , stuyvesant proved to be no match for levy , who won the right to join the militia and went on to become the patron saint of jewish police officers in america it was rabbi kass s idea to celebrate what he calls 350 years of jews in law enforcement , an event that the police department will sponsor tomorrow at one police plaza the event will also commemorate the 80th anniversary of the shomrim society \( shomrim is the hebrew word for police officer \) , a fraternal order of jewish officers and civilians within the department i'm trying to make the case that being a cop is a job for a jewish boy , and that jewish cops have made contributions to the city , said rabbi kass , who looks a little like eddie cantor and seems to have the entire folklore of jewish police officers at his fingertips noting that there are currently 1 , 500 to 2 , 000 jewish officers in a department 36 , 000 strong , he added , we 've had great writers , great musicians , and we 've also had great cops there s an air of mystery about asser levy , who may have been a marrano , someone who converted to catholicism in order to survive , but was able to practice judaism again once he landed in new amsterdam he has a recreation center and a tiny street in manhattan , at east 23rd street , near the fdr drive , named after him , along with a seaside park in brighton beach , brooklyn new york would have to wait 250 years to have another heroic jewish cop he arrived during the time of theodore roosevelt , who reigned as police commissioner between 1895 and 1897 the police department had become an irish bailiwick , its officers appointed by the politicians of tammany hall roosevelt hoped to end all this the first fight i made was to keep politics absolutely out of the force , he wrote in theodore roosevelt an autobiography he was introduced , he went on , to a jew named otto raphael , a powerful fellow , with goodhumored , intelligent face , who had rushed into a burning building to rescue several women and children raphael was an amateur boxer from the lower east side roosevelt invited him to take the policeman s exam raphael would rise to the rank of lieutenant and become roosevelt s sparring partner and lifelong friend but few other jewish lieutenants had a rabbi in the white house the department remained an irish bailiwick , with officers such as johnny broderick , broadway s own detective , who once stuffed the bootlegger and gunman legs diamond into a garbage can irish detectives were often succeeded by their sons the jewish cop was an alien in an irish universe enter albert seedman , the first , last and only jewish chief of detectives it s the 1970 s , and chief seedman is all over the place , tough , flamboyant and foulmouthed , constantly chomping on a cigar , appearing at the scene of important crimes he seemed more irish than the irish , as if he had coopted their territory , their language , their domain chief seedman is the jewish policeman i remember , and it was partly because of him that i began writing crime novels suddenly the police department was familiar ground , with a warmth and a wildness i 'd encountered growing up in my own badland of the bronx he appears in one of my books as barney rosenblatt , aka cowboy , a jewish chief of detectives with his own squad of killerangels in long leather coats he wears a colt with his name and rank engraved near the trigger , and a holster with a little leather beard at the bottom , like buffalo bill chief seedman grew up on fox street , near st mary s park , a haven for irish gangs and one of the toughest neighborhoods in the south bronx but he himself did n't have a tough time it was a jewish block , he explained , and jewish kids did n't fight after studying accounting at city college , he joined the department in 1941 i did n't get the choice assignments , he admitted i think it was because i was jewish i let it slide off my back but he did rise through the ranks to many people it felt as if he was chief of detectives forever , but he served only from 1971 to 1972 he was a kind of magnet that kept drawing publicity to himself there were articles about him everywhere he was always out in the field , always talking to the press , in part because he had become the department spokesman for what he called frontpage crimes in 1972 alexander s hired chief seedman away as vice president in charge of security for all its 15 stores but even after he left , the myth surrounding him endured young jewish cops used to come up to him and thank him they joined the force after reading about me in the papers he was the jewish goliath who seemed to stride over an irish army elson gelfand , a retired deputy chief , confirms this when he joined the department in the 50 s , he recalled , there was not a single jewish policeman above the rank of captain he joined the shomrim society , which had 2 , 200 members then and now has 2 , 500 the shomrim society is a muscular dwarf compared with the holy name society of catholic officers \( the department is 85 percent catholic \) , but rabbi kass has his own particular magic and charm chief seedman remembers being on a panel that interviewed rabbi kass for the post of police chaplain \( and chaplain of the shomrim society \) in 1966 chief seedman recalls rabbi kass , a former air force chaplain , as a skinny little man with an attach case he could n't make up his mind about him but after the interview , seedman asked him what he was carrying in the attach case rabbi kass opened it and revealed handball gloves and a pair of sneakers he was going from the interview to a handball game chief seedman voted to hire him as the department s third jewish chaplain the first , rabbi abraham blum , had been appointed in 1906 , after roosevelt opened the police to new york s ethnic minorities the shomrim society has been a sanctuary for jewish officers since it was founded in 1924 with an enrollment of 214 it was something to identify with so i would n't get lost among all the irish and italians , said chief gelfand , who was its president in 1984 otherwise i would have been adrift when i pointed out that shomrim cop was police argot for someone with a soft , cushy desk job , he bristled that irritates me , he said it s not true but it was the perception that mattered , and that s why jewish cops needed their own goliath , albert seedman , the accountant who hated to sit behind a desk one detective who worked under seedman was my own brother , harvey charyn harvey was the main reason i survived the bronx all my friends were beaten up by irish and italian gangs i 'd be walking with a friend and suddenly there was a whirlwind around me , as the person i was with lost his pants and his wallet , but i was left alone , like some magical leper none of these neighborhood bandits wanted to tangle with my brother , who was unaffiliated , without the credentials of a gang , but would fight them collectively or one at a time he was always fighting , always coming home with a torn shirt , a bloody mouth or a black eye but his jewishness was n't celebrated rabbi kass may talk of some maccabean spirit that hovers around jewish policemen , but my brother was regarded with bewilderment there was only one way to measure him strong as a goy , neighbors crooned with a slight derision their own sons became rocket scientists , their daughters nurses and housewives compared with my brother i always felt like richard iii , some clever humpbacked thing who surpassed him in the end he was the one who read books , but i became the writer he painted and drew , but i was the one who got accepted by the high school of music and art there was only one narrow route for harvey become a gangster or a cop he chose the lesser of two evils he was worried about the height requirement in the 50 s , a cop had to be 5 feet 8 , and my brother was missing an eighth of an inch i remember how he would stretch on the floor like plastic man he passed the exam in june 1958 , in a ceremony at the police academy , he was awarded the bloomingdale trophy , a blue revolver with his name engraved on it for having the highest general average in shooting and in academic and physical prowess i 've got a picture showing harvey accepting his blue gun in the presence of mayor robert wagner that year i was a junior at columbia college , having conned my way into a colloquium of great books that included a future nobel prize winner how i gloated ! i would have a talmudic life of words , would go into hell with dante alighieri , and tilt at all manner of strange missiles with don quixote , while harvey , poor harvey , had nothing but a ceremonial gun yet there was something about the police that appealed to me the sadness , the long silence of men and women who had terrific street smarts but were like children away from the street the language of violence seemed to have crawled under their skin it rendered them shy in almost every other situation , made them suspicious of the world outside their expertise i sensed this shyness in david wadler , the sergeant in charge of the 350 years celebration he 'd grown up on coney island his dad was a butcher \( like asser levy \) he 'd always had a passion for the police i never realized that police officers were n't jewish i asked sergeant wadler how many current jewish cops had children who were cops he could n't answer the department does n't keep such statistics ten or twenty , was his guess clearly , jewish police officers were n't creating their own dynasty but harvey charyn was the exception his son , howard , is also a cop and therefore not part of that epic tale whereby jews of one generation strove to have their sons surpass them in some mythical ladder of success , and move snakelike into the upper regions of the middle class still , lieutenant howard charyn is on the captains' list \( he has passed the exam and is waiting for other captains to retire \) , and i can feel the tenderness he has for his father , a hard man to be tender about at school i was proud to say what my father did , my nephew says kids wanted to hear about harvey none of their dads was a cop , and certainly not a cop with a gold shield , who retired as a firstgrade detective , a rank almost impossible to achieve in the mandarin world of the new york police department harvey reflects the curious quandary of most jewish cops , civilian soldiers who are n't quite sure where they fit jewish police officers resemble nonjewish officers more than they resemble other jews , said rabbi kass , himself an assistant chief with a twostar rank , like a major general but new york is a town of tummelers , of men and women with big mouths , and jewish cops should have been the biggest tummelers of them all , like cowboy rosenblatt , my imagined chief of detectives i had to find a tummeler , and i found two felicia shpritzer and gertrude schimmel , heroic jewish cops who took on the department and defended the rights of all women officers women had always had a hard time being with the police they started out as matrons who guarded female prisoners the first six policewomen , appointed in 1918 , were completely segregated from the men , in a women s bureau that was like its own little police department the absurdity of this was highlighted in 1943 when mayor fiorello la guardia issued all policewomen a black shoulder bag that had enough room for a holster and a makeup kit use the gun as you would your lipstick , la guardia said do n't overdo either one then ms shpritzer and ms schimmel came along neither would tolerate the glass ceiling that kept women behind as men moved up in the ranks they sued the city , and in 1965 they became the department s first female sergeants ms shpritzer is no longer alive , but i was able to speak to ms schimmel , who is 85 she could have been a character in grace paley s story the loudest voice , about a little girl who can rock an auditorium with the sound of her voice born into a poor family on tinton avenue in the south bronx , she went to morris high school and hunter college it was january 1939 , and she wanted to become a high school english teacher , but because of the depression , no high school english teacher had been hired in 10 years she and her friends took all the civil service exams , including the policewoman s exam there were 200 vacancies , but over 11 , 000 women filed for the exam she was part of the famous class of june 1940 that graduated 300 policemen and 18 policewomen , a class that included teachers , lawyers and one phd it was the first class of police officers that had a large number of jews , she remembered most of the 318 moved up the ranks only six men in the class remained patrolmen she never found much antisemitism in the department but the glass ceiling remained , and not until after three years of litigation could ms shpritzer and ms schimmel sit for the sergeant s exam ms schimmel eventually became a deputy chief she was also prepared to protest the glass ceiling within the shomrim society we could n't be members until 1960 , she recalled , because the organization had its own cemetery , and its older members did n't want the husbands of women officers to be buried among them her story suggests all the contradictions of new york , a city filled with the controlled chaos of nearly eight million souls , with a police department that is part of this chaos yet sees itself as apart from it as a jew , my brother harvey told me , i had to be as tough or tougher than the other guys i had to be the first to go through the door and jewish chiefs like albert seedman could have a mythical toughness the police department is no longer an irish bailiwick it is more modern , more tactical , with fewer racial and ethnic divides , but it still has to patrol the same maddening city , a city that screams its head off , even if that head no longer belongs to some mythical jewish chief jerome charyn is the author of 10 crime novels featuring a jewish police commissioner , among them el bronx , citizen sidel and four titles reissued as the isaac quartet his latest novel , the green lantern a romance of stalinist russia , will be published this fall by thunder s mouth press
green bay , wis , oct 3 slowly , silently , the green bay packers trudged down the long hallway from the field to their locker room , heads down , not a smile among them after their third consecutive loss briefly , a roar went up from near the entrance to the tunnel it could have been for only one player brett favre added to his legend sunday with what may soon become known as the concussion throw , a 28yard touchdown pass to javon walker in the third quarter , just three plays after banging his head when defensive lineman william joseph drove him to the lambeau field turf packers coach mike sherman said favre was a little cloudy after the hit by joseph , and the packers' medical staff wanted him out of the game but while doug pederson was in for the next two plays , sherman said he asked favre if he felt ok , without consulting the team doctor or trainer for favre , who was already playing with a sore left shoulder and left hamstring , that was akin to asking a fox if it would like 20 minutes alone in a henhouse he said yeah , and he threw the touchdown pass , sherman said the doctors told me after that they did n't want to put him back in the game the doctors had n't exactly cleared him so i was in error by putting him back in the game sherman did not know if favre , who extended his nfl record for quarterbacks with his 214th consecutive start \( including playoffs \) , could play next week i have n't talked to the doctors , he said favre was not available to reporters after the game by game s end , he was alert enough to motion for the thirdstring quarterback , craig nall , to spike the ball in the final seconds , but he was apparently foggy on other things he did n't even remember the touchdown play , said giants quarterback kurt warner , who spoke briefly with favre coming off the field favre s teammates , however , could not forget the rest of the game favre s throw provided their only points in a 147 loss , leaving the packers 13 , and 02 at lambeau field , where they used to be nearly unbeatable they were 6812 at home in the 10 seasons before this one green bay had never lost three straight in sherman s tenure as coach , which began in 2000 and green bay is under 500 after four games for the first time since 1993 , favre s second season as the starter i'm frustrated because i 've never been 13 , said fullback william henderson , a packer since 1995 i'm not going to sit here and tell you i'm happy with 13 neither , clearly , were the 70 , 623 fans who jammed lambeau on a windy and brilliantly sunny fall day they booed tight end david martin for juggling and dropping a pederson pass on thirdand11 with about 11 minutes to play , when the packers were behind by a touchdown they grumbled at the ineptness of green bay s offense with pederson , who finished 7 of 17 for 86 yards with an interception we did some things , but then we kind of sputtered at times , pederson said it was kind of the theme all day although green bay s defense looked better than it did a week earlier at indianapolis when the colts opened with 22 consecutive pass plays and put up five firsthalf touchdowns it had massive breakdowns at times overpursuit enabled tiki barber to break loose for the tying touchdown , a 52yard run , just 50 seconds after favre s touchdown throw and barber s 38yard burst on the first play of the fourth quarter helped lead to jeremy shockey s gamewinning touchdown catch the secondary has been a particular source of frustration for packers fans the veteran cornerback mike mckenzie held out for all of training camp , then pulled a hamstring he did not play sunday and the rookies ahmad carroll and joey thomas came to blows during a meeting of defensive backs two weeks ago none of this plays well in the land of lombardi , where nothing less than at least a third consecutive division title will do it s unfamiliar territory for them and for us , sherman said it s unacceptable when you sign up as a green bay packers football player , you are expected to win when you lose , it better hurt , because it hurts a lot of people but you better get it fixed , and get it fixed fast
president bush swept to an apparent popularvote victory over senator john kerry last night , and seemed headed toward winning enough electoral college votes to assure his reelection but in what was shaping up as a midwest replay of 2000 , mr kerry s campaign challenged the results in ohio and said it would not abandon the campaign until all the votes in that critical state were counted mr bush s aides said early this morning that they were convinced that he had won ohio which , combined with his victory in florida , would guarantee him a second term but at 2 30 this morning , senator john edwards of north carolina , mr kerry s running mate , made a brief and dramatic appearance in front of a huge crowd of supporters at copley square in boston to announce that he and mr kerry would not concede it s been a long time but we 've waited four years for this victory , he said to thousands of people who earlier had been expecting mr kerry to be delivering a victory speech on that very spot we can wait one more night in what sounded like a hint of concerted legal action ahead , mr edwards added tersely john kerry and i made a promise to the american people that in this election , every vote would count and every vote would be counted tonight , we are keeping our word as of 2 am this morning , mr bush had 2 , 685 , 059 votes , compared with 2 , 564 , 047 for mr kerry , or an edge of 121 , 012 votes mr kerry s aides said that they believed the vote could be turned around once provisional ballots those submitted by people who were unable to vote because their names not on registration rolls had been tallied the vote count in ohio has not been completed , said mary beth cahill , mr kerry s campaign manager there are more than 250 , 000 remaining votes to be counted we believe when they are , john kerry will win ohio the dispute provided a chaotic conclusion to a long gyrating night of counting that vividly recalled the turmoil of four years ago in addition to the problem in ohio , iowa officials said that they would do a recount in that state , where mr bush had a lead of 11 , 000 with 94 percent of the vote counted an evening of confusion and deflation for mr kerry s aides and democrats across the country caused in no small part by surveys of voters leaving the polls , which showed mr kerry leading mr bush by as much as 3 percentage points nationally with 86 percent of the vote counted , mr bush was leading mr kerry 51 percent to 48 percent americans turned out in big numbers to vote , according to officials from both parties , lining up at polling places across the country from ohio to florida , from new york to minnesota in an evocative conclusion to one of the most emotionally charged campaigns in a century polls taken up to the eve of the election showed mr bush tied with mr kerry , and party officials suggested that the turnout in this hardfought election could match the modernday record of 63 percent set in 1960 in ohio , lines were so long that some polling places stayed open past the 7 30 pm closing time one in seven people who voted yesterday did not participate in the 2000 election , and 60 percent of those voters said they supported mr kerry , according to surveys of voters leaving the polls and throughout the day , republicans appeared concerned by the images of long lines of americans waiting to vote , particularly in cities and in areas with large numbers of minority voters a survey of voters leaving the polls suggested that the turnout was at least partly inspired by anger among democrats lingering from mr bush s disputed victory in 2000 but white house officials said they remained confident that the republicans' own turnout effort aimed at evangelical christians who mr bush s advisers believed had failed to vote in 2000 would counter the opposition to mr bush , and prevent him from facing the fate of his father , who lost reelection to bill clinton in 1992 mr bush won florida , seizing one of the big three states that have become the focus of both parties for much of the year and the state that was at the emotional fulcrum of the battle of 2000 mr kerry won the second of those three states , pennsylvania , and the two men were engaged in what could well prove to be a climactic fight in ohio for all the concern before the voting about irregularities at the polls , there were few reports of problems as night fell across the country , even in states where mr kerry and mr bush had dispatched squads of lawyers , all briefed up but with no courts to go to late last night even before the polls had closed in nevada and iowa , two particularly competitive states mr bush summoned reporters and photographers to white house residence where he was watching election results with his family , including his father , the former president we 're very upbeat , thank you , mr bush said i believe i will win a little while later , a senior kerry adviser , joe lockhart , appeared before reporters to say much the same thing the first state that we believe will flip is new hampshire , mr lockhart said , referring to a state that mr bush won in 2000 and that democrats are confident of winning this time but as the night churned on , facing excruciatingly close tallies in ohio , wisconsin , new mexico and iowa , aides to mr bush and mr kerry were contemplating another inconclusive election night , though none suggested they were facing a repeat of the 36day count of 2000 we 're counting all the votes , said mike mccurry , mr kerry s chief spokesman at the end of the day , we win i'm not sure what day , but we win ralph nader , the independent candidate who many democrats believe effectively handed the white house to mr bush in 2000 by drawing votes from al gore , was winning a minimal number of votes and did not appear to be a factor in the outcome of the race it was an appropriately chaotic end or nearend of the 2004 campaign in many ways began the night in december 2000 when the united states supreme court effectively declared mr bush the nation s 43rd president it took place during one of the most difficult periods of the nation s history , framed by the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon that took place less than one year into mr bush s term the attacks shaped not only mr bush s first term as president , but also his reelection campaign against mr kerry in a sign of the intensity of the contest , both mr bush and mr kerry took the unusual step of campaigning right through election day mr kerry began his day visiting a campaign office in lacrosse , wis , while mr bush brought air force one into columbus , ohio , for one last visit to a state he won in 2000 , but where he was struggling for victory again no republican has won the presidency without winning ohio mr bush flew to ohio from texas , and he dropped in on the state s bushcheney headquarters in columbus to thank campaign workers at one point mr bush took the phone from a volunteer , mick turner , who was making calls urging voters to get to the polls , and said julie this is president bush calling how are you \? no , i promise you it s me mr bush then put one finger in his other ear to hear her better and said i'm proud to have your support i appreciate you taking my phone call thank you so very much mr bush then hung up and said to reporters , 1 to 0 mr bush voted in crawford , tex , at 8 am with his wife and twin daughters the president s eyes were puffy from a 19hour , sevenstop , sixstate campaign swing the day before , and he appeared calm if wistful as he talked to reporters this election is in the hands of the people , and i feel very comfortable about that , he said the people know where i stand i 've enjoyed this campaign it s been a fantastic experience traveling our country , talking about what i believe and where i'm going to lead this country for four more years asked if he had any words for mr kerry , the president responded i wish him all the best you know , he and i are in the exact same position we 've given it our all and i'm i'm sure he is happy , like i am , that the campaign has come to a conclusion in wisconsin , which al gore won in 2000 , mr kerry went to an office to pump up supporters before heading home to boston , where he cast his ballot with his daughters before lunching , as he has every election day he has run for office since his first victory in 1982 , at the union oyster house this campaign has been an amazing journey , a wonderful journey , he told reporters after emerging from the polling place at the historic statehouse downtown the american people have put their homes , their hearts to us mr kerry , at once nostalgic and exuberant , said that he was very confident that we made the case for change , but that what s really important is that the president and i both love this country whatever the outcome tonight , he added , i know one thing that is already an outcome our country will be stronger , our country will be united , and we will move forward , no matter what , because that s who we are as americans and that s what we need to do this campaign came to a conclusion even an uncertain one shaped by the three forces that had formed it from the beginning the attacks of sept 11 , the disputed election of 2000 and the war in iraq from the start of this contest , mr kerry presented himself as the democrat best able to take on mr bush because of his record as a vietnam veteran which , he said , would allow him to hold his own with the president on security issues , and turn the campaign to what he argued would be strong ground for democrats domestic issues with the economy struggling and the war in iraq going off course , mr bush increasingly built his campaign around the threat of terrorism , invoking the symbols of the attack on the world trade center and portraying mr kerry as not having the strength to stand up to terrorist attacks the survey of voters leaving the polls found that mr bush did indeed enjoy a big advantage over mr kerry on the issue of terrorism but it also showed that a majority now believed that the war had gone badly off course , and had jeopardized the longterm security of the united states and while mr bush was seen as much better able to protect the nation from terrorist attacks than mr kerry was , the survey suggested that in the end , domestic issues like health care and job creation were critical factors in the choices of many americans , and many of those voters were going to mr kerry both parties had identified getoutthevote efforts as critical to victory in an election where poll after poll showed mr kerry and mr bush evenly matched for democrats , it was a matter of building on the anger still burning from 2000 for mr bush s chief strategist , karl rove , it was a matter of motivating what he said was four million evangelicals who had not been there for mr bush in 2000 , and who would respond to a campaign appeal that was built to a large extent by trying to paint cultural differences with mr kerry on such issues as gay marriage and abortion rights mr rove appears to have had at least some success on that count the surveys found that voters cited three issues as central in making their decision the economy , terrorism and moral issues , and mr bush won among voters who cited moral issues

when ed schwebel was whittling down his mound of credit card debt at an interest rate of 92 percent , the mbna corporation had a happy and profitable customer but this summer , when mbna suddenly doubled the rate on his account , mr schwebel joined the growing ranks of irate cardholders stunned by lenders' harsh tactics mr schwebel , 58 , a semiretired software engineer in gilbert , ariz , was not pleased that his minimum monthly payment jumped from 502 in june to 895 in july but what really made him angry , he said , was the sense that he was being punished despite having held up his end of the bargain with mbna i paid the bills the minute the envelope hit the desk , said mr schwebel , who had accumulated 69 , 000 in debt over five years before the rate increase all of a sudden in july , they swapped it to 18 percent no warning no reason it was like i was blindsided mr schwebel had stumbled into the new era of consumer credit , in which thousands of americans are paying millions of dollars each month in fees that they did not expect and that strike them as unreasonable invoking clauses tucked into the fine print of their contract agreements , lenders are doubling or tripling interest rates with little warning or explanation this year , credit card companies are changing the terms of their accounts at a historically high rate , said michael heller , an industry consultant as those practices spread , they are creating a rift between the lenders and some of their more lucrative customers , according to cardholders , current and former bank consultants and regulators who were interviewed for a joint report by the new york times and frontline , the pbs documentary program people like mr schwebel , who carry balances from month to month and pay finance charges regularly , feel they should be the favored customers of the credit card business , which is now the most lucrative segment of banking they make up the profitable majority of the 144 million americans who have generalpurpose credit cards to a degree , they subsidize the 40 percent of credit card customers who pay in full each month without incurring any fees or charges but increasingly , they say , what should be a warm embrace has turned into a painful squeeze as lenders employ new tactics to extract more and bigger penalties for even the slightest financial transgressions in the last few years , lenders have more frequently raised customers' rates because of slipups elsewhere , like late payment of a phone or utility bill , or simply because they felt a customer had taken on too much debt the practice , called universal default , started after a rash of bankruptcy filings in the midtolate 1990 s and has increasingly become standard in the industry while mbna declined to comment on any specific customer s account , its general counsel , louis j freeh , the former fbi director , said in a statement that it was being prudent by raising rates when it had reason to think the risk of not being repaid had increased edward l yingling , executive vice president of the american bankers association , said bankers must have the flexibility to change terms on short notice the bankruptcy filings of the 90 s many by customers who had been paying their bills on time caught banks offguard , he said lenders decided they needed to watch for signs of trouble elsewhere , like missed car payments , he said in those cases , he added , there are only two logical responses we 're not going to let you have this credit card loan anymore and we 're going to say , 'pay it off , ' or we can say , 'you 're now more risky we 're going to raise your rate ' still , some critics say the severity of the punishment does not match the risk of default the suddenness and perceived unfairness of the penalties have left many consumers feeling burned by lenders who relentlessly courted them with promises of low rates to some cardholders and consumer advocates , credit card companies are acting like modernday loan sharks , strongarming their customers to pay more with no legal limit on how much they can charge in eight years , the major card companies have increased the fee charged to cardholders for being even an hour late with a payment to 39 , from 10 or less unleashing an industry duncan macdonald , who , as a lawyer for citibank was involved in its successful case for deregulation of fees before the united states supreme court in 1996 , now says he fears that he helped to unleash a monster until that ruling , most banks still charged an annual fee of about 25 for the use of a card and a single fixed rate to all borrowers , usually around 18 percent applicants either qualified for the privilege of carrying a card or they did not i certainly did n't imagine that someday we might 've ended up creating a frankenstein , said mr macdonald , who predicted that the penalty fees could rise to 50 in another year i look at that and i say to myself , 'is 50 a fair fee , plus a 25 percent interest rate and all these other fees that are thrown on , for folks who are probably not that risky \? is that fair \? ' mr macdonald said federal bank regulators should investigate the fairness of universal default and some of the banks' harsh penalties but regulators and lawmakers have been reluctant to crack down on a popular consumer product that fuels america s economic engine consumer spending pulled the country through the last economic downturn , powered largely by purchases financed with debt , to the tune of 2 trillion few consumer products today are as cherished or reviled as credit cards the typical household has eight cards with 7 , 500 on them people like mr schwebel are known as revolvers in the industry because they roll balances over from month to month , never paying in full without the 85 million americans who revolve , card issuers would be struggling to please their investors but with them and the hefty finance charges they accrue from the moment cashiers swipe their cards , the industry is reaping record gains last year , card issuers made 25 billion a month in profit before taxes i think it is generally understood that those that use the revolving part of the credit card are kind of the sweet spot , said mr yingling of the bankers' association , who spoke on behalf of several of the biggest issuers , including citigroup , jp morgan chase and mbna , all of which declined to make executives available for interviews but the lenders' aggressive tactics have prompted a surge in complaints and lawsuits and even a warning from the primary regulator of national banks in september in an advisory letter , the office of the comptroller of the currency said banks should not raise card rates without having fully and prominently disclosed the circumstances that might cause an increase the case that opened up the industry came in 1978 when the supreme court decided that a bank could charge its cardholders any rate allowed in the bank s home state major banks swiftly moved their credit card operations to places like south dakota and delaware that had removed caps on interest rates there is no federal limit on consumer credit rates changing the terms after that ruling on interest rates , credit cards , which until then had generally been an uncertain business , started to look potentially lucrative banks began to innovate and compete they cut the required minimum monthly payment to 2 percent of the balance , from 5 percent , to encourage customers to borrow more and stretch out the repayment they dropped annual fees and dangled offers of low interest , or none at all , to lure new customers at the same time , legal teams crafted contracts of 12 or more singlespaced pages that gave the banks the leeway to change their terms whenever they wanted a typical term sheet for a visa card issued by bank one , which was acquired this year by jp morgan chase , includes we reserve the right to change the terms at any time for any reason john gould has worked in and around the credit card business for 25 years , but he said he was shocked when his wife tried to make a lastminute payment over the phone and was charged an extra 15 what a rip , he said that does get me mad fees like that are accounting for a greater share of the revenue that card companies garner from their customers last year , they collected 117 billion in penalty fees , more than half of the total 215 billion in fees they collected from cardholders , according to cardweb , a research firm mr gould , a former executive of mastercard international who conducts research for towergroup , a company owned by mastercard , said he did not think that card companies were trying to trap people into financial distress but he said it was absurd that 44 percent of them tell their customers that they might be penalized for one or two late payments with maximum rates that now exceed 28 percent this practice has gone on while the shortterm interest rates set by the federal reserve board have been unusually low , now at 2 percent , he noted , but the rates have been rising in recent months what are they going to do if we have a spike in interest rates \? mr gould said what are they going to start charging people , 35 percent , 38 percent \? if it comes to that , you might as well go to the loan sharks but andrew kahr , a financial services consultant who devised some widely used consumerlending strategies , including the zeropercent teaser rates , said consumers should be able to recognize that the business is a game of chance interest rates shooting past 25 percent may seem scandalous to some , mr kahr said , but they are no less realistic than the low introductory rates many cardholders receive the lenders offer tantalizingly low initial rates because that is what it takes to lure customers from competitors , said mr kahr , who was a founder and chief executive , until 1986 , of the san francisco lending company now known as providian after he left , providian ran afoul of state and federal regulators for some of its credit card practices , and agreed to a 300 million settlement but , he said that banks cannot earn an adequate return by lending for less than it costs them to borrow , so they look for ways to recoup losses on the lowrate chasers they do better when they apply these price increases selectively to customers who statistically have become more risky , or to those who have violated the rules of the account , mr kahr said still , some cardholders complain that they did not know the rules until after they were punished for breaking them linda sherry , editorial director for consumer action , an advocacy group , said the consumer really has no rights to find out anything , to demand , 'why is this being done to me \? ' last month , a consumer advocacy group in san diego , the utility consumers' action network , filed suit against discover financial services , the issuer of the discover card , asserting that it had changed the rules late in the game the group contends that a recent rewording of discover s universaldefault policy is unfair to consumers , especially those in difficult financial situations the change , disclosed to cardholders in april , allowed discover to raise the interest rate to 1999 percent , from as low as zero , for a single late payment but the infraction did not have to follow the revision , because discover reserved the right to look back 11 months for a late payment that could justify the increase it has gotten to the point where the fine print is becoming almost outright abusive of their customers , said michael shames , executive director for the consumer group the customers who are affected most by this practice are those who , for one reason or another , are having trouble making payments and have a large balance jennifer kang , a spokeswoman for discover financial , said she could not comment because of the pending litigation discover executives declined repeated requests for an interview mr heller of argus information advisory services in white plains , the industry analyst who has studied the rate of change in credit card terms , said that his research showed that in the first half of this year , mbna the card issuer that doubled the interest rate for mr schwebel , the arizona engineer repriced a smaller share of its card accounts than the industry average but mbna , in the statement from mr freeh , said if we see indications that a customer is taking on too much debt , has missed or is late on payments to other creditors , or is otherwise mishandling their personal finances , it is not unreasonable to determine that this behavior is an increased risk in the interest of all of our customers , we must protect the portfolio by adjusting a customer s rate to compensate for that increased risk the credit score the interest rate on a credit card is theoretically correlated to the likelihood that a borrower will make good on his debts lenders typically measure those odds by a threedigit number known as a fico score calculated by and short for the fair isaac corporation , a company in minneapolis , that score has become the most vital of statistics to many americans credit scores are used to determine everything from how much a person can borrow to how much he or she pays for life insurance to whether he or she can rent a home a utility company in texas even experimented last summer with using credit scores to set prices for electricity the number crunchers at fair isaac do not make lending decisions they simply take information collected by the three largest creditreporting agencies , experian , equifax and transunion , and apply mathematical formulas to boil it down to a single number on a scale that runs to 850 lenders use that score , almost like a thermometer , to determine if they 're going to grant credit or not , said tom quinn , a spokesman for fair isaac he estimated that his company had calculated a credit score for about 75 percent of american adults the average fico score is 720 , he said a score below 620 lands a consumer in the riskiest category , known as subprime , and virtually ensures the highest borrowing rates , if the consumer can obtain any credit at all credit reports generally note only those payments made at least 30 days late consumers with betterthanaverage scores are usually , but not always , eligible for the lowest rates as steve strachan , a flower importer in york , pa , learned , a relatively high credit score does not guarantee favorable terms a thick credit report on mr strachan from january showed a fico score above 730 , but by then he had already been through a battle with the issuer of a card that had once been his favorite method of payment in the 1990 s , mr strachan traveled frequently from his home on the west coast to amsterdam and other foreign cities to meet with suppliers of tulips and exotic flower varieties that he distributed to domestic florists and wholesalers he obtained a worldperks visa card that rewarded him with seat upgrades through northwest airline s frequentflier program i used that card whenever i possibly could because of the travel benefits , he recalled , sitting in his living room before stacks of credit card bills , changeofterms notices and other correspondence between him and several lenders never paid a penny of interest he was such a valued customer then , he said , that us bank , which issued the card , had extended him a high credit limit of 54 , 000 even though the card rate was just one percentage point above the prime rate when the economy wilted after the collapse of the stock market in early 2000 , so did mr strachan s business he began using his credit lines on that visa card and a few others to stay afloat , paying smaller portions of his growing balances then , in may of last year , us bank sent mr strachan a letter telling him that it planned to raise the card s rate to 2021 percent , nearly quadrupling the existing rate of 525 percent i was n't late , and i did n't go over the credit limit , and i did n't write bad checks , mr strachan said a representative of us bank told him he was using too much of his available credit , he said a us bank spokesman declined to comment on mr strachan s account the monthly interest charge on his 50 , 000 balance jumped from 209 in june to 756 in july and 808 in august he eventually persuaded the bank to restore the original rate , but the bank closed the account , shutting off a key source of credit by then , bank one , another creditor , had compounded mr strachan s woes he was carrying a balance of about 70 , 000 on one account when the bank started raising his rates , first to 1999 percent in april 2003 , then to 2299 percent the next month , then to 2499 percent in june by october of last year , he was incurring a monthly finance charge of about 1 , 500 on a 77 , 000 balance it was like they almost all had a little meeting in the back room and said , 'let s get strachan , ' he said of his creditors how does it serve them to treat people like that \? are they trying to force them into bankruptcy \? lawyers he consulted advised mr strachan to take the easy and increasingly popular way out by filing for bankruptcy protection , but he refused he is struggling to make good on his debts because i have principles and ethics but the battle to dig out of a deepening hole has taken a toll mr strachan said he had lost 30 pounds and described himself as a broken man lately , he said , bank one has periodically reduced his credit limit to a level just above his remaining balance , leaving him little margin for error some months , he said , if he were to pay only the minimum due , the ensuing finance charge would put his balance over the limit , triggering a penalty fee by doing that , he said , they create their own little monster the regulators consumer complaints prompted the office of the comptroller of the currency , which oversees the nationally chartered banks that constitute most of the major card issuers , to warn banks about giving fair notice of term changes and about sending out tempting offers to people who are unlikely to qualify for them julie williams , the acting comptroller , said in an interview that as long as the lenders were not intentionally deceiving their customers , they were free to set whatever rates and fees their home states allow if customers do not want to pay a particular rate , they have choice , she said they can find another card but consumers clearly are unhappy with the choices they have about 80 , 000 people lodged complaints with the comptroller s office last year ms williams said the largest single source of their ire was credit cards those complaints are routed to examiners who monitor the banks , she said , but the examiners' foremost concern is to make sure the banks are financially sound ms williams described her agency as a tough regulator , but critics contend that the comptroller s office has taken strong action against only one major issuer of credit cards in the last five years in 2000 , the occ joined in an investigation into providian that had been started by the san francisco district attorney s office providian customers complained that they had been hit with late fees for payments that had been sent in on time but not credited to their accounts for days or weeks some said the resultant penalties pushed them over their credit limits , leading to additional fees later , ms williams said , the two agencies joined forces to extract 300 million in a settlement with providian the comptroller s office has since angered state attorneys general by trying to limit their ability to regulate how national banks behave in their states eliot spitzer , the attorney general of new york , said his office gets thousands of complaints every year about credit card issues relating to the major banks , the major card issuers but more often , he said , the banks' response has been that 'we do n't need to deal with you because the occ has told us indeed , directed us not to deal with state enforcement entities ' elizabeth warren , a professor at harvard law school who has been a vocal critic of consumer lenders , said the comptroller s office should do more than express discomfort with the practices of credit card companies , as it did in september the regulators did not say that those are unfair practices , they are unsafe and unsound and do n't do them , ms warren said instead , they said it s a problem look , if they think it s a problem , then tell the credit card companies to stop doing it
houston now that the league championship series are well under way , there seems to be a groundswell to see a yankeesst louis cardinals world series not me i 've read that story before the yankees and the cardinals may be the best teams left , and i appreciate the opportunity to dust off the history books and stroll way down memory lane but we 've all seen that there s a fresher , more compelling story line that seemed so unlikely two months ago astros versus yankees , featuring roger clemens from the moment clemens did his double take last winter retiring from the yankees , then unretiring to follow andy pettitte to houston i began pulling for the ultimate twist clemens , who would turn 42 during the season , would lead the astros to their first world series appearance against the franchise that defines itself by championships no one , except perhaps clemens , could have predicted this , and i'm not so sure this is what he had in mind when he signed with the astros back in january in fact , clemens was almost an afterthought for the astros the real prize , houston thought , was the 32yearold pettitte clemens would give the astros stature and aura , but pettitte would give them victories instead , pettitte was shut down in august with an elbow injury clemens , meanwhile , has been so phenomenal that he will probably win a seventh cy young award after a season in which he went 184 with a 298 earned run average clemens s start yesterday in game 3 of the national league championship series was one of the most significant of his career with the astros down by two games to none , clemens allowed two home runs early but gave his team seven strong innings and put houston in position to win the game , which they did , 52 , on three homers of its own houston can tie the series today more than once after the game , clemens alluded to the dual pleasures and pressures of being home i mean , there s added pressure i mean no different than a few years ago when i had to do it in new york , clemens said different situation there because this is my hometown so no matter my age or what i 've done in the past , you want to make a good showing i was just grateful that i have a lot of friends and family here i get to share this with clemens pointed toward the back of the room , where his mother , bess , was sitting in her wheelchair i hope mom s not too tired over there , he said she pitches every pitch with me she s still breathing that s the good thing this was not the mercenary roger clemens , but the veteran pitching now for civic pride i understand the history surrounding the yankeescardinals , who have met in the world series five times but clemensyankees is a better story and would offer a much more satisfying closure for a major league career than began in 1984 everyone is speculating about clemens s plans for next season i guarantee you that the one event that would make him retire on the spot is a world series appearance with houston in new york he has known some pretty great moments , but pitching against the yankees in the world series is a moment that could not be duplicated or topped sure , there s something to be said for a clemensred sox world series clemens began his career with the red sox and made his name there and i believe his heart is in boston except the red sox gave up on him , said he was done when he was 34 clemens went to toronto and won two straight cy young awards then , for want of a world series championship , clemens farmed himself out to father george and this is a critical point that pedro mart nez effectively made last month when he called the yankees his daddy the yankees eventually become home to veteran players who spend their careers chasing the yankees or chasing championships on teams too cheap or too inept add clemens to that list he won two world series titles with the yankees , and george steinbrenner and the team s fans felt that when clemens retired after last season , he retired a fullblooded yankee obviously not his appetite for the game was not satisfied clemens is a texan at heart his season with houston is a story about a triumphant return home , a quintessential hometown hero story clemens was born in dayton , ohio , but moved to texas and went to high school here , winning the state baseball championship he was a high school star he pitched , won three letters on the football team and played basketball he went to junior college in texas and then led the university of texas to a national championship in 1983 the world series rings with the yankees were great , but there would be even deeper satisfaction for clemens to march into yankee stadium with his hometown team and win the act of handing steinbrenner s yankees their second straight world series defeat would be the ultimate statement of independence telling his sugar daddy , your money helped me win a championship , but i'm winning this one on my own if not , we may see clemens again next season , though that is when things would get pathetic he has just enough in his tank for this season in any event , houston enjoyed the most dramatic turnaround of the four teams left in the playoffs the astros were reeling and left for dead at the allstar game break they fired manager jimy williams and hired phil garner in what we thought was a caretaker situation i got a call asking about a rumor that we were trading clemens back to boston , drayton mclane , houston s owner , said yesterday there was no way i was trading him i do n't give up , that s not my nature clemens helped lead the charge back and while i agree that st louis and the yankees are the logical historic choices for a compelling world series , give me roger clemens coming back to new york , facing slaying the

or body pillow \? and by an animated image on its web site \( www chipotle com \) that shows an employee being buried under a barrage of burritos chipotle , which spends an estimated 8 million to 10 million a year on all marketing communications aimed at consumers , becomes the first advertiser to hire the mother new york office as its creative agency of record before new year s , the national basketball association named the office to work on a creative project , centered on promoting viewership of and attendance at the league s playoff games madison avenue has been closely monitoring the progress or perceived lack thereof at the mother new york office , the first outpost for the agency outside london the office has had what is known in retailing as a soft opening that is , a lowkey , informal startup during the last few weeks rather than a big , splashy one with ribboncuttings and speeches the announcement of the chipotle account is intended as a signal that the office is open for business mother is one of the hottest agencies in the competitive british advertising market since it was founded seven years ago , it has landed assignments from bluechip advertisers like the boots drugstore chain , cocacola , diageo , orange telecommunications and unilever but whether the charmingly cheeky tone of its output will gain favor in the united states among consumers as well as potential clients is a question that is difficult to answer , particularly in an uncertain economy for the advertising industry when established agencies are struggling it s a tough challenge , said john staffen , who started yesterday as the executive creative director at the new york office of arnold worldwide , part of the arnold worldwide partners division of havas agencies based in other american cities that have opened offices in new york have found it hard to flourish , mr staffen said , much less agencies with headquarters overseas executives at the new clients of mother new york offered a different perspective we look at ourselves as a company that breaks some rules , said jim adams , marketing director at chipotle , which is based in denver , so that was n't a concern chipotle was especially interested in mother s new york office , he added , because of the chance to work with the two partners who are the creative executives there , linus karlsson and paul malmstrom they are a longtime team who most recently worked together at fallon worldwide , part of the publicis groupe , and are known in the industry by their nickname , the swedes we make burritos we try not to take it too seriously , mr adams said mother and the swedes understand that attitude we 've kept an eye on the swedes , he added , so when we heard they were involved in opening this arm of mother , we said , 'let s go talk with them' and we 've found our creative soul mates tim andree , senior vice president at the basketball league in new york , said the nba gave the office the creative assignment because mother is obviously one of the hot shops in advertising also , he added , league executives had worked with another partner at the office , rob deflorio , who before joining mother had been global advertising director at nike in beaverton , ore mr deflorio said that he , the swedes and the fourth partner at the office andrew deitchman , formerly a global director at the red cell agency in london , owned by the wpp group were optimistic about their prospects , despite the widespread belief that transplants find it difficult to put down roots in new york that s because we do n't see our office as a transplant , mr deflorio said , because the literal definition is taking organs from one entity and putting them into another we 're all new to the agency , he added none of the four has worked for mother before what s being carried forth is the mother philosophy , the mother spirit , not transplanted or exported by mother people from london in hiring the office , neither chipotle nor the basketball league is dismissing another agency chipotle has produced pretty much everything inhouse since we started in 1993 , mr adams said the nba s policy is to bring in agencies to handle assignments from time to time as it continues to work with berlin cameron red cell in new york , part of wpp at some point , we 're going to have to slug it out with other agencies , mr deflorio acknowledged asked if he was confident the office would prevail in such reviews as frequently as the flagship london agency does , he replied , absolutely

ivan s powerful winds would not damage that island the way it did grenada earlier in the week in cuba , president fidel castro declared an islandwide hurricane watch in kingston , the streets were empty as night fell except for a few cars scurrying for cover past boarded and taped storefronts and homes at the request of prime minister pj patterson , a state of emergency went into effect expanding police powers in kingston and other towns and cities earlier , the authorities said they were having difficulty persuading residents in lowlying areas to leave their homes for shelter but in montego bay and other resort towns on the north coast , about 15 , 000 stranded tourists from the united states and other countries gladly agreed to move from waterfront hotels to heavily fortified concrete and steel resorts inland as the storm intensified , hotels around the country ordered guests from their rooms , many of them with floor to ceiling glass walls , and herded them into the safety of central ballrooms and dining areas i think this is going to be a bad one , said butch stewart , chairman of sandals resorts , the largest hotel group in jamaica , and chairman of air jamaica , the national flag airline mr stewart , reached by telephone in miami , had gone there after starting repairs to his hotels in the turks and caicos islands and the bahamas that were damaged by hurricane charley last week while jamaica and florida braced for hurricane ivan , rescue workers continued to try to get into grenada , the tiny island in the southern caribbean where more than 20 people died earlier this week as the stormed wrecked hundreds of homes and businesses a state department official said friday evening that by midmorning saturday , planes would begin airlifting american citizens out of the devastated island to port of spain in trinidad and tobago roughly 1 , 500 americans were on the island when hurricane ivan hit , the official said about onethird of those

the fishermen s hospital in marathon in montego bay , horace peterkin , manager of sandals montego bay and a vice president of the jamaica hotel and tourism association , was getting the last of his guests out of his beachfront resort and keeping an eye on developments around the country he said he understood the government was preparing to forcibly evacuate some residents in dangerous areas a lot of people are still clinging to their houses and possessions , mr peterkin said one reason people were unwilling to leave their homes , he said , was memories of looting during and after hurricane gilbert , the last powerful storm to hit jamaica , 16 years ago the mood of jamaica , he said , has shifted from widespread denial , based on 50 years of watching all but two big hurricanes skirt the island at what seemed to be the last minute , to very serious concern everybody is very , very nervous , mr peterkin said early this afternoon , tameka cato , 17 , was walking as fast as she could toward safety in her family s church , the nearby kingdom hall of jehovahs witness , with two younger brothers and her 7yearold sister , sangean , trying to keep up their parents planned to join them later sangean in blue jeans and powder blue shirt was hefting a pink backpack stuffed with clothing and the others carried sacks of water and food along the deserted street nearly every business was shuttered in kingston but the tiny , gritty l k restaurant bar on half way tree road was open and so was taylor s funeral home on east street elvis gayle , one of the undertakers at the funeral home , said he had come in to help ken anderson , the caretaker , take down a sign that the wind might have blown away they were determined to maintain the funeral home policy of being available to bereaved families 24 hours a day , every day , clear skies or not probably nobody is going to come out during the hurricane , mr anderson said but we 're staying open just in case keith sturridge , the burly owner of the bar , said he figured his business , with its concrete block structure and steel security bars on the windows , was a safer bet for riding out hurricane ivan than his 70yearold home he said he figured if he was going to be in the bar , he might as well be ready for business the counter stools and all the booths were empty in midafternoon as a light rain washed the front of the building but andre jones , 30 , a construction worker , and two other men were staying dry , just under the eaves of the bar s roof they laughed at the thought that like hundreds of thousands of evacuating floridians , they might try to get out of the path of the storm people could get away from the beaches in jamaica to places like the restaurant , they said but after that , there was no place to go on an island that was 150 miles long and 50 miles wide none of them had the money for a flight to florida and the thought of that made them chuckle , too florida is all mashed up and it s going to get hit again , mr jones said what good is it going to do you to go there \?
when yoav rosen was growing up in jerusalem in the 1970 s , he was obsessed with an act that was said to have been performed only by the likes of jesus , buddha and hindu mystics walking on water last month , mr rosen received a united states patent \( no6 , 764 , 363 \) for a device that he says will allow ordinary people to do just that mr rosen moved to the united states from israel three and a half years ago , when his wife took a job as a researcher at the dana farber cancer institute but mr rosen , who had been a business and marketing executive for a software company in israel , could not find an equivalent job here during the bottom of the dotcom bust so i said to myself , 'why not start dreaming \? many inventors are afflicted with an overabundance of ideas not so mr rosen i just had this one idea , he said but i 've had it since i was 11 years old his mother still keeps a picture of a waterwalking machine he drew back then the design was all wrong , mr rosen said there is no way it would have worked of course , neither did leonardo da vinci s waterwalking device , which he conceived in the late 15th century his drawing of it is housed at the biblioteca ambrosiana in milan da vinci s invention if it had worked would have operated on a principal similar to crosscountry skiing in the last 150 years , americans have patented about 100 waterwalking inventions the first , in 1858 , was by hr rowlands , who lived in boston , not far from where mr rosen resides , in newton , mass most of the subsequent patents , mr rosen said , are iterations of that same idea unfortunately , mr rosen observed , none of them actually work mr rosen s device also resembles the 1858 design his pontoons are made of styrofoam and plywood , and are tethered together so the user s legs will not spread apart while walking before you start walking on water you have to stand on water , and that s not an easy thing , mr rosen said the water is a living , moving , dynamic thing attached to the back of the pontoons are flaps , which act like paddles , providing propulsion as the legs lift and drop that idea also echoes the design found in many earlier patents but mr rosen s flaps are different from other versions in two significant ways rather than being heavier than water , the flaps are buoyant and they are hinged to the pontoons in a unusual position , which makes them rotate from 9 o'clock to 12 o'clock on other waterwalkers , he said , the flaps typically rotate from 6 o'clock to 9 o'clock the flap needs to offer maximal resistance from the very beginning of the step , so that the other foot can move forward in real distance terms , and not just relatively to the backwardpushing foot , he said mr rosen , who has tested six generations of prototypes , mostly on the charles river , acknowledges that his version is counterintuitive i think that is why this design has eluded hundreds of inventors , he said but , he added , allowing the flaps to rotate quickly enough means a person using the contraption can walk at a normal gait earlier this year , mr rosen started selling a related vessel , a standing paddle boat for sports fishermen , which is carried by about 20 kayak and canoe stores , mostly in the northeast he calls it the w boat , for the shape of the wake that it produces it s basically a oneman show , he said i have drowned a lot of money in this venture his web site , www wavewalk com , features a section on his waterwalking invention , but it could be some time before waterwalking becomes a common sight i have n't brought it to market for a very simple reason distribution channels , mr rosen said what store would sell it \? it does n't fit into an existing paradigm for sports
usa today , which announced yesterday morning that it had concluded a sevenmonth inquiry into the accuracy of several articles by a former foreign correspondent without resolving whether he had falsified information , said last night that it had serious concerns about another of his dispatches the editor of usa today , karen jurgensen , said she was made aware of an internal complaint yesterday about the similarities between a september 1998 article describing a gun market in darra , pakistan , written by the correspondent , jack kelley , and an article that had appeared two months earlier in the washington post of course we 're going to look into it , ms jurgensen said yesterday afternoon we 'll look into any stories that arise as we work through this now public process several hours later , a spokeswoman for usa today called to read a statement from ms jurgensen now that we have looked more closely at the story , we have serious concerns , the statement said a lawyer for mr kelley said the concerns were unwarranted in yesterday s issue of usa today , the newspaper published an article that described how mr kelley , who had worked at the paper since its inception in 1982 , resigned last week after being confronted with evidence he had repeatedly misled the editors conducting the inquiry as it sought last fall to verify a frontpage article that mr kelley filed from belgrade in 1999 , the newspaper said , a security firm that it had retained discovered that a woman claiming to be a translator for the article had not been involved in its preparation the newspaper said that after receiving an anonymous complaint about his work last may , it had begun examining the belgrade article and several others by mr kelley , whose companysupplied biography says he has reported for usa today from 90 countries the editors said they had received the complaint around the time the new york times disclosed the discovery of fabrications or plagiarism in at least three dozen articles by a reporter , jayson blair in its article yesterday , the newspaper said that none of the articles examined , including the belgrade article in which mr kelley described a yugoslav army , threering notebook that contained a direct order to a lieutenant to 'cleanse' a village necessitated a correction the editors either concluded they were accurate or that the passage of time and the difficulty of retracing events in distant wartorn countries made verification impossible , ms jurgensen said in a statement yesterday on usa today s web site in an interview yesterday , ms jurgensen said i think we could go another six months and still not have clarity at the newspaper s newsroom in mclean , va , several reporters and editors interviewed by telephone yesterday said they were troubled by aspects of the investigation most notably , they were concerned that mr kelley , 43 , had been allowed to approve the reporter who conducted the inquiry , mark memmott , a former deputy managing editor mr kelley had also been involved in deciding who would be interviewed about his work , the newspaper said none of the staff members who were critical of the investigation yesterday would express their concerns by name , saying they feared angering their bosses at usa today and gannett , the newspaper s parent ms jurgensen said mr kelley had been permitted to play an active role in the investigation because we had the assumption he was innocent we were trying to be fair , she said we knew he trusted mark gina lubrano , the readers representative of the san diego uniontribune for more than a decade , said mr kelley s involvement might have tainted the process it surprises me that they allowed kelley to be a participant in determining how the investigation would be conducted , ms lubrano said in a statement that he issued through a lawyer yesterday , mr kelley said i walk away from usa today knowing that in my 21year career , i have never fabricated or plagiarized a story ms jurgensen said that after yesterday s article was printed , she was made aware of the article mr kelley wrote about the market in pakistan , and the article s similarity to the one by kevin sullivan published in july 1998 in the post mr kelley s article contained a halfdozen phrases or sentences that closely tracked those that appeared in mr sullivan s mr kelley wrote , for example , that when the guns offered for sale were fired in the street , the dogs did n't even flinch mr sullivan had written that not even the dozing dogs flinch mr kelley wrote that an ak47 , captured from the soviet army in afghanistan , sells for 320 but a nearidentical darra copy starts at 50 mr sullivan wrote that an ak47 captured from the soviet army in afghanistan goes for about 320 , but almost identical copies made in darra start at about 50 mr kelley also wrote of small familyowned shops that line the road and are filled with russian kalashnikovs , american m16s , italian berettas , israeli uzis , and guns hidden in walking sticks the post article mentioned that the market is lined with tiny shops and stalls filled with the same russian kalashnikovs , american m16s , italian berettas , israeli uzis , even guns hidden in walking sticks lynne bernabei , a lawyer representing mr kelley , said she had examined the two articles at the request of the times the dogs 'do n't flinch' in both articles , she said other than that , there is very little similarity ms bernabei said that she had spoken with mr kelley , who did not recall the post article but did recall being advised to visit darra by a bbc cameraman she said that mr kelley also recalled that a number of other news organizations wrote about the market these included the independent of london , life magazine and newsday she said that it was not out of the ordinary that the articles by usa today and the post contained much of the same information , considering how mediashrewd the denizens of the arms market had become this is a family arms market , she said people are n't going to change in two months it s not surprising the figures are going to be the same
there is stephon marbury s petulant past four teams in eight years , a litany of disgruntled teammates , most who wanted him to pass first and shoot second , and no secondround playoff experience on the r sum there is also a brilliant forecast , the raw explosiveness , the way he turns a routine jumpstop into riveting theater , skittering by one defender , going up and over the next , scoring when he wants , promising another nba city he is all grown up coney island s own is coming home , and whether marbury makes a team a finals contender or a playoff poseur depends on who shipped him and who acquired him ask the phoenix suns , and they will say the marbury experiment failed , the way it did in new jersey and minnesota that marbury , the mercurial point guard they call starbury , can only take a team so far before he glowers at teammates who miss layups and before his moodiness becomes contagious that is partly why they traded marbury , penny hardaway and cezary trybanski to the knicks on monday for antonio mcdyess , howard eisley , charlie ward , maciej lampe , the rights to milos vujanic , two firstround draft picks and cash , in one of those blockbuster deals only sports talk radio and maybe isiah thomas could dream up ask the knicks , and they will say they swapped a slew of role players , contracts and unfulfilled potential for one of the game s top 15 talents indeed , on the surface , the knicks will have a top floor leader in his prime for the first time since walt frazier ran the floor at madison square garden marbury , a brooklyn schoolboy legend , is an allstar , able to create his own shot in the final seconds of a close game the way none of the knicks can by any account , this starting five is not shabby marbury allan houston keith van horn kurt thomas dikembe mutombo , serviceable at center if slightly decrepit shandon anderson and a watereddown hardaway coming off the bench if that is not at least a seventhseeded team in the east , what is \? on paper , talentwise , this puts us right up there at the top , van horn said but that s just paper indeed , rather than answering questions about the knicks' newandimproved crew , van horn spent most of yesterday afternoon s session with the news media playing down all the times marbury had publicly disrespected him what was that gem from last summer , when marbury lumped in van horn with gheorghe muresan and jim mcilvaine as former nets teammates with little or no game \? when van horn was traded to the knicks from philadelphia , marbury surmised that van horn was too soft to play at the garden marbury was drafted by milwaukee and traded immediately to minnesota , where he eventually forced a trade to the nets instead of teaming with kevin garnett to become the heirs apparent to john stockton and karl malone in the western conference , he came east to play near his hometown the move backfired in a torrent of losses and bruised egos , until he was shipped to phoenix for jason kidd he spared little criticism of his former teammates you got to be way tougher than keith is to play in new york , marbury said last september you got to be gritty you 've got to be a grinder marbury mentioned latrell sprewell , michael jordan , tim duncan and allen iverson as players who met the standard but keith is not a player who fits the description , marbury said then yesterday , van horn said it s not just about stephon and i , it s about the team when he gets here , i'm sure we 'll sit down and talk because i want to be on the same page with him and he wants to be on the same page with me , and ultimately i just want to win if there s any issues we need to work through , we 'll talk spike lee , the filmmaker and longtime knicks zealot , wanted marbury to audition for his 1999 movie , he got game , about a fictional schoolboy legend by the name of jesus shuttleworth from , yes , coney island but marbury s agent at the time refused to have him audition if he was not guaranteed a significant part in the movie lee played down the notion that the movie was based on marbury s life a number of hangerson , street agents , soulless college coaches and female groupies tried to corrupt the character played by ray allen yet as marbury returns home , one has to wonder about those distractions the relatives competing for space and attention in the family lounge , the expectations from the people who saw him grow into one of pro basketball s most scintillating performers that petulant past colliding with that awesome future , and how it will work itself out lost in the latest purge of everything layden was another point guard , charlie ward , the last remnant from the pat riley era ward was often ridiculed and booed , and rumored for years to be going elsewhere seventyseven playoff games , a couple of eastern conference championships and a few game 7 s later , knicks fans got their wish ward is gone he never had marbury s basketball instincts or improvisation , but when the knicks still mattered and ward was still spry , he competed and found the resources needed to win games for his team in the spring if stephon marbury competes in 77 playoff games during his knicks career , consider him fortunate
almaty , kazakhstan , dec 11 ukraine s political earthquake may have sent shock waves through russia and europe , but in the former soviet republics where there have been similar accusations of improprieties carried out to ensure that the old political leadership remains in power the tremors have been decidedly more muted just two months ago in this sparsely populated country roughly the size of western europe , parliamentary elections regarded as unfair by local and western monitors left a growing opposition movement with only one seat in a 77member lower house of parliament the lone opposition member refused to take his seat in protest while kazakhstan s president , nursultan nazarbayev , had promised that a new election law would make the vote fair and open , a chamber with a handful of opposition members has been replaced by one with none dos kushym , director of kazakhstan s largest pollmonitoring organization , described the latest election as the most blatantly fraudulent since the nation gained independence 13 years ago two weeks after the kazakhstan voting , belarus held a parliamentary election that achieved much the same result it was described by one opposition leader as the least fair since aleksandr g lukashenko was first elected president in 1994 a year earlier in azerbaijan , another contested election was held with a twist the government s candidate was ilham aliyev , 42 , the son of president heydar aliyev , who had appointed him prime minister in august of that year the elder mr aliyev , who died in december 2003 , withdrew his candidacy for reelection in favor of his son two weeks before the vote after the younger mr aliyev was declared to have received 80 percent of the vote , street protests erupted , and one person was killed isa gambar , the leader of azerbaijan s opposition musavat party , recently flew to kiev , ukraine s capital , as did a delegation of former opposition candidates from kazakhstan they were all eager to learn what it was in ukraine that led supporters of the challenger , viktor a yushchenko , to flood the streets of kiev and other cities and prevent his opponent , viktor f yanukovich , from taking office after a vote they deemed fraudulent after kazakhstan s elections , bright path , the largest opposition party , also called for a protest demonstration on the capital s main square but when the government refused to allow it , the demonstration was called off we decided to cancel it because we were afraid there would be violence , and we felt a responsibility toward our supporters , oraz jandosov , a candidate and cochairman of the party , said in an interview transparency international rates kazakhstan one of the most corrupt countries in the world , ranking it 122 out of 145 the larger the number the more corrupt and the opposition blames mr nazarbayev , 63 , for institutionalizing bribetaking during his rule independent monitors and pollsters say kulyash agatayeva , an education ministry official , won largely because of the mobilization of teachers and other government officials who were ordered to campaign and vote for her or face losing their jobs my wife is a school director , and on election day we both voted six times , because we had to , said a driver who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals you call that democracy \? there were also allegations that busloads of outoftowners were paid to vote over and over at various polling places , and that election observers were denied tally sheets all charges still echoing across ukraine the organization for cooperation and security in europe , the european union and the national democratic institute for international affairs , based in washington , found that kazakhstan s election fell short of international standards but russian monitors called it free and fair even before the voting ended alikhan baimenov , another leader of mr jandosov s opposition party , said encouraging kazakhs to stand up for their rights would be a long process we need to convince our society that you can change president and still have stability , he said russia s intervention in the elections has shocked a lot of people here because we value our independence , he added it s a mistake that shows how inexperienced russia is in nonforce relationships with its neighbors this is a critical moment for the regime , he said they should look at georgia and ukraine and begin to make democratic reforms , and if they do n't , there is no hope david lewis , director of the international crisis group s central asia project , was not optimistic there is no evidence that governments will learn the lesson that falsified elections tend to produce conflict , he said , referring to the former soviet republics of central asia on the contrary , i think these events just increase their paranoia until ukraine s second round of voting , american support of democracy in this region had been slight , mr baimenov asserted unlike the european union , the united states embassy here did not issue any statement on the elections after the results were announced , although it criticized the first round deputy secretary of state richard l armitage flew here a month after the vote asked at a news conference what he had discussed with mr nazarbayev , he listed nine subjects , none of which touched on the elections the main purpose of his trip , he said , was to thank mr nazarbayev for keeping a 28member kazakh mineremoval unit in iraq in contrast , mr baimenov pointed out , secretary of state colin l powell immediately condemned the ukrainian vote as flawed
because of www fundrace org i can no longer pretend before fundraceorg , it was easy to persuade myself that my neighbors and i shared the same political views but when the truth stared at me from the computer screen , i had some reexamining to do did you know that that there is a web site where you can look up who gave money to bush or kerry and how much \? we were sitting around the dinner table , and my mother , who at 69 is a computer and political fiend , mentioned her find is that legal \? i asked sure , she said political contributions have always been public information i 'll send you the link since that night , i 've become a political peeping tom and , perhaps , a violator of suburban etiquette first i looked up my husband , gary , and myself for accuracy so far , so good we had both contributed to wesley clark s campaign when he still had one my donation to john kerry was also there i was happy with my contributions but felt a little exposed suddenly , my personal politics just seemed so public i began to navigate the site searches are done by name and address and , basically , you can go up and down your street and see who gave how much to whom this might sound like fun if you live in a town of politically likeminded people i do n't we live in summit lovely , leafy , heavily republican i knew this before fundracecom i just did n't want to believe it i continued my search , and off came those rosecolored glasses oh no ! i groaned what \? gary asked karen and joe each gave 2 , 000 to bush so did those new people on the corner and , oh my god , jane and bill , too \( for the sake of neighborliness , i have changed the names of my friends and neighbors \) gary , predictably , was unmoved why does any of that surprise you \? why indeed \? did i think that these republicans in this republican town were really closet democrats \? well , yes for years i have persuaded myself that my friends and neighbors were only sort of republicans the kind who voted that way when it did n't really matter but now , with the stakes so high , they would certainly come to their senses and align themselves with the rest of our blue state fundraceorg forced me to face the truth unless , of course , my republican friends are putting up bush lawn signs and giving 2000 to bush and still voting for kerry even i do n't believe that i calmed myself by scrolling through the site and was pleasantly surprised at some of the contributions made to the kerry campaign i found myself expressing love for a few neighbors whom i vowed to get to know better when summit got dull , i opened my address book and checked out people from other parts of my life dare i search for my first true love \? we have n't spoken in over 10 years , but bad news 750 to bush i knew that whole relationship had been a mistake like a weird stroll through my past , i discovered where my old friends ended up politically i checked a few more names and began to wonder how i could be such good friends with people whose politics are so different from mine am i a hypocrite \?

little children by tom perrotta 355 pages st martin s press 2495 dear penthouse forum , one of the characters imagines writing , in tom perrotta s poignantly funny new novel about love and marriage i'm a 31yearold stayathome dad , and you 'll never believe what just happened to me at the playground or maybe you would , since mr perrotta tells his story so knowingly the married dad in question , whose name is todd , has just shared a steamy outoftheblue kiss in broad daylight with a wife not his own named for the skill with which its adult characters handle their inhibitions , little children presents the full cultural and emotional underpinnings of this suburbshaking event sarah from the playground , a onetime feminist who cringes to see her copy of the handmaid s tale juxtaposed with the berenstain bears visit the dentist , is part of a coterie of dazed , vaguely disappointed young mothers it was n't that easy to tell one weekday from the next anymore , mr perrotta writes about this crowd they all just melted together like a bag of crayons left out in the sun more than any of the others , sarah feels that she has been bodysnatched out of a stimulating city life and unreasonably planted in the midst of this one and there is cause for her to feel that way her husband is infatuated with a smalltime internet porn star her daughter , in whom she is none too interested , sometimes reminds sarah of a character out of dostoyevsky the local book club is attempting madame bovary this choice is quietly diabolical \( mr perrotta s often are \) but not exactly popular i mean , is n't it kind of depressing \? asks one of sarah s socalled friends she cheats on her husband with two different guys , wastes all his money , then kills herself with rat poison do i really need to read this \? here s why sarah needs to read it because todd is so handsome that her friends dared her to approach him in the playground \( five bucks if you get his phone number \) and because once she got near him , something just snapped you know what would be really funny \? she asks this stranger , in full view of the snackbearing , childminding greek chorus that observes her so they kiss and the earth moves and , houston , we have a problem this author s ingratiating earlier books , including election \( the source for that delightful film \) and the wishbones \( about aging slackers in a band that plays at weddings \) , featured younger characters and easier laughs little children will be mr perrotta s breakthrough popular hit , but its undercurrents are more somber this soccermom bovary , like the original , grasps the fundamental sadness of characters trapped in middleclass stability and yearning for adventures gone by but mr perrotta is too generous a writer to trivialize that what distinguishes little children from runofthemill suburban satire is its knowing blend of slyness and compassion the book refers a couple of times to controversy surrounding representative gary a condit so it takes place not long before sept 11 , 2001 , in a world where characters are still free to worry about lesser dangers within the community where the book unfolds , the biggest known threat is an alleged girl scout molester named ronnie living nearby , newly out of prison and watched over by his worried mother if he had a nice girl in his life , she reasons , maybe he would n't spend so much time alone in his room , spying on the neighborhood kids through binoculars which is more menacing to this community the prospect that ronnie may strike again , or the storm of adulterous emotion unleashed by sarah and todd \? both the book and the neighborhood need ronnie mostly as a distraction but he serves as a highly public contrast to the private betrayals that are under way , and it is these hidden sea changes that mr perrotta captures best for instance sarah is obsessed with finding the right bathing suit for flirting with todd meanwhile her businessman husband , richard , is indulging his fetishes with the cheerful internet doxy who calls herself slutty kay are you doing this for fun and money \? he asks kay \( actually carla \) via email both ! she answers is n't that the american dream \? ever professional , richard wonders whether there may be subcontracting or outsourcing possibilities in kay s line of work and then one day he just walked into the living room , with his shirt untucked and that glazed expression he got when he spent too much time on the computer , and told her she could go for a walk he was looking right at her as he said it , but it was as if he did n't even see her , as if she were n't actually standing two feet in front of him in a red bikini that fit her like a dream the loneliness encapsulated in that moment is simultaneously amusing and painful so is the steadfast adult selfishness that the title of little children describes and although mr perrotta mischievously dresses todd s son in a jester s hat , it s a touch that conveys both cruelty and humor beyond the comic absurdities of sarah and todd s affair , there is the question of what they will do with the rest of their real lives in the end mr perrotta presents little children as a moment in amber rather than a sudsy melodrama he succeeds in illuminating what happened to sarah and todd , understanding its meaning and exploring its consequences and all of the noncriminal principals in this story are better off in the end than they were at the start mr perrotta accomplishes this tenderly while also putting it in perspective as history is about to reveal , these are not the events that change the world
texas juries in capital cases must make a prediction they may impose a death sentence only if they find that the defendant will probably commit more violent acts other states look backward , asking juries to consider the moral blameworthiness of the crime texas , which leads the nation in executions , wants to know the future will the killer kill again \? the fact is , said david r dow , a law professor at the university of houston , you 're being punished for something that you have n't done in making their predictions , juries rely on expert testimony in 1986 , for instance , dr edward gripon , a psychiatrist , testified that david harris , then 25 and freshly convicted of murder , posed a substantial risk of further violent acts dr gripon , who had never examined or even met mr harris , based his conclusion on a prosecutor s description of the defendant s past conduct mr harris , now 43 , is to be executed on june 30 on wednesday , his lawyers submitted a petition to a state appeals court it says dr gripon s prediction 18 years ago has turned out to be wrong mr harris s years in prison have been marred by only minor infractions , like having too many postage stamps or hanging a clothesline in his cell his most serious offense , according to the authorities , was kicking a guard s boot while wearing shower slippers mr harris says he slipped mr harris s case is not unique a recent study by the texas defender service , a group that represents defendants in capital cases , examined 155 such cases in which prosecution experts had predicted , often with a claim of scientific certainty , that the defendants would commit more violent crimes these experts , the report concluded , were wrong 95 percent of the time though the 155 inmates in question generally served at least a decade on death row , none of them killed again eight committed serious assaults , all against prison employees or other inmates two were prosecuted maintaining that he was sentenced to death on the basis of junk science , mr harris says he deserves a stay of execution and a resentencing hearing at which evidence of how the future turned out can be presented a spokesman for the state attorney general s office declined to comment , citing the pending litigation but shannon edmonds , a lawyer with the texas district and county attorneys association , said objections to the futuredangerousness standard were a smokescreen there is no issue or litmus test that would be accurate enough to satisfy the texas defender service , mr edmonds said they basically do n't think anyone should get the death penalty gena bunn , chief of the texas attorney general s capital litigation unit , defended the state s futuredangerousness requirement in a law review article in 2000 ms bunn said abstract arguments must fail in the face of the reality of vicious killers like aaron fuller , who raped and killed an elderly woman in 1989 although the use of psychiatric testimony to predict future dangerousness is roundly condemned in the scientific community , she wrote with a coauthor in the texas review of law politics , the reader need only make a commonsense inquiry to see the logic of the system would the reader want to share a jail cell with aaron fuller \? texas law makes the death penalty available for about a dozen categories of murder , including those committed during a robbery or a sexual assault , those done for hire and those in which the victim is a child or a police officer but conviction of such a crime is not enough to impose a death sentence , a jury must find , unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt , that there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society because those convicted of capital crimes must serve at least 40 years , as a practical matter that threat is to prison guards and other inmates only oregon joins texas in having death sentences turn solely on predictions of future dangerousness six other states allow the factor to play a role in juries' decisions , along with many others a ninth state , virginia , which trails only texas in the number of people it executes , requires a jury either to find future dangerousness or to determine that the crime was outrageously or wantonly vile , horrible or inhuman what is a significant but not determinative factor in other states , professor dow of the university of houston said , basically in texas is the whole ball of wax \( in the 29 other states with the death penalty , future dangerousness plays no role at all \) state representative jim dunnam , a democrat from waco , has introduced legislation to conform capital sentencing procedures in texas to those in some other states i was trying to address the problem of unreliable testimony by experts in capital cases , mr dunnam said my proposal was that we have more of a list of factors , both aggravating and mitigating , for the jury to balance in making their decisions mr harris , the inmate now appealing his sentence by contesting the futuredangerousness standard , was convicted in 1986 of killing mark mays in a beaumont gunfight as mr harris was trying to kidnap roxanne lockard , mr mays s girlfriend mr harris later gained fame in the 1988 documentary the thin blue line , in which he acknowledged knowingly giving false testimony about the 1976 murder of a dallas police officer , evidence that almost resulted in the execution of an innocent man solace k southwick , one of mr harris s lawyers , discussed his case in her office at a big corporate law firm here ms southwick has represented him since 1990 the physical difference in david harris is n't just that he s aged and gotten a little fatter , she said he s a completely different person she showed a visitor an elaborate crafts display mr harris had made for her it included the images of a bald eagle and a flag , a clock and the words god bless america the prison kitsch has no place in her sleek office , and she keeps it tucked in a closet but she shook her head to look at it is n't it amazing that he would have that sentiment \? she said in 1983 , the united states supreme court declined to bar expert testimony concerning future dangerousness under the texas law the american psychiatric association had filed a supporting brief in that case , saying expert opinions on the subject were useless the unreliability of psychiatric predictions of longterm future dangerousness is by now established fact within the profession , the association told the court but justice byron r white , writing for the majority , said , we are not persuaded that such testimony is almost entirely unreliable in the petition filed wednesday , mr harris contends that recent studies demonstrate that expert predictions in this area are just that almost entirely unreliable a decade after that supreme court decision , the justices held in a civil case that trial judges must carefully scrutinize scientific expert testimony before presenting it to a jury it is unclear whether that principle applies at capital sentencing hearings but one federal appeals court judge , emilio m garza , has written that the later case , known as daubert , suggests that expert testimony about future dangerousness should be rejected the scientific community virtually unanimously agrees that psychiatric testimony on future dangerousness is , to put it bluntly , unreliable and unscientific , judge garza wrote in a 2000 concurrence to a decision upholding a death sentence some prosecution experts have been criticized for the uniformity and severity of their opinions , others for unorthodox methodology one , dr walter quijano , testified in at least seven cases in texas that being black or hispanic correlated positively to future dangerousness state officials have told courts that it was a mistake to present the testimony , but local prosecutors , in a rare bit of infighting among law enforcement officials , insist the death sentences should stand the courts have so far agreed that new sentencing hearings are required in those cases , and the texas legislature recently enacted a law barring testimony about future dangerousness based on the defendant s race but the futuredangerousness requirement itself stands , frustrating critics i see the texas statute as dishonest to the true purpose of capital punishment , said andrea keilen , the deputy director of the texas defender service it does n't reliably sort who deserves to live from who deserves to die
minneapolis , dec 24 brett favre orchestrated one of the most dramatic fourthquarter comebacks of his career friday , and he picked the perfect time to do it favre led the packers 76 yards on the game s final drive as green bay beat the minnesota vikings , 3431 , on a gameending field goal at the metrodome the packers \( 96 \) clinched their third consecutive national football conference north title and guaranteed themselves a home playoff game had the vikings \( 87 \) won this meeting of rivals , they would have seized the division title right now it ranks no 1 , favre said of the 11play drive that set up ryan longwell s winning 29yard field goal i'm going to have to let it soak in favre , who has led the packers to 34 fourthquarter comebacks , threw a fourthquarter interception that chris claiborne returned 15 yards for a touchdown to put the vikings ahead by 3124 but favre guided the packers 80 yards for a tying score i'm at a loss of words , i really am , favre said i'm proud of this team favre avoided a blitz and connected with javon walker on a 31yard pass with 25 seconds left to put the packers in scoring position again with three seconds left , favre handed the game over to longwell , who drilled a field goal to beat the vikings for the second time this season and was mobbed by teammates it s jubilation , longwell said there s something to be said about when everything s on the line and your body can come through in that situation it s something a lot of people on this planet will never get to feel longwell kicked a 33yard field goal as time expired nov 14 against the vikings in green bay the packers also won that game , 3431 i thought it was pretty weird that it was the same score , but there s nothing routine about kicking a field goal in this league , longwell said the vikings hoped the packers would foul up the snap on the fieldgoal attempt last week , a botched snap on an extrapoint attempt by the detroit lions allowed the vikings to escape with a victory the snap had to be good , the hold had to be good and the kick had to be good , packers coach mike sherman said so it s a threeman team when we kick a field goal , but ryan is mr dependable the packers began the season 14 , and they entered this game having lost two of their past three games that drive right there is sort of what our season s been all about , favre said ups and downs , but find a way to endure at the end the vikings still have an excellent chance of landing a wildcard berth , even if they lose jan 2 at washington if either carolina or st louis loses or ties one of its final two games , the vikings are in minnesota has not been to the playoffs since 2000 , when it last won the division if our season was over , i think i 'd be a little more upset , because i 'd be going home without a chance of playing in the postseason , said vikings receiver nate burleson , who scored on a 68yard pass play in the 38point second quarter but we still have a chance the packers trailed by 3124 late in the fourth quarter on fourthandgoal from the 3 , sherman made his gutsiest call of the game and went for it favre delivered a bullet to donald driver , who made the catch while falling down in the end zone favre was 30 of 43 passing for 365 yards with 3 touchdowns and the interception in the third quarter , he moved into third place on the nfl s career passing yardage list , overtaking warren moon favre finished the game with 49 , 538 yards driver caught 11 passes for 162 yards none were bigger than the fourthdown reception , when he ran a shallow slant walker finished with 5 catches for 90 yards , including a 9yard touchdown reception if you look at the throws i made , from my standpoint , it was more our receivers making plays , favre said javon , at the end of the game , made a tremendous play against the blitz the packers were without wide receiver robert ferguson , who was unable to move his legs after being hit last sunday against jacksonville ferguson s uniform hung in the packers' locker room for inspiration favre is now 49 at the metrodome , and during a wild second quarter , the packers played catchup while trading scores with the vikings randy moss put the vikings ahead , 70 , with a 12yard reception from daunte culpepper , who was 16 of 23 for 285 yards with 3 touchdown passes , all in the second quarter culpepper also hooked up with burleson for a 68yard touchdown , allowing him to surpass moon s team 10yearold record for passing yards in a season he has 4 , 418 culpepper also broke randall cunningham s team record of 34 touchdown passes , set in 1998 , with 37 moss was covered well by al harris much of the game and finished with 2 catches for 30 yards the packers missed many tackles in the second quarter , but they firmed up their defense in the second half the vikings' defense did not look much better in the second quarter green bay s bubba franks caught a 22yard touchdown pass , and ahman green scored on a 1yard run on fourth down green led the packers with 64 yards rushing on 19 carries michael bennett of the vikings had his best game of the season , rushing 17 times for 92 yards and scoring on a 38yard pass play the vikings lost 7 of their final 10 games last season if they lose again next week , they will once again have closed out their season by going 37 we got a good enough team to win the whole thing , culpepper said when everybody believes that on this team , that s when we 're going to do it
for nearly as long as there have been humans , there have been laws defining the status of animals , reserving certain species for certain uses and certain people some of those laws have been unbelievably cruel , like england s game laws in the early 19th century what they really protected were the property rights of humans , not an animal s right to exist , which humans have barely ever acknowledged it s a major philosophical shift , then , to put laws on the books that protect an animal from any human use whatsoever but even laws that make it illegal to shoot songbirds , for instance , often do not offer enough protection human activities simply impinge in too many ways on the wellbeing of animal populations that is what makes the endangered species act so remarkable it s an extraordinary monument to human selfawareness as well as to our awareness of the world around us it says that for certain species determined by their vulnerability , not by any obvious value to humans we 're willing to place their interests ahead of ours as an act of conscience , it s hard to beat what got me thinking about this was an endangered kemp s ridley sea turtle she lay in the back of a pickup truck on padre island , tex , a few miles north of the national seashore her shell was nearly circular , almost exactly the size of a manhole cover , with an unexpected concavity on her left side the truck bed was lined with a blue plastic tarp , which kept slipping under the turtle as she tried to climb out she had just laid a nest full of eggs , and as soon as the scientists on hand led by donna shaver , from the padre island national seashore turtle lab had taken a blood sample and inserted a tag , the turtle would be lifted out and released on the beach , a few dozen yards from the gulf of mexico an endangered species sounds , almost inevitably , like a bureaucratic pigeonhole but there was nothing abstract about this turtle she showed an almost painful determination to get out of the truck bed and back onto the sand it had taken the same determination for her to stride out of the surf , walk across the sea wrack a ridge of seaweed cluttered with plastic debris and a few stranded portuguese menofwar and lay her eggs on the beach a marine biologist lowered her from the bed onto the sand i helped hold her while the final tag was inserted i knelt directly in front of her and placed my hands on what i thought of as her shoulders she drove against me , the last human obstacle between her and the gulf the wind blew , and behind me the surf roared then it was time to let go when she moved at last , she marched briskly down the sand between a double cordon of beachcombers and tourists who had happened upon the scene like me , none of them had ever knowingly come this close to a member of an endangered species before the turtle rested for a few minutes , then struck out again she nosed her way over the tidal debris , and then the biologist lifted her over a driftwood log that lay in her path from there it was a clean break for the sea , down the slick sand and into the pooling backwash of the surf i watched until the crest of her shell had gone under and the last swirls caused by her powerful strokes had been gathered up in a new inrush of water it was one of those rare moments when you suddenly realize , viscerally , the profound otherness the astonishing sufficiency of nature habitat barely suggests the convergence between the turtle and the sea she reentered it seemed , at the moment of reentry , to have the force of an atomic bond and yet what lay ahead of her was a radically impaired gulf , with a hypoxic dead zone at the outlet of the mississippi river nearly the size of new jersey many of the commercial fishing boats in the gulf now have nets fitted with turtleescape devices but the only way to make certain is to police the boats , a job the coast guard used to do in the days before homeland security moved front and center that kemp s ridley female was n't merely an individual turtle , fortunate to have lived to lay a nest of eggs that would be carefully incubated she s also the denizen of an administrative zone a legal habitat that exists solely because of our intermittent human ability to restrain ourselves all the force of her prodigious will , her enormous drive seaward , adds up to nothing without that
tel aviv , dec 12 tiny countries with big problems tend to make somber , selfconscious films in this instance , at least , israel is no exception still , israeli directors are making more of an effort to entertain as well , working harder to fit lifelike characters around bigger themes of sexual and religious politics one of the most successful is perhaps among the least likely an americanborn orthodox director , joseph cedar , whose portrayal of religious settlers has brought cries of betrayal down upon his head his second film , campfire , released in israel this year , is a story of sexual yearning and awakening , set in 1981 , as a widow with two daughters seeks companionship and community in the early settler movement the eldest daughter is saucy , the other meek when the younger daughter is molested during a holiday campfire , it sets off confrontations and quandaries that cause the widow to reject what she comes to see as a repressive communalism the leader of the settlers urges her to hush up the incident to protect the community unsurprisingly , she chooses to support her daughter in a slightly awkward effort to be uplifting , given its themes , the film ends cheerily , with the widow finding contentment with the only man in the film who is nice to her she , who wants to fit in , needs someone who has given up on fitting in , mr cedar says in an interview they awaken something for each other mr cedar , his eye on the larger world of film distribution , insists that he could have set this family drama anywhere , and that the fundamental human themes supersede the intricate israeli context the big trick in making any foreign movie is that it must be specific enough so local audiences do n't feel you 're turning them into something exotic , but universal enough so that others will recognize themselves , he said but this insider s view of the early days of the settler movement is inevitably political it is also fundamentally brave what interests him , he says , are characters who are able to break out of the community s tribal embrace but he also admits that the cynicism , hypocrisy and elitism of his fictionalized settlers and their leader are meant to comment on the current situation in israel , where the settler patriarch ariel sharon , the prime minister , has prompted fury by his desire to dismantle all israeli settlements in gaza and four tiny ones in the west bank there is something about our reality now that is undeniably influenced by the settlers' movement , mr cedar said i resent that , and that resentment is there in the movie his first film , time of favor \( 2000 \) , was more of a potboilerthriller about a plan born of misconstrued religious teaching and unrequited love to blow up the dome of the rock , a muslim shrine the anger his first film created among his own tribe of nationalreligious israelis helped provide the spark for this one people said , 'when we finally have one of our own , why do you show such things \? ' i thought i was making a film as a representative of a tribe and found people angry with me i needed to think about how much i needed to be accepted and loved by that tribe and this movie is a response , he said at the center of campfire is the effort to silence scandal there has been a similar response to the film , mr cedar said that s the flak i'm getting 'how can you put this out \? it s a sacrilege ! ' the hard core can only deal with me as someone who has left the fold and is betraying confidentiality but it s about me , too i'm part of the fold campfire \( medurat hashevet in hebrew \) won the top israeli prize for best feature film this year from a field of 24 , and is israel s nominee for the foreignlanguage category of the academy awards \( it is still seeking a united states distributor \) with few exceptions , the oscar has gone to obscure foreign films , but it can make a difference , especially in the united states , where people pay attention to prizes , said ruth diskin , who distributes many israeli documentaries and features the last israeli film to be an oscar finalist was beyond the walls , 20 years ago israeli films tend to be made on the european model , as joint productions of various companies , with some money from state finances for homegrown cinema israel had about 136 million to distribute this year campfire received money from the state , which provided about 70 percent of its budget from two television channels , one of them cable and from private financing it was made for about 900 , 000 compared , for example , with the multimillion budget for baz luhrmann s twominute advertisement for chanel no 5 , starring nicole kidman mr cedar , 36 , came to israel at the age of 5 when his parents emigrated to israel from new york he attended israeli schools and served as a paratrooper in the israeli army , but then went to new york university s film school , graduating in 1995 time of favor was also the israeli nominee for the foreignlanguage film oscar the critic stephen holden praised it in the new york times for its underlying concern with the consequences of words and with the complicated emotions fueling terrorist acts but he also said the film was quite crudely directed mr cedar has improved , it is fair to say in the jerusalem post , talya halkin called him arguably the jewish state s firstever oscarclass filmmaker he has also managed to make two films about settlers without a single palestinian , which comes up a lot , he says , at foreign festivals being an israeli at a european film festival is one long apology , he said the european press expects you to be in exile , and to meet their expectations is to be selfhating there have been other strong films this year , none of them very lighthearted two of the best deal in different ways with prostitution and the exploitation of women in israeli society amos gitai , 54 , one of the country s best and bestknown directors , did promised land , a feature with a documentary feel about the transport of women from the economic mess of the former soviet union \( in this case estonia , although moldova is the most prevalent example \) through the sinai desert to tatty destinations in haifa and tel aviv i was looking for fields of jewisharab cooperation , mr gitai said there s music , and then crime and israelis try to be excellent in everything they do , whether it s hightech or the smuggling of women for sex in a wellresearched tale of exploitation , the film mixes bedouins in sinai with native and newly arrived israelis from the former soviet union internationally known actresses like hanna schygulla and anne parillaud take gritty roles , while rosamund pike , a former bond girl , plays a mystifying character a tourist or semijournalist who identifies with the prostitutes and joins them even harsher , if possible , is or , a film by keren yedaya , about an hivinfected prostitute and her and horrified teenage daughter , named or , played with awkward grace by dana ivgy this is an enormously angry film men here are evil and ridiculous , made childish or brutal by sex but the tractlike nature of the film is redeemed by good acting and an unsweetened look at the mother , who gives the same , insincere patter to her daughter as to her clients many people , feminists included , choose to maintain the illusion of choice , or the illusion of the power of women who work as prostitutes , ms yedaya , 32 , said or does not want to become a prostitute , but is battered repeatedly and broken , she said or , which means skin in hebrew , is french for gold , and this french coproduction is also known as mon tr sor , or my treasure or s descent into prostitution will strike some as forced or diagrammatic , but we 're a long way from pretty woman correction december 16 , 2004 , thursday an article in the arts on monday about new films by israeli directors mistranslated the hebrew title of the movie or the word means light , not skin
a gleaming , sheercut wall of brass hit me from behind pounding timpani and crashing cymbals rattled my cartilage a wave of woodwinds and strings swept me along for a time , the monumental thrust and sharp rhythmic snap of the march in the third movement of tchaikovsky s sixth symphony made me feel as though the music were playing my instrument instead of vice versa it was the ultimate in surroundsound , and not surprisingly , because i was sitting smack in the middle of the stage at avery fisher hall , an amateur clarinetist embedded in the clarinet section of the new york philharmonic to my left was stanley drucker , in his 55th season with the philharmonic and a legend among clarinetists surrounding me were heirs to a symphonic tradition molded by the likes of mahler , toscanini and bernstein in front of me was the latest in that line , lorin maazel his dancing eyebrows , along with the black notes on the page , stood out with extraordinary clarity in the bright stage lights some 2 , 800 people , a soldout house , sat in the darkness beyond it was a thrilling moment for a music lover , someone who started clarinet lessons at age 11 , had a mother who actually got him to practice , and has played in many amateur orchestras and chamber groups special satisfaction came from sharing the stage with a quintessential new york institution it was , after all , the orchestra that i grew up with , starting with its young people s concerts but there was also a professional reason to be there as a reporter , i was getting the chance to experience what it felt like to play in a great orchestra , an organism that at its best has the might of a jet engine , the delicacy of an eyesurgeon s laser and the coloristic nuance of a monet painting i was only the third nonprofessional to play with the orchestra , management said the others were a young oboist who had come in 1999 by way of the makeawish foundation \( the foundation sent a second player on june 11 , the week after my appearance \) , and george plimpton , who played percussion during a canadian tour in 1967 yet it all came together with extraordinary ease all the necessary people signed off , among them eric latzky , the orchestra s public relations director zarin mehta , executive director and now president carl r schiebler , the personnel manager members of the players' committee mr maazel and , critically , mr drucker , who as the orchestra s longestserving member wields immense influence within the ensemble with the final approval , the reality of the situation hit me was this an elaborate practical joke \? would i flounder in a sea of flop sweat \? and why were they letting me do this , anyway \? people associated with the orchestra suggested a number of reasons perhaps most important , in a time of declining audiences , classical music needs all the help it can get the philharmonic in particular has been stung by a series of public relations problems , notably its failed plan to move to carnegie hall , and perhaps most of all , a longstanding reputation false , the players insist that they are an unruly bunch \( indeed , several players asked me afterward if i thought they were as difficult as people said \) mr latzky and i settled on the program scheduled to start june 3 in addition to tchaikovsky s sixth symphony , his famous path tique , the program would include rachmaninoff s fourth piano concerto , with yefim bronfman as soloist , and scriabin s poem of ecstasy shortly after getting an ok from the philharmonic , i received permission to practice in the subbasement of the new york times before , i had generally tried to squeeze in at least 15 minutes of practice a day now , that would not be nearly enough i needed to lift my game way , way up although it is not hard to get a sound out of the clarinet , to do it well requires a complex set of physical functions the muscles surrounding the mouth must come together to create firm support around the mouthpiece and reed the tongue is responsible for a large array of articulations the diaphragm must provide a continuous column of air the fingers must fall with perfection to eliminate any space between notes all these endeavors must take place simultaneously and without conscious thought none of this takes into account the brain , which must handle phrasing , rhythm , musicality and blending with other players now , imagine a stage full of people , all of them going through the same process first notes on may 18 , 16 days before the concert , i met with mr drucker in an office in avery fisher after a gentle probing of my musical background , which included lessons with the new york teacher irving neidich , peter hadcock of the boston symphony orchestra and the freelancer chester brezniak , and a performance with my college orchestra at symphony hall in boston , he offered two pieces of advice do n't faint on stage , and when in doubt , leave it out to prepare , he said , find a good reed , and do n't practice too much i was told i would be treated like a regular substitute the brochure for subs that i was given listed payment of 1 , 980 for a week of rehearsals and concerts , or 198 for a twoandahalfhour rehearsal and 396 for a single concert , although alas , i was not to be paid \( the base salary for a regular player is 104 , 000 , though many earn far more than that \) the brochure stipulated that performers must wear white tie and tails , and no cologne or perfume i left with a spare copy of the clarinet part of the tchaikovsky with the word drucker written on the last page this is a common practice intended to help orchestra members remember whether they have played a specific part and find out who else has done so the signatures on some scores go back a century i planned to add mine ten days later , on may 27 , mr drucker and i met again so he could hear me play mr drucker , 75 , is an institution not only in the city but also in the musical world born and raised in brooklyn , he entered the orchestra shortly after world war ii a compact man with penetrating eyes , irongray hair and boyishly crooked front teeth , he has an ageless look , or as charles rex , a violinist , put it , stanley s the new york philharmonic s version of dick clark mr drucker and i decided that i would join him in playing the first clarinet part but when i inquired about the hauntingly beautiful clarinet solos in the first movement , he suggested that my playing them would not be a good idea we do have paying customers , he pointed out with a smile fine with me the path tique presented other challenges the piece is full of elastic tempo shifts , extremes of loudness and softness , powerful entrances after silences it is also one of the orchestra s mostperformed pieces , played by the philharmonic or its predecessors nearly 200 times , one of which was the american premiere in 1894 as we went through the part , mr drucker bracketed off sections for me to play , a mix of passages in which the whole orchestra would be playing as well as exposed passages in which the clarinets stood out he also told me not to worry about when to make my entrances mr maazel would take care of that that s one thing this guy is , is clear , mr drucker said then he had me play the sections we 'd selected , drilling me in several places and conducting with his mechanical pencil do n't hang over notes into rests , he instructed do n't be so tense with my tonguing hear the beats in my head be absolutely precise with the internal rhythms my heart sank i could play the notes , but i was not always rhythmically precise at one point , mr drucker changed his mind about my playing one particularly exposed passage but he praised my sound , told me i must have been good in my youth \( thanks , stanley ! \) and pronounced himself confident in my abilities then he noticed my spare mouthpiece , an oldfashioned model that he had long coveted despite using the same one for 56 years , he was obsessed with searching out mouthpieces he offered to trade twoforone , and when i agreed , he dropped my mouthpiece into his jacket breast pocket it felt like lending derek jeter a bat when i told my wife this story , she took it as another sign that we clarinetists \( we clarinetists ! \) were crazy doubts and dry runs there were two rehearsals on june 2 , the day before the actual concert i spent the previous night studying the score , reading about the symphony , and listening to bernstein s extremely slow recording and riccardo muti s much fleeter version with the philadelphia orchestra that night , themes from the path tique spun through my head when i arrived at avery fisher the next morning , musicians were pouring in from the suburbs , where many of them live i headed to one of the eight cramped dressing rooms and was warming up when i heard a crash , followed by a stream of curses oh , my god ! a violinist cried out oh , my beloved bow ! she had tripped going up the stairs and fallen on the bow , snapping it clean listening to her sobs , i hoped the accident was not a bad omen a bit later , wandering upstairs to the stage , i saw mr drucker with the other members of the section the second clarinetist is pascual martinez forteza , a 31yearold spaniard who joined three years ago stephen freeman , a 38year veteran , was playing bass clarinet , although he had only four notes in the symphony the associate principal clarinetist , mark nuccio , who joined in 1999 , was playing the first part in the piano concerto i was sitting roughly in the middle of the stage , sandwiched between mr drucker and the laidback mr martinez forteza , whose rich , low register tones supported me like a rock at 11 am , mr maazel took the podium for the tchaikovsky , and without a word started the piece the basses rumbled forth after three slow beats , judith leclair , the principal bassoonist , began a solo , giving a first inkling of what raises an orchestra to this level her opening note , low and soft and consequently one of the more challenging entrances in the repertory , conveyed utter confidence that was only the beginning rhythmic figures were played with extraordinary precision the musicians played eloquently as soloists , though when necessary they could blend exquisitely i was also struck by how the players invested even the simplest phrases with expressiveness if mr maazel held a beat here , or pushed forward there , they reacted instantly , like fighter pilots adjusting a wing it was surprisingly easy to play with them the solidity of their intonation , rhythm and musicality were like beacons that had only to be followed after a few measures , mr maazel stopped again , without a word , he made a ballooning motion with his arms to indicate how to phrase a short viola motif then he started again when he spoke , it was softly , with authority , but not without humor sorry to interrupt , he said a few minutes later while some of the woodwinds chattered during one loud passage , which was apparently not loud enough in the clarinets , he said with a smile , we 'd like to ask the new york times to make their contribution my jitters began to fade , but i realized i would have to concentrate fearsomely to play with the same rhythmic exactitude as my section mates in a soft woodwind passage , i accidentally changed notes a bit early and felt mortified , although nobody said anything later after rehearsing the final movement , mr drucker left like a shot to catch the 2 37 to massapequa , on long island mr nuccio took the stage to rehearse the rachmaninoff you always dream about being in an orchestra , especially one like this , mr nuccio said afterward when you first sit down , you ca n't believe you 're actually here it continues kenneth gordon , a first violinist with 43 years in the orchestra , described playing in the philharmonic this way it s like putting on a yankee uniform on the firing line playing at the open rehearsal the next morning was not only like being in the ballpark but having a crowd in the stands then , that evening , came the main event the concert was at 8 pm i arrived an hour early , and the security guard at avery fisher s stage door , one flight above the secondfloor lobby , wished me a meaningful good luck as he let me in in the musician s lounge , robert langevin , the principal flutist , was calmly eating chinese food i dressed and asked mr drucker if he had any final words of advice just do n't faint on stage , he said see you on the firing line i was less nervous than i 'd expected my mouth was dry , but my breathing was under control although i did n't play for the first page , i followed every note in my part , worrying that i would screw up my very first entrance , a series of fast 16th notes followed a little later by three measures of an exposed woodwind choir that required my paying careful attention to mr maazel this was the part i had slightly flubbed earlier this time i nailed it relief flooded over me to be honest , i was not perfect , once dropping out when i momentarily lost focus in a fast passage and at one point flubbing a run \( mr drucker later comforted me by pointing out that my mistake had been well covered up by the rest of the orchestra \) but my more prominent passages , playing alone with mr martinez forteza , went well i listened as , just to my left , mr drucker played the limpid solos of the first movement with surprising freedom give the audience something to remember , he said later in the orchestra as a whole , there were some missed entrances , several slightly fuzzy moments , and a flash or two of flawed intonation , but i doubt that anyone in the audience noticed mr maazel had clearly been holding back during the rehearsals tonight , he brought an extra intensity to climactic moments many people have complained about the acoustics in avery fisher hall , but from where i sat , they sounded great thomas stacy , the english horn player , likened the difference between sitting in the audience and sitting in the orchestra to the difference between drinking instant coffee and sipping espresso to me , it was the difference between gazing at the seashore and floating on an ocean of sound when it was over , as the audience clapped , mr martinez forteza patted his thigh in a quiet applause for me , mr drucker shook my hand , and mr langevin flashed me a thumb s up i reached for my score and added my name at the end , right below the name drucker a times colleague who reviewed the concert , allan kozinn , wrote , on purely technical grounds , the orchestra s playing could hardly be bettered , which i took as a direct compliment however , the critic described mr maazel s interpretation as fiery but oddly chilling , a criticism mr maazel seemed to anticipate in a conversation the previous day it did a disservice to the composer to focus solely on the emotional aspects of the sixth symphony , he said of other conductors , adding the vulgarization of tchaikovsky by interpreters not worthy of him has always distressed me back in the dressing room during intermission , the violinists marc ginsberg and vladimir tsypin continued their perpetual chess game joseph robinson , the principal oboist , wrapped up the day s crossword puzzle i changed and went upstairs to the wings for the rest of the concert after rousing encores from mussorgsky s pictures at an exhibition , a beaming mr maazel stepped off stage , lowered his head , pumped his arms like a runner , then charged back out for a final bow after the concert , i felt an odd mix of emotions while i had not played the entire symphony , i had truly made music , matching the section in dynamic changes and following mr maazel s subtle tempo shifts the musicians had treated me with a combination of curiosity and friendliness , reminding me how it felt to be a member of a musical fraternity mr robinson , the oboist , later wrote me a note saying that although he did not hear much of me , i hit all the right notes as a colleague in the dressing room but sitting next to mr drucker made me aware of how far i was from such mastery wistfully , i realized that i had probably made the right career choice , though i regretted that my mother and kindly mr neidich were not alive to hear me and perhaps the letdown i felt after so much anticipation and preparation was inevitable at the same time , i felt both exhilarated and reinvigorated as a musician the next morning i practiced hard , and i have n't stopped since maybe the subbasement is still free
not once has the connecticut democratic primary produced a president from senator edward m kennedy to gary hart to jerry brown , the sometimes surprising democrats who have won the state in the spring have lost the nation by november if not earlier yet relevance seemed attainable just last year , in the brief but optimistic days when senator joseph i lieberman of connecticut appeared to be a strong candidate , and a primary victory in his home state might have made a fine platform for declaring a broader victory on super tuesday but now , even though the senator is still on the ballot in the connecticut primary , his candidacy is over , and so , it would seem , is whatever opportunity the state had to become a player in primary season when democratic voters in the state go to the polls tuesday , many observers expect senator john kerry of massachusetts , the new local favorite by default , to walk away with the bulk of the 49 delegates at stake he s going to win the primary in connecticut , predicted ken dautrich , director of the uconn poll and a political scientist at the university of connecticut we stopped polling that a few weeks ago he s almost like a senator from connecticut he s very popular here mr dautrich said the state s proximity to the boston media market and mr kerry s nextdoor neighbor status had given him exposure over the years that would easily secure the state his polling also showed mr kerry as by far the strongest candidate in connecticut in a general election against president bush mr kerry s apparent dominance may help explain why , as a state democratic consultant , roy w occhiogrosso , summarized it , he and other candidates are not advertising here and not campaigning here asked how much television advertising mr kerry had done in connecticut , his state coordinator , nick paindiris , said none zero mr kerry s wife , teresa heinz kerry , plans to visit stamford and greenwich on sunday , and cate edwards , daughter of senator john edwards of north carolina , is to visit south norwalk the same day , but the leading candidates themselves have no plans to come before tuesday , their campaigns said friday a spokeswoman for the rev al sharpton said mr sharpton had been to connecticut more than once in recent weeks and howard dean , the former governor of vermont , spoke thursday night in new haven , his first public appearance since dropping out of the race last week dr dean , whose brother jim is a state resident and has been a prominent supporter , did not discourage his supporters from voting for him in connecticut dr dean s communications director in the state , susan wallace , said that dr dean had built a strong network and that she expected him to do well , even without calling himself a candidate connecticut goes against the national grain , ms wallace said candidates who receive 15 percent or more of the vote in any of the state s five congressional districts are eligible to win a percentage of connecticut delegates a former state representative , joe courtney , who described himself as a recovering lieberman supporter , has helped oversee a recent regrouping of the edwards campaign in connecticut after mr lieberman s departure from the race while mr courtney conceded that mr kerry was now the favorite , and while southerners from jimmy carter to bill clinton have lost the state in the past , he noted al gore s primary victory in 2000 and said new englanders were not fundamentally opposed to supporting a southerner we 're all kind of trying to evaluate who can beat bush , said mr courtney , adding that i really think that moderate southern democrats with a populist streak who have a talent for connecting with middleclass voters were the formula for success some democrats suggested that the recent ethical scandal surrounding connecticut s republican governor , john g rowland , could help increase democratic turnout but most expected that mr rowland s troubles , if they played a role at all , were more likely to be an issue in a general election , when they say republicans could suffer a backlash in the state neither mr lieberman nor his fellow democratic senator from connecticut , christopher j dodd , have endorsed a candidate a spokeswoman for mr lieberman , casey adenwansbury , said mr lieberman has advised his supporters to vote for their second choice who is still running even if mr kerry proves vulnerable in the state , if the surging mr edwards or the dormant but still popular dr dean shows strongly , history suggests that success in the connecticut primary is far from a ticket to the white house since the state first held a presidential primary , in 1980 , the only candidate to have won in connecticut and nationwide was a republican , the elder george bush , in 1988 told of the state primary s status as something of an antibellwether for democrats , mr dautrich , the political scientist , said , that s not a good omen for kerry
to the editor many people are stating as fact that president bush lied about iraq and weapons of mass destruction , and that the bush team s planning for the war and its aftermath has been one big bungled operation both these assertions are wrong bill clinton , tony blair and the united nations all thought like mr bush that saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction either they were all lying or none of them were lying as for planning , there have been far fewer bungles in this war than in past wars if franklin d roosevelt , george c marshall , winston churchill and dwight d eisenhower had been subjected to the kind of minutetominute scrutiny and public polling that the bush team is subjected to today , none of them would have lasted out world war ii mark r godburn great barrington , mass , may 21 , 2004

concise illustrated history , diane mcwhorter tells us that she was motivated to write her first book , the epiclength , pulitzer prizewinning carry me home , by the fear that her father was a member of the ku klux klan and might have had a hand in the 1963 bombing of the 16th street baptist church in birmingham , ala , which killed four black girls about her age this book , she says , is inspired by her daughters , or more precisely by the fear that they may take the freedom they experience for granted and never know how much things have changed and how many people changed them her young people s history fuses memoir with a fastpaced chronology , lyric feeling with historical precision the oppression of africanamericans around me did not strike me as having anything to do with my life , she writes of her childhood looking back at that time , mcwhorter is quick to say that the true heroes of the movement were the children , some named , many nameless , of little rock and greensboro and tuscaloosa and , most conspicuously , birmingham exposed to the vulgar hatred of mobs , attacked by police dogs , pounded by fire hoses , children led the way the distinction of mcwhorter s book is the elevation of these child warriors to the prominence they are due their protests moved two presidents to act to end segregation and extend the right to vote yet those victories left crises in their wake though discriminatory laws were swept away , poverty and inequality remained the young people who had marched behind the banner of nonviolence grew restive martin luther king jr could not control them by the mid60 s , even before the assassination of king , the movement was split along generational and ideological lines mcwhorter calls the civil rights struggle america s second civil war the drama she writes about may also be likened to a play in which the actors have left the theater before the third act the stage is set for the play to resume because the movement for freedom and democracy , in mcwhorter s apt expression , gives america meaning by breaking out periodically in active , selfconscious struggle to realize american ideals , africanamericans democratize the nation america s love for freedom was nurtured in plain view of massive unfreedom , in the form of slavery the founding fathers cherished their liberty all the more because they knew what its opposite was like marilyn nelson s eulogy for a slave who lived in new england , fortune s bones the manumission requiem , jolts us out of any feeling we might have that another person s misfortune is none of our business nelson is the poet laureate of connecticut , a state that , judging by two other recent holders of that post , leo connellan and james merrill , takes poetry seriously an earlier book of hers for children , carver a life in poems , depicting the life of george washington carver , rescued the great botanist and inventor from the platitudes of black history month and popular reductionism fortune was the name of a slave owned by dr preserved porter , who specialized in setting bones when fortune died , in 1798 , at about 60 , the doctor boiled his bones and dried them so that he could have a skeleton to study four succeeding generations of porters became doctors , having first learned the names of the bones in the body from fortune s bones sally porter law mcglannan , the last porter doctor , recalled playing with the skeleton as a child , a scene that inspired nelson to imagine the children taking the skull out of its wooden box and rolling it around the floor fortune s assembled bones are now part of a permanent display at the mattatuck museum , in waterbury , conn , which includes a discussion of waterbury s slaves and slave owners \( www fortunestory org \) the museum commissioned nelson to eulogize fortune , and she used the form of a traditional funeral mass for her poems we do n't think of slavery in connection with the constitution state with the cottongrowing states of the south , yes , but not with apples and onions , oats and rye neither do we imagine black hands toting and laying stones for the kind of fences robert frost liked to lean on north or south , however , slavery meant unremitting work and suffering forensic analysis of fortune s bones , showing numerous injuries , tells the tale of his life of labor the poet speaks through an assortment of characters dinah , fortune s widow , relates how miss lydia , dr porter s widow , became sick at the thought of the doctor rendering her husband s bones dr porter announces his wish to see his former slave serve the advance of science dissecting the body gives him an unexpected thrill , and his clinical reserve gives way to a flood of fantastic images note well how death softens the human skin , making it almost transparent , so that under my reverent knife the first cut takes my breath away it feels like cutting the whole world it falls open like bridal gossamer in the section called kyrie of the bones , a speaker who had played with the bones tells us that he also supplied them with an identity i called him larry , he says it was easier to face him with an imaginary name the name stuck , which is to say that someone at some point wrote the name larry on the skull , usurping , until nelson came along , the name of the man whose bones these are the museum committee that oversees the exhibit is currently divided over whether to continue displaying fortune s skeleton or to give the bones a dignified burial visitors are divided , too the genuine bones have an allure that a cast reproduction might not they do n't merely evoke the ghost of slavery , they give us a view of its infrastructure on the other hand , there is no evidence that fortune gave dr porter permission to preserve his remains the exploitation of the living man continues in death , an injustice that lies in poetry s peculiar power to correct by elevating him from a curiosity to the subject of a frighteningly honest work of art , marilyn nelson endows fortune with life both in and out of time , releasing him from the shackles of his master s intentions children s books theodore rosengarten is the author of tombee portrait of a cotton planter , and the coeditor , with his wife , dale rosengarten , of a portion of the people three hundred years of southern jewish life
