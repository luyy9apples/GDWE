kuala lumpur , malaysia the malaysian authorities released new details on tuesday to buttress their conclusion that flight 370 must have ended in a crash in a remote part of the indian ocean but with no physical evidence of the plane s fate yet found , and the search suspended for a day because of treacherous weather , distraught relatives and friends of passengers mounted an angry protest in beijing , breaking through police lines and marching to the malaysian embassy demanding more answers hishammuddin hussein , malaysia s defense minister and acting transportation minister , said at a news conference near kuala lumpur that the plane appeared to have sent one more partial signal eight minutes after the last of the previously disclosed electronic handshakes between the plane and a satellite , which engineers have analyzed to infer the plane s probable path after it disappeared from radar screens early on march 8 mr hishammuddin called the newly reported signal a partial handshake at this time , this transmission is not understood , and is subject to further ongoing work , he said the last full handshake was recorded at 8 11 am , more than seven hours after the plane took off from kuala lumpur bound for beijing with 227 passengers and 12 crew members the next satellite signal from the aircraft would have been due by 9 15 am , but it never came mr hishammuddin referred delicately to the likelihood that signals stopped because the plane ran out of fuel and crashed , saying that the timing is consistent with the maximum endurance of the aircraft his office later released additional technical details about the way the satellite signals had been analyzed and about how those calculations had narrowed down the search area none of this appeared to have diminished the mistrust felt by the relatives and friends of chinese citizens who were on flight 370 , who have been bitterly critical of malaysia s handling of the search a group of them protested outside the malaysian embassy in beijing at midday tuesday , demanding that officials tell them the full truth about the flight the group shoved past police officers as it left its hotel and arrived at the embassy on foot about 40 minutes later the street was crowded with journalists , police officers and people trying to reach some of the other embassies on the street a line of paramilitary police officers blocked journalists from following the marchers up the road the group presented a malaysian diplomat with a scathing statement saying that the families would regard malaysian leaders and the statecontrolled operator of the flight , malaysia airlines , to be murderers if it emerged that missteps had led to the deaths of their loved ones later in the afternoon at the hotel where the families were staying , a man who said that he represented them and that his surname was wang asserted that the malaysian government had not given any evidence to back its conclusion that the plane had crashed at sea with no survivors he said most of the families did not believe that account the malaysian ambassador to china arrived at the hotel after 3 pm and spoke privately to the relatives and friends gathered in the hotel ballroom people in the room said the anger and frustration were palpable the chinese government continued to express skepticism as well we are highly concerned with malaysia s conclusion , and have demanded full information and the evidence that supports the conclusion , a foreign ministry spokesman , hong lei , said at a news conference in kuala lumpur , mr hishammuddin bristled when a succession of chinese journalists questioned him about delays in finding the missing jetliner can i also remind you that we received satellite data from china , regarding sightings in the south china sea , which made us distract ourselves from the search and rescue to search areas that had already been searched \? he said his office released calculations from inmarsat , a british satellite communications company , based on the handshake signals those calculations pointed to an area of the southern indian ocean where the plane must have wound up , assuming it was flying at a ground speed between 400 and 450 knots , or about 460 to 520 miles per hour that narrowed the search area down to onefifth of its peak size , though it is still vast about 470 , 000 square nautical miles , greater than the area of california , arizona , new mexico , oregon and washington state combined surveillance aircraft have been trying to sweep about 20 , 000 square nautical miles of ocean a day , though they could not do so on tuesday because of a storm the australian maritime safety authority said the search would resume on wednesday we are not searching for a needle in a haystack we are still trying to define where the haystack is , air marshal mark binskin , the deputy chief of the australian military , told reporters at pearce air force base near perth , australia , where the aircraft are based david johnston , australia s defense minister , said the search area was probably one of the most remote parts of the planet and one that has shipwrecked many sailors he said an australian ship that was hunting for possible floating debris had to move 75 miles off its station on tuesday because of the weather mr johnston called the maritime search , involving ships and aircraft from australia , new zealand , china , south korea , japan , the united states and other nations , one of the largest efforts you 'll ever see but none of the vessels had yet recovered any of the large floating objects sighted by planes or satellites , suggesting that the plane could be in an altogether different area an american submersible craft capable of finding objects on the sea floor was being flown to perth on tuesday , but rear adm john kirby , a pentagon spokesman , said it would be useful only once the general location of the plane s wreckage was known it s being sent there to be ready , should there be a need , admiral kirby said and right now , there s no need we do not have a debris field as for the malaysian police inquiry into the plane s disappearance , khalid bin abu bakar , the forces' inspector general , declined to discuss details on tuesday , saying , that would jeopardize the ongoing investigations in kuala lumpur , malaysia airlines said that though the investigation had not found the plane or the reason it vanished , relatives of those on board had to let go of any hope for a miracle we must accept the painful reality that the aircraft is now lost , and that none of the passengers or crew on board survived , said mohamed nor yusof , the chairman of malaysia airlines he said the airline s primary responsibility now was caring for the grieving families
the pope , a porn star and a parrot walk into a bar well , almost their point of intersection just a week and a half ago was actually st peter s square , and porn star stretches things the performer in question was reportedly a former male stripper who had graduated to racy movies and , this being italy , was once head of his town council sounds like prime minister material to me a chip off the old silvio he brought the bird , named amore , to meet the pope , meaning francis , who was taking one of his routine spins among the flock in the popemobile amore , perched briefly on one of his fingers and squawked what the crowd was papa ! those syllables , i 'd bet , were a big improvement over other utterances amore has learned to mimic it s amazing what you miss if you do n't stay on top of vatican news these days did you hear about the harley \? a gift to francis that he put his signature on but apparently never used , the for more than 275 , 000 or his recent introduction to a lifesize likeness of himself \? pope benedict xvi was known as god s rottweiler pope francis has a dessert doppelg nger that pretty much says it all it was pope john paul ii who was often called a rock star , but it s francis who just landed on the , as if he were jagger , springsteen or spears seeing him there was like finding mitch mcconnell scowling below the logo of tiger beat on my vague mental list of things that might someday come back into fashion , the papacy was never present i used to cover it for the times , from 2002 to 2004 , and was convinced then that my beat was n't just a dying man john paul could barely walk and struggled to talk but a dying institution , at least in the united states and much of europe but the bevy of bulletins from rome and the merry nature of so many of them suggest that people everywhere , even in the more godless precincts of the western world , ca n't get enough of this new pope and are committed to giving him the benefit of the doubt the united nations last week about the roman catholic church s coddling of sexually abusive priests and its evasion of full accountability , but in none of the news coverage was francis put on the hot seat there was this implicit notion that the mess predated and had little to do with him , which is ridiculous he s been a part of this institution for a long time , and if he 'd been agitating for reform and full transparency all these years , he 'd never have ascended to the top he s no renegade but he is the equivalent of a corporate turnaround artist or a political strategist who deftly breathes fresh life into a sputtering enterprise i use those secular metaphors because his rehabilitation of the papacy has so much secular resonance and so many secular lessons like this if you 're going to define yourself in opposition to a predecessor whom many people had misgivings about , go all the way francis is the bill de blasio to benedict s michael bloomberg , doing a complete semiotic overhaul less investment in festive footwear , more in the washing of he s not telling priests to stop being priests , any more than de blasio is telling the police to stop being the police he s just urging them to tamp down the brusqueness and bullying no more theological stopandfrisk he understands that tone trumps content that it s everything , really the writer damon linker has contributed lively , intelligent pieces of commentary to the publications and that take francisfawning journalists to task for seeing a revolution that s just not there linker asserts that the church , under this pope , has not in fact changed its teaching about homosexuality , the ordination of women , celibacy or any of that and he s absolutely correct but he gives short shrift to what a difference a smile and a shrug make francis , who has mastered both , may not be telling the church s scolds that they have to relinquish their dogma , but his manner and diction are telling everyone else that he s not going to harangue them that it s neither his inclination nor his place and that s huge who am i to judge \? this , from a pope , is like streisand saying , who am i to sing \? it s a bit of selfeffacement that you never saw coming francis has also grasped that timing is everything , a point proved by the reception to his recent apostolic exhortation about the corrosive effects of greed in the world this statement was lauded as a bold , overdue enunciation of muffled catholic principle , but his predecessors , even benedict in his furlined stole , did n't exactly cheer the excesses of corporate titans and upbraid the underclass for being loafers hooked on government largess charity for the poor is as consistent a message as any the church preaches francis just landed his sermon at the perfect moment of welling anxiety about income inequality , and he had the additional savvy to pepper it with words and phrases at the heart of the heated political debate about what to do besides , he s attentive to the coordination of message and optics advocating generosity toward the needy is infinitely more effective when you 've traded the usual papal residence for a lessregal guesthouse and the customary chariot for a ford focus it has a practicingwhatyoupreach modesty and authenticity to it above all , francis has recognized and taken advantage of the fact that people of all stripes liberals , conservatives are as hungry for saints as they are for , well , chocolate they may not have much patience for the vocabulary of shame and the fustiest definitions of sin , but they want examples of goodness and calls to grace , and they 'll respond eagerly to the ones that do n't come with exclusionary rules and harping about penance that s part of what gave mandela and gandhi such currency beyond their countries they were spiritual leaders minus the catechism the world has no glut of these i believe in god , not in a catholic god , francis has said , and he s even expressed respect for atheists when one of the stars of philomena and the woman on whom it s based last week , he was n't put off by complaints about the movie s anticatholicism or suspicion that the pair s visit was part of an oscar campaign he welcomed and met with them an ecumenical papacy , he realizes , has more sway and stamina than a narrowly , stridently pious one it s a big tent he s unfurling parrots and porn stars welcome
hong kong manni ng has stayed with s protest movement from the start , boycotting her classes , sleeping in a tent on a city street , even cleaning up garbage but after an attempt by the demonstrators to surround the city government complex failed over the weekend , she is wondering how to continue ms ng , like many of the student protesters here , will soon have to tell her parents about her involvement , something she has been avoiding because of their opposition to the movement more important , she and thousands of other young people have learned firsthand just how daunting it is to go up against the highly organized , uncompromising communist government in beijing and now , polls show waning sympathy for the students among the general public but in some ways , her life is much richer than it was before demonstrators took to the streets here in late september , and the changes suggest that the citizens of may be able to sustain a protest movement for years , if not decades in two months , ms ng , a film student at the , has formed the most intense friendships of her life she has also shed her previous view of the city as a cruel place after seeing the generosity and selflessness of her fellow protesters , and she has vowed , at age 22 , to keep pressing for democracy in the former british colony , even if it takes a lifetime i'm very worried about this place , but i do n't know what can i do , ms ng , wearing a black hoodie , blackrimmed glasses and braces on her teeth , said on monday i know the opportunity for success is small , but this movement has shown that we are powerful and this place is ours maybe we can take a little rest , and one day we 'll be back the demonstrations , now in their 10th week , may soon reach a finale as the police increasingly whittle away at the main protest area and as students , prodemocracy lawmakers and sympathetic academics wrangle over how to proceed in the early morning on monday , the police began their most aggressive incursion in two months , clearing demonstrators from a pedestrian bridge that spans the heart of the protest area late on monday evening , a student protest leader , joshua wong , and two other young demonstrators said they would begin a hunger strike to try to pressure the government to hold talks on elections in hong kong after that setback , the thousands of people who took part are thinking about what comes next in interviews , demonstrators spoke of the resilience of the movement and of an organizational prowess built on grassroots volunteerism but they also expressed a newfound realization of how arduous their fight may turn out to be in many ways , the protest movement is back where it was on aug 31 , when s legislature laid out for elections in hong kong prodemocracy activists say those rules ensure that only candidates acceptable to beijing will be able to appear on the ballot for the city s top job , the chief executive that decision led to the protests , originally called occupy central , which were meant to pressure the hong kong and chinese governments into changing the election guidelines so that prodemocracy candidates could have a chance to run for the office since then , the governments in hong kong and beijing have made clear that the decision , by the national people s congress of china , is not negotiable president xi jinping , last month at a news conference with president obama , called the protests illegal the fact is that the movement is going down , said jack pun , 47 , a professional commercial translator who for over a month has operated a stall at the protest site in the admiralty district that hands out postcards with pictures and ink stamps illustrating the movement s ideals it s very hard to maintain such a large movement for such a large time it would be better to bring it to an end by ourselves a surge of support for the movement after the police fired tear gas on the protesters in late september has faded a conducted by the university of hong kong and released in midnovember found that almost 55 percent of people surveyed opposed occupy central and that more than four in five wanted the demonstrations to end the poll of 513 people was conducted nov 17 and 18 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 44 percentage points still , mr pun , like many other demonstrators , said the events of the fall had given him new confidence it s very hard to believe that you have the courage to resist the police , he said nobody ever imagined so many things about our movement nobody ever imagined that our movement would be represented by an umbrella nikki lau , a 34yearold assistant film director with cropped hair dyed flaming red , has been among the volunteers supporting the protest site since it sprang up on sept 28 after a worsening bout of fever that began 45 days into the occupation , she has come less frequently already petite , she estimated she had lost 15 pounds i had no idea i could go this far , she said none of us did ms lau said the two months of protest had transformed the views that many hong kong residents , including her , had about the city and its people s capacity for defiance it s hong kong people giving civil disobedience a whole new definition she said the main lesson that many ordinary residents had come away with was that they could speak out that s never been a problem for me , but for a lot of people that s been something to learn , she said but , she added , there s also a dark side to this to see that politics are never easy we do n't know why they do n't talk to us , why there s so much behind closed doors , she said , referring to the government i 'll remain involved in the movement , but also looking at the big picture of how long it s going to take benny tai , a law professor who helped plan the movement more than a year ago , said that after the decision by china s legislature , what was needed was a movement that could endure for years or decades , much like the american civil rights movement ms ng , the student , said she was ready for just such a protracted struggle she knows the odds , but she also knows how much the effort has helped reshape her life this is a lifelong movement , she said we cannot give up because we belong to this place if we want this place to be well , we cannot just leave it
philadelphia every year in the united states thousands of men and women die from cancers that can be prevented with a simple vaccine sadly , uptake of this preventing vaccine is abysmal one reason doctors do n't want to talk about sex the good news is , they do n't have to in the past decade , the centers for disease control and prevention , in concert with the american academy of pediatrics , has recommended three vaccines for adolescents one to prevent meningococcus , which causes bloodstream infections and another , given in a threeinone shot called tdap , to prevent , and \( whooping cough \) and a third to prevent \( hpv \) , which causes several types of cancer in july , the cdc announced the most recent results of its teenage survey around 80 percent of adolescents now receive the meningococcal and tdap vaccines the hpv vaccine , however , is a different story only 57 percent of girls had started the threedose series 38 percent had finished it in boys , for whom the vaccine was recommended a few years ago , 35 percent had started and 14 percent had finished the series it s frustrating to report almost the same hpv vaccination coverage levels among girls for another year , said dr anne schuchat , director of the national center for immunization and respiratory diseases at the cdc , in a statement why are adolescents and their parents embracing meningococcal and tdap vaccines but not the hpv vaccine \? one possible explanation is a clash between perception and reality , people just do n't understand how serious an infection hpv can be in a typical year in the united states about 150 people die from meningococcus , four from tetanus , none from diphtheria , 20 from pertussis , and roughly 4 , 000 from cancers caused by hpv people are more than 20 times more likely to die from hpv than from the other four diseases combined about 79 million people in the united states have been infected with hpv , and 14 million new infections occur every year as a consequence , 18 , 000 women and 8 , 000 men suffer preventable cancers of the cervix , anus , penis and throat it s the most common , and except for , the most fatal  another common misperception is that the hpv vaccine is ineffective and immunity is shortlived but the truth is that the hpv vaccine is virtually 100 percent effective at preventing the precancerous lesions caused by the types of hpv contained in the vaccine , which would most likely prevent most cervical cancers regarding how long immunity will last , the hpv vaccine is made in the same manner as the vaccine , for which immunity lasts at least 30 years immunity provided by the hpv vaccine is likely to be no different further , some highprofile and highly irresponsible claims have been made that the vaccine is unsafe the hpv vaccine has now been studied in more than a million women to determine whether it causes any serious side effects it does n't there is no scientific support for the suggestion by the onetime presidential hopeful michele bachmann that the hpv vaccine could cause , or for katie couric s giving voice to the notion that it may have caused illnesses and death finally , some fear that the hpv vaccine may increase sexual promiscuity a study of 1 , 243 young women and girls between the ages of 15 and 24 alleviated this concern those who received the hpv vaccine were not more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior nor did it make sense that they would the hpv vaccine does n't prevent other sexually transmitted diseases , like , , and indeed , the hpv vaccine does n't even prevent all types of hpv , just the majority of those most likely to cause cancer this argument would be analogous to the claim that people who received a could run across a bed of rusty nails with impunity when the cdc s dr schuchat stood in front of the media in july and analyzed the woeful rates of hpv vaccination , she did n't mention any of these misperceptions rather , she offered something else adolescents were n't getting the hpv vaccine because doctors were n't recommending it strongly enough in fact , one of the top reasons parents gave for not vaccinating was the lack of a recommendation from their health care providers a likely reason doctors are uncomfortable talking about sex with 11yearolds so , what to do \? how do we separate the sex talk from the first dose of hpv vaccine \? amy b middleman , chief of adolescent medicine at the university of oklahoma college of medicine offers one solution in the coming nova television special vaccines calling the shots do n't talk about sex the sex part , says dr middleman , the way in which you get the target disease , is irrelevant we do n't talk about diphtheria , and how you can get diphtheria , before we give the tdap vaccine in other words , it s not about sex it s about cancer the fact remains that millions of adolescents are n't getting a vaccine to prevent a known cause of cancer it takes about 20 years for an hpv infection to progress to cancer that s when the bill is due given current rates of immunization , somewhere around 2 , 000 adults every year whose parents had chosen not to give them the hpv vaccine will probably die from a preventable cancer it s unconscionable and doctors will have only themselves to blame
it appears that cliven bundy , the 68yearold rancher and freeloader , does n't reject only the federal government he rejects history bundy decided this week to tell us all what he knows about the negro mr bundy was as saying they abort their young children , they put their young men in jail , because they never learned how to pick cotton and i 've often wondered , are they better off as slaves , picking cotton and having a family life and doing things , or are they better off under government subsidy \? they did n't get no more freedom they got less freedom in an attempt to clarify his comments , bundy was and he made matters worse i'm wondering are they happier now under this government subsidy system than they were when they were slaves , when they was able to have their family structure together , and the chickens and a garden , and the people had something to do \? the mount kilimanjarosize amounts of ignorance and offense packed into those two statements boggles the mind soon after bundy s views on slavery and the negro came to light , the conservative supporters he had accrued began to scurry and others pounced but i refuse to let bundy s fantasies about slavery and projections about negroes be given over to predictable political squabbling the legacy of slavery must be liberated from political commentary casual , careless and incorrect references to slavery , much like blithe references to nazi germany , do violence to the memory of those who endured it , or were lost to it , and to their descendants there is no modernday comparison in this country to the horrors of slavery none ! leave it alone remember , honor and respect that s all how could slaves have been happier , when were put in shackles , loaded like logs into the bowels of ships and sailed toward shores unknown , away from their world and into their hell \? how could they have been happier to be greased up and sold off , mother from child , with no one registering their anguish \? sojourner truth , in her , delivered in 1851 at the women s convention in akron , ohio , lamented i have borne 13 children , and seen most all sold off to slavery , and when i cried out with my mother s grief , none but jesus heard me ! the gilder lehrman institute of american history that nearly twothirds of slaves lived in nuclear households however , those families could be broken up on a whim , and many slaves were bred like animals , were raped at will and could marry only if allowed how could they have been happier to meet the lash , to feel the flaying of flesh , to have it heal in dreadful scars only to be ripped open again until one had , as sethe , the main character in toni morrison s beloved , put it , a tree on one s back \? it was not only the lash but also the noose and being chased down and ripped apart by dogs , and all manner of terrors when the human imagination sets itself on cruelty there are no limits to its designs americans have been trying to justify slavery since its inception , to make the most wrong of wrongs right , to no avail robert e lee wrote in 1856 the blacks are immeasurably better off here than in africa , morally , physically and socially the painful discipline they are undergoing is necessary for their further instruction as a race , and will prepare them , i hope , for better things others used religion as a justification , quoting verses and patting themselves on the back for saving the souls of the socalled savage but as frederick douglass pointed out , the slave auctioneer s bell and the churchgoing bell chime in with each other , and the bitter cries of the heartbroken slave are drowned in the religious shouts of his pious master religion did n't elevate enslavers trying to justify slavery reduced religion happier \? how , mr bundy , could you even utter such absurdity \? the very soil of this country cries out for us to never forget what happened here , for the irreducible record of the horrors of slavery to never be reduced romantic revisionism of this most ghastly enterprise cannot stand it must be met , vigilantly and unequivocally , with the strongest rebuttal slaves dishonored in life must not have their memories disfigured by revisionist history america committed this great sin , its original sin , and there will be no absolution by alteration america must live with the memory of what its forefathers even its founding fathers did it must sit with this history , the unvarnished truth of it , until it has reconciled with it
minneapolis three years ago , jeff green joined one of the most exclusive clubs in the nba he did not ask to be a part of it he did not even know it existed until a doctor told him that he had an aortic aneurysm and his career with the boston celtics was in jeopardy openheart surgery was looming , and green had never felt more alone , more uncertain that was when the calls , the text messages , the overtures started coming first from fred hoiberg and etan thomas , then from ronny turiaf they offered advice they offered encouragement they had all been there before and just like that , green was not alone but as he quickly found out , it was so much more than a club hoiberg calls them the zipper brothers a small and tightknit group of players who have overcome serious heart ailments and continued playing at the highest level of a game that tests an athlete s heart as much as any does hoiberg cut his nba career short after having openheart surgery and getting a zipperlike scar on his chest to address an enlarged aortic root in 2005 thomas and chris wilcox were able to play after their operations turiaf , green and phoenix suns forward channing frye each missed a season while recovering but are playing again chuck hayes never needed surgery , but after a heart abnormality was found during a routine screening in 2011 , he underwent extensive testing before being cleared to continue playing with toronto it s definitely a brotherhood , turiaf said it s something that s hard to put into words we do n't have to talk all the time but when those instances happen , we talked , each and every one of us , some way , somehow , was linked with the other and whenever we see each other , it s like , we made it unlike torn knee ligaments , blown achilles' tendons or dislocated shoulders , heart defects carry a much more frightening outlook boston s reggie lewis , the loyola marymount star hank gathers and atlanta hawks center jason collier are among the players who have died of heart problems during their playing careers so when the diagnosis comes , so do the zipper brothers hoiberg , who now coaches iowa state , was there for turiaf turiaf was there for green green was there for frye and frye will be there for the next one the surgery that we had is rare , and there s only a few guys that have had it , green said we formed a bond that if we can help in any kind of way to help another fellow player or person that s having the surgery get through it , we 're going to do it , because it s rare that you really hear about an athlete having to go through something like this and as important as the encouragement is for every player faced with the grim realities of his situation , what stuck with green even more was the blunt perspective turiaf and thomas offered about the road ahead it was n't all , you 're going to be great , you 're going to be great , you 're going to be great , ' green said they told me , you 're going to have pain you 're going to go through this but the one thing you need to do is be positive to try to take your mind off it' none of the active players knew one another well before their heart issues were revealed now they seek one another out and swap texts this whole league is a fraternity , but when you know somebody has gone through the same situation you have , you reach out to them , you ask them about their condition , hayes said you ask them how they 're doing my situation was n't as extreme , god bless , as ronny s and channing s and jeff green s so i did n't get the full effect of what they went through but when my situation first came up , they were the first ones that came through and sent their condolences frye barely picked up a basketball all last summer while recovering from his operation , but he is playing as well as he ever has he was averaging 117 points and 52 rebounds and shooting nearly 39 percent from 3point range for the surprisingly competitive suns heading into the weekend anytime you find a bunch of guys going through your same situation , it helps make you feel not as special , frye said i can do this i can overcome this for me , it really just gave me that glimmer of hope that it can get taken care of go figure it did two years removed from his operation , green has been one of the few bright spots in a tough season for the celtics , averaging a careerhigh 17 points , and hayes has given the raptors some veteran defensive toughness off the bench turiaf has been in and out of the lineup with various nagging injuries for minnesota , but given the one he has already overcome , the smile rarely leaves his face i take pride in having that as a legacy to help others going through a situation that i know is probably the worst situation that i had to go through as a professional athlete and as a man , said turiaf , who wears no 32 with the timberwolves in honor of hoiberg so it s definitely something that i wished never happened because it s kind of difficult to deal with but it happened to good people that just want to give back to others the earth is becoming a better place by trying to help the other
berkeley , calif senator rand paul , republican of kentucky , said wednesday that president obama should be particularly wary of domestic spying , given the government s history of eavesdropping on civil rights leaders like the rev dr martin luther king jr , injecting the issue of race into the contentious debate over surveillance i find it ironic that the first africanamerican president has without compunction allowed this vast exercise of raw power by the nsa , mr paul said in an address at the university of california , berkeley certainly j edgar hoover s illegal spying on martin luther king and others in the civil rights movement should give us all pause , he said now if president obama were here , he would say he s not j edgar hoover , which is certainly true but power must be restrained because no one knows who will next hold that power mr paul s remarks were part of his effort to bring his libertarian brand of conservatism to audiences in less friendly territory here at a campus that has been a wellspring of american liberalism , he tried to speak in an informal way , bluntly telling students he was a defender of the rights they hold dear i believe what you do on a cellphone is none of their damn business , mr paul said in one of the lines that drew the most applause his stopover here may have seemed like a wrong turn on mr paul s crosscountry speaking tour , hardly the most orthodox place to rally support for a politician this month at the conservative political action conference , the annual gathering of diehard conservative activists but mr paul knew his audience better than it may have appeared the title of his speech , the nsa vs your privacy , was carefully tailored as the latest piece of a grander strategy by the senator to broaden his appeal to people particularly younger ones who have largely written the republican party off he seemed at ease , reclining in a chair on stage as he answered questions from a student moderator wearing baggy bluejeans , an oxford shirt with a red tie and cowboy boots , he was more dressed down than some of the who were there to welcome him he joked about pink floyd and even compared the republican party to bad pizza that staple of college sustenance remember domino s finally admitted they had bad crust \? he asked , drawing chuckles as he tried to draft an analogy to how republicans should adapt we need a different kind of party , he said , noting that republicans have to either evolve , adapt or die saying the nation s intelligence apparatus was drunk with power , he said that warrantless domestic surveillance should be a matter of concern to everyone i'm not here to tell you what to be , mr paul told the crowd of several hundred , most of them students taking a break between classes but i am here to tell you , though , that your rights , especially your right to privacy , is under assault it was an attentive crowd there were no disruptions or protesters with hectoring signs at least one person was wearing a ron paul tshirt the speech was the latest test of mr paul s experiment to see whether a conservative republican with a less rigid adherence to the party line can appeal more broadly more than most of those republicans considering a run for the party s 2016 presidential nomination , mr paul has spent a considerable amount of time courting africanamericans and hispanics with a message of inclusion and an insistence that his party must drastically change or risk alienating minorities for a generation or more he has also tested out his freemarket economic policies on audiences in traditionally democratic but economically depressed communities like detroit and some republicans say he is targeting one of the party s potential growth wings , that of younger , libertarianleaning voters his appearance was another example of his willingness to embrace risk few college campuses are as associated with the american left as berkeley is , and it has often been a caldron of liberal discontent , better known for featuring the antivietnam speeches of dick gregory and dr benjamin spock than for hosting a man elected to the united states senate on the energy of the tea party it s a bold choice , brendan pinder , a junior who is president of the berkeley college republicans , said of mr paul s decision coming to berkeley does make a statement robert b reich , the former labor secretary in the clinton administration who is now a professor of public policy at berkeley , was walking around the auditorium before the speech and remarked that mr paul had chosen a safe topic he s not in the lion s den he s in a playroom of pussycats , mr reich said i 'd like to see someone ask him about his position on gay rights and abortion but that did not happen the moderator only selected questions that had been submitted on notecards before the speech as was clear from a number of democrats like mr reich who were there , mr paul has become something of a political spectacle , drawing people who want to see what all the fuss is about i'm a big hillary person , said gavin newsom , the state s lieutenant governor , gamely laughing off the idea that he was a paulite hillary rodham clinton is his candidate , he assured a group of students and reporters who had surrounded him i'm interested in why this message has resonated , particularly with young people it was at berkeley that ronald reagan vowed to crack down on the university s vocal and often unruly antiwar activists in the late 1960s clean up the mess at berkeley became a campaign pledge during his run for governor of california in one infamous episode , reagan sent in national guard troops to break up a large protest , leading to an outbreak of violence that left one person dead mr paul seemed amused by the incongruity of his appearance here and grinned as he discussed his reasons for accepting the school s invitation he said he liked the idea of the challenge i see it as a way to attract new people to the party , he said in an interview before his speech , sponsored by the the point of his visit , he said , was hopefully showing that the message of a republican with a libertarian twist may well be acceptable to people , even in berkeley this was not the first time mr paul had set foot inside potentially hostile territory he visited howard university , the historically black institution in washington , in an attempt to try to show that the republican party was not as out of sync with young africanamericans as many of them might think but his tone at howard where he reminded students that the naacp had been founded by republicans and spent a good amount of his remarks on the history of civil rights struck many in the crowd as somewhat patronizing some booed the berkeley audience was enthusiastic , especially when he responded maybe to whether his outreach was part of a 2016 strategy but he stayed away from discussing social issues next up on his speaking calendar could be before another unexpected crowd the naacp the group has invited him to discuss his proposal for economic freedom zones in poor areas
in his professional career , diego forl n has scored a lot of goals in a lot of different places argentina , england , spain , italy , brazil and japan on wednesday , forl n , an ageless striker from uruguay , added china to the list when he scored the game winner against shandong luneng it sends his japanese club , cerezo osaka , to the osaka won , 21 , and finished second in its group , behind pohang steelers of south korea for forl n , 34 , the trip to the knockout stages of the regional tournament will be a way station as he prepares to join uruguay for the world cup in brazil \( he turns 35 may 19 \) four years ago in south africa , forl n was voted the tournament s top player and shared the lead in goals scored \( five \) in january , he left the brazilian club internacional and joined osaka , where he earns a reported 59 million a year the concern of uruguay coach scar tab rez was that the move to asia against questionable competition would not be the right preparation for forl n but the player would have none of it the thing is , you need to play football , forl n told agence francepresse after last weekend s jleague win over kashiwa reysol you need to have competition it does n't matter where you play you have to switch it does n't matter how you have to adjust it s been really nice here and we play nice football we will have to see when we start playing at the moment it s a good team with experience and good players , so we need to see how it will be at the beginning of the tournament , which is about 250 miles south of the chinese capital , beijing , another south american expatriate , vagner love of brazil , gave shandong luneng a 10 lead but within three minutes early in the second half , osaka scored the equalizer and then forl n planted the winner osaka will face the asian champions league s defending champion , guangzhou evergrande , which is coached by the italian marcello lippi , in the round of 16 \( may 5 in japan may 12 in china \) forl n is uruguay s most capped player , with 107 international appearances , and sees his role in japan as a mentor and a teammate maybe the language is difficult sometimes to talk to them but they are really nice guys , he said i can talk to them with my experience about different things if they want to listen they do n't have to listen if they do n't want to be part of it but i'm there if someone wants to talk sometimes in training i see things , so i try to do my best to tell them things that i have experienced
apart from shows like the gorgeous solo by the vietnamese artist dinh q le that closed last week at ppow , little contemporary art from southeast asia finds its way to chelsea and we 'd see almost none at all there were it not for tyler rollins , who consistently highlights the region , as he does in the current jakkai siributr exhibition mr jakkai , who was born in bangkok in 1969 , studied art in the united states and now lives in his home country , thailand he is best known for his work in textiles , and the centerpiece of this show is a display of 10 elaborately embroidered versions of uniform jackets worn by thai civil servants , the police and upperlevel military personnel along the gallery walls are selfportrait photographs of the artist dressed in the jackets prototypes for the photographs are images found in memorial books traditionally published on the occasion of highstatus funerals , with the deceased shown wearing emblems of his political and social rank because mr jakkai s family has connections to thai royalty , several of the photographs are based on funerary portraits of his ancestors what distinguishes the uniforms in the show from the real things is their decoration in place of official sashes , badges and medals , they are bedecked with buddhist charms , bowtied ribbons , invented insignia and folk amulets , such as a necklace of wood goodluck phalluses , all of which turn the jackets into highly eccentric , not to say cartoonish , riffs on power couture mr jakkai s work has a distinctly buddhist subtext the exhibition title suggests that earthly trappings of prestige are merely envelopes for emptiness and the show itself , organized by iola lenzi , a curator based in singapore , includes a video of a single uniform adrift on moving water , as if on the sea of karma , with the sound of cremation fires crackling in the background but it does n't take familiarity with buddhism or thai culture to grasp the basic idea here that in the end , all hierarchical human power is ultimately reduced to the shared rank of dust to dust
when the assured the public this month that most american hospitals could treat cases of ebola , it was technically correct hospitals routinely treat highly contagious diseases , and toptier ones are extensively equipped to isolate patients who pose special risks but the infection over the past week of betrayed what even many of the best hospitals lack the ability to handle the tide of infectious waste that ebola generates ebola s catastrophic course includes diarrhea , vomiting and hemorrhaging of blood , a combination difficult enough to contain in lesscommunicable illnesses when they are highly contagious , disposing of the waste and cleaning up what is left behind require expertise and equipment that some specialists said are lacking even in highly regarded medical facilities those shortcomings are compounded , they said , by surprising gaps in scientists' knowledge about the ebola virus itself , down to the time it can survive in different environments outside the body the time for educating on these things is not when we 're in the midst of a crisis , paul d roepe , the codirector of georgetown university s center for infectious disease , said in a telephone interview the time was years ago even with the billions we 've spent preparing our health systems for this sort of scenario , we 're still so open to error a handful of medical centers nationwide , including ones at emory university and the university of nebraska that treated the first ebola cases in this country , are specially equipped and their staff members trained to address the challenges but they are the exceptions most hospitals do not have incinerators or the steam sterilizers called autoclaves with the capacity to handle large amounts of infectious waste texas health presbyterian hospital , the 866bed facility in dallas where two nurses became ill after treating an ebola patient , has had to pack and ship 55gallon drums of waste from body fluids to linens to contaminated protective suits to an entire hospital bed to a port arthur , tex , incinerator for disposal the federal department of transportation , which regulates hazardous waste shipments , was forced to issue special permits to move waste from the hospital and an ebola victim s apartment because the agency s packaging requirements were not designed for such large volumes of highly infectious material perhaps more important , some specialists said , is the lack of training and practice that hospital workers need to treat ebola victims and safely handle the waste they produce debra sharpe , a birmingham , ala , biosafety expert , has overseen safety at a nonprofit laboratory that researches emerging diseases and bioweapons , and has run a company that trained workers to handle biological agents the infectious waste problems in those jobs parallel those in hospital settings , she said in an interview it s totally shocking , ms sharpe said it would take me anywhere from four to six weeks to train an employee to work in a high containment lab in a safe manner it s ludicrous to expect doctors and nurses to figure that out with a day s worth of training none of the science is new none of the protection components are new it s just new in a health care setting hospitals and the cdc should have been reaching out to the biosafety community before now , to try to adjust to this the cdc does have general and with some occasionally unexpected recommendations for instance , that infectious body wastes can be safely flushed into public sewer lines \( ms sharpe concurred with this , but added that many treatment facilities , as a precaution , pour bleach into a toilet and wait several minutes before flushing \) beyond the advisories , gray areas complicate waste problems because ebola is such a messy illness , patients' rooms must be scrupulously cleaned lest a stray drop of blood or vomit spread virus to an unknowing patient or worker but the cleaning itself is so hazardous that it , too , requires special training and a knowledge of which hospital sterilizers and cleaners are likely to kill the virus in dallas , hospital officials summoned a private hazardous waste cleanup firm to sterilize the room where thomas eric duncan , the nation s first ebola victim , some 140 55gallon drums of potentially contaminated material were also hauled from the dallas apartment where he had stayed scientists say ebola is in a class of viruses that are generally more susceptible than many to chemical disinfectants but out of caution , the cdc recommends that rooms be cleaned with agents powerful enough to kill hardy viruses like the flu and polio that is not the only unresolved question the recommendations from cdc on what to do and not to do are based on relatively sparse science , dr roepe said i can only find two that address the simple question of how long the virus persists outside the human body the number you 'll hear from most people is from a few days up to a week , he said but the context in which the virus is found outside the body matters a great deal how long can it last on a doorknob \? we do n't have a lot of raw data , believe it or not
i first met ben bradlee in the winter of 1969 i was a 19yearold kid from canton , ohio , who had never taken a course in journalism , never published an article , rarely read the newspaper and had little notion of what i would do with my life yet somehow as a brandeis sophomore i had made my way to be a finalist for the washington post internship it must have been my essay and there i was sitting at ben bradlee s right hand in a boston restaurant surrounded by other finalists , all of whom went to harvard , were working on the crimson , and had dazzling credentials by the time lunch was over , i was sure i was no longer in the running but as i got up to leave , ben placed his hand on my arm and asked me if i had a few minutes to talk a halfhour passed he asked me what i thought of the vietnam war i remember telling him i was torn he seemed pleased by my confusion we talked about writing i honestly do n't remember what else we talked about except that when we parted i knew what i wanted to do i wanted to work for him \( mind you , that was two years before watergate \) a couple of months later , i received a letter from ben dated march 6 , 1970 it began dear ted you got nosed out in the finals of the toughest competition we have ever had you are really a year premature and your lack of previous experience in journalism was a tough hurdle for us to overcome i was particularly sorry about you , because i was attracted by your love of writing , and your attitude generally i hunch that you have a hell of a future in this business , and i hereby urge you to reapply again and again i enjoyed my time with you enormously keep up your interest in this business you will make it sincerely , ben bradlee that was all the encouragement i needed four years later my father died and i went to ben and asked him if he had any advice for me he first told me that i made him uncomfortable i was wearing a threepiece suit take off your vest , he said in that gravelly voice you make me nervous he asked me where i might want to work somewhere near my family , i said he got on the phone and called the editor of the akron beacon journal and said he had someone sitting across from him who he thought might make a good reporter and so i got my foot in the door of journalism for several years thereafter i would send him my better stories and he would send back comments just a line or two of encouragement , always signed ben bradlee ted , keep going you 're doing fine , best , ben bradlee , read one of his notes on feb 10 , 1976 , he wrote i 'll reactive your name and if this bloody strike ever ends , maybe things will change all the best , ben bradlee \( the contentious strike pitted pressmen against management and was then already in its fifth month and far from resolved \) that summer he made a call on my behalf to the virginianpilot and helped me get an internship there by now i had come to look upon him as a kind of gruff guardian angel finally in the summer of 1977 , between my second and third years of law school , i was given my shot at the post as an intern more than seven years after my initial try i guess ben figured anyone this relentless might make a persistent reporter a year later i joined the post as a staffer i had my moments and my stories , but was never one of the post s true heavyweights but ben never stopped watching over me or the rest of us i remember one afternoon i was called into his office along with another reporter and two senior editors a republican senator had gone to ben s house in the middle of the night , ben said , alleging that the candidate ronald reagan had a number of gay staffers the question was raised whether we should pursue it as a story a senior editor weighed in , referring to queers ben interrupted him we do not use that term , he scolded in 1980 there were not so many in the newsroom who would have objected we pursued the story , confirmed the obvious that there were gays on the candidate s staff \( as there are doubtless on most staffs \) but with ben s support , chose not to run it , concluding that it was a nonstory i also remember another senior editor disparaging a story i had worked on for months ben knew i was upset about the editor s comments and even considering resigning ben never mentioned the editor or his comments he just came over to me at the end of the day , put his arm around my shoulder and asked me if i needed a lift home i \( foolishly \) declined , but the gesture was enough to restore my confidence that i was at the right place in 1980 a series i coauthored was a finalist for the pulitzer prize i remember going into ben s office and giving him a copy of the rejection letter he had sent me a decade earlier with a note appended , saying thanks for giving me a shot i think we all felt that way about ben it was personal sure , we were ambitious sure , we owed it to the paper and the country and all those other grand principles but honestly , i think a lot of us felt like we owed it to ben his faith in us was a debt we did not take lightly i remember writing a story about president jimmy carter that a times reporter took issue with and called ben for comment i was on the line as well the reporter told ben the times would blow a hole through the post s story ben s response sounds like a great story , ca n't wait to read it \( a part of me feels guilty even writing this for the times do forgive me , ben \) i remember only too well the janet cooke episode in which the post was forced to return a pulitzer prize after it was learned the story had been a fabrication it anguished us all , but none more than ben i also remember that a series i coauthored that same year drew tremendous fire and that though the post s defensive shield was weakened , ben did not flinch i left the post in 1987 , but continued to write for it nearly every year thereafter in 2011 , i sent ben a copy of a book i had written and wrote an inscription to him that said how much i admired him , that he had changed the course of my life , and that there was no man , save my own father , whom i respected more a few months later i was visiting the post and found myself alone with ben in the elevator he told me he had received my book and had read the inscription you know , he said , after i read it , i walked around all day with my chest puffed out you think ben bradlee needed ted gup \? and yet , there it was he knew the power of a few right words , a gesture , a smile i remember after a story i did i felt his hand patting my back did n't say a word i also remember thinking i would n't have traded that for any kind of raise i saw him only twice after that , once in 2012 on the 40th anniversary of the watergate breakin , and once at a 2013 tribute for a departing donald graham but by then , the ben i knew that we knew was largely gone , a victim of dementia last night , reading of his death , i called a friend from the post and we comforted each other , and shared our memories of ben , profane and inspired , steelyedged and sweetcentered for us , working for ben had been the privilege of a lifetime i for one often imagined ben as a kind of journalistic king arthur and we , his knights of the round table he was not only my gruff guardian angel , but the nation s as well he will be missed
chicago people showed up and plopped down lawn chairs , sitting there just so they could feel like a part of the event , even if they could not see anything the neighborhood s residents were glad for their team , for their boys and for themselves they brought cakes they rode bikes they hugged this was a homey neighborhood celebration on the city s south side , a departure for an area known for gun violence chicago finally had its chance on wednesday to welcome home the jackie robinson west little league team that won the united states championship on saturday the rolling celebration started with a rally at the team s home park and worked its way into the city center residents lined up for 70 blocks along halsted street , waiting for their heroes it was the kind of celebration you would expect in smalltown america as politicians lined up to talk with a few thousand fans at a rally on the team s field , the parade route already had a classroom of day care students standing in yellow shirts on 95th and halsted a halfdozen women in wheelchairs waited at 81st street in front of the naomi and sylvester smith senior living center hundreds of students packed in at 79th street near st sabina academy on 76th , there were more children in front of a learning center terrence j lavin , an illinois appeals court justice , grew up in the area playing little league now , he said , he deals daily with guns , gangs and drugs on wednesday , he was not delivering speeches , but instead was at 87th street in what he considers his neighborhood there are n't many parades down halsted street , he said none in my memory remember when president obama said that trayvon martin could be his son \? there are thousands of chicagoans , white and black , thinking that about these amazing kids they are medicine for a municipality dulled into a sort of crime stupor because of all the shootings , he said we are better than that and these kids are a living , breathing symbol of that chicago is a city with an outofcharacter crisis in confidence , especially on its south side it is fighting the label of america s murder capital as monday news reports routinely tally up weekend shootings the young faces on the news are not displaying smiles or celebrations that is what made this team so important so tens of thousands of people , counting those at the finale rally at millennium park in downtown chicago , were celebrating not only the team , but also community every time you turn on the television , you always hear about someone s baby getting killed , said aaron wright , who was at the early rally at jackie robinson park every time people think about chicago now , they think about guns this gives us inspiration , he said this is better than the bud billiken day parade bud billiken is a fictional character celebrated with an annual parade on the south side , partly as motivation for children to do well at school at the bud billiken parade this month , two people were shot so the community came out to jackie robinson park , surrounded by traditional chicago bungalows people put down lawn chairs , filled the stands , hovered around the homerun walls at the rally downtown , the celebration seemed more about chicago than the south side the only thing that seemed out of place at the early rally were the politicians , who , one after another , took the microphone while the neighborhood waited to cheer for their young ballplayers among them were aldermen and cook county officials , along with the rev jesse jackson and lisa madigan , the state attorney general gov pat quinn wore a bright yellow jackie robinson west tshirt what a glorious day the lord has made , mr quinn told the crowd i think all of us know our favorite letters in the alphabet jrw jrw jrw jrw mayor rahm emanuel was there the south side has become a vulnerable spot for him politically , not only because of the violence but also because of his efforts to close schools for budget reasons yes , the politicians are milking this , said mr wright , the rally attendee we could talk about that all day do n't get me started pat batom , who sat in a lawn chair at the team s park , said politicians showed up at big events and at church , but you never hear from them unless there s an election she was not going to let that ruin the day , though she had to come out to support the team and joshua houston , a player , said , this is unbelievable during the little league world series , he said , he had no idea the team was connecting so well with chicago his father , jerry houston , one of the coaches , said the team had connected because little league baseball took in parents , coaches and volunteers it is a much closer relationship with the city , he said , than when the bulls won their nba titles in the 1990s the city just sat there and watched on tv , he said baseball has allowed a lot of families to really come together , mr houston said they came together because of these kids
london the ming dynasty ruled china from 1368 to 1644 , and it was under its aegis , during the first half of the 15th century , that technological and design advances brought milky white and cobaltblue porcelain to perfection the most internationally soughtafter of all ceramics , ming products became synonymous with the country that produced them , referred to in india and the middle east as chini and in english as china but this artistic high point was just one of the many achievements of the ming dynasty between 1400 and 1450 , as shown by ming 50 years that changed china , in the recently opened sainsbury exhibitions gallery at the british museum the show runs from sept 18 until jan 5 , 2015 five years in the planning , this dazzling show is curated by professor craig clunas of oxford university and jessica harrisonhall of the british museum with its population of around 85 million , 15thcentury ming china was by far the largest state on the globe as professor clunas points out in the exhibition s exemplary catalog , everything about it was on a grand scale it had a greater land area , bigger cities \( and more big cities \) , bigger armies , bigger ships , bigger palaces , bigger bells , more literate people , more religious professionals ming was not a family name but an appellation , meaning bright , luminous or shining it was adopted by the founder of the dynasty , zhu yuanzhang , who had overthrown the mongol yuan dynasty , the previous rulers of china for almost a century the exhibition opens with two magnificent silk hanging scrolls the earliest known painting of nanjing , where zhu yuanzhang made his capital from 1368 to 1398 , and a later 15thcentury image of the forbidden city in beijing the third ming ruler , the yongle emperor \( 14031424 \) , made the momentous decision to move the capital to beijing a longterm consequence of this relocation was the adoption of the local dialect , mandarin , as the language of imperial administration and communication during this period , in the far south of the country , the ming also fixed china s southern borders , which have remained unchanged till this day the ambition and scope of the yongle emperor s construction projects and military campaigns from the far north to the far south of his domains led historians to see his reign as a second founding of the ming dynasty the first ming emperor , who took the personal title hongwu \( vast military power \) , was prolifically procreative , fathering 36 sons and 16 daughters although none of his successors produced so many , the opening section of the exhibition , ming courts , radically reassesses the importance of these male heirs as agents of the emperor s rule the dispatch of these princes to the provinces played a hitherto underestimated part in projecting the dynasty s image through the length and breadth of china a fuller appreciation of the grandeur of these princely courts in xi'an the court took up half the area of the city has been made possible above all by the excavation of princely tombs in recent years a selection of finds from tombs in sichuan , shandong and hubei vividly bring alive the lavish lifestyles of these provincial courts , the traces of which have mostly disappeared above ground the finds include clothes , ornaments , gold jewelry , ceramic figures , and furniture there is even a set of miniature furniture from the prince of lu s tomb in shandong , including a bed with pillows and mattress , wash stands with towels , and storage boxes innovations in the visual arts also opened windows into the life of the imperial court at the instigation of the xuande emperor , a new genre emerged of paintings showing the son of heaven at leisure a wonderful scroll here , amusements in the xuande emperor s palace , on loan from the palace museum in beijing , shows him watching an archery competition , a polo match , soccer playing a form of miniature golf participating in an arrowthrowing game and taking refreshments and retiring with his entourage in the evening xuande , known as the aesthete , was also an accomplished artist , as is shown by two of his own paintings on display blue and white porcelain was not a ming invention , but during the yongle emperor s reign it reached dizzy new heights of refinement new clay recipes made it possible for vessels to become thinner , and new glazes produced a much purer translucent white and a glossier finish a far greater range of shapes was introduced , including a number inspired by bottles , flasks , jugs , candleholders and pen boxes from the islamic world the exhibition includes a fascinating series of juxtapositions of porcelain items with brass vessels of middle eastern origin the imperial court fostered the development of more exotic color schemes , combining red and green , yellow and red , and green and white the size of some orders given to the imperial kilns was staggering one for 443 , 500 porcelain pieces with dragon and phoenix designs was placed in 1433 , during the xuande emperor s reign the role of middle eastinspired designs and of cobalt from iran , which gave a stronger blue than the local product , in the perfection of blueandwhite porcelain are both telling markers of another central initiative of the ming emperors of the first half of the 15th century the opening up of china to the wider world this occurred well over half a century before portuguese and spanish ships appeared on the horizon , which according to traditional eurocentric historical narratives was the primary force in exposing china to foreign influences between 1405 and 1433 , the eunuch admiral zheng he made seven voyages into the socalled western ocean , an area extending from the south china sea to the east coast of africa and the red sea the impact of these expeditions , which lasted two years at a time , on trading and cultural relations between south asia and the middle east is the subject of the last section of the show , diplomacy and trade zheng he s expeditions were born of the dynasty s desire to establish , internationally , the legitimacy of its rule in china and to exact recognition of its primacy in the entire hemisphere , either through persuasion and gifts or military threats the admiral s armadas consisted of as many as 250 ships , some of them 60 meters long , at the time the largest ever built these huge treasure ships carried porcelain , lacquer , silks and other precious chinese goods , and were escorted by up to 27 , 000 men , most of them armed although the prime purpose of the voyages was political , they played a major part in distributing chinese goods westward and bringing back to china cargos of pepper , spices and artifacts not to mention gems , gold and silver bullion and , as exported luxury chinese goods began to trickle into fardistant europe , not the least of the consequences was to stimulate adventurous european navigators to set out across the oceans in search of the sources of these wonders in the mythical regions of cathay
the members of the martha graham dance company are impressive individually and collectively , but they have two main and dissimilar ways of moving in modern pieces by living choreographers , they look released , motivated , free in graham s own choreography , they look tense , stiffbacked , selfconscious , showy last week brought two world premieres on wednesday and depak ine by nacho duato , which i saw on saturday the dancers are marvelous in both their speed and pliancy in echo is terrific , while in depak ine , they whip up an ovation with their intensity but echo was n't much of a piece , and depak ine is vile depak ine enacts some timeless and ritualistic narrative in which a woman lies facedown while men and women combine in various groups and solos one man may be a shaman before settling into intensely sexual grapplings when they depart , the supine woman starts to wriggle and thrash like a hatching reptile she no sooner rises into some kind of adult life than three men come along and maul her , again in sexual terms left alone again , she expresses various kinds of trauma before collapsing into the same facedown posture as before then the first group of men and women returns , ending the piece as it began it is performed to clich laden taped music by the serbian composer \( a collage of chanting voices and rhythmless electronic sounds \) and the spanish electronic musician \( rapid 4 4 rock percussive effects \) the implication is that this pattern of unhappy sex is a cycle , perhaps annual , perhaps generational you can argue about whether it depicts misogyny or is actively misogynistic it scarcely matters the movement is , like its music , an array of sensationalistic effects the dancers perform it with complete urgency , precision and motivation the range of physical detail shown by peiju chienpott , as the victimized protagonist , is especially exciting in the , this was sandwiched between graham s classic appalachian spring and her rite of spring this rite draws applause , but it s merely a recycling of old graham steps and devices the story , a pareddown reduction of diaghilev s 1913 original , gives us a shaman , a female chosen one and a tribe in which men dominate there s none of the poetic ambiguity or psychological penetration of graham s finest work , all of which predates 1960 the dances have a bangbang force , ironing over any difficulties in stravinsky s score , which here becomes as surefire in its effectiveness as the soundtrack of a hit broadway musical it s unusual to find a graham program with two scores that are true masterpieces too bad we 're given taped versions here appalachian spring had its premiere in 1944 , an annus mirabilis for new music in american dance stravinsky s danses concertantes had its stage premiere with the ballet russe de monte carlo his sc nes de ballet opened on broadway in billy rose s the seven lively arts leonard bernstein s fancy free opened at american ballet theater with jerome robbins s choreography and on screen , gene kelly and rita hayworth danced to jerome kern s numbers in cover girl thanks to the patron elizabeth sprague coolidge , graham was able to present a program that october at the library of congress in washington that featured new commissions from paul hindemith \( h rodiade , which the troupe revived last fall \) , darius milhaud \( imagined wing \) and aaron copland copland called his new score dance for martha until she named it appalachian spring , referring to a line in hart crane s poem the bridge it s curious to reflect that two other , very different american composers are likely to have attended early appalachian spring performances thanks to members of graham s original cast , merce cunningham and john cage , who had recently begun a relationship with cunningham , and woody guthrie , who was attached to mazia and would marry her in 1945 in 1947 , guthrie would write  something that s always hard to determine is graham s choreographic musicality in appalachian spring sometimes it shows taut dance rhythms where none are heard in the score , and sometimes it matches musical brio with dance brio , only then to show the dance continuing with different musical accompaniment graham demonstrated that a dance has its own life , often independent from music , and in this she paved the way for cunningham s more radical independence in ways that have seldom been acknowledged saturday s performance was a good illustration of the axiom that taped music produces taped performances but not all around natasha diamondwalker s calm dignity as the pioneering woman and lloyd mayor s radiantly youthful energy as the husbandman were both admirable but all of them tended to do more facial acting than is needed here is a work where the meaning should be in the movement this problem , alas , began in graham s own day , even in the era of live music it was not unusual in the 1970s to see thoroughly phony performances of appalachian spring and other works graham liked to say how her father had taught her that the body never lies , though the strained , selfconscious performances by her own company both in her lifetime and after have often disproved this theory on saturday , i could believe neither maurizio nardi s posey revivalist nor mariya dashkina maddux s sentimental bride , but i remember the same problems with earlier dancers decades ago basic features of stance , gesture , walk and above all the lower torso were n't given full value a further problem is that the company uses graham s own revised version of the choreography , adjusted , from the 1950s on , to accommodate her own decline there are two sets of film clips of the 1944 they show , in particular , how much simpler , more obvious and less ambiguous the role of the bride later became the problems of graham s legacy are insoluble , because it was she herself , long ago , who began to erode it
an early goal by clint dempsey the sixth fastest in world cup history gave the united states national team a shocking lead against ghana in the teams' opening game of group g and a late goal by john brooks , an inexperienced american defender who came on as secondhalf substitute , earned the americans a victory the 21 win was the united states team s first over ghana in three world cup games the result belies the dominance ghana exhibited throughout the game but the 3 points that the americans earned with a victory give them a strong start to the touranment and a possible path to the second round dempsey combined with jermaine jones to break into the box , executed a deft move past two defenders and slotted a shot into the far corner of the goal from close range after only 34 seconds the early goal lifted american fans' anxiety and filled their lungs with enthusiasm the united states had the earliest lead it had ever held in a world cup match but the early success was persistently chipped away by a determined and skilled ghana team that dominated possession and sent dangerous crosses from both flanks to the center of the american goal there , the black stars captain , asamoah gyan , headed numerous attempts toward goal , but few were on frame and none found the back of the net the pressure was intense , and a ghana goal seemed almost inevitable then , in the 82nd minute , kwadwo asamoah , a left back who had been pressing up the field all game , cut a through pass into the left side of the american penalty box for gyan , whose willy backheel pass landed in andre ayew s path ayew blasted past tim howard at the near post to tie the score brooks , a german born defender who had played only four times for the united states , headed a corner kick from graham zusi , another secondhalf american substitute , in the 86th minute the improbable goal scorer gave the united states an improbable victory full story after a thrilling ride four years ago , capped by landon donovan s epic goal against algeria , the us enters this cup with a missing piece donovan , who was passed over by coach jurgen klinsmann that puts pressure on the attacking team of clint dempsey and jozy altidore and the playmaking midfielder michael bradley to step up ghana also had a tremendous cup four years ago , kept out of the semifinals only by luis suarez s hand their attacking players are rather unconventional asamoah gyan never seems to be quite where you expect him to be on the pitch , and kevinprince boateng is a midfielder who seems more comfortable as a striker or is it the other way around \? most are predicting germany and portugal to come through this group if one of these teams are to break up that duo , a win today is vital
were the assailants who slashed to death 29 people and wounded 143 others at a train station in southwestern china last saturday aspiring jihadists or wouldbe refugees seeking to flee the country \? those two opposing narratives one issued by a communist party official and the other suggested by a united states governmentbacked news service have emerged to explain why six men and two women ended up in kunming , the capital of yunnan province , 900 miles from their homes in the far western region of xinjiang , where they set out to kill as many people as possible although the authorities have yet to identify the ethnic identities or hometowns of those arrested , it is widely assumed that they were uighurs , the turkicspeaking , largely muslim people who are increasingly at odds with the nation s ethnic han majority according to radio free asia , which is financed by the united states congress , the attackers may have been driven to desperation after their attempts to leave china were thwarted at the country s border with laos citing an anonymous source , the report said the eight had fled their hometown near the silk road city of hotan last year after a violent clash with the police left scores of uighur residents dead the source said they gave up trying to leave through the border crossing near mohan after 30 other uighurs were arrested by the chinese authorities they cannot go back to hotan , but they cannot do any business in kunming either because they don t have any id cards with them and have arrest warrants issued against them by the regional police department , radio free asia said , quoting the source , whom it described as an uighur living in kunming forlorn , he said , their desperation turned homicidal after learning about mounting bloodshed in xinjiang , where in recent months more than 100 uighurs have been shot and killed by the police in skirmishes that the authorities have called terror attacks , but that exile groups say are little more than extrajudicial killings their message to the government was , we can do something also , the source said the opposing theory was offered by qin guangrong , the communist party secretary of yunnan province , who told china national radio that the eight attackers were hoping to become overseas jihadists and had tried to leave the country through vietnam , which shares a border with yunnan , but failed to get out unable to leave china or return home to xinjiang , he said , they decided to wage jihad in kunming mr qin s account , the report said , was based on a confession by one of the suspects , a young woman who was shot and wounded by the police at the train station three other suspects are also in custody four of the attackers were shot dead at the scene , according to state news media the article citing mr qin s account was deleted from the radio station s website , but has since been picked up by other outlets although the two stories clash on key points , there is some overlap , most notably the notion that the attackers had been trying to flee china before they decided to embrace violence while impossible to determine the truth , neither theory is entirely outlandish uighur fighters have been captured on the battlefields of afghanistan , including 22 who ended up at the american detention center at guant namo bay in 2011 , the chinese authorities said that a group of uighurs who attacked and killed more than a dozen people in kashgar , in southern xinjiang , had received training in pakistan but exile groups and human rights advocates say the government also exaggerates the threat of islamicinspired violence and brands even uighur dissidents as separatists in recent years , scores of uighurs seeking to flee the country have been captured at china s border with southeast asia and sent back home for punishment in 2009 , in a case that drew international attention , 20 uighur asylumseekers were deported back to xinjiang from cambodia a day before xi jinping , then china s vice president and now its president , was due to visit bearing 12 billion in aid beijing said the uighurs were criminals the united nations , which had interviewed them as part of their asylum bid , said they had credible fears of persecution none of the asylumseekers has been heard from again
aracataca , colombia beyond the cellphone stores and the motorcycles buzzing like flies in the 100degree heat , still has some magic in it it is still a place where dilapidated wooden houses hide shady gardens that hint at furtive mysteries , where a 96yearold woman gets her toenails painted pink and keeps songbirds in cages , and where squealing children swim in irrigation canals flowing beside sunblasted streets mr garc a m rquez , the writer , will be remembered at a memorial service in mexico city on monday , attended by the presidents of colombia and mexico and cultural luminaries \( though perhaps none who shines as brightly as mr garc a m rquez , who has been called the most famous writer on the planet \) mr garc a m rquez left this dusty town when he was still a boy , but he later reached back to his time here as the source for his greatest work , defined by a style known as magical realism aracataca became the model for macondo , the town that serves as the stage for his masterwork , one hundred years of solitude most of his time here was spent in the home of his maternal grandparents , where he soaked up the stories told by his grandmother and other relatives he said that it was his grandmother s matteroffact way of telling the most fantastic stories that inspired the narrator s voice in one hundred years of solitude now the site of his grandparents' home , where he was born and which fed the vibrant world of his fiction , has been turned into a tidy museum parts of the original wood home remained until a few years ago , but that was all knocked down and rebuilt , according to the museum director , daniel l pez in its place is a neat , whitewashed structure that in some ways resembles a swiss chalet more than the local wood architectural style it is meant to mimic much of mr garc a m rquez s adult life was spent in mexico , where he died last thursday he was cremated and the colombian ambassador to mexico said that a portion of his ashes would be brought home to colombia , although it was not clear where they would reside cataqueros , as the people from aracataca are called , said they hoped the ashes would be brought here , perhaps to be kept in the museum that is the clamor of all cataqueros , said fabi n marriaga , 60 , a lawyer whose fatherinlaw , luis carmelo correa , was a lifelong friend of mr garc a m rquez he said that the author would call his fatherinlaw while he was writing to check details on their boyhood home we 're in a great crusade now to have them give us some of his ashes to rest here , mr marriaga said aracataca s mayor , tufith hatum , said that the town would hold a ceremonial funeral procession on monday to coincide with the memorial in mexico president juan manuel santos of colombia will preside over a memorial service in bogot on tuesday early in the 20th century , aracataca was a boomtown dominated by american banana companies today it is a dusty , hot place with about 40 , 000 residents , its population swelled in recent years by thousands of refugees from colombia s endemic violence , displaced by guerrilla groups or , particularly in this area , rightwing paramilitary groups there is a lack of good jobs and an illegaldrug problem many streets are unpaved only about a third of the homes receive water that is fit to drink and while trucks carrying green bananas are still a common sight , oil palm plantations have replaced many banana groves the town is the opposite of a tourist trap beyond the museum and a pool hall that calls itself macondo billiards , there is little effort to take advantage of its connection with the famous man there are no mugs with mr garc a m rquez s image , no key chains , no macondothemed tshirt shops rafael jim nez , a local poet who helped start the museum , wants to create a gabo trail , in honor of the writer nicknamed gabo , that would guide tourists to landmarks that figured in his life and work but so far that is just a dream his worry is that the town s important sights and what is left of its original character are fast being obliterated the old wooden houses , made of wide cedar planks , with large rooms , high ceilings and steeply pitched roofs designed to ward off the heat , are fast disappearing , mostly replaced by the low cement block homes that are standard throughout the region he pointed to a corner where a large wood house was knocked down to make way for an airconditioned billiard hall and bar no one is taking care of the cultural landscape , mr jim nez said in time , we 're going to end up looking like any other town yet some of its uniqueness remains mar a d'conti , 96 , lives in a creaky greenpainted wood house that was built the year before she was born according to mr jim nez , ms d'conti s father , antonio d'conti , was an inspiration for one of the characters in one hundred years of solitude , the dandyish italian piano installer , pietro crespi ms d'conti remembered mr garc a m rquez , whom she called gabito , playing with other children in the plaza in front of her family s house he was cute , she said , recalling how he and other children would stand under the chutes of water gushing off buildings during rain storms as she spoke , a woman gave her a pedicure and painted her toenails a glittery pink on a back patio , the songbirds she raises fluttered in their cages her father owned two cinemas , banana plantations and a cattle ranch , she said the family was rich back then and so was aracataca gnarled fingers showed a sepia photograph of her father , a dapper man with a wide tie , high collar , impeccably pressed trousers and neatly combed hair but while she was aware of the family s apparent connection to mr garc a m rquez s fiction , she said she had never read any of his novels i have bad eyesight , she said her daughter , isabella vidal , 60 , a high school art teacher , expressed what is a regular countercurrent to the gaboworship here why had mr garc a m rquez not returned to his hometown to sponsor good works , she asked he made lots of money as a writer , she said , and could have spent some of it paving streets or buildings health clinics what did he give to aracataca \? she said for me , he has done nothing from his beginnings , living along the dirt streets here , mr garc a m rquez went on to have a worldwide impact , though his literary influence was especially strong in latin america h ctor abad , a colombian novelist from a younger generation , said that there was a downside to the long shadow cast by mr garc a m rquez s genius his magical realist style was poorly imitated by many , he said , in touristy novels portraying a clich d version of latin america i think that garc a m rquez was very great but the worst that he left was his influence , mr abad said the important thing was his example as writer and a person , showing us that we could write without fear anything we wanted , with great freedom in one essential way , aracataca still resembles the macondo of one hundred years of solitude , which in the book becomes a metaphor for the human struggle to overcome isolation macondo in its early years was completely cut off , a town lost in the jungle , and its founder , jos arcadio buend a , obsessed with finding a connection to the rest of the world even today , in a world of cellphones , satellite televisions and fast cars , the residents here chafe at the idea of living far from the center of things aracataca was an old , forgotten town , said elena romero , 33 , a housewife , relaxing in the shade on a park bench because gabriel garc a m rquez won the nobel prize , aracataca is known throughout the world jorge polo , 54 , a merchant and palm oil farmer who met mr garc a m rquez on a few of his visits here , said , we gave him his nationality , and he gave us recognition we thank him for the happiness of having been born in aracataca
washington with deepening concerns about domestic violence among professional athletes , members of a united states senate committee on tuesday chastised the four major sports leagues for failing to police their players and falling short in supporting victims the problem , the members of the senate committee on commerce , science and transportation said , has come into sharp focus in the nearly three months since video surfaced of ray rice punching his thenfianc e in a hotel elevator the senators called on the leagues and player associations which were represented at the packed hearing to be tougher addressing domestic violence and to do more for victims when a celebrity athlete is charged with committing domestic violence , it uniquely reverberates through society in unique ways , said senator jay rockefeller , democrat of west virginia , the chairman of the committee the hearing came five days after an arbitrator overturned the national football league s indefinite suspension of rice , calling it arbitrary the ruling marked the latest setback for nfl commissioner roger goodell , who has faced widespread criticism in light of the rice case for not doing enough to curb domestic violence the league has pledged to overhaul its personal conduct policy last month , the new york times that nfl teams often have close relationships with local law enforcement agencies , which can favor the player and isolate victims further , the times reported on how victims can feel trapped , in part , by the close team culture and the emphasis on avoiding distractions both the players and the leagues came under fire members of the committee cautioned that players should not hide behind collective bargaining agreements to avoid suspensions some even suggested that the nfl s taxexempt status should be revoked if it does not improve its handling of domestic violence cases senator claire mccaskill , democrat of missouri , said the domestic abuse issues extend to all of the leagues and that they must do more to hold players accountable perpetrators know if they can only get their victims to recant , refuse to cooperate , threaten their financial future , threaten the futures of their families' financial status , or put them on an airplane to venezuela if they can accomplish those things then nothing will happen , mccaskill said still , the nfl and the rice case were at the center of the hearing , with senator john thune , republican of south dakota , calling the nfl s handling of the rice case completely inadequate and sending a mixed message to fans each of the four major sports leagues the nfl , major league baseball , the national basketball association and the national hockey league were represented by an executive as well as a players' association official troy vincent , a former nfl player who is now a league executive , testified that the league and its players understand the anger and that reforms are underway in light of the rice case , the nfl has announced several measures , including hiring domestic violence experts , introducing more counseling and mandating stricter penalties for players caught committing domestic violence we recognize that we have to break the culture of silence , said vincent , who choked back tears earlier in the hearing as spoke of abuse in his own home as a child none of the league commissioners appeared at the hearing a point that drew the ire of rockefeller , who will soon retire at the end of his fifth term when witnesses refuse to show up and testify , my experience tells me that they are afraid of something , rockefeller said in his opening statement given the scope and severity of this problem , i find their absence troubling
atlanta president jimmy carter had already greeted an emory university student dressed as a skeleton wednesday night when a woman read aloud the evening s first randomly selected question what is your favorite ice cream \? microphone in hand , mr carter quickly replied well , my favorite dessert is ice cream , and my favorite ice cream is mango but i do n't turn down other flavors when mango is not available and so began mr carter s with emory freshmen , in which he for 33 years has stood gamely before throngs of teenagers no query is off limits when i was in the white house , i could pretty well predict 90 percent of the questions i 'd get from the white house press corps , and we 'd have the answers rehearsed , kind of , mr carter said in an interview before he spoke to about 1 , 500 people i do n't ever know what i'm going to get asked here as he spoke in a gymnasium where , less than an hour before , students had been playing basketball , the questions flowed easily from scraps of paper and twitter what role should the united states play in combating ebola \? what items can a former president possibly have remaining on his bucket list \? how old was mr carter when he first became interested in human rights \? if mr carter had a theme song , what would it be \? could he sing it \? and the former president , sometimes sporting an amused grin , dutifully and earnestly answered each one , down to his favorite song my generation has this expectation of transparency and openness , and we do n't necessarily expect it from a president who was even elected in the '90s , said jon darby , the president of the student government association to see it from a president who was elected so long ago , i think it is surprising mr carter s candor extended to current issues he said that the plan president obama outlined this week to fight ebola should have been assembled a long time ago but he also defended the president s response to the unrest in reaction to a police shooting in ferguson , mo , last month , saying he could n't possibly interfere in the situation it would be completely illegal and improper for a president to do anything else even as his 90th birthday approaches next month , mr carter remains strikingly available to ordinary americans his sunday school class in his hometown , plains , ga , remains a draw , and it is not unheardof for mr carter to be spotted at atlanta braves baseball games other former presidents are hardly invisible in american life bill clinton , for instance , actively campaigns for democratic candidates , and keeps busy with philanthropic efforts and george w bush works on health care issues in africa , and is preparing a biography of his father , george bush all are involved in their presidential libraries but historians say mr carter still stands apart for his accessibility , and his ritual of talks before emory freshmen is especially unusual part of carter s baptist spirit , i think , is that he is evangelical about the things that mean something to him , said mark k updegrove , the author of , second acts presidential lives and legacies after the white house , and the director of the lyndon baines johnson presidential library the opportunity to address these young people appeals to him at least one other former president harry s truman made a habit of regular appearances before young crowds mr truman , spurred by his secretary s reports of schoolchildren visiting his missouri library , would often talk with students in impromptu gatherings in an auditorium but mr carter has enjoyed a more formal arrangement at emory , and decided in the early 1980s that a townhall format would be the ideal platform for large audiences although the event s style has remained a constant , steven hochman , mr carter s faculty assistant at emory , said the content had shifted in the early years , the focus was much more on his presidency because those students remembered his presidency they grew up with him as president of the united states , dr hochman said you come to a point where you 're starting to talk about something you remember really well , and then you realize none of these kids you 're talking to were born when that happened it becomes history for people
beijing although china and the united states have long been at odds over american surveillance flights near chinese territory , the alltooclose of an american spy plane and a chinese fighter last week has forced both countries to consider the potential for the dispute to escalate disastrously during a gettoknowyou visit by vice president joseph r biden jr to china in 2011 , xi jinping , then the vice president , complained that american spy planes were frequently intruding into chinese airspace mr biden defended the flights as legal under international law , and warned against risky shadowing maneuvers , known as intercepts , by chinese pilots , according to american officials familiar with the conversation now , more than a decade after a off the southern chinese coast , chinese jets are flying close to american aircraft again last week , the chinese fighter pilot flew within 30 feet of a newgeneration navy spy plane , known as a p8 poseidon , in what the pentagon said was very , very close , very dangerous maneuver it was the fourth such confrontation this year , the pentagon said since the meeting with mr biden , mr xi has become president he has initiated a more assertive diplomatic posture in the region and championed measures intended to transform the chinese military into a more capable , battleready force at the same time , washington has deployed a new squadron of the advanced navy p8 surveillance planes to a base in japan , in part out of concern over china s new generation of nucleararmed submarines the closein flying tactics against the american spy planes were not only bad behavior by chinese pilots as the pentagon asserted but were indicative of a deliberate decision by china to push the united states surveillance farther and farther from the chinese coast , chinese experts said the united states wants to be everywhere , but china says i'm a responsible power i will take care of my business you take care of your business , ' said jin canrong , a professor of international studies at renmin university in beijing china s logic is that other countries are not my business , but when it comes to my country , it s none of your business several years ago , in an effort to ease tensions , the pentagon revealed classified information to the chinese on the number of its surveillance missions directed against china , according to a former pentagon official , who declined to be named because the information remained classified the chinese had claimed that the united states flew more surveillance missions against china than washington had flown against the soviet union , and cited overblown figures , the former official said chinese officials had said america was treating china as an enemy when zhang junshe , a military analyst at the chinese naval research institute , wrote in people s daily , the leading communist party newspaper , on monday that american planes conducted about 500 close surveillance missions of chinese targets every year , the number appeared to have come from the american disclosure the 500 is much closer to the truth than the numbers they used to throw around , the former pentagon official said the initial reaction of the chinese at the disclosed material was veiled disbelief , the former official said at an average rate of more than one flight per day , the number 500 does sound about right , said lyle j goldstein , associate professor at the china maritime studies institute at the naval war college in rhode island , adding that he did not have specific knowledge and was speculating note that this averages out to more than one flight per day , professor goldstein said of course , there are maybe multiple flights on any given day that approach china from different vectors on tuesday , china s defense ministry took special umbrage at the pentagon s criticisms of the chinese pilot and blamed the united states for what occurred between the p8 and the chinese fighter the episode should be called american military jet closein surveillance incident , ' a spokesman , yang yujun , said at a monthly briefing for reporters this event occurred 220 kilometers away from china s hainan , not 220 kilometers from america s hawaii , and even more so not 220 kilometers away from florida , he said as china develops a more sophisticated submarine fleet , based chiefly at hainan , china s most southern province , the united states has a more urgent need to get a look at the capabilities , and that means increasing surveillance , according to james hardy , the asia pacific editor of ihs jane s defence weekly hainan is most likely the base for the new type 094 strategic missile submarines that are believed to be entering service now , mr hardy said the us navy will be flying p8s around this part of the world and conducting shipbased surveillance , too , he said there are also p3s in the region the older turboprop maritime surveillance aircraft that the p8 is replacing in us navy service , he added a first squadron of six p8s arrived at the kadena air base in japan at the end of last year , he said more than 100 p8s are on order with boeing , he said like the p3s , the p8s , which are built by boeing and can fly higher and farther , are loaded with stateoftheart digital electronics and can drop sonar buoys into the water the buoys are like sophisticated microphones designed to listen for the movements of submarines , mr hardy said the united states was also using surveillance planes and ships to monitor the south china sea , one of the world s major trading routes , which china claims as its territorial waters but which the united states insists must be maintained as international waters , mr hardy said a major irritant between the united states and china is what constitutes territorial waters the united states says that aircraft have the right to fly over waters beyond a nation s 12mile territorial line china , like a handful of other nations , asserts that foreign aircraft do not have the right to fly over waters within its 200mile exclusive economic zone without permission when the united states invited china to participate in a major navy exercise off the coast of hawaii last month , china sent along an uninvited intelligence ship that patrolled waters within the united states exclusive economic zone that was an example of china s having its cake and eating it , mr hardy said , adding it would complain if the us did the same the same goes for military surveillance by air the question of china s close intercepts would be raised at the annual defense consultation talks between china and the united states that were held at the pentagon on wednesday and thursday , pentagon officials said one of the goals , they said , was to prevent anything like the collision of 2001 , when the tail fin of a chinese j8 fighter jet hit a propeller of a navy ep3 spy plane the chinese aircraft crashed , killing the pilot the damaged american plane managed to land on hainan island , where the american crew members were detained by china for nearly two weeks until intense negotiations between the bush administration and the chinese government secured their release still , despite the risks , there is little likelihood that china will reduce its intercepts or that the united states will curb its surveillance , said zhang baohui , a professor of political science and director of the center for asian pacific studies at lingnan university in hong kong there are genuine strategic stakes here , mr zhang said the us will try to

all dance occurs in the three dimensions of space and the fourth of time but it can be a beautiful shock to feel the invigorating intensity with which the south indian classical dance form of brings all those dimensions keenly to life on monday evening at la mama , in one of the opening events of the weeklong drive east festival of indian music and dance , the dancer stretched to the back of the stage with her right arm , then with her left , each time turning from the front with a 180degree arc likewise she ardently addressed the air above her next the floor below her and also the space s various diagonals and horizontals thus her body filled the surrounding box of empty space with tension and energy all while maintaining a fullbodied flow of pulsating rhythm to a score featuring percussive vocal syllables these are among the most basic pleasures of bharatanatyam , but by any standards they are extraordinary ms ramalingam delivers them and much more complex aspects with terrific skill though the threedimensionality of ballet is among its assets , and though this year alone i 've seen four of the world s five foremost ballet companies , none of them communicate physical multidirectionality with such verve is a new york spinoff of the great annual festival of music and dance in chennai , india a season of 40 programs , drive east includes a concert series , an artists' residency and a summer camp the performances , at la mama , are a firstrate way to deepen our appreciation of india s performing arts i 've loved indian dance and music for years , and yet monday s performances made me feel in the happiest way how ignorant i am about them the rhythms of india alone are beyond my grasp , the ways in which form and communication connect are infinitely subtle , and my knowledge of indian culture and religion is slight but the sensuous beauty of these arts draws me deep in it s a good way to feel as an outsider tumbling into a vast realm of unknown beauty ms ramalingam wearing jewelry , ornaments and several layers of bright orange , red , purple and gold fabric performed five solos in an hour , pausing only briefly between them this dancing was concentrated in every sense , with ultralong , tightly packed phrases , several of which won applause through the \( taped \) music when one or two items of her apparel fell to the floor during different dances , it just underlined how lively this dancing was it was astonishing to see how many parts of the body contributed spine , shoulders , thighs , eyes , fingers , heels and more and each of them made rhythm eyes alternated between demurely downcast and brightly coquettish in 1212 fashion or the head would address threatening anger along one diagonal and then tender entreaty along another , in conversational giveandtake separated fingers splayed in multiple directions , then changed with the fanlike turn of a wrist the spine tilted pliantly from side to side the feet skipped rapidly along a diagonal , made various heeltoesole rhythms , and quickly bounded back the threedimensionality of bharatanatyam became a matter not solely of focus and address , but also of line one dance ended with a wheeling halfcircle of a stretched leg from front to back until the foot came to rest on the floor behind , and the body s complex contour from that rear leg around and up to a frontstretched arm made a gloriously sculptural resolution then the next dance concluded with the same movement , delivered a little faster , only then to pivot into an entirely new shape and one of the greatest virtues of indian classical dance each work had stillness after passages of cascading brio , suddenly ms ramalingam would halt , become a work of proud statuary , and breathe or she would pause with one leg raised and angled even when the stillness was brief , it registered within the surrounding rhythm but sometimes it was sustained with magnificent calm all these elements made this an event of real virtuosity yet delivered with modesty and charm i have just two slight reservations one i have seen other bharatanatyam dancers use frontcurving arm positions with greater volumetric fullness two her spoken introductions about each dance could be slower and clearer on monday evening , this recital was sandwiched between two concerts of indian music , miles apart in style at 6 , , a collective of six contemporary south asian instrumentalists led by rajna swaminathan , played four structured improvisations at 8 30 , , accompanied by nitin mitta \( tabla \) and aparna garimella \( tanpura \) , gave a 90minute sitar recital both programs were superb i found the sitar concert revelatory the variety of meter , sonority , pitch and speed that this instrument achieved was transporting , and the interplay with the tabla exhilarating the rest of the drive east festival brings dance examples of kathak , kuchipudi , mohiniattam , odissi and rarest here sattriya each has its own wellestablished rhythmic and physical style , and each can prove addictive i plan to steep myself in as much as possible
london is in the midst of a boom so giddy it has parted company with the rest of britain construction is everywhere , from the new towers of the city of london \( a global financial center larger than wall street \) to the mansions of kensington \( where the world s superwealthy burrow below ground to accommodate staff quarters and the de rigueur swimming pool \) to everhipper eastern districts like hoxton \( sought after by the ordinary mortals driven from the center \) money does not precisely gush from every home , business and storefront in central london , as it did before the meltdown of 2008 , but it oozes again in sticky abundance house prices in london have jumped about 19 percent in a year the london economy is set to grow by over 4 percent this year in a nation that , elsewhere , struggles to shake off stagnation the capital has become a glittering enclave in a country often resentful of its dominance it presides with spiffy superiority , like squeakyclean singapore looking down on dusty southeast asia there is talk of a bubble nobody cares foreign money pours in , to the city and its immediate surroundings , where the shard skyscraper now rises over 1 , 000 feet , but also into houses and apartments often used only a few weeks a year in belgravia , mayfair and marylebone the oligarchs of kazakhstan , the oilrich of the gulf and the newly affluent of asia bivouac with their staffs they shop , oblivious to the displaced masses with day jobs the average masters of the universe in london , unlike those in the united states , can enjoy residency without being taxed on global income large numbers of luxury properties sit empty most of the time , palatial slivers of big portfolios if vladimir v putin is serious about defending russian speakers wherever they are , he may have to annex the royal borough of kensington and chelsea , where russian is a lingua franca on the king s road none of this will be unfamiliar to new yorkers the other great global city like london a magnet to strivers of every kind and home to every kind of bad english has its own bubble it sucks in money from across the globe , even without those tax advantages real estate prices soar ordinary people are pushed out as in london , farflung districts rise bushwick has arrived east new york looms new york is a world apart , even if its relative weight in the national economy is much smaller than that of the british capital what draws the world to london and new york is opportunity that s fine , of course but they are also magnets to people looking for a safe place for their money having made it big in autocratic countries with parlous legal systems \( if that \) , a cowed press and rampant corruption say , russia and china oligarchs and crony capitalists wake up one day and find that , gosh , they like nothing as much as democratic systems under the rule of law held accountable by an independent press having trashed the west , they trust the west with their money this then is the way the world works autocratic hypercapitalism without western checks and balances produces new elites whose dream is an american or british lifestyle and education for their children , and whose other goal , knowing how their own capricious systems really function , is to buy into the rule of law by acquiring real estate , driving up prices in prime markets to the point where the middle classes of those countries , with incomes often stagnant or falling , are pushed aside this process is mirrored at the national level , where the bargain is that american debt is bought by asian governments , notably the chinese , and asians make money through access to creditfueled american markets and consumers asians lend america money to police the world their new wealth depends on americanunderwritten stability they know it surface conflict often masks inextricable connectedness london and new york , with roughly the same populations , have become booming citystates that reflect 21stcentury openness and fluidity , but also the skewed economics and growing inequalities of a world where finance has outflanked the law and the global rich find ways to game a system that holds the majority in its grip in london during these boom times , the disparities can feel obscene still , london does the public sphere , like bike schemes , road surfaces and the subway , much better than new york it is a european city , after all but it sits in a middling nation well past its zenith new york does power , directness and steak a lot better than london it races and churns london carries on take your pick in the end it s personal waiting for a table the other day in a new york restaurant , i was asked for my name as i spelled it out , the ma tre d'h tel interrupted me of course , of the priestly class , he said , referring to the name cohen given to the high priests of ancient israel that would not happen in london
hong kong participation in an informal poll to gauge hong kong s desire for democracy is exceeding expectations , helped on sunday by hundreds of volunteers who are reaching potential voters in subway stations and shopping malls , bringing americanstyle retail politics to one small corner of the people s republic of china three days into a 10day voting period , more than 689 , 000 ballots had been cast , equal to almost onefifth of the number of in hong kong , a former british colony that was returned to chinese sovereignty in 1997 organizers had publicly said they hoped for at least 100 , 000 participants in the poll , which has been condemned as illegal and invalid by the central government in beijing most votes have been cast online on computers through a website or by smartphones with an app but on sunday , polling centers opened across hong kong , and people voted in curtained booths the poll is nonbinding and does not have the backing of the hong kong government using tactics that would be familiar ahead of the iowa caucuses or new hampshire primary , groups of students and other volunteers on sunday caught potential voters at the bus and subway stations and near the city s shopping malls though hong kong is just more than onequarter the size of rhode island , its 72 million people make it more populous than all but 12 american states people who participate are choosing among three possible methods for electing the top leader of hong kong , called the chief executive , all of which give voters a more direct say in picking candidates than the chinese government has signaled it will tolerate the current chief executive , leung chunying , said friday that none of the proposals would be permitted under the legal framework set up to govern hong kong the group overseeing the poll , occupy central with love and peace , has pledged to disrupt the city s main business district if the hong kong government , in consultation with beijing , presented an election reform plan that did not meet international standards for free and fair elections all three options allow candidates to secure a nomination by receiving a certain number of signatures from voters a minimum of 1 percent of the voting public , or about 35 , 000 people they differ in the procedures used to nominate candidates while the chinese government has agreed to allow hong kong to pick the chief executive by universal suffrage from 2017 , it has resisted calls for significantly expanding voters' participation in nominating candidates the referendum s organizers say unless their demands are met , the nomination process will be skewed to allow a vote for only beijingapproved candidates the three proposals being voted on allow for candidates who may not be acceptable to beijing to find their way onto the ballot the chinese government has final approval of any candidate who wins a hong kong election but the mainland government has no control over the informal referendum , which has suffered from cyberattacks some people have said that beijing s opposition to the poll , carried out by a universityaffiliated group in tandem with the occupy central movement , motivated them to vote over the weekend , hong kong newspapers loyal to the mainland chinese government denounced the referendum wen wei po , a promainland publication , said the electronic poll was open to numerous abuses , including the possibility that residents might vote more than once by using more than one smartphone or computer this farce cannot decide hong kong s future , said a headline on the website of takung pao , another probeijing newspaper benny tai , a founder of the occupy central movement , said that if the hong kong or chinese authorities questioned the integrity of the vote , there was a simple solution the government should organize an official referendum that would put real choices about universal suffrage to the voters we 'd support that , mr tai said if they have their doubts , then they can answer them with an official poll voters at polling stations across the city on sunday showed enthusiasm for the referendum in hong kong s outer suburb of tseung kwan o , philip yeung , 22 , who studies english at a local university , brought his mother , father and sister with him to vote chloe ng , 39 , a child care worker , said her entire extended family of more than 20 people had cast ballots for some of hong kong s youth , the campaign over universal suffrage has become a heady initiation into opposition activism many of the most ardent canvassers for votes were supporters of scholarism , a youth group that has backed the most farreaching proposal for public nomination of candidates for the chief executive two high school activists for scholarism , agnes chow and joshua wong , rode a campaign van through hong kong as a loudspeaker attached to it blared out calls to vote both said they saw the poll as another step in a long battle against the mainland authorities and their local supporters our consideration is not whether the chinese government will accept the proposal or not , said ms chow , 17 the most important consideration is that the hong kong people can enjoy a real democratic political system whatever the result , that s our ultimate goal outside one polling station in a busy shopping district , a dozen or so opponents of the referendum shouted slogans and held up signs urging people to think twice before voting but as the morning progressed , a growing number of people filed up the stairs to vote at 15 tables run by volunteers
lawyers defending brig gen jeffrey a sinclair on sexual assault charges are renewing claims that the case against him has been tainted by the influence of senior officials in the pentagon , citing emails that military prosecutors turned over during the weekend the emails show that fears that general sinclair s chief accuser might have testified untruthfully at a hearing in january were discussed among a number of senior officers at fort bragg , nc , and were not limited to just the former lead prosecutor , who quit the case last month the decision by the prosecutor , lt col william helixon , to resign from the case after he failed to persuade his superiors to dismiss the most serious charges and the public disclosure of their disagreement had thrown the prosecution into turmoil that culminated in a hearing last week at fort bragg before the start of the courtmartial , where officials testified that colonel helixon was under extraordinary stress from health and personal issues when he had expressed misgivings about the chief prosecution witness , and at one point was even acting irrationally and was suicidal but documents that defense lawyers made available to a reporter on sunday indicated that the most senior army lawyer at fort bragg had also raised immediate concerns with his commanding officer about the accuser s testimony in january , which was about her finding an old iphone that contained messages between herself and general sinclair it is possible that she was not truthful , col michael lacey , the senior military lawyer at fort bragg s xviii airborne corps , wrote to the corps commanding officer , lt gen joseph anderson , in an email early the morning after the accuser s jan 7 testimony the conflict between her description of discovering the phone , and what forensic analysis indicated , brings her credibility into question , colonel lacey wrote the courtmartial proceedings against general sinclair began last week at fort bragg , after to a handful of lesser charges , in hopes of narrowing the trial to focus on the credibility of his chief accuser , with whom the general has acknowledged having a threeyear extramarital affair the courtmartial is scheduled to resume on monday army prosecutors have said that they do not question the woman s account of sexual assault by general sinclair , 51 , who is accused of forcing his former lover , a junior officer , to perform oral sex , and threatening to kill her and her family if she revealed their affair a separate email disclosed over the weekend shows that another army lawyer at fort bragg advising the top commander at the base about the courtmartial solicited input about the case in december from one of the army s top lawyers at the pentagon the email was sent dec 16 by lt col james bagwell , chief of military justice at fort bragg who defense lawyers said at the time was also serving as the base s acting staff judge advocate to brig gen paul wilson , then a colonel , who is a senior officer at the judge advocate general s corps at army headquarters at the pentagon the email detailed general sinclair s offer to plead guilty to charges including adultery and conduct unbecoming an officer and to retire at a reduced rank , if the military agreed to drop the most serious charges of sexual assault it was sent days after the general s chief accuser revealed to prosecutors that she had found the old iphone sir lot has been happening on this case over the past week virtually none of it good for govt , colonel bagwell wrote i was wondering if i get your thoughts opinion on the latest attached otp from general sinclair , he wrote , using the military acronym for offer to plead in the email , colonel bagwell appeared to endorse the concept of a plea bargain with general sinclair for my part it s 90 there , he wrote , referring to the plea offer none of the new emails showed whether general wilson responded , or if he did , whether he argued the plea agreement should be rejected , as it was the next month but lawyers for general sinclair believe it is the latest evidence that suggests the pentagon has improperly influenced the prosecution , and on sunday night they submitted a new motion with the military court at fort bragg complaining of unlawful command influence the military judge hearing the case has rejected several previous motions seeking dismissal of charges based on allegations of improper influence general sinclair , former deputy commander of american forces in southern afghanistan , has long conceded an affair with his chief accuser , now a 34yearold captain , but his lawyers have denied the sexual assault charges , claiming the woman fabricated the allegations to avoid prosecution for adultery , which is punishable under military law
los angeles bad omens stared at henrik lundqvist at the start of game 5 of the stanley cup finals it was the 666th game of his career a full moon the first on friday the 13th since 2000 hung over staples center perhaps the omens were true portents a riveting stanley cup playoffs finally came to end , almost 30 minutes past midnight eastern time for the second time in three years , the won the stanley cup the rangers put together an overachieving springtime run , although they wound up falling short of their first championship in 20 years , losing game 5 , 32 , in double overtime , and losing the series , four games to one kings defenseman alec martinez scored on a rebound past lundqvist \( 48 saves \) at 14 minutes 43 seconds of an unbearably tense double overtime dustin brown , the kings' captain , hoisted the cup two years and two nights after the kings won their first cup , against the devils i prepared so hard for every game , lundqvist said afterward i 've never been so tired after a run like this the kings took a 10 lead on justin williams s goal 6 minutes 4 seconds into the game lundqvist had just stopped two kings shots in rapid succession and was being pushed into the net by jarret stoll when williams scored on the rebound the kings could not add to the lead , but the rangers could not mount much of a threat , as los angeles backchecked conscientiously and effectively that changed at 15 37 of the second period , while the rangers were on the power play ryan mcdonagh found chris kreider alone in front with a nifty feed , and kreider redirected the puck in to tie the score the kings went on the power play two minutes later and threatened to retake the lead but williams passed the puck out of the rangers' zone , and carl hagelin shouldered kings defenseman slava voynov aside to get it voynov , exhausted near the end of a 2 29long shift , offered little resistance hagelin passed to boyle , who stickhandled deftly to give himself space in front of kings defenseman drew doughty boyle s shot from 27 feet found the top corner behind quick with 30 seconds left in the period that shocked the staples center into silence but the crowd came back to life when mats zuccarello was sent off for tripping the kings' jake muzzin 7 39 into the third period on a play in which muzzin seemed to stick his leg out at zuccarello marian gaborik , the former ranger , needed only 18 seconds to capitalize on the kings' power play first tipping doughty s shot into lundqvist , then burying the rebound the kings poured on the pressure through the rest of the period , outshooting the rangers by 123 but the game went to overtime , for the third time in the series' three games at the staples center the first overtime was breakneck , fraught with chances and anxiety mcdonagh hit the goal post on a rangers power play the kings' tyler toffoli struck the crossbar at even strength lundqvist fought off jeff carter s wraparound try and numerous drives in front quick stopped zuccarello on two rebounds kreider had a breakaway but missed it was exhausting , physically and emotionally crazy , brad richards said , reflecting on all the strange bounces the puck throughout the series that s life not life , but that s our sport the rangers became the first team to lose the finals in less than six games since 2007 , when anaheim ousted ottawa , four games to one but they had a remarkable and unexpected ride through the playoffs they beat the philadelphia flyers in seven games , came back from 13 down to upset the pittsburgh penguins in seven , and defeated the montreal canadiens in six in a matchup of original six teams in the eastern conference finals down three games to none against the kings last wednesday , the rangers held on for a 21 win at madison square garden , a victory that spared their fans the sight of a visiting team lifting the cup on garden ice during their playoff run , the rangers rallied to the side of their teammate martin st louis , who played through his grief after the unexpected death of his mother on may 8 i'm proud of every guy here we fought hard , st louis said after friday s game i'm just going to let this wound heal a little bit come up for air during the playoffs , derek stepan had his jaw broken , yet he missed only one game , scoring two goals on his first night back the alternate captains richards , dan girardi and marc staal served ably as captainsbycommittee for a team whose full captain , ryan callahan , was traded away in march tonight s not a night to reminisce , richards said but there 'll be a time this summer we 'll look back at what an amazing run it was has to be amazing to get this far things have to come together as a group no one will ever know except us how fun it was and how we came together lundqvist , the 32yearold goalie from sweden , backstopped the rangers to victory in three series and five straight elimination games before finally falling on friday , his dream of winning a stanley cup deferred for at least another year you try not to get frustrated knowing how close we were , he said slap shots game 5 was the 93rd of the nhl postseason , the league s longest
los angeles in october , before starting an international theater tour , the songwriter consulted a clairvoyant she was instructed to write down four questions in advance and sleep on them the first question on the list , ms del rey said in an interview in may at her house here , was am i meant for this world \? it s probably not the kind of question most multimillionselling pop singers would ask themselves with their careers clearly ascendant this year , ms del rey was called on to sing a spooky remake of once upon a dream for the disney film maleficent , and she sang at versailles for the prewedding party of kanye west and kim kardashian but doubt , regrets , obsessive longing and selfdestructive impulses are often at the core of ms del rey s songs and videos i wait for you babe , that s all i do you do n't come through babe , you never do , she sings in pretty when you cry on her new album ultraviolence \( polydor interscope \) , due for release tuesday since her emergence on a major label with the single video games in 2011 and the album born to die in 2012 , ms del rey has drawn passionately opposed responses her songs and video clips demurely step into cultural minefields , exploring eroticism , mortality , power , submission , glamour , faith , popculture iconography and the meaning \( s \) of the american dream she has faced , in reviews and online discussions , shifting accusations of inauthenticity , amateurishness , antifeminism and commercial calculation \( although her only top 10 single in the united states was unplanned a dance remix by cedric gervais of her wistful ballad summertime sadness \) but she has also , largely through youtube , gathered an adoring worldwide audience that takes her every lyric to heart ultraviolence will doubtless stir up more disputes but one thing the album should immediately eliminate is the notion that ms del rey is only chasing hits the album reaches deeper into her slowmotion sense of time , her blend of retro sophistication and seemingly guileless candor it also moves gracefully between heartache and sly humor , sometimes within the same song the music on ultraviolence sets her further outside whatever passes for current pop mainstream while radio playlists are full of futuristic electronic dance beats and autotuned testimonials to selfesteem , ms del rey , 28 , has taken a contrary path , melodic and melancholy much of her music has been lush and downtempo , invoking vintage movie scores and echoes of the 1950s and 1960s it opens quiet spaces her voice sounds human and unguarded , offering sweetness and ache even when she sings fourletter words the tracks on born to die drew on hiphop , with grunted samples and hefty beats , but now , she said , i'm not crazy about some of that production the hiphop influence was already receding on paradise , the ep she released in 2012 and ultraviolence is more languorous than ever its first single , west coast , actually downshifts to a slower tempo for its chorus , where standard radio formula calls for a big buildup in a throwback to a lesscomputerized era , many of the tracks on ultraviolence were built around ms del rey and a sevenpiece band recording together and responding to one another the songs often float in a psychedelic haze that she described as narcoswing dan auerbach , the black keys' guitarist , produced and performed on the album , and said , she was watching us and swaying while we were playing mr auerbach was drawn to her songs because , he said , they felt old and new at the same time ms del rey freely cites inspirations including frank sinatra , bob dylan , cat power , nirvana and eminem , but none of them emerged in this century think of what s going on now , she said where am i going to get my inspiration \? i could n't think of a thing today that i would really genuinely want to be a part of in conversation , ms del rey is n't the lowvoiced chanteuse of songs like video games or blue jeans her voice has a girlish , soprano lilt , punctuated with giggles wearing a blue minidress and clear sandals that revealed toenails painted a pearly peach , she sat on her couch here , sipping coffee and smoking through a pack of cigarettes , under a painting of cherubic angels she showed off a recent tattoo on her right arm whitman nabokov , two authors she has quoted in songs she had just returned to los angeles to finish her north american tour , with a show at the shrine auditorium and expo hall after living in london and touring the world , ms del rey bought her house here , an elegant englishstyle residence in need of repair , seven months ago the walls are newly painted in the blues and greens that were also the palette of video games , the homemade she edited it on her laptop that catapulted her career and has now been viewed more than 119 million times on her two alone the paintings in her living room are of icons the virgin mary , elizabeth taylor and a book on the coffee table had marilyn monroe on the cover i have strong relationships with icons , she says they 're probably my most meaningful relationships they feel personal to me , but maybe that s what being an icon is maybe everyone feels like they have that special relationship that s different from everybody else , like you love them and you think you understand them more than anyone else , or you get them for who they really are it s not a position she aspires to for herself i would n't really know how to shape myself as an icon , she said earnestly many of the accusations that were leveled at her majorlabel debut were inaccurate she was n't a pretty face serving someone else s concept , or a dilettante as born elizabeth woolridge grant she had worked at being a songwriter since her teens , and playing in small clubs on the lower east side and in williamsburg she grew up in lake placid , ny , and came to new york city with , she said , a dylanesque dream of a community of writers , but never found it in 2007 , she got her when she was a senior at fordham , studying metaphysics she recorded a debut ep in 2008 , and briefly released an album in 2010 lizzy grant aka lana del ray before it was withdrawn while she renamed herself lana del rey the songs on that album were already exploring the tarnished innocence and dangerous compulsions that she would return to on born to die the production would change with her collaborators , but her perspective did not as many songwriters do , she works with more trained musicians who supply foundations for her melodies and lyrics sometimes they offer chord progressions while she improvises sometimes she brings finished words and tunes for them to harmonize she s very clear about what she wants and does n't want , said rick nowels , who wrote young and beautiful and west coast with her , and who has collaborated with madonna and dido she is the captain of her own ship ms del rey describes her songwriting simply i want one of two things , she said i either want to tell it exactly like the way it was , or i want to envision the future the way i hope it will become i'm either documenting something or i'm dreaming on ultraviolence , that means songs like cruel world , in which she breaks away from a long failed relationship shared my body and my mind with you that s all over now and sad girl , a bluesy reflection on being a mistress on the side she also sings the other woman , a song recorded by nina simone already braced for disapproval , she said if you really do want to analyze me , if that s maybe something you 're interested in , let me tell you my story and you can look at that the recording of pretty when you cry is built around the original writing session chords from her band s guitarist , blake stranathan , a fluctuating tempo and words she was making up on the spot i'm stronger than all my men , she sings , except for you a more conventional approach would be to redo its shaky , scratchy lead vocal with something prettier i did n't even think to go back and fix it , she said , because if you know the story behind it , then you can tell why it was sung that way the angry responses to born to die left scars carl jung said that inevitably what other people think of you becomes a small facet of your psyche , whether you want it to or not , she said her new album includes a retort money , power , glory , which claims , with deep sarcasm , that those are what she s after i learned that whatever i did elicited an opposite response , so i'm sure money , power , glory' will actually resonate with people as being what i really do want , she said with a shrug i already know what s coming , so it s ok to explore irony and bitterness a recurring criticism was that her songs about being swept away by love were antifeminist in their passivity she contends that she was writing about private , immediate feelings , not setting out doctrine for me , a true feminist is someone who is a woman who does exactly what she wants , she said if my choice is to , i do n't know , be with a lot of men , or if i enjoy a really physical relationship , i do n't think that s necessarily being antifeminist for me the argument of feminism never really should have come into the picture because i do n't know too much about the history of feminism , and so i'm not really a relevant person to bring into the conversation everything i was writing was so autobiographical , it could really only be a personal analysis she has also been denounced for video clips that culminate in her death by drowning , by falling , by choking the video for born to die ends with her in a boyfriend s arms , inert and covered in blood she agrees that her videos have often been exploring ways to die , she said , adding i love the idea that it 'll all be over it s just a relief , really i'm scared to die , but i want to die the title song of ultraviolence ventures into precarious territory in an arrangement that melds baroque dirge and wahwah guitar , the singer describes herself as filled with poison but blessed with beauty and rage , and goes on to quote a fraught 1962 song from the crystals , the lyrics also mention a cult leader , and ms del rey said the song looked back to a time soon after she moved to new york city , when she considered following a guru who believed in breaking you down to build you back up again it sounds kind of weird , she added , but that is what it s about , and having romantic feelings entwined with the idea of being led and letting go and surrendering that s always a concept to me , like i'm wavering between independence and falling into lifestyles and being led there s an underlying pattern to the songs throughout ultraviolence ms del rey s voice appears alone and often fragile in the verses , then is swarmed by instruments and multiple backup vocals each tune fully represents the ebbs and flows , the periods of normality mixed with this uncontrolled chaos that comes in through circumstances in my life , she said it s your story if you 're the one writing it , you want to tell your story right the next night ms del rey was at the shrine s expo hall before a packed , standing audience there were highpitched screams when she strolled onstage , and from the front to the back of the hangarlike hall , voices were raised to sing along it was n't , like some concerts , a social occasion this audience was devotional , sharing every word , sometimes close to drowning her out onstage , ms del rey just stood there and sang , swaying occasionally when she did her one planned bit of choreography , a single hip flip in body electric , the whole room roared the energy is so much higher in the pit than it is onstage , she noted afterward she strolled twice down into the photo pit , trailed by a video camera , as fans reached for her with offerings and hugs one fervent embrace looked like a halfnelson i 've lost a lot of hair on this tour , she said later , backstage the audience has been an unexpected well of comfort that i 've dipped into recently it was never something i even thought to go to for strength or affirmation but the adoration has n't quite broken through the solitude of her songs yes , i'm in a different place today than i was four years ago , she said but i'm some ways i'm still in the exact same place i'm still on the periphery
untitled i remember when those masked avengers of women artists , the guerrilla girls , first blasted their way into new york city s collective consciousness it was 1985 bold blackandwhite posters popped up overnight , plastered on walls all over soho what do these artists have in common \? they allow their work to be shown in galleries that show less than 10 women or none at all it included a list and those male names were important armed with facts , wit and anonymity , the girls made a stink their famous weenie counts embarrassed the art world , a world inhabited by rightthinking , leftleaning , openminded , sensitive , educated people proudly brandishing the fword feminism , a word that still makes new york sophisticates squirm the guerrilla girls waged an ongoing campaign in which they increasingly employed irony and humor as their weapons of choice in 1989 , city buses rumbled down our streets emblazoned with this message do women have to be naked to get into the met museum \? less than 5 of the artists in the modern art sections are women , but 85 of the nudes are female the image ingres' la grande odalisque , wearing a ferocious gorilla mask the initial catalyst for the guerrillas' rage was a 1984 show at the museum of modern art one hundred and sixtynine artists were featured thirteen were women what has changed in the last three decades \? in april 2014 a rumor circulated on the internet that in 2015 , moma would show only women , complete with a quote from glenn lowry , the museum s director , admitting that the gesture could not make up for years of underrepresentation alas , it was an april fools' day hoax perpetuated by art slant , a fine arts portal nevertheless , sexism and racism in the arts are receiving media attention once again , and the guerrilla girls are still with us their targets now reach far beyond new york , and the art world has embraced them their posters have been shown at the tate in london the group exhibited at the venice biennale in 2005 but they still wear gorilla masks in public , and they still do weenie counts the numbers are somewhat better in 2012 , 275 percent of the artists at the frieze art fair were women , excluding collaborations but women s work is still cheaper than men s , a lot cheaper s list of the 300 most expensive works selling at auction between 2008 and 2012 does not include one by a woman museums , galleries , art magazines , art critics and collectors are still complicit a combination of factors big investors who want a quick turnaround for profit , artist entrepreneurs \( think jeff koons and damien hirst \) , the blockbuster museum shows that began in the 1970s with the world tour of the king tut extravaganza , as well as burgeoning international art fairs have created a dizzying atmosphere of glitz , media glare , celebrity and speculation , the upper reaches of which mostly exclude women in an age when women can and do study art , when over half of the art students in the west are women , why is it still so hard \? does art really have a gender identity and , if it does , does that identity necessarily match the artist s sex \? in 2008 , the english art critic brian sewell told the independent , the art market is not sexist there has never been a firstrank woman artist only men are capable of aesthetic greatness sewell s comment created an uproar , as did the artist georg baselitz s statement last year women do n't paint very well it s a fact he also said , as always , the market is right are these old white men mouthing the clich s of an earlier era , or are they saying what others think but do n't say aloud \? perhaps more surprising than their sexism is their faith in the art market i confess i do not believe that jeff koons' balloon dog \( orange \) , which sold for 584 million in 2013 , is better than louise bourgeois' spider , which brought 107 million in 2011 experts' and assessors' perceptions of art and its value are fickle , marketdriven and reflective of the culture as a whole countless empirical studies have concluded that such perceptions are informed by one s expectations and biases we are all affected , but we may be entirely unconscious of our prejudice if a work has been designated great , perceptual experience changes accordingly if a work of art of any kind has a woman s name attached to it , it is perceived to be worth less than a man s work , and not only by men women , too , are infected in 1970 , the conductor zubin mehta told the new york times i just do n't think women should be in an orchestra in the 1970s and 1980s , symphony orchestras adopted blind auditions the musicians were hidden behind a screen the policy resulted in a marked increase in the numbers of women in orchestras one can only wonder what would happen if art were judged blind would we know immediately which sex was responsible for a work \? would joseph cornell s boxes with their delicate details , birds , ballerinas and movie stars be instantly recognizable as works by a man , and eva hesse s abstract minimalist sculptures as works by a woman \? if cornell had been a woman , how would his boxes have been interpreted \? his art has an overtly feminine quality and , if hesse s work had been signed by a man , would her geometric forms , her cords and ropes , her anatomical and erotic allusions scream woman artist \? i think my work is very strong , she says , and yet sensitive , so there you have both socalled masculine and feminine every artist is shaped by his or her experiences , including sexual identity and the privileges or disadvantages that go with it , but great art can never be reduced to biography or sex far more than a man s art , a woman s works continue to be judged according to what s known about her personal life and by the fact that she is female simone de beauvoir pointed out that man is the universal , woman the particular this dichotomy has not been overcome when was the last time you heard someone mention an important man artist \? in 1985 , a small band of artists went marauding in the dead of night with posters and wheat paste they left behind a message demanding change things have changed for women making art , but they have not changed enough the fword is also for our future
the best holiday card we received the year that our daughter died said simply , continuing to lift you up in prayer and came from an aunt and uncle we hadn t seen in years before that year , i had always looked forward to holiday cards as children , my brother and i had quarreled over who would haul in the mail each december day this sometimes culminated in a race down our steep , and occasionally snowy , driveway my dad s size 10 shoes flopped on my feet , my way of saving a few seconds of lacetying we cast aside the matte cards with illustrations of cardinals or wreathes and relished those that rained staticky glitter onto our fingers and the kitchen table in seeing my name scrawled by so many different hands , i felt embraced as i progressed from young adulthood to parenthood , holiday cards changed in place of the traditional folded affairs , my husband and i received highgloss family photos sleeker than a tropical postcard , often signed electronically the absence of a message , and sometimes any handwriting at all , irked me of course , i would be annoyed i am a writer i waved aside my irritation everybody kept hectic schedules , and i could already follow the goingson of most families on facebook that december , five months after our daughter s stillbirth , the cards mounded in our mailbox as usual i set aside the cards that i expected to be safe , usually those from older relatives or friends without children then i slit open the thinnest envelopes , glanced inside , and dropped each slick card into the garbage more than an annoyance now , the photo cards pained me some people had dashed off their names in shiny ink none had written a personal message had the senders paused at the sight of our names as they affixed the stamp on the envelope \? thought twice about mailing photos of their cherubic babies \? i wanted to think better of people , and not any people , our friends and family members those oldfashioned matte cards became my respite even those that had only a handwritten happy holidays were a thing of grace compared with the glistening photographic proclamations of joy that many people sent and we received a wonderful few with messages recognizing that our holidays would be blanketed in sorrow this is not a campaign to end the photo card those cards fulfill a lot of needs for the sender they are quick , relatively inexpensive , personalized and yet completely impersonal my husband and i now have two healthy children , and our daughter carries around the photo cards that we receive as if they were sacred objects those cards , however , gloss right over the issues that most profoundly affect families job loss , illness , death it is easy enough to buy a box of those generic cards , the oldfashioned kind with space for writing , and swap one in for the family that needs charity more than cheer that card may be the only one that is remembered beyond new year s day
the prosecutor overseeing the case of a white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager in ferguson , mo , offered a firm , unapologetic defense on friday of his role in the case , his unusual handling of grand jury proceedings , and his decision to announce the grand jury s finding in the evening hours in his since a st louis county grand jury decided last month not to indict the officer , darren wilson , the prosecutor , robert p mcculloch , told a radio station that he did not believe events would have been different had he chosen to wait until daylight to reveal the grand jury s conclusion businesses were looted and burned in the st louis suburbs in the hours after mr mcculloch made the announcement about 8 30 pm central time on nov 24 , when the streets were dark and demonstrators had massed outside the ferguson police headquarters there was no good time to announce this , mr mcculloch told ktrs of the case that inflamed a national debate over race and policing whatever was going to happen was going to happen we knew that very early on mr mcculloch said that he believed it was important to release the decision as soon as practicable after the grand jury reached it earlier in the day , and that he consulted with law enforcement authorities on the choice asked whether he wished , in retrospect , that he had waited until the next morning , mr mcculloch said no i do n't have any regrets about that , he said what occurred afterwards was unfortunate , and there are a variety of reasons that that may have occurred and some people were bent on destruction regardless of when this was going to be released since the death of the teenager , michael brown , in august , mr mcculloch has been a focus of anger for protesters who questioned his family s deep ties to law enforcement and his ability to be fair on friday , mr mcculloch , the st louis county prosecuting attorney for more than two decades , defended the ways he had treated this case differently , like presenting grand jurors with all available evidence and testimony including witnesses whose testimony was discredited rather than a simpler , narrower thesis of the case my job is not to get an indictment , my job is to seek the truth , and seek justice and do what is right and what s appropriate in there , he said , and that s what we did in this case and all other cases mr mcculloch said the grand jury was able to sort out whose testimony to believe , and acknowledged that witnesses he did not believe to be truthful had come before the jurors mr mcculloch said that one female witness , who provided testimony that appeared to bolster officer wilson s account of events , clearly was n't present when the shooting occurred in her testimony , the woman whom mr mcculloch appeared to cite , acknowledged a history of feelings that others consider to be racist , gave various reasons for being near the shooting , and described extensive memory problems from a head injury in a car crash asked whether he believed the grand jury had given credence to the woman s testimony , mr mcculloch said , none whatsoever , and added that the grand jury also heard from other witnesses whose testimony was also in doubt it went both directions , he said my determination was to put everybody on and let the grand jurors assess their credibility , which they did , mr mcculloch said he added at another point it s not as though we just as some of these pundits have said we just opened the door and threw everything in and said , here , do what you 're going to do' since mr brown s death in ferguson , some have called for special prosecutors in every such case involving officers mr mcculloch dismissed those suggestions , as well as claims that his views were tainted because he has had family members who have been police officers , including his father , who was killed by a kidnapper years ago he said he had been reviewing police shootings for 20 years and had prosecuted numerous officers for various crimes it has not hindered our ability to look at these things , he said some people have the idea that the police are going to protect the police there s nobody who dislikes a dishonest cop more than other cops , because they tarnish everybody with that and we do n't like dishonest people regardless of their occupation
kabul , afghanistan just months after american officials ceded control over all detention operations in afghanistan , president hamid karzai s government has quietly planned dozens of prisoner releases that american and afghan officials said on tuesday would include committed insurgents who had attacked americans the pending wave of releases has revived one of the most caustic and seemingly resolved issues between the allies just as relations have hit a new low over mr karzai s refusal to sign a longterm security agreement with american officials officials from both countries who support the security deal say they are worried that the mass release of militants with american blood on their hands could scuttle talks altogether and lead to a complete western withdrawal from afghanistan in 2014 it was out of concern that dangerous militants might be too easily returned to the battlefield that american military commanders initially resisted mr karzai s demands in the spring to hand over all detention operations as the americans relented , they said they had received his personal assurances that security would be maintained suddenly , it is a major issue again , though the releases have not been made final the afghan commission charged with reviewing detainee cases at the main military prison near bagram air base , a coalition hub north of kabul , is planning to release more than 85 prisoners who the coalition and afghan defense officials say should face trial the plans were detailed by american and afghan officials alarmed by the move , and have been confirmed by commission members these are guys that are tied directly to killing and trying to kill our forces and afghan forces , an american military official said this is an issue of deep concern it is serious the commission disagrees abdul shakor dadras , a member of the threeman panel , said there was no real evidence against any of the men , who are among the 650 prisoners the panel has ordered freed since mr karzai created it after the transfer of the prison in march in an interview on tuesday , mr dadras said that mr karzai tentatively approved the releases at a cabinet meeting last week the president , he said , ordered the commission to give the international military coalition and the main afghan intelligence agency until friday to produce evidence against the detainees if none is produced , the men will be released , mr dadras said but american and afghan security officials , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of tensions between the countries , said they had already given the commission enough evidence to send all the detainees in question to trial , or at least to hold them pending further investigation the officials say that they have evidence linking the detainees to the killings of 117 american , european and afghan service members and civilians , and that they are ready to continue investigating in cases where more evidence is needed to try the men one of the detainees was caught planting a hidden bomb and was linked by biometric evidence to other bomb attacks that killed two afghan soldiers , the officials said another is alleged to have trained and deployed teenage boys for suicide attacks a third placed a hidden bomb outside a school , killing a student , the officials said both the afghan defense officials and the americans argued that under the deal that transferred control of the prison , the commission did not have the authority to order the releases over the objection of the coalition and the intelligence service , which is supposed to make a recommendation on each case the commission has exceeded its mandate and ordered the release of a number of dangerous individuals who are legitimate threats and for whom there is strong evidence supporting prosecution or further investigation , said col david lapan , a spokesman for american forces in afghanistan an afghan defense official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of crossing mr karzai , was blunter we are not happy at all they turn into war heroes once they go back to their villages and join the fight against afghans releasing the prisoners is harming us one of the men due to be released , salman khan , was detained in may by coalition forces , who said they had caught him hiding a bomb in zhare district , the american military official said villagers in the district confirmed the american account of the raid , though they said his name was sallam khan they insisted that mr khan should be released hajji lala , an elder from zhare , said that mr khan had been duped by the taliban into planting the bomb and that he would stay away from the insurgents if he returned american and afghan defense officials say there is ample evidence of freed insurgents returning to the battlefield one case cited by afghan officials was that of mullah ghulam mohammad , who was detained by coalition forces in northern badghis province he was freed last year after pressure from some afghan officials and has since returned to badghis , where he now commands an estimated 500 fighters , said qazi abdul rahim raheen , a member of parliament from the region , citing a briefing by afghan intelligence officials the conflict is a new blow to the ebbing trust between mr karzai and american officials , who had already expressed anger with his growing list of demands since he refused in november to complete the security deal he had initially approved it does raise concerns if they are not willing to adhere to agreements we made , then there is a real trust issue , the american military official said it raises questions about any deal we would enter into the americans were not the only ones striking pessimistic notes on tuesday prowestern afghan officials who only days earlier had expressed confidence that mr karzai would come around on the security deal , especially as its approval is a prerequisite for the flow of billions of dollars in promised western aid to afghanistan , were now saying they were no longer sure what would happen only he knows what is in his head , said one senior afghan security official two afghan defense officials said that was precisely the aim of those pushing for the prisoner releases they linked mr dadras to mr karzai s powerful chief of staff , abdul karim khurram , who is widely seen as pushing the afghan leader away from the united states that the releases could help scuttle the troop deal was the point , the officials said one of the main reasons that the president is releasing these prisoners is to pressure the foreigners , said gul padshah majidi , a lawmaker from paktia province , an eastern area that is thick with taliban fighters the problem with this strategy is that it will reach a point that things will get out of control
faced with growing concern over the spread of the ebola virus , public health officials on tuesday promised extra measures to screen airline passengers arriving into the united states but they remained opposed to more draconian travel restrictions that they say would cause more problems than they would solve among the measures under consideration by the , temperatures of atrisk passengers would be checked , or they might be subject to detailed questioning upon their arrival in the united states dr thomas r frieden , the agency s director , provided no specific details , a reminder of how easily the disease can travel and how difficult it is to detect so far , only one case of ebola has been diagnosed in the united states , but pressure is coming from some members of congress and from elsewhere for the administration to adopt a more forceful posture dr frieden said new measures would be announced in coming days but cautioned against measures that could backfire or prove ineffective in the long run we recognize that whatever we do , until the disease is controlled in africa , we ca n't get the risk to zero here , dr frieden said we may be able to reduce it and we 'll look at every opportunity to do that he added in medicine , one of our cardinal rules is above all do no harm if we do something that impedes our ability to stop the outbreak in west africa , it could spread further there , we could have more countries like liberia , and the challenge would be much greater and go on for a longer time a travel ban to the hardesthit countries guinea , liberia and sierra leone would make things worse since it would restrict the movement of international aid workers who are struggling to contain ebola , and would further cripple countries that are already having a difficult time coping , said dr barry r bloom , a specialist in infectious diseases and public health professor at harvard university given the fragmented and broken health care systems in these countries , controlling the disease means getting people from the outside to fly in and to come out again , dr bloom said a travel ban on those countries would probably be counterproductive it would take away the expertise that is needed the cdc has helped set up protocols in those three countries to screen passengers upon departure in the last two months , dr frieden said , local officials have screened more than 36 , 000 passengers of those , dr frieden said , about 77 registered a fever or other symptoms and were not allowed to travel at this point , he said , none of them were known to have been infected by ebola the last time that health officials tried to screen passengers , they met with mixed results , dr bloom said confronted with the sars epidemic in 2003 , some countries sought to screen passengers , but in the experience of australia , canada and singapore , these screenings failed to turn up a single sars case at least 14 ebola cases have been treated outside west africa in the current outbreak most of those involve health and aid workers who contracted the disease in west africa and were flown back to their home countries for medical treatment the virus has started to raise concerns among those who work on airlines on tuesday , union representatives of flight attendants and airport ground workers called for tougher screening in addition , the united states coast guard says it is planning to increase screening procedures for passengers aboard cargo ships coming into american ports from west africa two people outside west africa have been found to have the virus one is a liberian man who began showing symptoms four days after arriving in dallas and the other a spanish nurse who became ill after treating a missionary in a hospital in madrid but screening passengers at their point of departure has flaws since it relies on them to tell the truth in the one known ebola case in the united states , the man infected with the virus had lied about not having any contact with an ebola patient , the authorities said european countries face the same dilemma the health authorities in spain have quarantined three people and are monitoring dozens of others who came into contact with the nurse , the first known case of the disease in europe in britain , the health authorities have said there is a real risk that the virus will be imported but have acknowledged that they have no plan to screen visitors entering the country for ebola more than 7 , 400 people in guinea , liberia , nigeria , senegal and sierra leone have contracted ebola since march , according to the world health organization , making this the biggest outbreak on record more than 3 , 400 have died so far while public officials try to contain the outbreak , they also must deal with a public confidence crisis increasing controls at the border may not be entirely effective in preventing ebola from spreading , but it might calm public fears about the disease putting another screening filter on our soil makes a certain amount of sense in building public confidence and public fear and confidence is the major driver of this , said j stephen morrison , director of the global health policy center at the center for strategic and international studies still , he added there is no foolproof solution they are not going to eliminate the risk mr morrison said the administration could tighten visa requirements from some countries , something that has not been addressed publicly yet we have to assume that in the next several months there will be a mushrooming of cases and that will increase pressure on europe and the united states since the exportation of cases will be linked to the mushrooming of the epidemic itself , mr morrison said we are only at the front end of dealing with this
if the chesapeake bay is america s estuary , then its largest tributary , the susquehanna river , could arguably be called america s river but we certainly do n't treat it as a national treasure this once magnificent watercourse , which runs through new york , pennsylvania and maryland toward the coast , is today an ecological disaster largely thanks to four dams , built along its lower reaches between 1904 and 1931 an impending license renewal by the federal energy regulatory commission for two of these dams will lock in another halfcentury of measures woefully inadequate to remediating the dams' environmental consequences instead , all four should be removed the susquehanna s 27 , 000squaremile watershed was once home to remarkable runs of migratory fishes and none more so than the american shad , a type of herring in 1827 , one net hauled in was said to have contained an astounding 15 million shad and river herring a commercial fishing operation on the river stationed a sentry on a hillside to watch for the moving bulge in the waters that signaled another huge school approaching shad were such a mainstay of regional diets that traveling fishmongers would blow horns and shout shado to announce the availability of this delicacy despite efforts to create ladders and elevators for fish to travel past them , the dams have devastated shad migrations the official goal remains the passage of two million shad beyond the fourth dam so they can reach suitable spawning grounds a modest target , given the original run sizes in 2014 , exactly eight shad made it past the fourth dam that s an improvement over 2011 , when none did this is n't an isolated occurrence ladders and elevators along other atlantic coast rivers have failed as well , and as badly for shad and other migratory species but the fourstep obstacle course on the susquehanna is especially harmful , cumulatively confounding and slowing the migrations , so that very little reproduction actually occurs nevertheless , the federal government is doubling down on these failed approaches , with a new plan that makes at best minor changes to the existing , futile array of fishpassage devices the destruction of enormous fish migrations is bad enough but it gets worse because the sprawling susquehanna drainage is unusually sedimentladen , the reservoirs behind each dam have been filling with voluminous quantities of sand and muck three of them have reached their sedimentholding capacity and the fourth , the conowingo reservoir , is quickly approaching it if nothing is done soon , the sediment will no longer be trapped and will travel past the dams into the chesapeake bay this would mean ecological devastation for the bay , which is already overenriched and would choke on the nutrientpacked sediment suddenly thrust on it the only other answer is expensive , continuing dredging and blind hope against an erosive storm or hurricane that would overload the dams and release the sediment with all this in mind , policy makers need to take the only responsible step and remove the dams true , they produce valuable electricity that would be tough to replace but there are alternatives by our calculations , a solar park built on the drained floor of the empty conowingo reservoir could allow the river to run beside it and replace the 575 megawatts the dam generates and lowhead hydropower arrays devices that pull energy from the river without impeding it could add even more it s hard to look at something as large as a dam and not think of it as a permanent part of the landscape but that s an illusion eventually the dams will deteriorate , and will someday have to be removed for safety reasons indeed , across the country people are starting to reckon with the environmental costs of large hydropower dams , and several have been removed already in 1999 , the federal government allowed the removal of the edwards dam on maine s kennebec river , a precedentsetting action that brought much of the river back to life removing the four lowermost dams on the susquehanna and the sediments behind them would be a huge and expensive undertaking but one that we think is critical to restoring one of our most compromised rivers oliver wendell holmes jr once wrote that a river is more than an amenity , it is a treasure the susquehanna has been little more than an amenity for far too long
washington in a longawaited decision about that was more confusing than clarifying , the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia on monday of a detainee at , cuba the question presented by the case , which involves a yemeni named ali albahlul , is whether it was legitimate to prosecute him for conspiracy before a commission even though that charge is not an international war crime if it was not valid , then he could be charged only in a civilian court an option congress has banned the case has broad ramifications the five highlevel suspects being prosecuted for aiding the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks have also been charged with conspiracy , among other things and several dozen lowerlevel detainees who are not linked to any specific attack may be eligible for a trial only on conspiracy charges but on tuesday , the court sidestepped many of the larger questions , ensuring that legal uncertainty would remain for at least another year over the charge of conspiracy in the war crimes tribunals by deciding the case the way it did , the majority disposes of this case without providing the government clear guidance for prosecuting the remaining detainees at guant namo and raises the prospect that it might be many years before the government receives a definitive answer , wrote judge janice rogers brown , criticizing her colleagues the full court reinstated the conspiracy charge against mr bahlul , which a threejudge panel vacated last year but the full court did so in a narrow way that did not establish any clear principle applicable to other detainees it also remanded mr bahlul s case to the same threejudge panel to hear other arguments against the conspiracy charge , leaving open the possibility that he might get his case vacated again for other reasons adam thurschwell , the general counsel for the office that oversees tribunal defense lawyers , said the defense team was still studying whether to appeal monday s ruling to the supreme court or wait for the threejudge panel to address other arguments the court really did n't decide the issue that everyone thought they were going to decide , mr thurschwell said it was pretty clear that the court was squirming in an effort not to have to decide this issue , and they managed to succeed mr bahlul has admitted that he made a propaganda video for about the 2000 bombing of the american destroyer cole in yemen , helped administer loyalty oaths to several of the 9 11 hijackers , made martyrdom wills for them and helped listen to a news broadcast during the attacks but he pleaded not guilty , barred his lawyers from making arguments and boycotted the trial a military commission convicted him of conspiracy as well as material support and solicitation of terrorism none of the three offenses are international war crimes , and on monday the full appeals court said the material support and solicitation convictions should be vacated its reasoning was that there was no tradition of prosecuting those charges in tribunals , so they were barred by the constitution s ban on declaring actions to be criminal after the fact the obama administration had argued that there was some tradition of prosecuting conspiracy in military commissions in the united states , including during the civil war and world war ii the court found that to be a murkier question because mr bahlul had not raised his legal challenge at trial , the court majority ruled , he faced a high bar in overturning his convictions the material support and solicitation charges cleared it , but conspiracy was more ambiguous and fell short the court s logic did not resolve whether other detainees who challenged the charge s legitimacy at the trial , and so faced a lower bar , would prevail all seven judges agreed that mr bahlul s convictions for material support and solicitation should be vacated , but they differed on conspiracy the majority opinion was written by judge karen lecraft henderson and joined by chief judge merrick b garland and judges david s tatel and thomas b griffith judge brown and judge brett m kavanaugh wanted to reinstate the conspiracy conviction on broader grounds , while judge judith w rogers wanted to keep it vacated
bamian , afghanistan they were the picturepostcard view of a rural and mostly untouched afghanistan ancient , towering buddhas that became a symbol of the taliban s religious fanaticism and intolerance now , about 13 years after the bamian buddhas were blasted into rubble , the world faces a new quandary whether to leave the gaping gashes in the cliff where the giant statues once stood , to rebuild the buddhas from what pieces were left , or to make copies of them and , as so often happens these days between afghanistan and its mainly western supporters , opinion is passionately split the major donor countries that would have to finance any restoration say the site should be left as it is , at least for now the afghan government wants at least one of the statues rebuilt at the heart of the conflict is a potent mix of political ideology , and an evolving theory of restoration policy usually relegated to heady debates among archaeologists the afghan government craves the symbolic victory over a stillthreatening taliban that rebuilding would allow it to claim many of those funding the restoration fear that rebuilding when so little of the original pieces remain would not be reconstruction at all , and more reproduction than a true accounting of history the debate has roiled unesco and many of its donors , which years ago appointed an that has been meeting annually for a decade on the fate of the site , and that so far has been able to agree only to preserve the niches where the statues stood and stabilize them against further damage for the moment , the preservationists have the upper hand the bamian buddhas and other ancient parts of the area have been declared a unesco world heritage site , and any modifications to the face of the bamian cliff would , in practice , have to be approved by the working group but their ruling has not gone unchallenged last year , german conservators doing stabilization work on the eastern niche quietly began building pillars to support the stone work and protect visitors from potential collapse the pillars , however , looked strikingly like giant feet similar , in fact , to those that indian conservators built to replace the missing originals in the 1970s michael petzet , an archaeologist who is the president of the german branch of the , which has done much of the conservation work on contract for unesco , makes no secret of his intent these feet , it was only the idea for the safety of the whole structure , professor petzet said , and maybe in the future if the afghan government wants to make a little bit more , they can build upon this when unesco discovered what was happening , it immediately asked the afghan government to order the work suspended , a decision seconded during heated debate in last december s meeting of the expert working group our priority has been to stabilize iconic elements of the world heritage site that are unstable , said brendan cassar of unesco to make a good restoration when you have n't addressed steps 1 to 9 is misplaced the western niche remains in danger of collapse , he said , with rocks and stones falling regularly , partly a legacy of the high explosives the taliban set to destroy the monuments pledges from donors to fund even that basic work have fallen short by at least 700 , 000 , mr cassar said unesco s position is that restoration is a case of putting the cart before the horse , he said we need to save all options for future generations professor petzet argues that rebuilding the buddhas would be no different from past efforts to reassemble parts of the roman forum another project criticized by some archaeologists or repair damaged mosaics after the earthquake in assisi , italy it s something human to want to do , he said in france , whole cathedrals were reconstructed in gothic style after they were blown up by protestants in the 1600s he said , i 've talked with many afghans , and they do not want that their children and grandchildren are forced by the taliban to see only ruins people who knew little else about afghanistan knew that there was something amazing in this high mountain province , where the ancient silk road crossed the hindu kush , and where a sprawling buddhist monastic complex flourished in the sixth century the monks sculpted cliffs hundreds of feet high , flattening their faces in order to build a network of monastic and ceremonial chambers within , with more than 1 , 000 of them in the area of the destroyed buddhas the larger standing buddha was 174 feet high the world s tallest and taller than the statue of liberty the smaller one still towered at 115 feet connecting the caves and the niches where the buddhas stood was a network of tunnels , staircases and passageways hollowed out of solid rock , much of which remains intact the taliban were not the first muslim visitors to savage the monuments islam forbids any form of idols , and successive conquerors turned their artillery on the niches by the 20th century the buddhas were heavily damaged and both were missing their wooden faces , said to have once had jeweled eyes with huge lanterns burning behind them at night during the war against soviet occupation , mujahedeen commanders obliterated a sitting buddha in the cliff with heavy artillery and looted many of the caves domed ceilings in some caves were desecrated the fighters built scaffolding that allowed them to leave their muddy footprints on the ceiling , a move highly offensive to buddhists the taliban , however , brought a more systematic destruction to the approximately 1 , 500yearold statues , planting high explosives throughout the niches in 2001 , reducing the remaining statues to rubble and leaving the niches and many passageways unstable professor petzet maintains that his conservators have managed to preserve , identify and catalog as much as 30 percent of the surface of the smaller standing buddha , enough , he says , to restore it persuasively but unesco says other experts are not so sure of that figure , putting the amount of material recovered at about 10 percent the point is , a very small percentage of the surface remains , mr cassar said some pieces are the size of a car and some a grain of sand in addition , the type of sandstone from which the buddhas were carved is highly unstable it s a disaster that can never be put back together , he said abdul ahad abassi , head of monuments for the afghan culture ministry , said the government formally requested that the smaller buddha be rebuilt , and unesco s world heritage committee is studying the issue in 10 years , the expert working group has come to no final decision , said muhammad asir mubaligh , the bamian deputy governor i know they have achieved some small things , but 10 years \? the main problem is there has n't been a donor country to say , we will pay for it' south korea recently announced a 54 million grant for the site , but it is earmarked to build a museum dedicated to bamian s ancient culture and to train afghan staff rival japanese and italian proposals call for other museum and conservation projects in bamian none of the proposals include money for rebuilding the buddhas i say rebuild one of them to attract tourists , and one should remain like that to remind people what the taliban did , said abdullah mahmoodi of the bamian tourism association the best way to protect our monuments is to make them valuable again
kemp , tex the life of an allterrain vehicle racer is a peripatetic one , big on lowbudget adventures but small when it comes to paychecks the best racers in the nation were here in october for the atv pro challenge in memory of caleb moore , which offered 30 , 000 in total prize money , a record for the sport as on most weekends on the atv tour , however , it meant that competitors shared recreational vehicles and campers as well as fuel pumps and any other part that failed caleb moore showed up on this circuit as a teenager he had a hollywood smile , an easy manner and a world of racing talent he hooked up with a team based in georgia and competed throughout the south he 'd show up by himself in a beatup truck after driving all night , said the team s owner , jorge cuartas and he 'd tear it up at races then we 'd share a room and do what s called bench racing , reliving the day s races it s all we could afford but what moore liked to do more than anything else was make his machine fly he had more than nerve he possessed the discipline to break down and think through tricks i 'd watch him work through a routine , and sometimes , it looked like nothing was happening , cuartas said he 'd let go of a hand here and do twist there subtle stuff just to get a feel but then a few hours or a few days later , he would look like an artist soaring up there he was wired different than most people never far behind him was his younger brother , colten their mother , michele moore , has a photograph of them as little boys turning flips on a trampoline , one mirroring the other down to the lighthouse smiles i can pretty much say he taught me everything i know , colten moore said when we raced together , he pushed me to go faster and made me jump jumps that i would n't have done even if i could n't do it , he would push me until i could michele moore and her husband , wade , were not wild about the boys' burgeoning passion for freestyle , the practice of hurtling machines off a ramp wade moore did n't mind the racing or the thousands of dollars to keep them on the road then they started doing this trick stuff , at the track over big jumps , moore said , and they started asking about it , and i kept saying no , no you ai n't doing it' finally , however , he gave in soon , his sons were barnstorming throughout the southwest and mexico early on , caleb was booked into a show in montreal by promising that he could do a back flip he had never tried one and had just four weeks to learn the brothers drove to michigan , where a friend had a ramp and a foam pit it took a couple of weeks , but caleb called home one day and told his father that he had perfected the back flip wade moore , however , wanted to see for himself and met his sons in montreal i pulled his younger brother to the side because i'm freaking out , he said i got into his face and i'm like tell me ! does he have it \? colten assured him caleb did when wade moore saw caleb loop through the air , he was stunned it was the most exciting moment of my life , wade moore said , and the most stressful , heartpounding moment of my life the idea for the x games was born at the magazine rack of a barnes noble in west hartford , conn it was 1993 , and ron semiao , a television programmer , was looking for filler content for what was about to become espn2 skateboarding , surfing , snowboarding there were plenty of magazines stuffed with ads and dedicated to the newest entries into what marketers call lifestyle sports but there was no sports illustrated or horizontal magazine for all of them , said semiao , who retired from espn last year and is now working on programming for nfl network semiao took the magazines home and started making calls he talked to the young people hustling around the espn campus in bristol , conn he quizzed the children of friends he came to the realization that young people held tony hawk in the same esteem as they did michael jordan he learned that each of these sports had its own culture sick and rad were good , and there was a huge market for board shorts and other distinctive attire he proposed a show with an olympicstyle format that espn would own and operate these sports had a very unique relevance to contemporary youth , semiao said the best i can compare it to is when i was kid and people said rock 'n' roll was n't real music and the guys playing it were n't real musicians but somebody was buying a lot of their records so in 1995 , the extreme games , as they were known in their inaugural edition , were held in providence and newport , ri , with events like bungee jumping and kite skiing two years later , the winter x games made their debut in big bear lake , calif , and the franchise was on its way to becoming a unique property in sports broadcasting it attracts bluechip advertisers and captures the eyeballs of freespending young men more than 38 million people watched some part of the winter x games last year , up 9 percent from the previous year , and the primetime viewing numbers across espn and abc for its core audience , men ages 18 to 34 , were up 14 percent from 2012 last year , 114 , 500 people attended the games in aspen , colo , the highest number in their history the x games helped increase the sales of energy drinks , sports equipment and apparel surfers , skateboarders and snowboarders spend more than 18 billion annually , according to boardtrac , a market research company that monitors the buying habits of action sports enthusiasts snowmobilers in north america spend more than 28 billion annually on equipment , clothing and accessories , according to the international snowmobile manufacturers association the success of the x games has changed the face of the winter olympics as well no x games disciplines were part of the 1994 games in lillehammer , norway next month at the sochi games in russia , with the addition of freestyle skiing , there will be six for both men and women the cachet more than the cash that the event has bestowed on action sports stars has allowed espn to fend off calls for higher purses from some competitors and to subdue criticism that by promoting and televising deathdefying stunts , the network is profiting from the broken bones and debilitating injuries of others the total prize money awarded will be 1 million , up from 961 , 000 in 2010 the x games' financial reach is perhaps best illustrated by the stars and the sports that the x games have helped usher into the mainstream before shaun white was a celebrity and a centerpiece of nbc s olympic coverage , x games devotees watched him grow up on espn he won his first x games medal in 2002 and is among the most bankable athletes in the world white graces magazine covers and recently bought a 9 million beachfront house in malibu beyond creating fresh stars , the x games has capitalized on the fear factor that rides shotgun alongside the gravitydefying stunts of skateboarders and snowboarders as well as motocross and snowmobile drivers in 2007 , the mega ramp 62 feet tall and 293 feet long was unveiled for skateboarders in the summer x games it was met with awe as well as shudders after jake brown fell five stories and was knocked unconscious in 2009 , after winning x games gold , jeremy lusk , a freestyle motocross star , crashed on a jump in costa rica , sustaining a fatal head injury on new year s eve 2009 in utah , kevin pearce struck his head on the halfpipe and was , ending not only his 2010 olympic hopes but also his snowboarding career two years later , the canadian freestyle skier sarah burke took a nasty fall on the same pipe ten days later ,  last year s winter x games in aspen , however , not only were harrowing for extreme athletes but also cast their pursuits in the most unflattering light at least six athletes left the mountain in ambulances , including a freestyle skier with a broken back and a snowboarder who flew off the edge of the halfpipe the freestyle snowmobiling competition began with eight participants and ended with four , including the winner , levi lavallee i know my sport is dangerous , said lavallee , who captured his sixth x games gold medal after missing the previous two years because of a broken pelvis and leg sustained in training jumps , but it was clear there were some things that needed to be addressed to make it safer or we were n't going to be part of the x games as a sport the winter x games in aspen this week will include a snowmobile freestyle competition , but one that espn officials say will be significantly safer among the changes are required body armor and helmet padding , and springloaded skis to prevent the tips from sticking in the snow the reality with all these events is that we continually evaluate safety , said scott guglielmino , espn s senior vice president for programming and the x games we work with safety experts , course designers and our athletes to try to mitigate as much risk as we can risk is prevalent , but these are worldclass athletes , and if the x games did n't exist , they 'd still be competing somewhere and participating in something they love virtually all of the athletes seem grateful that the x games legitimized pursuits once banished to the backcountry of minnesota and the dirt tracks of california lavallee said that without them , he would be a weekend snowmobile racing warrior , struggling to afford going from race to race instead , he coowns a snocross team that employs three other riders and more than a dozen people he has built a training compound at his home in longville , minn , with a stateoftheart ramp and foam pit to practice tricks like a double back flip that he has yet to land in competition among his sponsors is red bull , the energy drink company that has become synonymous with action sports red bull supports more than 600 worldclass athletes in 160 disciplines globally , including motorsports , aerial sports , parkour , fixedgear cycling and professional video gaming in 2012 , more than 52 billion cans of red bull were sold for nearly 7 billion in revenue patrice radden , a company spokeswoman , said , for a brand that stands for vitalizing body and mind and is closely associated with an active lifestyle , sports has been a natural fit from the beginning for lavallee , numerous concussions , three cracked vertebrae , broken ribs and tibia , and collapsed lungs have been the cost of doing business he will miss the snowmobile freestyle after aggravating a lateral muscle tear he sustained last year at the x games , but lavallee will compete in the snocross and the long jump at 31 , he also recognizes it is harder for him to bounce back from injuries i 've not only had a career , but i got a future because of the sled , he said with my team , i have a business to walk into when i'm finished i wo n't have to go find a job by 2009 , the moores could do almost any stunt atop an atv and could reach dizzying heights wade moore had built his sons a ramp and foam pit outside the family home in krum , tex but caleb and colten were still living show to show and hardly felt like pros they needed to go where the money was and discovered where that was while watching the 2009 winter x games y'all can do that , wade moore said to his sons during the snowmobile freestyle competition they were doing complicated tricks on their atvs why could n't they translate them to a snowmobile \? by december , they talked polaris into sending a couple of sleds to them in texas mechanically , caleb was the more accomplished tinkerer of the brothers and outfitted the machines with shock absorbers and fiveinch wheels they tried them in their foam pit and found the sleds far easier to flip than their quads the moores shot a video of the tricks they could do in the air and sent them to joe duncan , who coordinates the sled competitions for the x games then they went back to michigan , this time to learn how to actually ride in the snow less than 30 days later , they were competing in the 2010 x games two texans crashing the snowmobile competition after a couple of days in snow made for good television , but it did not endear them to the competition lavallee had grown up riding his sled to school , storing his helmet and snow suit in the principal s office until dismissal he also had to compete in qualifying before being accepted into the field of the 2008 x games the moore brothers , indeed , looked shaky trying to control their sleds , and espn s broadcasters made sure viewers knew that caleb and colten were new to the sport but each held his own in the competition , with caleb earning the bronze medal in freestyle the next year , however , when the moores returned to the x games , they were clearly comfortable astride snowmobiles this time , caleb took the bronze in freestyle and the silver in best trick , but an impromptu stunt initiated by colten elevated the brothers to crowd pleasers as well as snowmobilers he called caleb to his sled , put him in the driver s seat and hopped on the back , and they zoomed toward the ramp in tandem , they did a back flip with colten adding a handstand off the back for emphasis they landed softly as a sustained ovation erupted , and the video of the two looping through the air as one has become a signature highlight for the winter x games last year in aspen , on the opening day of the games , the brothers conceded that that single unscripted moment had eclipsed everything either of them had accomplished on a sled even the gold medal that colten earned in freestyle at the 2012 winter x games colten said , if anyone comes up to me , it s always dude , that flip where you both got on \? that was awesome ! ' this was their fourth x games , and the moores were no longer curiosities from texas but favorites to win their travels were no longer confined to the back roads of the south and the southwest they had been from france to sweden , and russia to australia they had bought a house together in north texas and had money in the bank they were in such high demand that they hired a publicist , and they intended to bounce out of aspen with a medal haul and an even stronger bottom line later that night , caleb was up first their parents and a couple of dozen friends and relatives were on the mountain when he underrotated on a back flip and caught the skis on the front of his snowmobile on the top of a landing ramp , vaulting him facedown into the snow the sled , weighing nearly 500 pounds , bounced on top of him and knocked him unconscious wade moore was at caleb s side when he came to , and he told his father he felt as if he had just awakened from a long dream wade walked caleb to the medical tent with what was initially called a concussion michele moore accompanied him to aspen valley hospital thirty minutes later on the same ramp , colten , too , missed his mark and was catapulted off his snowmobile he was strapped onto a gurney and taken by ambulance to  colten , with a separated pelvis , was released the next day caleb , however , was in trouble and had been flown to a hospital in grand junction , colo he never really regained consciousness one week later , caleb moore he was 25 eight months later in kemp , tex , the moores made camp in a muddy parking lot the women heading in and out of the rv as the men stood around the openwheel racers on their trailers , interrupting their chatter to hand a wrench to the soul beneath the greasy engine before them , dirt was groomed into mounds and switchbacks that sent fourwheel motorcycles arcing into the sky colten , 24 , was going to give a freestyle demonstration on his atv thousands gathered here at a memorial for caleb moore , a race organized by riders he grew up competing against on dirt tracks hollowed out of woods throughout the south it was as much a rally as a fundraiser , a bittersweet celebration of one of their own who had the scaled the heights of action sports only to become the first fatality in the x games the mountain dew girls streaked past in black tank tops and matching miniskirts , and cowboy boots that were no match for a damp , windy lone star afternoon no , this was a day for hoodies and hunting jackets and a thermal coosie around a can of beer , something almost everyone was gripping zz top blasted from the sound system , but even those longbearded guitar gods could n't compete with the highpitched rumble of the atvs that lurched through the parking lot on their way to the racetrack there were no uggs or furtrimmed coats in sight no network television cameras or onair talent no mountainside chalets filled with swag bags brimming with red bull and playstations and oakley sunglasses two boys about 12 , in oversize helmets and nodding like bobblehead dolls , bounced their miniatvs between cars it looked as if all that horsepower might buck them off at any moment wade moore smiled and recalled that not so long ago , his boys , caleb and colten , were just as overmatched on the same noisy contraptions it took me 10 years to pay for the first year of riding , he said espn pulled the freestyle snowmobile demonstration from the winter x games in tignes , france , after moore s death in march , it discontinued the best trick competitions in both snowmobiling and motocross , which had become mustsee viewing for their gravitydefying derringdo the network also abandoned its international versions of the x games they were not making enough money to continue them in cities like barcelona , spain munich and foz do igua u , brazil espn officials conceded that they had overreached and were losing money we produce x games because it reaches an important young audience , and we are prepared to continue to invest in it , guglielmino said among the calamities that plagued the snowmobile competition in aspen last year was the runaway sled that rocketed toward spectators , injuring a boy it belonged to jackson strong , an australian motorcycle rider with medals from the summer x games , who had spent only four hours on a snowmobile before the competition , according to the espn telecast guglielmino said that jackson had spent more time than that preparing for the snowmobile competition and that the information should have been shared with the production team by the competition organizers strong is a worldclass motocross rider with a transferable skill set to the snowmobile , guglielmino said he was qualified for the event strong , however , is not competing this year , nor are there any other crossover athletes in the competition lavallee , who was part of the athletes' advisory council , said he and his fellow competitors had urged organizers to make sure participants had spent plenty of time on a snowmobile no law enforcement agency investigated caleb moore s death , and the family is not suing espn each competitor must sign a waiver before taking part in the x games none of this was new to us , wade moore said we all knew what could happen he said there also was little doubt that colten would continue riding within months of his brother s death , colten was back on a national tour with the nuclear cowboyz , a sort of dirt bike and atv arena opera he also circled the globe as part of travis pastrana s nitro circus live , the action sports collective featuring pastrana and his friends doing aerial stunts on every machine imaginable it makes me feel closer to my brother , colten told his father the moores are expecting a crowd to watch colten compete in aspen in years past , they have treated the x games as a celebration of their boys that has drawn three generations of friends and relatives , and many atv enthusiasts from texas they are going to celebrate the boys again or at least try it is going to be tough this is what he wants to do , wade moore said of colten i'm not going to be the one to tell him he ca n't do it
we 're a week into chris christie bridgegate and i'm already bored , not because i do n't think the truth should be ferreted out in the bright light of day , but because the political discussion about it appears to be devolving into pettiness we are reaching that point in politics that we all too often reach where disgust becomes delight this is when political accountability veers into political blood sport , where partisans lick their chops at the idea of an opponent s demise it becomes unseemly and trivial and reeks of fear surely , there was something rotten in trenton , and chris christie either participated in it , created the environment in which it could fester or was such a poor manager that he was completely oblivious to it none of those scenarios bode well for him in his current job or if he aspires to higher office but right now , this is an issue primarily for the people of new jersey they are the ones who got caught up in smallbore political retributions that caused a largescale headache , and shows christie maintaining much of his homestate support what the scandal portends for the rest of us is strictly about 2016 and the fact that christie is or at least , was seen as a promising republican candidate for the presidency there are two kinds of presidential elections change elections and continuity elections for many of those who see 2016 as a change election , finding an antiobama may seem quite appealing , and christie fits that bill in style and tone whereas obama feels polished and professorial , christie is brash and blunt to my taste , christie s bullying disposition is utterly inconsistent with the dignity of the presidency , but i am only one vote some people see charm in his crassness that scares others who wish for a continuity election but it need not first , let s allow the inquiries into what went wrong in bridgegate play themselves out before we condemn there is now enough investigative firepower both journalistic and legislative looking into what happened that the truth is sure to surface if everything that chris christie said in his interminable news conference stands up to scrutiny , and anyone else found to be involved is fired , christie is likely to survive this scandal , and might possibly emerge from it stronger for having stared down the glare of national inspection and survived however , if that turns out not to be the case , his goose is cooked either way , the focus on the scandal has taken too much of the focus off the meat of the matter that for many progressives , this must be a continuity election chris christie and candidates like him should frighten progressives not because some deem him charming but because he s a shifter he has built a reputation on being a straightshooter , but he has a track record as a needlethreader there are some issues on which one could argue that christie is a moderate , but on others he s unsettlingly ambiguous , vacillating between extremes for instance , he used to favor abortion rights , now he s antiabortion he believes in exceptions for rape , incest and the life of the mother , but also supports parental notification and a 24hour waiting period and , although he does n't believe that homosexuality is a sin and believes people are born with the predisposition to be homosexual , he does n't support samesex marriage in fact , christie vetoed a samesex marriage bill in the state in 2012 last year a judge ruled that the state must allow samesex marriages as for immigration , of the starledger put it in december if gov chris christie thinks voters wo n't notice if he promises one thing when he s running for governor , then another when he s running for president , he s dreaming yet that s what he appears to be doing when it comes to the dream act when the governor was seeking the latino vote weeks ago , he assured advocates he 'd support new jersey s version of this bill but now that he s been reelected with 51 percent of the hispanic vote , christie told a radio station last week that he would not sign the dream act , which passed the state senate and is expected to be taken up soon by the assembly , for reasons that make no sense we 've been to this flipflop republican sock hop before in 2012 with mitt romney and we do n't need a repeat instead of rooting for a bridge to drag christie under , progressives must focus without deviation on the issues that cry out for continuity in 2016 we are moving toward more equality for all income inequality has taken a proper place of prominence we are working to fix a broken health care system we extricated ourselves from senseless wars rather than rushing headlong into them i find the proprogressive argument more exciting than the antichristie one

' in the middle of town , people come running to the beach , not away from it the other day , beachgoers here saw what they believed to be a great white snare a seal , the two animals thrashing around as the water turned redder a father in the group told the cape cod chronicle that his children were not frightened by the scene but rather were jumping up and down with excitement one of the people most responsible for the shift in perception is greg skomal , a state marine biologist and shark specialist he has led efforts to tag and track the behemoths for decades in new england and conveys his enthusiasm in wellattended lectures to vacationers up and down the cape the white shark is the holy grail of species it s an iconic , charismatic shark that everybody wants to see , dr skomal told about 50 people in truro last week during a breezy talk titled white sharks i have known , loved and learned from it included eyepopping slides and video of great whites with names like gretel \( because she was lost \) and large marge dr skomal says that great whites are not interested in human fodder people are not as blubbery as a seal or the carcass of a whale , which is their top menu choice a great white in 2012 took what dr skomal called a test bite out of a tourist from denver who had been swimming near seals in truro , but it swam away after the man kicked it it was the first great white attack on a human in massachusetts in 76 years since 1837 , massachusetts has had only three shark attacks and one fatality , in 1936 , according to the by contrast , in that same time , florida has had 687 confirmed unprovoked shark attacks and 11 fatalities , most recently in 2010 the creatures may have long lurked in new england waters but they are closer to shore now because their chief food source , the gray seal , has returned in abundance the seals were nearly wiped out decades ago by fishermen , who killed them because they snatched their fish the marine mammal protection act of 1972 ended the slaughter of seals , and the population has exploded , setting up an allyoucaneat buffet for hungry great whites do n't be afraid of these animals just because every now and then they bite someone , dr skomal said they 're important members of the ecosystem and we need to have them here mike meserve , a retiree visiting from washington , said his takeaway from dr skomal s lecture was this the sense of menace from the jaws' effect has worn off almost completely the reality is , there s no real reason to be afraid but when dr skomal began tagging great whites near here in 2009 , many were nervous it was like , how do we pull this together so we do n't scare everyone \? said sandy wycoff , owner of the chatham clothing bar , which features some shark apparel we do n't want to be amity slowly , the question resolved itself the sightings increased taggings increased tourists started asking where they could see the great whites and , eventually , businesses started catering to the interest the merchants are capitalizing on the fact that the sharks are here and people come , and this is what they 're looking for , said lisa franz , executive director of the chatham chamber of commerce the demand is there , so basically the town is supplying it some vacationers think the town took the bait , in the words of ryan brigden , 17 , who was swimming off lighthouse beach the other day with an uncle , chris conway maybe it was a calculated move by the town and the press to make it exciting here , said mr conway embracing the sharks was genius , he said , but all that would change with a fatality there will be one , he predicted the tourist economy was already flourishing in chatham , where the winter population of 6 , 600 soars in the summer to 30 , 000 , even before the attraction of the sharks but this could have gone in a whole other direction , and the economy could have suffered if people were afraid , said jennifer allard , marketing manager for the chatham bars inn , an upscale resort hotel not only are people still coming , but they 're still going on kayak tours , seal tours and boating excursions and still swimming in the ocean , she said what they are not doing is signing up for the 5 , 000 sharkwatch excursions that the inn offered last year with spotter planes instead , the inn is offering a 50 boat ride out to a buoy with marianne long , a recreation manager at the inn and a volunteer for the new shark conservancy , who talks enthusiastically about sharks as she checks a receiver to see if any tagged sharks have cruised by so far , none have
cincinnati here along the banks of the murky ohio river , where a generation has wallowed in the futility of the beloved , the paradigm has shifted respect is gained not by reaching the postseason but by winning there the fans know it , and so do the players , some of whom gathered in a tunnel at paul brown stadium 45 minutes before kickoff sunday and formed a circle members of a team that had won the afc north that had won all four of its games against playoff qualifiers , that had reached the postseason for a third consecutive year they jumped and yelled about respect , how they did not receive any but would sunday there is a finite length of time that a team can be considered on the rise before being branded disappointing or , worse , underachieving and with a 2710 loss to the upstart , the bengals edged closer to the brink although none of their players were present for the franchise s last playoff victory , 23 years ago monday , they sense how it weighs on the region s consciousness this city deserves better than that , defensive end wallace gilberry said our fans deserve better than this by this , gilberry could have been referring to the three secondhalf turnovers committed by andy dalton , who has thrown six interceptions while leading cincinnati to a combined 33 points in his three playoff games , or to the chargers' seasonhigh 196 rushing yards or to the bengals' general sloppiness in a stadium where they had not lost this season , having won their eight regularseason games there by an average of 176 points if any team merited respect after sunday , it was san diego , which won its fifth consecutive game the chargers moved on to an afc divisionalround matchup sunday afternoon at topseeded denver , where their improbable lateseason run gained traction with a victory dec 12 go ahead , write us off all you want , say all the negative things you want , said chargers linebacker donald butler , who forced a giovani bernard fumble at the san diego 4 toward the end of the first half even when we beat denver before , it was what denver did n't do , not what we did i think as a team we embrace it , and we 're just rolling with it san diego quarterback philip rivers characterized sunday s game as the fifth round , as in the fifth round of the playoffs in the chargers' minds , the playoffs started weeks ago every game presenting a daunting reality lose , and their season is over win , and maybe , just maybe maybe turned into wowitreallyhappened last sunday , when the chargers benefited from an unlikely sequence of results to grab the conference s final wildcard berth they won in overtime after kansas city missed on a late fieldgoal attempt , a moment that the chargers' defensive coordinator , john pagano , drew saturday night when addressing his charges it feels like almost destiny , he told them pagano s unit surrendered 439 yards , but it seemed like half that much san diego s pressure harassed dalton into making poor decisions and poorer throws , intercepting him on consecutive secondhalf drives we heard a lot all week that we did n't touch him , this and that , chargers safety eric weddle said , referring to the bengals' 1710 victory at san diego on dec 1 we knew the way we can play , and the way we 're playing right now is a lot different weddle , like many teammates , lauded the steadiness of mike mccoy , who on sunday did what other firstyear coaches andy reid of kansas city and chip kelly of philadelphia could not advance to the final eight mccoy , previously the broncos' offensive coordinator , presides over a team that established its bona fides with wins at philadelphia , kansas city and denver he also helped coax a brilliant season from rivers , who finished 12 of 16 passing for 128 yards and a touchdown sunday during this fivegame winning streak , he has completed 683 percent of his passes , with 10 touchdowns and two interceptions even if the chargers deployed an offense during the first half that rivers described as conservative he handed off the ball 18 times and attempted six passes he operated it with command he kept san diego close , with a 107 deficit at halftime , before eliminating all suspense with a marvelous opening series in the third quarter the chargers zipped 80 yards in 10 plays , a drive capped by rivers s fade pass to ladarius green for a 4yard touchdown after he audibled out of a run san diego proceeded to convert turnovers on cincinnati s next two possessions a fumble by dalton , who lost the ball when he slid headfirst , and an interception returned to the bengals' 3 into nick novak field goals , and ronnie brown added a 58yard touchdown scamper with 2 minutes 17 seconds left in the game by then , many of the fans had started filing for the exits , befuddled how a team that had toppled green bay , outlasted new england and crushed indianapolis and beaten these chargers , too could stumble in january yet again and this , after the bengals had won 11 games , in a season that was supposed to legitimize them , with their ornery defense , their array of playmakers and a quarterback who was perceived to be ascending marvin lewiscoached bengal teams are now 05 in the playoffs obviously , there is going to be a lot of criticism and talk , dalton said , but until you win and prove people wrong , people can say whatever they want so they will , and afterward , they did as a cold rain started pelting the turf in the second half , butler said , he turned to some of his teammates and asked them to stop and enjoy it playing in the rain , battering a favorite at its home field , silencing the crowd you ca n't get a better scenario than that , butler said , grinning except you can although the chargers will be cast as underdogs in denver , the eventual champion in each of the last three postseasons was seeded no higher than fourth for the next week , san diego should capture the nation s attention , with its quotable quarterback and its opportunistic defense seeking another shocking victory it might be cold there , defensive lineman corey liuget was told the super bowl s in new york , liuget said it s going to be cold wherever we go to play the chargers will at least have an opportunity to find out the bengals , after another promising season turned hollow , will not
new delhi on the heels of christie s successful auction in india , the sixth edition of the india art fair demonstrated that demand in the country s art market remains strong spread across three tents and 200 , 000 square feet , this year s fair , which ran from thursday to sunday , featured 91 booths and modern and contemporary works by over 1 , 000 artists from india and overseas participants included 12 new galleries from outside india , including those from israel , france , portugal , germany , spain , turkey and , notably , from karachi , pakistan the himalayas art museum in shanghai and the mark rothko museum in latvia both participated in the fair for the first time the fair s organizers said in a statement that a number of exhibitors sold out completely and that 96 percent of exhibitors reported good sales , but no figures on sales or attendance were released most of the indian gallery representatives who spoke to india ink said they were satisfied with their sales we didn t go in expecting very much , but we exceeded our expectations , said priya jhaveri , the director of jhaveri contemporary in mumbai , which participated in its very first art fair it was a positive experience for us because we were introducing artists who aren t known among the works she sold were those by rana begum , hamra abbas , alexander gorlizki , and yamini nayar none of the works , with the exception of the one by ms begum , exceeded 15 , 000 jhaveri contemporary s booth was placed near several other notable indian galleries , and these booths had some of the strongest contemporary works on display yet critics and observers rued the lack of consistency in the quality of some of the art at the fair , saying that although top tier galleries from india and some from overseas had stellar works , many middletier galleries had lackluster offerings in terms of art works and quality , the most interesting pieces were at some of the contemporary galleries , said mallika advani , a wellknown independent art consultant and former india representative at christie s although i normally deal more with the moderns than with the younger artists , i can t say there were too many works by the senior artists that i would recommend to collectors she said most of the artwork on display had been featured on other commercial platforms , including auctions and previous gallery shows there were gems to be found , however ms advani singled out the experimenter gallery of kolkata and gallery ske , based in bangalore and new delhi , which displayed the work of the mixedmedia artist avinash veeraraghavan , volte gallery of mumbai , which had a visually appealing bronze sculptural work by the british studio based upon , and atul dodiya s works at vadehra art gallery of new delhi despite criticism about the overall quality of the art , there was universal agreement that the fair acts as a creative catalyst and draws a diverse audience that includes a global community of curators , museums and collectors as well as locals who wouldn t normally have access to such a wide range of contemporary art it s an important national convening that didn t exist before , said melissa chiu , director of the asia society museum in new york ms jhaveri said although 90 percent of her buyers at the fair were those already known to her , she met many people who hadn t known that her gallery was in mumbai tushar jiwarajka , founder and director of volte , said he sold a few major works , but beyond that , he saw the fair as a great platform to showcase his gallery in the four years i have participated , we have sold to new collectors , he said mr jiwarajika s booth had works by the south african artist william kentridge , the britishindian artist anish kapoor , and indian contemporaries like sheba chhachhi , ranbir kaleka and nalini malani auxiliary events that take place outside the fair , including museum shows of modern and contemporary indian art , are almost as important as the fair itself the national gallery of modern art is currently showing two major exhibitions , one by the contemporary artist subodh gupta and one on the preindependence works by amrita shergil other highlights included a solo show of paintings by zarina hashmi , folding house , at gallery espace , msmalani s solo show , cassandra s gift , at vadehra art gallery and sudarshan shetty s show , every broken moment , piece by piece , at gallery ske the curated exhibitions like those by senior artists like nalini malani and zarina hashmi , that didn t happen before , that is in large measure due to the fair as a convenor , said ms chiu as a curator , it s a very good way of getting a sense of what s happening with indian artists today , both emerging and established neha kirpal , founder of the india art fair , wasn t fazed by the criticism about the quality of art this year an art world novice when she founded the fair six years ago , ms kirpal said that her goal was to make the market more democratic this is a domestic fair for a domestic audience , she said the art scene here is small and the preference is not to exclude galleries right away we could have made it very exclusive and have only the absolute best , in which case from india there would be 20 galleries that made that cut but that s precisely the problem the art world is inaccessible i am that public that was too intimidated to walk into a gallery as a young person growing up in india among the fair s 400 , 000 visitors over the past five years , she said , thousands of them had never before seen art in their livesfor such folks , works like the oil on canvas by henry singleton \( 17661839 \) titled the last effort and fall of tipu sultan , which was featured at the delhi art gallery booth , would have been an eye opener i am passionate about building something in this country for art and culture that did not exist before , she said we are at a different stage in its development cycle we are where london was maybe 50 years ago we are just about starting off gayatri rangachari shah is a freelance journalist she is available on twitter
new delhi two months before indians vote in national elections , a new poll suggests that india s dominant political party and family may suffer one of their worst defeats in the country s 67year history seventy percent of indians say they are dissatisfied with the way things are going in india today , according to a new pew research center survey and 63 percent of those polled said they would prefer that the opposition bharatiya janata party lead the next government , compared with just 19 percent who picked the governing indian national congress party , which is led by sonia gandhi and her son , rahul gandhi this poll affirms what most of us suspected , said shekhar gupta , editor in chief of the indian express , a daily newspaper published in mumbai but what it does n't tell us is who will lead the next government the pollsters interviewed 2 , 464 randomly selected adults between dec 7 and jan 12 in states and territories that are home to roughly 91 percent of the indian population the poll has a margin of sampling error of four percentage points perhaps the most important finding was the popularity of narendra modi , the official prime ministerial candidate of the bharatiya janata party , a hindu nationalist political organization pew found that 78 percent of those polled had a favorable view of mr modi , with just 16 percent holding an unfavorable view mr modi , chief minister of the western state of gujarat , is considered by many to be the in india s history he led the state when riots broke out in 2002 , costing the lives of more than 1 , 000 people , mostly muslims he has been linked with a secret police assassination squad but mr modi has softened his image in recent months , and the bharatiya janata party has undertaken an outreach to muslims , who make up about 14 percent of the country s population mr modi has presided over an economy in gujarat that is among the strongest in india , and he has promised to bring to the rest of the country his economic expertise and ability to build good roads still , mr modi s support in a national poll may not translate into his election as prime minister no single party has won a parliamentary majority since 1989 , and none is likely to do so this year , political analysts say whether modi becomes the next prime minister will come down to 10 to 20 seats in parliament , said hartosh singh bal , the political editor of caravan magazine indeed , three women from the crucial states of west bengal , uttar pradesh and tamil nadu lead political parties that may each earn enough seats to block mr modi from his goal and speculation is rife about how these three mamata banerjee , mayawati and jayalalithaa , the last two of whom go by one name will play their cards pankaj pachauri , a spokesman for prime minister manmohan singh , dismissed the pew results india is too big and complex a country for pollsters to predict anything by talking to 2 , 500 people , mr pachauri said nonetheless , there is widespread agreement that the gandhis , india s dominant political family for most of its history , will face a crushing defeat the governing coalition has been tarnished by repeated corruption scandals , and a slowing economy has added a sense of gloom
no living celebrities are portrayed in a disappointing exhibition of photographs by at the newyork historical society but lots of celebrated figures from the past are indirectly represented , from thomas jefferson and emily dickinson to eleanor roosevelt and robert smithson the exhibition finds ms leibovitz departing from the celebrity portraiture she s best known for in the spring of 2009 , she set out on a twoyear journey that took her to about two dozen historic sites in the united states and britain most of these were house museums dedicated to famous individuals , where she photographed the rooms they inhabited and objects they owned and used the hat ralph waldo emerson wore when he went out walking a white dress that dickinson wore annie oakley s silver riding boots animal bones collected by georgia o'keeffe ansel adams s darkroom some pictures are of places like niagara falls , gettysburg and yosemite national park organized for the by andy grundberg , an educator and former photography critic for the new york times , the exhibition has itself been on a twoyear pilgrimage new york will be the tour s eighth and last stop since its 2012 debut in washington the show s photographs have none of the impishly inventive spirit of ms leibovitz s celebrity pictures they 're well made but suffused by a suffocating , reverential mood while frequently atmospheric , the images are puzzlingly mute you have to refer to the brief descriptions in a free , eightpage brochure to grasp their significance that s where you learn that the old compass in one picture was used by the explorers lewis and clark and that the wellworn pair of white gloves in another image were in abraham lincoln s pocket the night he was shot in many cases , the written descriptions are more intriguing than the pictures an aerial view of virginia woolf s inkstained desktop is unremarkable by itself , but it s interesting to learn that she was not a neat housekeeper her husband , leonard woolf , recalled in his memoirs that her writing studio was not merely untidy but squalid the picture of a television on a gray metal shelf with a bullet hole in its screen \? elvis presley shot it sometime in the 1970s , and now it s stored at graceland , his home one of the most striking descriptions is of a nearly lifesize picture of a gown that the opera singer marian anderson wore when performing in 1939 , anderson , who was black , in washington to an audience of more than 75 , 000 people , and , via radio broadcast , to millions more listeners she sang there because she was not allowed to perform at her first choice , constitution hall , which had a whiteartistsonly policy of the exhibition s 82 photographs , that of anderson s gown is the only one pertaining to a person identified as other than white that in itself is n't unforgivable there s no reason ms leibovitz s or anyone s personal pantheon should reflect a predetermined demographic so why these people and not others \? the brochure s brief introduction explains , she chose the subjects simply because they meant something to her but the photographs by themselves give little sense of exactly what meaning any particular subject had for her the book accompanying the exhibition includes a firstperson narrative composed in collaboration with the writer sharon delano it s a breezy read , full of facts and entertaining anecdotes , but it does n't develop any thoughtprovoking insights some places ms leibovitz visited , like graceland , are n't mentioned at all in the text the exhibition title , pilgrimage , casts the project in a quasireligious light it prompts you to think of the places ms leibovitz visited , from jefferson s monticello to smithson s spiral jetty depicted in three aerial photographs as a series of shrines representing some sort of collective spiritual ethos from this perspective , things like the bed henry david thoreau slept on , the desk that louisa may alcott wrote little women on and the couch sigmund freud s analysands reclined on are relics of secular saints , objects magically imbued with transcendental vibes because they were touched by great men and women in fact , except for spiral jetty , the objects in these pictures tell you almost nothing about why the people they belonged to were special if anything , they do more the opposite they show the ways these individuals were typical of their times and places lincoln s top hat was not unlike top hats worn by other men of his day the muchused pastels in a wooden box in o'keeffe s studio are not different from pastels used by countless unknown artists why , then , should anyone care about such objects , much less about photographs of them \? responses to that question could be interesting , but ms leibovitz does n't ask or answer them she seems immune to more complicated ideas or theories about how to engage with and represent history as a photographer and an artist both the exhibition and the book trade on ms leibovitz s famous name , but the images they present could have been produced by just about any competent travelmagazine photographer they 're no fun at all
the american civil war was a conflict that sat astride two phases in military history it began with generals on both sides employing timeworn napoleonicera strategies and ended with horrific trench warfare and violence against civilian populations that foreshadowed world war i it was also a crucible in which new combat technologies were tested , among them ironclads , machine guns and submarines and while scientists had not yet fully grasped the germ theory of disease , it was also one of the first conflicts to see chemical and biological agents tested , and even used , as weapons disease was everywhere during the civil war by far , the biggest killer during the conflict were communicable illnesses caused by unsanitary conditions at camp and in the field as andrew m bell of the university of virginia has documented , early in the fighting military leaders on both sides of the war began to grasp the concept of disease vectors , as weapons union planners knew that among other things , the blockade against southern ports would exacerbate the spread of disease in the south by restricting access to food , clothing and medical supplies malaria was still rampant across the deep south , and quinine was in high demand before the war some parts of the south experienced shortages of quinine as early as the first summer of the war , and prices climbed each year thereafter , bell said southern civilians suffered most of all from the quinine shortage because the confederate government requisitioned whatever little bit made it through the blockade others sought to turn disease into an offensive weapon one southern planner proposed shipping clothing worn by yellow fever patients to union military units , hoping to cause an epidemic in 1862 , rr barrow , a southern farmer , suggested taking bodies of yellow fever victims , along with contaminated clothing , to new orleans , which was occupied by union forces there is no evidence that either plan was put in action in 1863 , dr luke blackburn , a southern sympathizer and later governor of kentucky , plotted to infect clothing with the smallpox virus and sell it to union troops in washington there may have been one union victim of the scheme , a lieutenant in the 17th vermont named charles w randall , who believed he became ill after purchasing some undergarments from a store later , the store was identified as a possible recipient of an infected clothing consignment another approach to biological warfare was the contamination of drinking water by retreating soldiers maj gen william t sherman reported that confederate troops retreating from vicksburg , va , had driven animals into ponds and then shot them in response , the union war department issued general orders no 100 , on april 24 , 1863 , stating the use of poison in any manner , be it to poison wells , or food , or arms , is wholly excluded from modern warfare the civil war also saw significant use of chemical weapons , at least in an incipient form union forces used variants of greek fire , essentially incendiary mixtures that were hard to extinguish and could , in some cases , float on water i classify greek fire as a chemical weapon because the formulations , when ignited , released large volumes of noxious fumes , and this was considered a useful collateral effect , said guy r hasegawa , a civil war researcher greek fire was used most notably during the sieges of vicksburg , miss , and charleston , sc longrange artillery shells were used as the delivery system for the incendiary compounds there were technical problems , such as the projectiles exploding too early or not at all , doing little damage the south also developed greek fire weapons , but how extensively they were used in the field is unclear confederates had their own ideas about chemical warfare , though none were actually employed in one case , a commando team was given chloroform for a planned raid on the monitor ironclad , which they would use to overwhelm sleeping sailors , but the raid never took place the south tested a shell laden with a chemical agent that would release intense noxious gases , to be fired into union positions the confederates also developed another fumeproducing device to be fired into tunnels a june 4 , 1861 , article in the richmond daily dispatch noted it is well known that there are some chemicals so poisonous that an atmosphere impregnated with them , makes it impossible to remain where they are by filling larges shells of extraordinary capacity with poisonous gases and throwing them very rapidly into an enemy position \( in this case fort pickens , a holdout union post along the gulf coast \) but the most rapid innovation took place in the north president lincoln exhibited great interest in the development of new weapons technology during the war , the president would often visit the navy yard and consult with john a dahlgren , head of the ordnance department of the navy yet because there was no coordinated , systematic effort to take advantage of such innovations , many ideas remained undeveloped nowhere was this more true than in the realm of chemical and biological weapons , where thinking got far ahead of actual doing , and the horrific implementation of things like germ warfare and chemical agents had to wait for a later , even more barbaric conflict follow disunion at or join us  sources guy r hasegawa , proposals for chemical weapons during the american civil war jeffrey k smart , chemical and biological warfare research and development during the civil war james

london they were among s most durable stereotypes and , for some , they still are the flatvoweled northerner in an equally flat cloth cap , denizen of dark and distant mill towns and the silvertongued southerner , the city gent with bowler hat and furled umbrella , emblem of the capital s bright lights and prosperity , the magnet of the nation in recent days , the urge to close that unbridgeable gap has seemed to underlie the government s promise to turn a string of cities athwart the pennine hills into what george osborne , the conservative chancellor of the exchequer , has termed a northern powerhouse to spread prosperity far beyond london months before a national election in may , some have interpreted the pledge as a nonetoosubtle maneuver to harvest political gain from northern constituencies that were once the exclusive preserve of the conservatives' adversaries others have depicted the idea as utopian and improbable , a patronizing nod to a bluecollar region weakened by postindustrial decline but perhaps the main point is that the outlines of the northsouth divide have shifted long the draw for ambitious young people from leeds or manchester or newcastle , london now casts a much wider net , a global lure to american bankers and russian oligarchs , latvian builders and polish plumbers , chinese investors and french tycoons just this week , it emerged that a firm from abu dhabi was buying scotland yard the building in london that houses the metropolitan police service , which is moving to smaller headquarters and the notion of a northern powerhouse , girded by new highways and railroads and investment in theater and science , plays into the stirrings of a broader devolution of power from the central government that could be the harbinger of britain s fragmentation or even its balkanization in a referendum in september , scottish voters rejected independence by a greaterthanexpected majority but the outcome was widely ascribed to promises by prime minister david cameron of a new and fair settlement enhancing scottish autonomy and heralding a reform in other parts of the united kingdom england , wales and northern ireland whilst in scotland , the referendum and postreferendum debates continue to fill column inches , said alex nurse , a researcher at the university of liverpool these debates are n't limited to north of the border with the economic gap widening , in tandem with a divide between rich and poor , the discussion has some urgency after the economic meltdown of 2008 , the north once the engine of britain s industrial revolution endured a sharper decline than the south , while austerity measures could well hurt the north more than the south because northern institutions and cities are more dependent on public spending from birmingham to the scottish border , moreover , there is an uneasy competition over access to mr osborne s munificence , blending a degree of hubris with rival claims to the northern soul mr osborne says he wants to create a northern powerhouse to complement the strength of the capital , the columnist todd fitzgerald wrote in the manchester evening news we already have one it s called manchester but , as paul linford , a columnist for the newcastle journal in the northeast observed , mr osborne s proposal seemed to center on a socalled golden triangle linking manchester and other cities , to the exclusion of other places that sentiment was mirrored in the depressed midlands city of stokeontrent , where tristram hunt , a historian and opposition lawmaker , mused in the sentinel on longstanding distinctions in northern identity manchester and liverpool enjoy a fierce rivalry dating back to trade and tax disputes when they were the emerging megalopolises of the 19th century , he said then there is the even older transpennine feud , which , of course , helped fuel a long and bloody civil war in the 15thcentury wars of the roses no one suggested , of course , that history might repeat itself , that glimmers of balkanization might flare into balkanstyle wars indeed , mr linford said , if mr osborne s promises go unredeemed , the muchvaunted northern powerhouse will remain so much hot air
sochi , russia the groom has fled the altar , leaving a jilted russia , which paid 51 billion for the onceinalifetime ceremony , only to watch one of the four groomsmen , none with blood ties , commandeer the celebration the list of by from the sochi games does not include the american forward zach parise , whose team beat the host country and faced the prospect of having to play russia again in the gold medal game because of how dangerous they are , it s just a matter of time before they put in six or seven goals , parise said it just never came together for them besides , the americans have the rematch against canada they have waited four years for , although one round earlier than they may have dreamed the teams met in the final at the vancouver games , with sidney crosby with a goal in the eighth minute of overtime , after parise had tied the score with 24 seconds left in regulation until last month , parise had not seen a replay of the olympic final , he said sidelined with a foot injury , parise , who plays for the minnesota wild , was flipping through television channels when he came upon the rebroadcast , which was in the second period he said he watched it through the bittersweet ending and was transported back to that night at canada hockey place at the sight of his late goal , he said , he got flashbacks and some goose bumps would he have watched a replay more than once if the outcome had been different \? probably , he said with a laugh the meetings between these north american rivals are always intense , but there may be more sparks flying in the semifinal , oddly , because the loser will relinquish any claim to the gold or silver medals the intensity is going to be in my opinion just as high as if it s a gold medal game , said parise , who rejected the idea that the united states , also a silver medalist to canada in 2002 , had any score to settle or point to prove i do n't think at this stage of the tournament we need any extra incentive or extra motivation , he added at this level , the difference between success and disgrace can be thinner than a medal russia s fortunes seemed to turn on an apparent goahead goal in the third period against the united states , which was disallowed because the net had come unmoored if the goal had stood and the russians had hung on to win , would they have played the rest of the way with lighter hearts and clearer heads \? how would the americans have responded to the defeat \? honestly , i think too much is being read into that , said parise , the americans' captain at the end of the day , the net s off it s not a goal he added , i do n't think we 're here right now because that goal did n't count the americans are in the semifinals because they have outscored their opponents , 206 the canadians have scored 10 more goals than their competition , with 7 of their 13 goals coming from defensemen the rivalry between the teams is physical but friendly if the americans cannot work up a deepseated hatred for the canadians , and vice versa , it is because many of them are nhl teammates the american coach , dan bylsma , and defensemen brooks orpik and paul martin are in pittsburgh with crosby and chris kunitz the canadian defenseman jay bouwmeester is a st louis teammate of the american forwards david backes and t j oshie and defenseman kevin shattenkirk defenseman drew doughty , canada s leading scorer with four goals , and forward jeff carter play for the los angeles kings with the american goaltender jonathan quick and on and on it goes obviously we know everybody over there , so it should be a lot of fun , said carter , the only canadian forward with more than one goal in sochi crosby , the points leader in the nhl this season , has yet to score a goal in the tournament i'm playing and reacting , trusting that it s going to go in , and sometimes it feels like it s not going in very easily , said crosby , the canadian captain but usually it takes one , and they all start going in the 2010 olympic final was a masterpiece suitable for framing , although the americans are inclined to let it gather dust in a closet rather than display it over the mantelpiece it was a great game to be a part of , a lot of fun , parise said at the same time , it goes hand in hand you ca n't think about how fun the game was without thinking how disappointing the end was maybe friday s game is not a grudge match for the americans , but it is a chance to redirect the conversation for us , parise said , it would be nice to not have to answer what it s like to lose to canada again
great buzz in the blogosphere over chris giles s attack on thomas piketty s capital in the 21st century giles finds a few clear errors , although they don t seem to matter much more important , he questions some of the assumptions and imputations piketty uses to deal with gaps in the data and the way he switches sources neil irwin and justin wolfers have good discussions of the complaints piketty will have to answer these questions in detail , and we ll see how well he does it but is it possible that piketty s whole thesis of rising wealth inequality is wrong \? giles argues that it is the exact level of european inequality in the last fifty years is impossible to determine , as it depends on the sources one uses however , whichever level one picks , the lines in red in the graph show that unlike what prof piketty claims wealth concentration among the richest people has been pretty stable for 50 years in both europe and theus there is no obvious upward trend the conclusions of capital in the 21st century do not appear to be backed by the book s own sources ok , that can t be right and the fact that giles reaches that conclusion is a strong indicator that he himself is doing something wrong i don t know the european evidence too well , but the notion of stable wealth concentration in the united states is at odds with many sources of evidence take , for example , the landmark cbo study on the distribution of income it shows the distribution of income by type , and capital income has become much more concentrated over time it s just not plausible that this increase in the concentration of income from capital doesn t reflect a more or less comparable increase in the concentration of capital itself beyond that , we have , as piketty stresses , evidence from forbestype surveys , which show soaring wealth at the very top and we have other estimates of wealth concentration , like saezzucman , that use completely different methods but point to the same conclusion and there s also the economic story in the united states , income inequality has soared since 1980 by any measure you use unless the affluent starting saving less than the working class , this rise in income disparity must have led to a rise in wealth disparity over time the point is that giles is proving too much if his attempted reworking of piketty leads to the conclusion that nothing has happened to wealth inequality , what that really shows is that he s doing something wrong none of this absolves piketty from the need to respond to each of the individual questions but anyone imagining that the whole notion of rising wealth inequality has been refuted is almost surely going to be disappointed
moscow thirty years ago , during my first trip to russia , i bought a ticket for the bolshoi ballet though i paid an excessive amount by 1984 soviet standards for a restrictedview seat all the way on the side of the sixth , uppermost ring , i did n't care i was in the bolshoi theater for the first time it was the world premiere of yuri grigorovich s new production of the threeact ballet \( 1898 \) to see better , i switched to a slightly more central place to steady myself , i sometimes placed my hand on the ceiling it s strange to return to any theater for the first time in 30 years , but none more than the bolshoi the russian nation and its capital city have greatly changed russia s dealings with the west and its presentation of its own history have been transformed and the itself has been completely renovated and partly rebuilt by 2005 , structural problems within the opera house had caused several vertical cracks to open in the building s outer walls it was closed for six years for extensive toptobottom renovations the 2011 reopening was a grand gala affair , screened live around the world opera and ballet stars performed celebrities in the audience included two of the theater s greatest legends , the soprano galina vishnevskaya \( who died the next year \) and the ballerina maya plisetskaya today s bolshoi theater gleams bright , and , like so much of russia , it recaptures more of its own past than could be seen in the soviet era the insignia of the doubleheaded eagle an emblem of the czarist era is to be seen again in many places , not least on the spectacular curtain this is one of the great 19thcentury opera houses and its central place in russian culture includes both czarist coronation celebrations and communist party policy announcements premieres by tchaikovsky , mussorgsky , rimskykorsakov , rachmaninoff , shostakovich and prokofiev occurred here money has been spent to restore its presoviet acoustics i wish the three performances i saw there in late march had featured music more distinguished than that of auber s 1857 ballet , and i should love to hear how superb voices fill it but visually , in its auditorium and its public spaces , the bolshoi may well now be the world s most splendid theater bolshoi means big but though bolshoi dancers certainly move on a big scale this theater is not too big its stage , though wider than that of the metropolitan opera house , is not europe s largest its auditorium has never been a world leader in terms of audience capacity in soviet days , the bolshoi had a capacity of almost 2 , 000 that has now been reduced to 1 , 740 , with the audience in the parterre section \( as the orchestra is called \) seated on individual freestanding upright chairs the bolshoi s top gallery , now as 30 years ago , is only three rows deep the metropolitan opera house , inhumanly large to european tastes , seats 3 , 800 what has always been thrilling about the bolshoi is its sixtier height , matched only by that of some italian opera houses \( notably la scala in milan and san carlo in naples \) , the glamorous intensity of its goldandred interior auditorium , and brilliantly restored to presoviet beauty the large number of spectacular foyers the largest processional space on the second floor is a rectangle in the old days , members of the audience would politely parade during intermissions around its perimeter , often in twos and threes , making conversation and acknowledging one another an old world custom that seems now to have vanished outside the sixth ring , in a hall where once the ballet company used to take class , there is now a vast , pleasantly spacious cafeteria some of the secondfloor foyers feature exhibitions about the theater s past this march , one room honored the beloved ballerina ekaterina maximova \( 19392009 \) another exhibited the bolshoi s tradition in the operas of mussorgsky , with photographs of performers in boris godunov , khovanshchina , sorochinsky fair and others some members of the audience dress to the nines , others wear jeans both extremes pass without fuss many pose for photographs dancing registers easily here , and it comes across as a luxury art in a luxury setting the restoration has helped recapture the theater s lost czarist brilliance onstage and backstage , however , nothing old remains equipment is state of the art a whole new area has been added behind the stage , for further scenery and rehearsals the facade of the bolshoi is famous though few pictures show the house s caf cr me color \( replacing the dirty gray it acquired in soviet days \) eight massive ionic pillars support a grand pediment , which in turn acts as a platform for apollo , god of the arts , and his quadriga his chariot and four horses , which are caught in midaction as if ready to race into the air ahead of the theater \( inside , apollo is also seen on the theater ceiling , with the nine muses \) during a tour of the theater , it delighted me to find that the costume department is situated just behind the quadriga people are now at work on ballet and opera costumes that will be seen on the company s american visit in may \( kennedy center , washington \) and july \( lincoln center in new york \) beyond them , the windows give an astonishing view past apollo , his chariot and steeds , and over toward the domes and spires of red square those who labor over tutus and robes backstage have nonetheless one of the most spectacular views in russia
the study was designed to ascertain the effect on traffic if two out of three tollbooths at the fort lee , nj , approach to the george washington bridge were closed  the traffic study was designed by duane c milledge , phd dr milledge was most recently the designer of a traffic study submitted to the agency that operates the two bridges that cross the missouri river near downtown kansas city , mo the design for that study calls for furnishing commuters on one bridge with 20 bills and instructions to say to the toll taker , sorry , it s the smallest i 've got , collecting no tolls on the other bridge , and observing the result dr milledge is a member of the american association of traffic engineers , a contributor to queue quarterly , and a republican precinct captain in summit , nj  the principal hypothesis of the study was that the tollbooth closings might ease traffic flow onto the bridge , due to fewer cars from fort lee being able to gain bridge access additionally , it was hypothesized that , if the two extra tollbooths were closed for an extended period of time , getting onto the bridge could prove so onerous for automobile commuters from fort lee that many of them might turn to public transportation or simply give up their jobs , thus ameliorating traffic congestion on the bridge on a more longterm basis  it was posited that the space occupied by the two tollbooths in question might more efficaciously serve the revenueflow needs of the port authority of new york and new jersey through a use other than collecting tolls for instance , concessioning them out as a shake shack or a retail outlet for selling such souvenirs as george washington bridge coffee mugs , springsteen memorabilia and cds of don imus drivetime radio shows from the '80s  the methodology of the study was to shut down two out of three tollbooths and see what happened  the research team had no problem collecting data from individual drivers waiting to go through the one open lane , since their cars were virtually stationary there were only 14 instances of violence directed at the survey takers , almost all of which consisted of commuters throwing coffee from travel mugs or paper cups fortunately , no researcher was scalded , since the drivers had been waiting so long that their coffee was cold with the permission of dr milledge , cpl vincent sicola , of the port authority police department , who is taking courses in anthropology at seton hall university , collected data on what commuters said to researchers and to other people who seemed to have some connection to the port authority corporal sicola found that 58 percent of the motorists in line shouted some imprecation , ranging from the sort often heard in the stress of a rushhour subway or an overcrowded emergency room \( eg , you people should burn in hell or you can take your study and stick it where the sun do n't shine \) to rare curses , presumably ethnic in origin \( eg , may streetcars grow on the back of your throat \)  no reliable statistics were gathered on the question of how commuters felt about using the two extra tollbooths for something other than collecting tolls after it became clear that questions on various options were likely to draw curses or violence , researchers were , as a safety measure , told to avoid the subject by day 3 of the study , traffic going from new jersey to new york on the george washington bridge had been reduced by 6 percent , a figure that had increased approximately 1 percent a day although some had predicted a spate of reckless driving when desperately late commuters finally gained access to the bridge , such driving occurred only sporadically none of the injuries were considered life threatening as to the question of whether long delays at the approach would eventually discourage fort lee commuters from using the bridge , the study unfortunately ended on the fourth day , well before reliable statistics on this hypothesis could be accumulated this was due to the intervention of patrick foye , executive director of the port authority , who on sept 12 ordered the two closed lanes reopened , without consulting dr milledge  we recommend a followup study to obtain reliable statistics on what is required to discourage use of the bridge to a point of reducing bridge traffic flow on a longterm basis , the lane closings should be at least two weeks in duration , with unlimited options for extensions the methodology to be used is described at length in dr milledge s book , no pain , no gain a new approach to traffic studies

the model , suzanne loh , who now lives in milan , said in an interview on tuesday that chinese officials allowed the embassies of the models home countries to help with travel arrangements ms loh and other advocates for international models say that more than 60 models had been detained in beijing since midmay on sunday , three russian models were brought from a jail or detention center directly to the airport in beijing , where they were put on a flight to russia they were deported to their homeland immediately , ms loh said a russian embassy official accompanied the models on the drive to the airport ms loh said she did not know how many models were deported before the russians ms loh , who has been in touch with models in china who knew the people being detained , said that beijing officials accused the jailed models of not having proper work visas during the detention period , the police allowed embassy officers to visit some of the models , said ms loh , 26 , who is from malaysia and is an advocate for proper working conditions for international models she added that although none of the models was physically harmed , they had no freedom the crackdown began on may 8 , when officials in beijing held a fake casting call for models at an agency called m3 and rounded up more than 60 people who showed up without proper work permits or visas , according to the advocates the advocates said at the time there were signs that a crackdown was underway in other parts of china as well industry blog writers reported on the events and warned foreign models in china to avoid casting calls and to hide their portfolios many of those detained in beijing were from eastern europe , with russia and ukraine heavily represented foreign models in china often work on tourist visas models have been leaving china following news of the crackdown , ms loh said , but there are still many who remain or want to come to work there she added that agencies in china were still accepting them and helping them to apply for tourist or business visas that would allow them entry to the country but not permit them to do modeling work ms loh said a model friend in china had told her that some of the detained models had tested positive for illegal drug use , and that could explain why the investigation seemed to drag on for weeks after the fake casting call for many foreign models , working in china is anything but glamorous in january , meredith hattam , a young american model , wrote an essay published by fashionista , an industry website , that described low pay , long hours of drudgery and sexual exploitation ms hattam once worked for an agency in beijing owned by a former ukrainian model , and she said this kind of job constituted the dregs of the modeling world , the bottom rung of the high fashion ladder when news of the crackdown first emerged , ms hattam tried to draw attention to the plight of the detained models an industry group , managers agents models association , posted an online petition condemning the crackdown and asking chinese officials to meet with industry representatives to discuss working conditions and visas models who have worked in china say that there is no visa that specifically allows for modeling and that china should change that the industry group said in its petition this situation is a serious blow to the reputation of the international modeling community and to the whole chinese fashion market it is a traumatic blow to the concerned family and friends in many countries who have spent days worried about their loved ones our community has promoted china as the next fashion capital on a par with new york , paris , london and milan this current situation is seriously undermining that next fashion capital reputation unless we can restore the trust and reputation of the chinese market by securing proper visas and work permits , while monitoring local agencies to ensure the safety of our young models , our united worldwide community will be unable to support sending models to china this will be damaging to the chinese fashion industry , designers , local brands , international brands , local modeling agencies and supporting businesses , such as photographers , hair stylists , makeup artists and creative companies
the blue whale , the biggest animal on the planet , was hunted with abandon in the pacific ocean until the early 1970s the species has been rebounding ever since , but a slowdown in the growth of the population frequenting waters off the california coast was a concern now it turns out to be a promising sign of recovery scientists at the university of washington \( cole c monnahan , trevor a branch and andr e punt \) have just published research finding that the west coast blue whale population of around 2 , 200 individuals appears to be approaching its preslaughter size , with the slowing growth a function of the carrying capacity of the marine ecosystem collisions with ships remain a problem , the scientists write , but should not affect the whales prospects the paper do ship strikes threaten the recovery of endangered eastern north pacific blue whales \? was posted online today by the journal marine mammal science here s the core of the abstract we used a population dynamics model to assess the trends and status of enp eastern north pacific blue whales , and the effects of ship strikes we estimate the population likely never dropped below 460 individuals , and is at 97 of carrying capacity \( 95 interval 62 99 \) these results suggest density dependence , not ship strikes , is the key reason for the observed lack of increase we also estimate future strikes will likely have a minimal impact for example , an 11fold increase in vessels would lead to a 50 chance the longterm population would be considered depleted although we estimate ship strike mitigation would have minimal impacts on population trends and status , current levels of ship strikes are likely above legal limits set by the us the recovery of enp blue whales from whaling demonstrates the ability of blue whale populations to rebuild under careful management there s more in a university of washington news release  the recovery has helped the state s whalewatching industry here s some pretty remarkable drone video of blue whales off dana point \( near laguna beach \) in may , shot by a whalewatching tour operator  as the university news release noted , it s important to keep in mind that the california recovery is a tiny bright spot given that researchers estimate \( from other work \) that the 3 , 400 whales killed in that population from 1905 to 1971 pale beside the 346 , 000 harpooned in antarctic waters in the same span the national oceanic and atmospheric administration estimates that the southern hemisphere population was 175 , 000 before the whaling binge and is about 2 , 000 today  one of the paper authors , the doctoral candidate cole monnahan , has a fascinating piece on the north pacific whale research on a great new blog he maintains with another author , trevor branch , called blue whale news in the post , monnahan stresses the big questions that remain about the more heavily hunted blue whale populations in the western north pacific here s the kicker so what do we know about the population structure in other areas \? in the western north pacific , we know there is at least one population that spends a significant portion of their time , including the mating season , too far west for our hydrophones to hear them the truth is no one knows what populations exist \( or existed \) in the western north pacific thousands of whales were caught off japan early in the 1900s , but none have been seen since was that a population that was killed off forever \? where do the blue whales go during the winter months to breed \? these are exciting questions for future researchers to tackle to get a sense of the mix of whalingera data , tracking and modeling used to estimate past blue whale abundance , read this plos one paper by an overlapping research team from last year estimating historical eastern north pacific blue whale catches using spatial calling patterns  here s a related animated map of commercial whale catches from 1900 to 2011 the data were collated and animated by monnahan i added the images and whale sounds in the video variant posted here
when chinese president xi jinping spoke at an event in beijing on monday commemorating the 77th anniversary of the start of fullscale war with japan , he warned against efforts to downplay japan s brutal occupation of china it was a stark reminder of how the events of that era continue to shape the geopolitics of asia today , as china and japan square off over territorial disputes and beijing voices concern about japan s moves to lift longstanding restrictions on its military forces in his recent book forgotten ally china s world war ii \( outside the united states , it is titled china s war with japan , 19371945 \) , rana mitter , a professor of history at the university of oxford , restores the often tarnished image of china s contribution to the defeat of japan in world war ii in an interview , he said that , unlike in europe , where a broad consensus on the war has been achieved , interpretations of the conflict in asia remain a source of acrimony between the major players , and these disagreements have important ramifications for the future of the region a better understanding of history by all sides , he said , will prevent the events of the past from being used in an irresponsible manner following are excerpts east asia has had these sorts of debates over world war ii history in the past does this latest bout feel different in any way \? i think it is new and i think it s different in some sense it s a continuation of disputes that have been going on for a long time if you think back to the 1980s , when we had the socalled textbook dispute in which various japanese textbooks which were felt to be whitewashing japanese war crimes in china were condemned by the chinese government some people regard that as being the beginning of the contemporary phenomenon of this kind of dispute over history between china and japan but i do think what we ve been seeing over the past few weeks and months is new there are two reasons for that the first is that , in terms of the politics of the two countries , the history dispute is fitting into two very different views of themselves in china we re talking about a new administration under xi jinping which has explicitly stated that using the memory of the war against japan , the war of resistance against japan as it s known in china , is a core ideological plank in terms of shaping a new identity and that fits alongside the new geopolitical aims that china has , which again are not particularly hidden , which is to increase its level of influence in the asiapacific region it s a different sort of china that s now talking about these issues japan also , of course , is in a different place , in part in reaction to what s going on in china the obvious sign of that is the prime minister shinzo abe cabinet and its attempts to change the constitution on questions of the selfdefense force and how it s used it also speaks , if one looks at opinion polls in japan , to by no means an absolute but by some means a partial shift in some parts of public opinion which are becoming more hostile to china so the disputes over world war ii and that period are figuring into a very different sort of geopolitical east asia when xi jinping and other chinese officials discuss japan and world war ii , who is their intended audience \? speeches like the one we heard a couple days ago are , i think , very much aimed at two separate audiences the first one is very much domestic this is an attempt to create in the chinese public sphere an entirely new understanding of the war , its effects on china and why china should act in certain ways today i would say very briefly that the overall message is we were vulnerable back then we suffered one of the most devastating events in our country s history this must never be allowed to happen again on the international side , i think that there is a particular message that s becoming clearer and clearer that was one of the reasons the american title of my recent book about world war ii in china is forgotten ally , because i think basically it s becoming more clear the chinese are becoming more aware of their own history , their own contributions during world war ii to the allied victory that would include at least 14 million dead , 80 to 100 million chinese becoming refugees during that period , the smashing apart of the modernization that had been happening in a rather tentative way in china in terms of building roads , railways and so forth , all of that sacrifice to oppose the japanese until recently , that s been a very inwardlooking story in china in recent years china has been much keener to use the story in an international perspective the message goes something like this why is the us still in the asia pacific , 70 years after the end of the war \? at one level it made supreme sacrifices and contributions to the allied victory in 1945 , and as a result it got to reshape the asiapacific world china now says , well , china was also one of the allied powers it also made a very significant contribution to the allied victory had it not been for the chinese contribution , threequarters of a million japanese troops at their peak would not have been held down in a quagmire they could have been redeployed elsewhere so china really was quite central to the ultimate allied victory , but what benefits has china reaped from making this supreme contribution \? now again , there s an element of willful sleight of hand here , because of course one of the major reasons that china never reaped the benefit was because the nationalist government that had fought the war primarily alongside the communists was thrown out of power in the civil war , and of course mao s communists were never going to acknowledge the nationalist contribution but the fact is that today , with the partial rehabilitation of the chinese wartime government even in communist china , the aim is not by any means about creating a new and objective history , instead it s about trying to find geopolitical leverage points in the here and now by reading history in a new and selective , but rather more creative , way xi and others seem to be saying that the rest of the world doesn t appreciate the horrors of what japan did during the war is there any truth to that \? yes there are two lessons that the chinese seem more and more keen for the world to draw from the war experience first is that , i think it is true in the west for the most part , the bare facts of what china went through and also what china contributed to the wartime victory of the allies simply aren t understood also the fact that for fourandahalf years , between 1937 and pearl harbor in 1941 , china essentially was fighting alone against the japanese it s worth considering the alternative had the chinese surrendered in 1938 , which many people expected them to do , you would have had an east asia that was essentially a japanese colony or japanese protectorate for decades to come there might never have been a world war in asia at all and the history of the world would be quite different you don t want to push it too far , but i think that it s very clear that the chinese contribution to the war was more geopolitically significant than westerners have come to realize the chinese as a whole , not just the authorities but also the public , are right to say that story isn t well known the corollary of that is there is a strong push in today s china to try and argue that , because the west hasn t acknowledged that past , it should now make concessions to china in the asiapacific region that , i think , is a much more tenuous link it s tremendously important to acknowledge the wider reality of what went on in china , to commemorate what china did and to provide that wider historical information to the west as well as to the chinese themselves at the same time it s a very tough call to argue that there is some direct geopolitical debt that has to be paid as a result of events 70 years ago so i think you have to separate the historical facts and the revelation of those from any particular significance in the present day one of the points that xi made is that anyone who changes history will not be welcomed by china or any of the nations of the world he seemed to be speaking directly about japan is there an effort in japan to redefine what happened in the war \? i don t think there s a fundamental attempt to redefine the war in japan one thing i should note is that japan is a liberal democracy with a wide public sphere people with all sorts of views left , right and center have their own views about the war there are also radical voices and leftist voices in japan who make it very clear that japan committed terrible atrocities in china during the war and that there is no getting around that what i think is disturbing is that there is more respectability than there should be in some parts of the public sphere in japan for a revisionist view of the war this is a very , very long way from saying there is some huge attempt to whitewash the war in japan i don t think that s the case at all but i think it is problematic when we see top political leaders arguing that maybe there is some sort of nuance , some sort of liberatory mission that existed on the part of japan during the war the bottom line is that japan went to war in china and then more broadly in asia in 1941 because it was driven by a desire for imperial expansion and to fulfill its own increasingly shrill ideological goals and i think there are sections of the japanese public which haven t done enough to acknowledge that that s the reality of why japan went to war part of this history debate is driven by prime minister abe and his efforts to lift some of the postwar constraints on the japanese military in china that s triggered a lot of talk about a return of japanese militarism how valid do you think those concerns are \? i think they re not really valid at all japan is an utterly different country from what it was in the 1940s japan became a militarist country in the 1930s because it had an extremely unstable political system its democracy was weak and partial in many ways it also failed to find many allies in the global community , which drove it further inward today the situation is completely changed japan s democracy is stable it s often dysfunctional , as many democracies around the world can be but there s no question that the system is embedded and solid and there to stay i don t think anyone could imagine the japanese government would not remain a liberal democratic system and also the military situation is completely different today there exists what did not exist in the 1930s , and makes the absolute crucial difference , which is the presence of a third party , the united states , in the region , which has a very significant defense role in other words , although japan has made certain moves , largely i think for domestic political purposes , in the end its defense behavior will still be constrained for a very long time to come by its alliance with the united states this is a constraint both on japan and on china neither one can act without taking into account what the united states might do why do you think these feelings about the war are so strong in china and south korea but we don t hear much about other places that japan occupied in world war ii \? you hear a lot about the rape of nanking but not about the or other atrocities committed by the japanese imperial army elsewhere it depends who the we is if you talk about people in the west , i think it s fair to say the asian theater of the war and its significance , and east asian geopolitics in general , still tend to be a bit remote it s very unfortunate , because this area of the world , asia broadly has 80 percent of the world s population , economically this is a very important area so i think understanding the history of how that area got to where it is will become increasingly important in the western world that said , i think it s also the case that , unlike in the north atlantic , the aftermath of 1945 in asia has never given rise to a unified and agreed narrative in a sense , 1945 in the north atlantic , despite the cold war , gave rise to a certain set of things that remain solid american dominance in the north atlantic , nato , the eu and a shared history france and germany essentially share a consensus on the meaning of the history of that period and it s very unlikely that will be unpicked none of that is really true for the asiapacific region 1945 is today unfinished business there has been a set of attempts to recreate geopolitics in the region , starting with that year and thrown way off course by a lot of unexpected events , most notably the communist victory in china as a result , the different histories of the different places remain very disparate the history of the philippines and its occupation has been of interest to people who work on southeast asia , but it doesn t seem to have much significance elsewhere what is it like for you as a historian who has focused on this period 60 , 70 years ago to see the topics you ve researched become headline stories today \? it s very disconcerting in a way if you re a historian of world war ii in europe , then although the subject still remains of tremendous interest in schools and the wider public culture , i think most people would suggest it really is the past i think most people would argue the likelihood of a general conflict in europe today is pretty unthinkable while conflict still seems to me highly unlikely in the asiapacific region , it s notable that nonetheless events which might have seemed of passing interest to historians working on quite obscure topics do still have tremendous amounts of political significance in china and japan today i think it encourages people to understand and read more of history when i say people i don t just mean people of the region , although that would be very good , but also people in the wider world , in the west , to try and understand why things happened as they did i think that that prevents one of the greatest dangers , which is a superficial understanding of history that produces false analogies the more history you learn and understand , the less likely it is that history will be used in an irresponsible manner
the case of the university of texas at austin s missing brains has apparently been solved on wednesday afternoon , after a day of much confusion , the university issued a statement that most of the 100 brains , preserved in formaldehyde in jars , that had disappeared from the basement of the had been disposed of by the university s environmental health and safety officials in 2002 , under protocols for biological waste not everyone is convinced that the university s explanation accounts for all the missing gray matter but if accurate , the statement resolves the status of a most unlikely collection of missing items the brains taken from mental patients in autopsies as far back as the 1950s they were kept in heavy glass jars , each with an identification label , a diagnosis and the date of death , according to alex hannaford , coauthor of a new book , , with adam voorhes , who photographed the brain collection the disposal was done in coordination with faculty members who determined that the specimens had been in poor condition when the university received them in the 1980s and were not suitable for research or teaching , the statement said faculty members then maintained possession of other brain specimens in the collection that the university continues to own the missing brains , which made up about half the university s collection , were transferred to the university from 28 years ago a coup for the university at a time when the specimens were sought by a number of other research universities , including harvard , which has the nation s largest brain bank the university of texas statement said the health and safety officials were thought to have disposed of 40 to 60 jars , some of which contained multiple human brains as far as we know , that accounts for all of them , said gary susswein , a spokesman for the university but we 're continuing our investigation to make sure that none went to other institutions mr hannaford said he was skeptical of the university s conclusion that the 100 brains had all been disposed of i do n't buy it , he said these jars were designed to hold one brain , and i find it hard to believe that if 40 jars were disposed of , that accounted for all the brains early tuesday afternoon , there were reports that the missing brains had turned up at the university of texas health science center at san antonio we have no evidence that any brain specimens were shared with other universities or health institutions , the statement said , adding that there was also no evidence that one of the brains destroyed came from charles whitman , the tower sniper whose terrorized the campus and killed 16 according to the statement , the university will investigate why some of the specimens were disposed of and how all of them had been handled since the university received the collection last year in indianapolis , david charles , 21 , was charged from the the police were tipped off by brian kubasco of san diego , who had bought six of the brains on ebay for 600 , and suspected they were stolen about 48 of the brains were returned to the museum , which is on the grounds of a former state psychiatric hospital all of the brains were from the autopsies of mental patients over roughly a halfcentury through the 1940s these brain collections go back to the mid1800s , and it s not uncommon for their whereabouts to be unclear , said brian burrell , a university of massachusetts , amherst , professor and author of disposing of such a collection can be awkward , he said , since it may not be possible to give away the brains sometimes , he said , an institution does not even know it has them ebay policy prohibits the sale of human remains , with the exception of hair and skulls , as well as skeletons sold for medical use but enforcement is not air tight , as evidenced by the indiana case while a federal law protecting the burial sites of native americans prohibits trade in indian funeral objects and human remains , it is generally left to the states to regulate the trade of remains some extensive collections of brains have simply vanished there was one collection of 600 brains , by a philadelphia anatomist , and no one knows where they are , mr burrell said
washington the evangelical christian family that owns hobby lobby , the chain of craft stores , made history two weeks ago when the supreme court the obama administration s mandate that familyowned companies must provide contraceptive coverage to their employees now , the family is looking to build a permanent presence on the washington landscape , by establishing a sprawling museum dedicated to the bible just two blocks south of the national mall the development of a bible museum has long been a dream of the oklahomabased green family , which has built hobby lobby into a 3 billion company in which its religious beliefs infuse every aspect of the business , from the music played in its stores to being closed on sundays but on the heels of the company s legal victory , the project is raising concern in some quarters that the greens' museum could blur the line between educating and evangelizing steve green , president of hobby lobby and the son of its founder , has referred to the bible as a reliable historical document , and , as part of the museum project , he is developing a curriculum to reintroduce this book to this nation this nation is in danger because of its ignorance of what god has taught , mr green , who declined to be interviewed , said in a speech last year in new york there are lessons from the past that we can learn from , the dangers of ignorance of this book we need to know it if we do n't know it , our future is going to be very scary such sentiments have stirred fears about the museum among groups such as the freedom from religion foundation , which promotes separation between church and state i think they are a great threat , said annie laurie gaylor , a copresident of the group , which is based in madison , wis my instincts would tell me that they are choosing washington , dc , because they intend to influence congress scheduled to open in 2017 , the yettobenamed museum would welcome people of all faiths and include rare torahs as well as historic bibles starting the bible museum in the nation s capital was no accident after surveying cities , including dallas and new york , for more than a year , the , the green family s nonprofit organization that is overseeing the project , chose washington for its tourists , robust museum culture and national profile the museum , which will occupy half a block in southwest washington , will sit in the shadow of some of the capital s most prominent institutions , including the smithsonian s national air and space museum it will replace the washington design center , a hulking , eightstory brick and stone structure that was originally built as a refrigerating warehouse in the 1920s , before home refrigeration was common mr green s group acquired the 400 , 000squarefoot space in 2012 for 50 million adding up the value of over 40 , 000 planned artifacts , the real estate and the cost of renovations , the museum is an 800 million venture the green family has been the primary financial backer to date , but a national fundraising drive will soon be underway to help finance the reconstruction details from a filing with washington s historic preservation review board showed that mr green plans to restore the building s facade , gut and reinforce the interior , and build a twostory glass addition on the roof renderings of the plan echo the transformation of the bankside power station in london , which was remade into the tate modern museum the proposal still needs final approval from the city because the building , which is considered an important example of renaissance revival architecture , is being designated as a historic landmark according to david maloney , the state historic preservation officer for the district of columbia , approval of the museum s final design is expected by the end of the month the genesis of a nonprofit bible museum came five years ago when mr green , a protestant , took some of the money he made from hobby lobby and started scouring the world for ancient manuscripts , torahs , papyri and bibles he spent more than 30 million during his initial buying spree , but scott carroll , an archaeologist and historian who advised mr green on his purchases , estimated that the collection was now worth hundreds of millions of dollars you 're talking about landmark acquisitions , mr carroll said , referring to items such as a nearly complete book of psalms on papyrus and the earliest recordings of the new testament in jesus' household language of palestinian aramaic these are huge things that any museum , to have a portion of them , would be honored to have the green family s religious beliefs run deep mr green s father and the company founder , david green , has made its christian identity a conspicuous part of hobby lobby s culture one year , unhappy with the way local newspapers were writing about christian holidays , he took out christmas and easter ads in hundreds of newspapers across the united states , spreading the message of jesus and referring readers to a tollfree help line where they could seek spiritual answers thus far , local officials have embraced the museum rachel reilly carroll , who is on the advisory neighborhood commission whose district includes the museum site , said that the proposed design had drawn an enthusiastic response from residents because it would rehabilitate the building s imposing exterior and create a new public space yvette alexander , a member of the washington city council , said that she was also open to the construction of a bible museum but that the strong views of the greens on contraception could be an issue if they tried to promote them through the museum s exhibits and if the greens were to turn to the city for money , their position on contraception would be an obstacle they probably would n't receive government funding if they 're trying to push their agenda , which is against what we 're representing , said ms alexander , a democrat i do believe in a woman s right to choose , and i do believe in contraception mr green laid out a sweeping vision for the space during his speech in new york last year to the national bible association that described his hopes of telling the story of a book that is like none other he expects millions of people to pass through the museum every year specifics of the exhibits have not been released , but the traveling show of mr green s collection offers some clues it included theatrical experiences such as hologram recreations of biblical scenes , reenactments of fourthcentury monks transcribing the bible by candlelight in st jerome s cave and a multimedia noah s ark experience whether evolutionary explanations of history will be included , along with those of other faiths , remains to be seen , but mr green has made his personal views on the matter clear discovery after discovery supports the accuracy of this book , he said the book we have is a reliable historical document elizabeth merritt , founding director of the washingtonbased center for the future of museums , said keeping a clear distinction between science and religion was the most important challenge the bible museum faced in differentiating itself from socalled creation museums , like , that has drawn scorn from paleontologists for displays making the case that dinosaurs died in a biblical flood as the green collection evolved from an assemblage of rare biblical artifacts to the curation of a large museum , mr carroll , formerly a professor at baylor university , decided in 2012 to part ways with the project while he believes in the scholarly roots and historical significance of the collection , he is concerned that the green family faces a difficult challenge in balancing its passion for ministry with the objective mission of a museum walking that narrow path in a political hotbed such as washington will be especially hard , but with questions of religious freedom continuing to crop up , proximity to those debates was part of the location s appeal not far from their thinking was that washington represents the heartbeat of who we are as american and wanting to influence things from that vantage point , mr carroll said it s a pulpit of sorts
los angeles for the second straight year , the nhl s western conference finals have shifted to chicago for a potentially decisive game but this season the los angeles kings have turned the tables to take a threegamestoone lead on the blackhawks , who  losing last year makes you drive a little bit harder to win , kings right wing justin williams told reporters sunday you do n't want anyone to take anything from you chicago took it from us last year we 're trying to reciprocate we won in 2012 , then we lost last year that might get the fire going a little bit more , knowing that someone got the better of you i know a lot of guys on our team hate losing just as much as they love winning we do n't want anyone to get the better of us we feel we owe them something the big payback came monday as the kings scored three firstperiod goals and four straight over all on the way to special teams were key once again as they denied the blackhawks' three powerplay opportunities while managing to score twice on three advantages of their own through the fifth game of the second round , the kings had scored nine powerplay goals and surrendered nine since then , they have scored seven , as well as an eighth as a penalty expired , while allowing two the kings never admitted to being surprised by their rally from a threegamestonone deficit to the san jose sharks in the first round this year or by capturing the 2012 stanley cup as an eighth seed , but the four straight goals they scored against the battletested blackhawks elevated some eyebrows here shocked to be up , 40 \? williams said absolutely but that s the way the game went from there on i thought they pretty much took it to us fiveonfive that s something we need to look at the blackhawks outshot the kings , 2421 , 2117 at even strength , and they also had 23 attempted shots blocked nevertheless , the apparent ease with which the kings scored their goals was as striking as the volume of the scoring on their first goal , a powerplay tally , center jeff carter passed up a pointblank shot opportunity to rotate the puck high it ultimately went to defenseman jake muzzin carter stood in front of the net essentially unmolested for the entire sequence there was equally soft pressure on muzzin as he loaded up , aimed and fired at a relatively leisurely pace on the kings' second goal , center anze kopitar cleanly stripped defenseman duncan keith in the corner of the chicago zone , from which kopitar sent a centering pass to left wing marian gaborik for a tapin goal since trailing san jose , three games to none , in the first round , the kings have gone 114 , with seemingly every player producing an offensive outburst along the way kopitar , carter , gaborik and williams are the top four scorers in the nhl this postseason kopitar has long been known for his deft defense , and this year he was a finalist for the selke trophy gaborik s hustle to throw a heavy check on andrew shaw and break up a scoring chance was one of many pleasant defensive surprises he has offered the kings since being acquired at the trade deadline the tandem has created synergy all over the ice , something that did not even seem to be a possibility at times in their careers gaborik said only the late pavol demitra compared to kopitar s skill among his previous linemates kopitar said he considered gaborik a singular talent among other wings he had played with , which meant increased confidence and extra space to operate offensively he just gives us a threat that we did n't have in the past , at least in my seven years here , before he got here , kopitar said he s a big threat on the power play he s the type of player that can burn you within a couple seconds with one move the kings have also dominated in the faceoff circles , winning nearly 58 percent of draws in the last three games after splitting the draws in game 1 they have been led in that regard by center jarret stoll he won 16 of 24 faceoffs for the kings monday , including 9 of 11 defensivezone draws chicago shuffled its lines , most notably moving right wing patrick kane up to the top trio and dropping center michal handzus to the fourth line the personnel changes were effective to an extent , but the blackhawks have had difficulty matching the kings' depth at center we have veteran centermen , kings coach darryl sutter said all four of them have obviously been here for a while you know , they take care of both ends of the ice they pretty much run the game for us as centermen despite some alarming trends in their performance , the blackhawks have had stretches where they carried play , particularly fiveonfive they also have the pedigree of twotime champions who have recovered from similar deficits in the first round against the st louis blues , they trailed , two games to none , and rallied to win four straight games last season in the conference semifinals , they lagged behind upstart detroit , three games to one , before coming back to win the series and later the stanley cup at times like this , it s pretty comforting to say that we can look back and say that we were in the same position last year and came out of it , kane said it was n't easy , this one s not going to be easy but we know we can do it still , the blackhawks have been caught off guard , if not consternated , by their predicament one defeat from elimination , they now must show if they are circling their wagons or circling the drain it s not a good position to be in , kane said coming into the series , we 'd have been lying if we told you we thought we 'd be in this position we 've got no one to blame but ourselves we 're the ones who are going to get ourselves out of it , so we might as well start with game 5 in chicago

las vegas from her glass office at the top of city hall , mayor carolyn g goodman looked down at the transformation of this city s oncecrumbling downtown , nodding toward new attractions the eyecatching brain research center , the mob museum , the sprawling performing arts complex as evidence that sin city is no longer just about booze and blackjack but las vegas is missing one essential ingredient , she said major league professional sports with about two million people , the las vegas valley is one of the last major metropolitan areas without a team of its own , in part because bigleague sports teams shy from tying themselves to a gambling town now , las vegas could be poised to land one a franchise , which would play in a new downtown stadium but the public has not yet embraced this vision of las vegas instead , residents have revolted against the prospect of paying for the stadium with tax dollars without millions in public money , it is unlikely that shovels will hit the dry ground on the 200 million project the stadium s future now depends on a final city council vote in december ms goodman has pleaded with residents to believe in las vegas , arguing that the vote is about the kind of city that las vegans want to have we want to be a formidable city that really draws people with all the extras and all the basics , ms goodman said in an interview this is the last piece after three decades of vast growth the city s population has tripled since 1985 residents are ravenous for diversions that do not involve video poker but many of them are still reeling from the recession that left a landscape of foreclosures and halffinished housing developments , and people say that more basic qualityoflife issues , like funding for schools and parks , are more important than a sports team the public schools here are severely overcrowded , and park space is in such short supply that eight youth soccer teams have to share a single field for practice the nevada youth soccer association has campaigned against spending public dollars on the soccer stadium , saying that the money should go toward new parks and fields for children i'm a soccer fanatic , but you have to make hard choices , said lisa mayo , a spokeswoman for the youth soccer association , who raised five children here the money should go to infrastructure that allows our kids to get exercise and teaches them the other intangibles that come with playing a sport the city does host a toplevel minor league baseball team , the 51s but for the mayor and her family , bringing major league professional sports to las vegas has become a crusade her husband is oscar b goodman , a flamboyant former mayor whose is titled , being oscar from mob lawyer to mayor of las vegas during his term , which preceded his wife s , he helped oversee the makeover of downtown las vegas , which attracts far more locals than the las vegas strip , the tourism hub just outside the city limits for 12 years , mr goodman tried to entice a team any team to las vegas he courted baseball , basketball and hockey , but none bit then term limits forced him to leave office his wife picked up the cause that was the only reason i ran for office , really , ms goodman said we both believe in the formula for redeveloping cities culture , medicine and major league sports in the past , las vegas had been a hard sell for sports teams , in part because leagues like the national basketball association did not want to be linked with gambling that concern has eased somewhat as gambling has flourished on the internet and casinos have popped up in other states at the same time , competition from international gambling meccas like macau have prodded las vegas officials to diversify the economy in addition to the new museums and medical center , zappos , an online shoe juggernaut , moved in downtown alongside the rows of casinos and adult video stores vegas is n't vegas anymore it s more than just gambling , said mike tomko , a city firefighter who moved here from new york a decade ago downtown , they want to make it a worldclass city mr tomko , 56 , said he still missed going to yankees and giants games but he does not think , with its growing but modest fan base , is bright and shiny enough to capture the attention in las vegas , where a team would have to compete with stars like britney spears or garth brooks nearly every night vegas is very transient getting a permanent fan base for any sport would be a hard call , he said we need to bring in other businesses regular businesses , insurance companies build a couple office buildings i do n't think mls is the answer given the city s growth and changing demographics , however , officials from the city and major league soccer insist that pro soccer can work here latinos make up a third of the city s residents , and nearly half of the population is younger than 35 both groups that have shown strong support for the sport if it is built , the 24 , 000seat stadium , complete with hightech cooling systems to keep players and fans from roasting on 100degree summer days , would occupy an empty 61acre lot near the new performing arts center boosters say it would not only attract families and new businesses to the area , but also foster hometown pride in a city often defined by its 100 , 000 daily visitors jason crank , a lifelong las vegan , said he would bring his 9yearold son to games if the city had a professional team growing up , it was always a challenge because we never had a team to root for , said mr crank , a 30yearold cabana host you looked towards the nearest cities for a team to root for i think this could be a great thing for las vegans we 're definitely big enough but the stadium will be built only if the city council approves a funding plan and major league soccer chooses las vegas as an expansion franchise for 2020 , neither of which is guaranteed minneapolis and sacramento are also vying to land the expansion team construction also began earlier this year on an indoor arena on the strip , but there is no deal in place to bring in a team once it is completed , and the site may host mostly boxing matches and shows and at the start of october , the city council directed the downtown stadium s developers to explore whether it could be built without public funding the mayor and one of the developers said in interviews that some public money would be necessary to make the project viable ultimately , the decision could come down to lois tarkanian , a city council member whose family is synonymous with sports in las vegas in 1990 , her husband , jerry tarkanian , coached the university of nevadalas vegas men s basketball team to its only national title i think a successful franchise in any sport would pull the city closely together , ms tarkanian said when my husband was coaching , you could n't go anyplace without someone talking about the team everyone was behind it we 're missing that feeling at the moment but ms tarkanian , who may be the swing vote on the sevenmember council , for construction of the stadium her constituents , she said , are against it it s a tough decision i feel the excitement it could bring , she said if we ca n't do it this time , i can assure you it will happen in the near future

in the crash as mcclure s car hurtled about 185 miles an hour toward the infield wall , he knew he was in trouble his brakes had failed the only thing i can remember is knowing i was going to hit the wall , mcclure said , and just pretty well figuring that was the end of my life and just wondering if i was going to feel it mcclure was knocked unconscious by the impact , cut out of the car and flown to a hospital he sustained internal bruising and a concussion and was unable to race for more than a month but mcclure , who has a wife and five daughters , had little choice but to get back in the racecar that is how he earns a living that changed me a little bit , mcclure , 35 , said of the accident , which affected his memory and moods even to this day , i'm a different person in that regard than i was before for decades , racecar drivers have sustained head injuries in crashes , and some still grapple with the effects , including memory loss , mood swings , irritability , difficulty walking and depression , years later those symptoms are similar to what some football and hockey players and boxers have experienced they are also potential indications of chronic traumatic encephalopathy , a degenerative disease found in the brains of athletes who have sustained blows to the head although nascar has worked to improve safety since the death of dale earnhardt in a crash on the final lap of the 2001 daytona 500 , head injuries have not been eliminated without a pension or a union , and with nascar structured to protect itself from liability and classaction lawsuits like those filed against leagues like the nfl , the drivers who helped build the sport and who continue to make it a multibilliondollar industry are mostly on their own unless , perhaps , a new alliance of owners can finally provide help mcclure drives for tristar motorsports , based in mooresville , nc , in secondary levels of the national circuit tristar fields as many as five teams in each nationwide series race some teams have more money and resources , and they race for wins and titles other teams , like mcclure s , struggle to keep up in 244 starts over 12 years , mcclure has no victories but has earned about 6 million in race winnings drivers at mcclure s level receive less than a third of their winnings and typically have no base salary , in contrast to the millions that top sprint cup drivers take home in salary , prize money and endorsement deals the money is not enough to allow mcclure to walk away despite lingering effects from his 2012 concussion i do n't have the statistical or financial success as your sprint cup drivers , mcclure said , especially your larger names in sprint cup so i'm not going to get to retire off of this that seemed to me the biggest factor in everything , probably the greatest thing over the issues with the head , over the issues with any depression the actual number of drivers who have sustained head injuries is unknown but like mcclure , some of the sport s best drivers continue to feel the effects of such injuries the hall of famer bobby allison is credited with winning 84 races from 1961 to 1988 and the 1983 cup championship his career ended abruptly on june 19 , 1988 , after he was nearly killed in a crash at pocono raceway in pennsylvania he never fully recovered from a severe brain injury and has had memory problems since the accident i use my redneck palm pilot when i want to hang on to something , allison , 76 , said , pointing to his hand he still has his wit but as his wife , judy , said , it does not mask the damage you can leave here and in five minutes , 15 , 30 , he wo n't know anything we 've talked about , she said ernie irvan , who won 15 races from 1987 to 1999 and was named one of the 50 greatest drivers in nascar history , sustained a skull fracture in a wreck at michigan international speedway in 1994 he retired after another crash at michigan in 1999 irvan , 55 , said that he did not know how many concussions he had sustained but that he knew how they had changed him i still remember winning the daytona 500 and things like that , irvan said , but my shortterm memory , a lot of times i do n't remember 100 percent what i did yesterday jerry nadeau drove in the cup series for seven seasons but had to retire in 2003 after he sustained a traumatic brain injury in a crash at richmond international raceway in virginia i'm really just a nice guy , said nadeau , 43 , who said he had tried as many as 15 drugs for depression , but i'm kind of like a nice , lost , angrytype guy geoff bodine , 65 , won 18 races from 1979 to 2011 , including the 1986 daytona 500 he said he had sustained at least 10 concussions i pray when i wake up , i will know who i am , he said in may , when nascar announced the new hall of fame class , amanda gardstrom could not wait to tell her father , fred lorenzen , that he had been voted in known as the golden boy of nascar , lorenzen won 26 races from 1956 to 1972 gardstrom called her father , who lives in a nursing home in oak brook , ill , to let him know then she told him again and again every time i bring it up , he s forgotten now , gardstrom said lorenzen , 79 , was found to have dementia in 2009 and has shortterm memory loss he has had other problems over the years , including difficulties with walking that eventually resulted in his using a wheelchair lorenzen is unlikely to attend his january induction ceremony in charlotte , nc gardstrom said she had watched his decline since the 1990s , when his mood swings began i do believe he has chronic traumatic encephalopathy , gardstrom said , adding that she had met with nascar officials in 2013 to discuss her father s health cte can be diagnosed only in a postmortem biopsy of the brain gardstrom arranged a meeting between nascar officials and dr robert cantu and chris nowinski of the boston university sports legacy institute cantu and nowinski attended the daytona 500 in february as guests of nascar cantu said he hoped to be involved in designing a test that drivers would have to pass before returning to racing after a concussion these are essentially fighter pilots that are flying aircraft with wheels instead of wings , cantu said their reaction times cannot be dulled and have them perform safely they would not only put themselves at risk , but they would put other people on the track at risk nascar , which now requires a concussion test at the start of each season , is not planning to put a new system in place steve o 'donnell , nascar s executive vice president for racing operations , said that concussions were not common our average is 34 over the last 10 years , he said if you want to look just in the last two years , we had three in 2013 and actually none to date i put it towards a number of the safety initiatives we put forth that put us in a very strong position nascar improved safety practices after a series of deaths that started in 2000 and culminated in earnhardt s in 2001 energyabsorbing cushioned walls and improvements in racecars , seats , belts and headandneck restraints all work to protect drivers those improvements probably saved mcclure s life in a crash he was told was far worse than the one that killed earnhardt still , nascar cannot be sure its concussion numbers are accurate it is up to drivers to let medical personnel know they are hurt jeff gordon , a fourtime cup champion , said he would not be honest about a concussion if it could cost him a title and nascar protocols do not guarantee that concussions will be diagnosed dale earnhardt jr had two concussions in 2012 , the second in a talladega crash during the seasonending chase earnhardt came forward after the second and sat out two playoff races formula one has monitors within its racecars to alert officials when a crash exceeds a certain level of force , the driver is required to see medical personnel nascar requires no examination if a driver can drive away from a crash if drivers are willing to take a gamble on racing after concussions , that may be because of a perception that they are less susceptible to longterm damage cantu said , i would be very surprised if nascar drivers are at high risk for cte just because of the amount of total trauma they take to the head is not that great for the great majority over the course of their career as compared with athletes in other sports but that does not mean they are safe from the disease nowinski said , one significant impact may be enough to start the degenerative process medical bills from allison s 1988 accident took a toll he is not rich he lives in a modest ranch house in mooresville , nc , and still makes appearances and signs autographs for the money two years ago , the allisons approached nascar s president , mike helton , and jim france , chairman of nascar s sister company international speedway corporation , to ask for help the allisons left emptyhanded , although nascar arranged for bobby to make some appearances now the allisons need help again bodine said that he had tried to work with nascar officials years ago to set up a fund for former drivers in need but that the officials had said no he said i 've had friends who are n't dead , but they ca n't talk right , they have trouble walking , it s just on and on that s just head injuries there s no question we need a program in place to help drivers right now , there is no way to know how many drivers are like mcclure , who have raced in relative obscurity despite injuries but bodine said he hoped to meet with someone from the race team alliance , a potentially gamechanging coalition formed by the top nine teams in nascar to create cost efficiencies one thing i 'll guarantee is we 'll definitely listen , said rob kauffman , coowner of michael waltrip racing and chairman of the alliance and we 'll try really , really hard to have a very sensible and pragmatic approach drivers are independent contractors , not employees , and they sign waivers before the season that limit nascar s liability they do receive some insurance from nascar but the sanctioning body is also protected by the mindset among many drivers that they accept the risk of grave danger each time they strap themselves into racecars , and they are unlikely to sue mcclure accepts it , even though he now knows the cost my oldest daughter , she wears her feelings on her sleeve , mcclure said she does ok with me racing , but i know the days that i leave town are a little bit harder for her she knows there s a risk she just turned 7 , but her innocence of not being aware of any risk is gone
over the next five weeks , indians will take part in what is considered the world s largest democratic exercise malavika vyawahare , a reporter for india ink , answers some basic questions about the election who are voters electing \? voters choose the representatives to india s lower house of parliament , the lok sabha , and the composition of that body determines which party chooses the prime minister and governs the country for the next five years about 8145 million people are eligible to cast ballots in this election voters will choose 543 members of the lower house the president of india , a titular head of state , selects two other members of the chamber what are the main political parties \? how have their candidates risen to power \? india has a multiparty system with more than 50 regional parties and two major national parties , the indian national congress , which leads the governing coalition , and the opposition bharatiya janata party the congress party , which was formed in 1885 , when india was still under british rule , has dominated indian politics the party played a leading role in the struggle against colonial rule , giving rise to some of the most prominent national leaders , including mahatma gandhi and jawaharlal nehru , who went on to become the first prime minister of india until the early 1990s , it had such broad support from the public that it was capable of forming a government without coalition partners the descendants of mr nehru dominate the party , and three prime ministers have come from that family mr nehru his daughter , indira gandhi and his grandson , rajiv gandhi indira gandhi was assassinated in 1984 her son rajiv gandhi was assassinated in 1991 his widow , sonia gandhi , took over the party and in recent years promoted their son , rahul gandhi , as the heir to their political legacy rahul gandhi is now the vice president of the congress party the bharatiya janata party , the other leading national party , is the main opposition in the lok sabha its roots are in the hindu nationalist organizations like the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh the bharatiya janata party won the 1998 elections as a leader of the national democratic alliance and stayed in power until 2004 narendra modi , the party s candidate for prime minister in this year s election , is a member of the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh and a selfdescribed hindu nationalist  mr modi was the chief minister of gujarat , a state in western india , during riots in 2002 at least 1 , 000 people , mostly muslims , were killed in clashes between hindus and muslims mr modi has long been accused of not doing enough to stop the violence , although a court rejected efforts to prosecute him nevertheless , he remains a divisive figure the aam aadmi party , or the common man party , was born out of mass street protests against corruption that erupted in 2010 and 2011 its leader is a retired civil servant named arvind kejriwal the party surprised political analysts by winning 28 seats in the delhi state elections , enough to seat mr kejriwal as chief minister but mr kejriwal resigned just 49 days into his term , accusing the two main parties of failing to support an anticorruption bill the upstart party declared its national ambitions early and has fielded candidates for lok sabha seats across the country but few expect it to pose a serious challenge to the established parties in the national elections how does the voting work \? the election commission of india has mobilized more than 10 million polling officials and security personnel to carry out the election there will be about 930 , 000 polling stations voting is staggered in this election , it will be done in nine phases from april 7 to may 12 voting will be done by electronic ballot this is the first time that nonresident indians are allowed to vote it is also the first time voters will be able to exercise the option , none of the above the results are scheduled to be announced on may 16 how is the prime minister chosen \? the party that wins the greatest number of seats usually forms the government and chooses the prime minister getting a majority , or 272 seats , usually requires building a coalition with smaller parties the bharatiya janata party has named mr modi as its prime ministerial candidate for this election , but parties are not required to choose a candidate before elections the congress party has not named a prime ministerial nominee the single largest party in the house usually chooses its prime minister , who may be a member of the lok sabha or the rajya sabha , the upper house of parliament what are governing coalitions and how are they formed \? india s multiparty democracy allows for the formation of alliances between political parties since the mid1990s , coalition governments have been the norm as no party has been able to secure a majority on its own alliances are fluid and can change any time after the elections the two main coalitions in india are the congressled united progressive alliance and the bharatiya janata partyled national democratic alliance what are some key themes that have emerged in the election \? what do voters care about \? corruption a slew of corruption scandals involving the congressled government , and an anticorruption push by the aam aadmi party have left an impression on voters economy slowing growth , persistent unemployment and high food prices have led to disenchantment with the present government secularism the ascent of mr modi and his hindu nationalist party has raised concerns that members of minority religious groups would face discrimination if the bharatiya janata party came to power how will these elections influence india s relationship with pakistan , asia and the west \? whether foreign policy is a high priority for the next government depends on the strength of the coalition if it is weak , it will be too preoccupied with domestic battles to take on big initiatives in foreign policy india s foreign policy is not likely to shift drastically , but a strong bharatiya janata partyled coalition would probably make larger changes because of the party s hindu nationalist streak and probusiness stand the current administration , led by prime minister manmohan singh of the congress party , has not made improving relations with pakistan a priority as domestic issues have kept the government occupied the bharatiya janata party has outlined a zerotolerance policy toward terrorism and accused pakistan of infiltrating india india under mr modi would be unlikely to adopt a confrontational stance with pakistan , but it is doubtful it would be on friendlier terms with its neighbor the bharatiya janata party has made it clear that it would respond firmly to any chinese territorial aggression , but mr modi is also mindful of india s economic ties with china no matter which party is in charge , india is likely to avoid jeopardizing economic relations with china , which has emerged as a key trading partner and potential investor though the bharatiya janata party s manifesto has reiterated the party s opposition to foreign investment in retail chains that sell more than one brand of products , known in india as multibrand retail , mr modi has welcomed foreign investment in his home state of gujarat his businessfriendly reputation is likely to help strengthen ties with the west , which had shunned him after the 2002 gujarat riots the united states denied him a visa in recent years , both european and american envoys have met with mr modi as he modeled himself as an investorfriendly politician and with his strong following among indianamericans , business ties between the united states and india would likely grow but the next prime minister , regardless of party , will face strained relations with the united states an indian diplomat was arrested on visa fraud charges in december and later indicted , which set off a furor in india
fortdauphin , madagascar with the world going crazy , i tried running away from the news it did n't work i 've been doing an ecosurvey of madagascar , the island nation off the east coast of africa that contains the highest percentage of plant and animal species found nowhere else on earth all of them now endangered to one degree or another my tour guide is russ mittermeier , the president of conservation international and one of the world s leading primatologists we saw something the other day that even mittermeier , who s been coming here for 30 years , had n't seen before we were trekking through the berenty reserve , one of the last remaining slices of madagascar s southern spiny desert , an ecosystem characterized by tall , thin , cactuslike plants exclusive to madagascar this forest is home to sifaka lemurs white , fluffy primates , with very long hind limbs that enable them to bound from tree to tree like forest kangaroos how these lemurs are able to leap from one sharply spiked vertical tree to another without impaling themselves is a mystery after walking through the forest for hours , spotting a lemur here and there , we came upon a particularly dense grove and looked up there , about 30 feet off the forest floor , were nine sifaka lemurs huddling together for warmth in two groups four on one limb , five on another staring directly down at us they looked as if they were drawn there by a disney artist too cute , too white , too fluffy to be other than the products of a toy factory i 've seen two or three huddled together , said mittermeier later that night , but i 've never seen a whole group like that i could have taken a whole chip full of pictures i did n't want to leave none of us did but it was n't just because we 'd never seen such a thing before it was because we knew we may that no one would , particularly our kids why \? just look at the trends madagascar has already lost more than 90 percent of its natural vegetation through deforestation , most of it over the last century , particularly the past few decades , said mittermeier what remains is heavily fragmented and insufficiently protected , despite the fact that madagascar has an essential national network of parks and reserves and that brings me to the question what is news \? i 've visited a lot and lately the tragic happening there are real news , worthy of world attention but where we in the news media fall down is in covering the big trends that on any given day do n't amount to much but over time could be vastly more significant than we can now imagine too bad we 'll never see this news story the un security council met today in emergency session to discuss the fact that madagascar , one the world s most biodiversityrich nations , lost another percentage of its plant and animal species or this secretary of state john kerry today broke off his vacation and rushed to madagascar to try to negotiate a ceasefire between the loggers , poachers , miners and farmers threatening to devour the last fragments of madagascar s unique forests and the tiny group of dedicated local environmentalists trying to protect them because that wo n't happen , we have to think about how this oneofakind natural world can be protected with the limited resources here we know the answer in theory a wellmanaged national system of parks and reserves is vital because , given the current trends , anything outside such protected zones would be devoured by development and population growth for madagascar , this is particularly vital because , without its forests , neither its amazing plants nor animals will survive which are a joy unto themselves and also attract critical tourist income for this incredibly poor country and the people wo n't survive either these forests maintain the clean and sustainable water supplies and soils that madagascar s exploding population requires we have to preserve this natural environment , hery rajaonarimampianina , madagascar s president , told me in an interview one of my major policies is to develop ecotourism this can bring a lot of jobs the problem is the poverty of the people that lead them to destroy the environment that is very sad madagascar s ecological challenge parallel s the middle east s political challenge the struggle here is all about preserving madagascar s natural diversity so its people will have the resilience , tools and options to ensure a decent future a diverse system in nature is much more resilient and adaptable to change monocultures are enormously susceptible to disease they can be wiped out by a single pest or weather event in a way that a polyculture cannot in the middle east today , though , the last remnants of polycultural nation states and communities are being wiped out christians are fleeing the arabmuslim world islamist jihadists in syria and iraq are beheading those who wo n't convert to their puritanical islam jews and palestinians , shiites and sunnis keep forcing each other into tighter and tighter ghettos so a human rain forest once rich with ethnic and religious diversity is becoming a collection of disconnected monocultures , enormously susceptible to disease diseased ideas
orchard park , ny let s start with the fact that my grandmother evelyn elliott is 107 years old add to this that she gave up driving only five years ago , can skype from her ipad and rode out november s blizzard stranded in the modest house where she has lived since 1932 yet these are minor points of family lore when you consider how she spends her sunday afternoons the woman is a football fanatic there is no visiting grandma during a game unless you plan to sit in reverent silence except if they score , at which point you will hear a faint centenarian whoop and definitely do n't bother her with talk of brain injuries or domestic abuse scandals or cheerleaders who are not being paid i'm just about the game , she says with the kind of steely resolve one gets after surviving two world wars and , among other calamities if football is grandma s second religion \( she has been known to miss church on big game days \) , then the bills are her alternate parish , yielding an extended collection of greatgrandchildren to be both heralded and scolded no one runs faster than defensive back aaron williams , but if he misses an interception , she purses her lips others may be wowed by a new draft pick , but to grandma , he is still a rookie who must carry his weight touchdowns are great and all , but if you want to impress her , pull off a hail mary pass as one of six grandchildren reared within this proveyourworth dynamic , i have long searched for a way to understand the inner workings of this woman s mind it finally struck me that football might be the route so we headed to ralph wilson stadium last sunday for the bills' final home game of the season what are you thinking right now \? i asked her on the drive over you ask too many questions , she replied we soon hit a traffic jam near the stadium , passing a tailgate party like the one grandma had recently attended with her nurse , sue \( grandma mostly uses a wheelchair after two broken hips in recent years , but this has never kept her from a good party \) in the buffalo tailgating tradition , fans gather around their cars in parking lots and drink a lot of labatt blue beer while feasting on the food that represents the opponent if the bills are up against the miami dolphins , it s fish on this day , the bills were playing the green bay packers , so cheese platters were in abundance as grandma looked toward the stadium , her face turned serious the packers had never won a road game against buffalo , but this time they were bringing their future hall of fame quarterback , aaron rodgers just the word quarterback causes bills fans to stiffen a little early in the season , the team made a switch at that position , replacing e j manuel with kyle orton , but he , too , had been less than dazzling if grandma was sure of one thing , it was this whatever the bills lacked on the field that day , they would more than make up for in the stands bills fans are unabashedly fanatical the team is a version of its underdog town , which has taken the same boomandbust path of other small postindustrial cities struggling to survive in the new economy through all of the highs and lows , buffalo has found in the bills an unwavering and noble cause to rally around it makes no difference that the bills have not made the playoffs since 1999 most of their home games still sell out , as did buffalo s on record , against the los angeles raiders in 1994 , with a wind chill of minus 32 degrees when the recent blizzard forced the team to decamp to detroit to face the jets , bills fans followed suit , pouring into that stadium as well it is perhaps unsurprising , then , that these same diehard fans waged a campaign this year to ban bon jovi s music because of rumors that the band s frontman , jon bon jovi , was interested in buying the team and moving it to canada \( instead , the bills were sold for 14 billion to terry and kim pegula , who have in buffalo \) after parking our car , we were escorted into an elevator that led to an entrance ramp to the field i have never met anybody who s 107 years old , the elevator operator said me neither , grandma replied as we descended the ramp into the open field , i caught the first flicker of emotion on grandma s face she had not been to the stadium since she was in her 90s \( an age that for most people is a bookend for grandma , it was just the start of another chapter \) year after year , grandma s television was her only portal into this field when she traded up to a 60inch flat screen , she felt closer but there is nothing like being there , before that wide expanse of green i think i'm gonna cry , she said just then , terry pegula strode up , his hand extended it did not occur to grandma that the bills were seeing a possible publicity bonanza in this article she stared at him and said , with a hint of warning , thanks for keeping the bills in buffalo half an hour later , we had taken our seats in a heated box , and the game began the bills fell behind early , 30 but late in the first quarter , marcus thigpen returned a green bay punt 75 yards for a touchdown , the kind of play that might happen once a year for any team touchdown ! grandma yelped inaudibly as the stadium erupted you do n't see all that when you 're watchin' at home , she said that was a great play i kept trying to discern what it was about the game that captivated grandma s mind i knew she paid close attention to strategy what do you think happens in the huddle \? i tried they decide what to do , she sniffed \( in the tone of are you an idiot or what \? \) i have interviewed militant jihadists , prosecutors , drug dealers and counterterrorism specialists at the central intelligence agency none of them prepared me for the challenge of extracting personal information from my grandmother ask her about church or baking , and she is loquacious try to psychoanalyze her , and you get a cocked brow \( this might explain why she is especially fond of the bills' defensive line \) to be fair , grandma is the product of a nononsense upbringing , which she can still recount in shimmering detail her father was a baker named emil wahl who had come to america from stuttgart , germany , settling in east buffalo , where he met and married emma nitzschke , the daughter of german immigrants by the time my grandmother was born in 1907 , the second youngest of eight children , her father owned a bakery on metcalfe street , delivering bread from a horse and buggy for 5 cents a loaf the family lived above the bakery in an apartment with no indoor plumbing and later moved to a 24acre farm on walden avenue , where the wahls began raising pigs for a living on weekdays , grandma would walk nearly a mile along a dirt road , often chased by geese , to reach a tworoom schoolhouse \( four grades in one room , four in the other \) when she was 14 , she and her sisters decided to try a vocational school instead she learned to type but soon quit because every time the tuition would come up , we 'd have to almost break my father s arm to get the money , she said so i got sick of that at the dawn of the roaring twenties , grandma , 15 by then , found a job in the alterations section of a men s department store , earning 1 a day , six days a week she spent her scant free time mastering the charleston , taking sun at lake erie , and serving ice cream and cake at the annual peach festival , where in 1926 she first laid eyes on a handsome southerner named charles elliott a former marine from jackson , tenn , he had served in world war i before attending cornell and was now working at westinghouse electric as an electrical engineer perhaps most impressive , he drove a car a jordan with side curtains and offered to pick my grandmother up for their third date at 5 am this gave her pause , until he explained his reasoning he wanted to take her to a football game at cornell , and they would have a long drive ahead at the beginning of the third quarter last sunday , with the score tied , 1010 , i started up with my questions again she frowned i ca n't concentrate when people talk , she snapped grandma s spectator style might best be described as zen she watches the game closely and calmly , getting neither flustered nor excited this disposition mirrors her general approach to life i just go with it , she likes to say i take it as it comes let the best man win in the third quarter , buffalo was the better team and methodically built a 1610 lead but now rodgers had the ball again , and the bills would have to find a way to keep him and the packers from answering grandma was well versed enough in football to know what was at stake time for them to make some noise , she said of her fellow fans as the bills' defense tried to pressure rodgers it s the third down as it turned out , early in the fourth quarter , rodgers was intercepted on a thirddown play by the strikingly named bacarri rambo , who had been signed by the bills just a month earlier the interception led to another field goal by the bills and a 1910 lead grandma seemed pleased but unfazed it s going about the way i expected , she said intuition grandma saw her first football game almost 90 years ago , on that day trip to cornell she acknowledges paying little attention to the sport she was far more taken with the gentleman who had escorted her there by the time charlie and evie , as they were known , married four years later , the depression had hit , and football took a back seat to weightier matters grandma considered herself lucky that her husband had kept his job at a time when neighbors were begging for food but to avoid being laid off , he was working only every other week married women did n't work back then , she recalled , but to help her husband make up for the lost income , she took part in raising chickens in the backyard of the house they had built , and sold the eggs door to door with the arrival of three sons \( my father , robert , coming last \) , grandma spent the next few decades shuttling among her housework , the two church choirs she led , and the cooking and baking classes she taught like many women of her time , she knew she had untapped potential she jumped at the chance , in the 1950s , to run her brother clarence s store , wahl s candies \( which is still in business \) but it was a shortlived affair grandma mostly tended to her children and husband , who had been a bills devotee from the team s 1960 inception three decades later , he would quietly watch the sunday game while she tuned it out , fixing dinner instead in 1991 , grandpa fell gravely ill right before my cousin camille s wedding in geneva so grandma went to europe by herself , and there , of all places , she discovered the bills it was the start of a magical era for the team , which was heading to the with a shining quarterback named jim kelly being a proud woman , grandma was irked that so many europeans seemed to know more about her own team and this american sport than she did she returned home ready to learn the game and watched that first bills super bowl with her husband at her side the bills lost grandpa died nine months later his absence left an aching void to fill every sunday watching the game became grandma s new ritual with kelly at the helm , the bills were the only team to make it to four consecutive super bowls although they lost all four , they gained a sacred kind of devotion from my grandmother she was now a bills fan with less than five minutes to go in the fourth quarter last sunday , the packers kicked a field goal of their own , cutting buffalo s lead to 1913 could the bills hold on \? another touchdown , they 'd have 'em , grandma said as her team prepared to go back on offense but they did n't seem to hear her the bills moved the ball past midfield but could not advance any farther and punted with two minutes to go , giving rodgers and the packers the opening they needed a lastsecond touchdown , and green bay could win , 2019 but on the very next play , rodgers was sacked on his own 3yard line and fumbled the ball into the end zone , leading to a safety for the bills \( another rare play for grandma to witness \) that sealed the and kept their playoff chances alive oh , boy ! grandma squealed oh , boy ! her face lit up as the crowd went wild it was something to no longer be watching alone , to be just one fan among many i think you are good luck , grandma , i said i think so , she said , beaming later that evening , we were back at grandma s , sitting around the same mahogany duncan phyfe table where four generations of elliotts had gathered for meals grandma quietly savored her slice of pepperoni pizza with the same focus with which she watches the games we reminisced about the day s highlights how she got to meet jim kelly how she reminded terry pegula to keep her team in her town then there was that moment , right before the game , when running back fred jackson walked up to greet her we wondered aloud if grandma might have taken a liking to the handsome jackson , who is still running strong at the ripe age of 33 she paused , breaking into a smile he s too old for me
washington when democrats changed senate rules last year against white house nominees , it raised hopes among some liberals that would use his new power to reshape the federal judiciary now , just over three months later , some democrats and progressive groups are instead trying to stop two of the president s latest nominees to the federal bench on the grounds that they are too conservative black lawmakers , civil rights advocates and abortion rights groups are challenging two georgia nominees put forward by the white house under an agreement with the state s two republican senators the two republicans were given a say in picking candidates for district court in exchange for allowing a stalled nominee to a federal appeals court to advance the conflict is the latest twist in a struggle over confirmations the change , while heralded , had only a limited impact on the ability of democrats to push through federal judges to lifetime appointments senators still hold virtual veto power over judicial nominations associated with their states under a custom of the senate judiciary committee that requires senators to return a blue slip acquiescing in a nomination before it can move forward blue slips have been difficult to get in the case of nominations from states where one or both senators are republicans of 18 pending nominations from those states , according to the committee , no republican blue slips have been submitted , and democrats have submitted only a few in order to move forward on the twoyearold nomination of jill pryor of atlanta to a seat on the united states court of appeals for the 11th circuit , the white house struck a deal with senators saxby chambliss and johnny isakson that led to the nominations of five others , including michael p boggs , a georgia court of appeals judge , and mark h cohen , a former state democratic official , to vacancies in the northern district of georgia mr boggs and mr cohen have run into significant resistance from progressive groups and black lawmakers mr cohen is under fire for his successful defense of a georgia voter identification law , which civil rights groups see as an attempt to suppress minority voting mr boggs is the target of most of the opposition for his sponsorship of antiabortion legislation while serving as a democratic state legislator between 2000 and 2004 and for voting in 2001 to retain a georgia state flag that contained the confederate battle emblem it breaks my heart that this is the first africanamerican president who is doing something like this , said representative david scott , a georgia democrat and member of the who is one of the chief critics of the nominations and served in the georgia legislature during the flag vote more than two dozen progressive groups , led by , submitted a letter opposing the nomination of mr boggs , and some democrats on the judiciary committee are already questioning the nomination , raising the possibility that one of mr obama s judicial choices could be rejected by his own party i am strongly considering whether he should be withdrawn because i have very serious concerns about some of the really unwise and inappropriate views he has stated , said senator richard blumenthal , a connecticut democrat who sits on the judiciary panel as a starter , i want to have some conversations with the white house and determine what they were thinking other democrats on the committee said they had just begun to review the nominations senator patrick j leahy , the vermont democrat who leads the committee , said he intended to schedule confirmation hearings once the necessary reports were in hand if the president sends up a nominee , they ought to at least get a hearing , and we will see where we go from there , said mr leahy , who said he has made no decision on the nominations i am not committed one way or the other , he said the deal is with the president , not me administration officials countered the criticism , noting that mr cohen was asked to lead the defense of the voter identification law by the democratic attorney general of georgia in the case of mr boggs , white house officials said that he had built a wide reputation for fairness and openness in his decade on the bench and has a special expertise in criminal sentencing reform , a subject of significant interest to the president none of the criticisms , nothing is based on his record as a judge for 10 years , said kathryn ruemmler , the white house counsel what has distinguished him as a state court judge at the trial level as well as on the court of appeals is he has taken a keen interest and leading role in criminal justice reform senator chambliss also dismissed the criticism of mr boggs these objections that are being raised are pretty baseless , he said , challenging the groups to find a biased ruling by mr boggs while the president might not have made the same selections if he were unconstrained , administration officials said , the package represented a compromise by both sides in an effort to find consensus nominees in more conservative states they said mr boggs was considered a solid candidate who would enable the administration to fill vacancies not only at the district court level but at the more influential circuit court level as well do you work with republican senators to find a compromise or do you leave the seats vacant \? ms ruemmler said we believe that is the choice under the current system , and it would be grossly irresponsible for the president to choose to leave the seats vacant the judicial fight has renewed calls by some activists to abandon the blue slip process and try to win confirmation without homestate consent in every case now that a filibuster against a nomination can be overcome by majority vote but senators in both parties have shown reluctance to take that step since they do not want to lose influence over highprofile , lifetime judicial appointments in their states they recognize that voting for judges opposed by homestate senators could later backfire on them if the tables are turned we could do away with the blue slip tomorrow , and it would not change a thing , mr leahy said nominees opposed by homestate senators will not get through mr leahy said while the negotiations might be difficult , they could produce results as in the case of six arizona judicial nominees approved thursday by the judiciary committee after an agreement between the administration and republican senators john mccain and jeff flake of arizona one of the nominees , diane humetewa , if confirmed , will become the nation s only currently serving native american judge and the first native american woman to serve in the federal judiciary
it s hard enough to establish a comedy series in the current climate of network television without disturbing the universe at the same time yet here comes john mulaney , a former saturday night live writer and standup comedian , wading into one of television s most entrenched debates , daring to create a sitcom for himself in which people can be heard laughing at the jokes i wanted to do this format , mr mulaney said over coffee this week in manhattan , his persistent sunniness apparently subduing his inner rebel i knew from the getgo we were doing something weird , and we 'd come up against resistance the format in question is the multicamera comedy , shot on a stage in front of a studio audience and it s something weird because is appearing , starting on sunday , on fox , while everybody knows that shows like this are supposed to appear only on the more orthodox cbs , where the species known as the multicam comedy has been defying extinction , mainly by racking up hundreds of millions of dollars in profits from shows like the big bang theory across the rest of television , only comedy made the modern way singlecamera shows like veep , shot on film , with no laughter to be heard anywhere has been acceptable for about a decade mr mulaney said his friends in comedy told him , i'm so sorry they 're making you do a multicam' lorne michaels , the snl executive producer who is playing the same role on mr mulaney s show , mulaney , said , we 're now into that distinction between singlecamera shows that are admired and multicamera shows that are watched he speaks from the experience of having recently produced a singlecamera sitcom created by another former snl writer , tina fey that series , , won many awards while averaging about a quarter of the more than 20 million viewers who watch big bang every week mr mulaney has only compounded his risk by creating a show bearing his own name , playing a young comic who writes for a bumptious game show host played by martin short but the lead character lives in a new york apartment hangs out with a few close friends , including a young woman \( nasim pedrad \) who is n't his girlfriend and some neighbors \( elliott gould plays one \) who burst in unannounced and every episode opens with him doing standup in a club it is hard to imagine a review that wo n't note the similarities to seinfeld that classic comedy may be long out of production , but its reruns remain popular at least partly because , yes , it followed a multicam format over the decades , the multicam comedy has been a better business than the singlecamera variety from cheers to frasier , and friends to seinfeld and big bang , comedies that have generated the most impact and profits have included laughs from studio audiences the contemporary singlecamera comedies , like 30 rock , the office and parks and recreation , have won a great deal of critical love but comparatively few dollars even modern family , by far the bestrated singlecamera of recent vintage , has not posted ratings in syndication akin to those of big bang so why the decided preference for the singlecam comedy in much of television \? one reason is clearly those audible laughs especially in new shows like mulaney , the comedy sometimes feels forced and the chuckles artificial james burrows , the director whose credits include many of the huge multicamera hits of the past two decades , has been baffled for years about the decline of the multicam format everywhere but cbs he notes that hearing an audience laugh would not be alien for a play , which , with its living room sets and emphasis on setupjoke banter , is what the multicam sitcom most resembles i was raised in the theater , mr burrows said \( his father was abe burrows , coauthor of the book for guys and dolls \) when you do singlecam , you are the sole judge of what s funny with multicam , you can continue to work on the jokes , because the audience lets you know what s working the longer runs of multicam shows are no surprise , he said , because the others are so niche i call them precious mr michaels said multicam comedies feel less contemporary but when viewers see a traditional multicamera show , everybody knows what it is , he said there s something comforting about hearing laughter , he continued and it s an american form but it has become only a cbs form other networks have tried multicams in recent years like , on nbc but none have broken through one reason , mr burrows noted , is that writers are not trained in the format anymore , except those who have worked in the stable of chuck lorre , who , with big bang , two and a half men and other series , continues to be the favorite producer of leslie moonves , the cbs boss mr michaels joked there are two people who believe in this form one is les moonves , and the other is john mulaney he added it once was mainstream , now it s sort of fringe it looks in a certain way like a bold choice or a foolish one early reactions to mulaney have ranged from mixed to ferociously negative tim goodman , a tv critic for the hollywood reporter , wrote , there is no saving a show  mr mulaney responded i do n't mind hearing it but i think it s an interesting , intelligent show i understand things seeming audibly out of touch , with people not having heard live audience laughter in a long while but he added i know it s not heinous if people do n't like the show , i ca n't do anything for you mr michaels said that television comedy usually needed a season to find its voice , citing examples that started with low ratings and some derision , only to wind up sustaining their networks \( the comparison again seinfeld \) there will be growing pains , mr michaels said , after seeing the 12 episodes of mulaney that have been produced the more recent episodes are way better , head and shoulders over when we began but the cast is good , and john is enormously likable whatever happens , mr mulaney is content with his choice i wanted to try a pure comedy and see if you can have a big tent with what we do , with this style of comedy , he said it might be an empty big tent for a while but i'm getting the chance to put it up
baghdad the kurdish regional government responded thursday to harsh criticism from iraq s prime minister , nuri kamal almaliki , announcing that its ministers would boycott cabinet meetings , demanding an apology to the iraqi people and calling on mr maliki to step down the political fissure was exacerbated after of turning their regional capital into the headquarters of the islamic state in iraq and syria , as well as harboring members of the baath party of former president saddam hussein and other opponents of the iraqi government the iraqi government halted all cargo flights to kurdistan on thursday , said capt nasser albandar , the head of civil aviation in the iraqi government kurdistan had responded by halting its cargo flights to baghdad , he said iraq has also notified the united nations that sunni militants from isis seized nuclear material from a university in the northern city of mosul last month as they advanced toward baghdad , the nuclear regulatory body of the united nations said thursday gill tudor , a spokeswoman for the international atomic energy agency , which is based in vienna , said in a statement that the organization s experts believed that the material thought to be uranium was low grade and would not present a significant safety , security or nuclear proliferation risk word of the seizure first emerged in a letter to the united nations that was dated tuesday and seen by reporters from reuters , which quoted it as saying that terrorists from isis had taken control of the materials the letter said that almost 90 pounds of uranium compounds had been kept at the university and that the materials can be used in manufacturing weapons of mass destruction , reuters said but the theft has not caused alarm in the safeguards division of the atomic energy agency in vienna , said a diplomat there who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide information that is considered sensitive this seems to be a reagent used in teaching , the diplomat said , adding that it was a relatively small amount of material that could fit in a bucket the mention of such weapons resonates in iraq , where the americanled invasion of 2003 was justified in washington and london by assertions that saddam hussein , the leader at the time , had acquired weapons of mass destruction none were ever found by the invading forces in her statement on thursday , ms tudor said that the atomic energy agency is aware of the notification from iraq and is in contact to seek further details she said experts did not believe that the material could be fashioned into a weapon nevertheless , the statement said , any loss of regulatory control over nuclear and other radioactive materials is a cause for concern mr maliki , the iraqi leader , asked the kurds on wednesday to stop the operations room for isis and implied that the kurds had assisted the sunni militants who swept into northern iraq and seized territory in june , saying that the government had diagnosed the internal and external parties who supported the conspiracy that took place in iraq kurdistan is a semiautonomous region encompassing three provinces in northern iraq the kurds are represented in the iraqi parliament and hold offices in the shiiteled national government , including president , foreign minister , trade minister and health minister however , they also have their own parliament and regional government , and have foreign missions in several countries he has become hysterical and has lost his balance , the kurdish president , massoud barzani , said in a statement , referring to mr maliki he is doing everything he can to justify his failures and put the blame on others many iraqis believe that the kurds used the push by isis and the ensuing security vacuum after many iraqi government troops fled the fighting to seize control of the oilrich kirkuk region , as well as towns in the northern part of diyala province and a number of border villages where there are substantial kurdishspeaking populations the kurds believe that these areas are part of their domain the back and forth is also part of a risky political calculation by mr maliki and mr barzani that each will garner points with his own loyalists by criticizing the other many shiites feel betrayed by the kurds after their seizure of kirkuk and other border areas , and support mr maliki s accusations for their part , the kurds believe that they are part of a movement to remove mr maliki and that the tough talk will rally his opponents as well as reinforce the kurdish position on kirkuk relations between the iraqi central government and the kurdish region have been deteriorating for months , with the central government refusing to pay salaries of kurdish government employees because the kurds have been trying to export oil independently in his statement , mr barzani s office noted that the kurdish region and its capital , erbil , had once been a haven for mr maliki , and said it was mr maliki who had ceded ground to the isis militants , not the kurds however , many opponents of the maliki government have also found refuge in kurdistan , including many sunnis who are insisting that mr maliki , a shiite , step down kurdistan is proud that erbil has always served as a refuge for oppressed people , including yourself when you fled the former dictatorship , the statement said now erbil is a refuge for people fleeing from your dictatorship a former speaker for the kurdish parliament in erbil , abdul salam barwari , expressed the longheld frustration of kurds and sunnis with mr maliki s policies , which they regard as discriminatory we have sacrificed to hold iraq together , while he breaks it apart , he said
richmond , va former gov bob mcdonnell of virginia and his wife , maureen , were convicted of corruption in federal court on thursday , after a trial that shattered the political career of the onetime republican star and peeled back the couple s private life to the bone as he was pronounced guilty on 11 counts of conspiracy , bribery and extortion , mr mcdonnell covered his face with his hands and his head fell nearly to the defense table his wife , convicted on nine counts , looked straight ahead there were sobs from the seats behind them where their five adult children and other family members sat the sevenman , fivewoman jury returned its findings on the third day of deliberations here in united states district court for the eastern district of virginia both mcdonnells , who now face years in prison , were acquitted of lesser charges of making false statements on loan applications , while ms mcdonnell was convicted on a charge she alone faced , of obstructing a grand jury investigation by trying to make a gift of 20 , 000 worth of designer dresses and shoes appear to have been a loan the verdict provided an emphatic coda to a trial that began with an investigation of the mcdonnells' acceptance of a rolex , armani clothing , free trips and other luxuries , and turned into a cringeinducing , tabloid drama of marital strife this is a difficult , disappointing day for the commonwealth , said dana j boente , the united states attorney for the eastern district of virginia when public officials turn to financial gain for official actions , we have little choice but to prosecute the case asked if mr mcdonnell would appeal , one of his lawyers , henry w asbill , said , of course over the nearly sixweek trial , mr mcdonnell , 60 , offered a few upbeat words as he entered and left the courthouse each day , expressing faith in god and the jury system , or on thursday detailing his exercise routine , all of which gave the impression that he was optimistic about an acquittal his reaction upon the first utterance of guilty around 3 pm suggested he was stunned the mcdonnells were indicted on a total of 14 counts stemming from what prosecutors said was a scheme to sell the office of governor for 177 , 000 in gifts and cash from a dietary supplements executive limited by law to one term as governor , mr mcdonnell , who left office in january , was in the mix as a possible running mate for mitt romney in 2012 and was highly popular in virginia until his career cratered with the corruption investigation the case rattled the state s political class , which had never had a governor indicted and prided itself on the virginia way , an acceptance of loose ethics laws in the belief that officials would not put private interests above the public good at this point the public is so suspicious of politicians , cutting a politician slack is nothing they can rely on , said thomas m davis , a former virginia congressman and a friend of mr mcdonnell s this is , of course , a tragedy for the family , but it s a tragedy for the state mr mcdonnell s former lieutenant governor , bill bolling , wrote on his facebook page , the public s trust is hard to gain and easy to lose although other governors around the country have faced corruption charges in recent years , none of those cases unfolded in the national glare like the mcdonnell melodrama that glare was magnified because the unexpected defense of the former governor elected as a social conservative and an exemplar of traditional family values was that his pictureperfect marriage had , in fact , been photoshopped mr mcdonnell , who carried his wife over the threshold of the executive mansion the day of his inauguration , portrayed her in his testimony as a harridan whose yelling left him spiritually and mentally exhausted , and who was so cold that she did not reply to an email pleading to save their marriage the defense used the selfdebasing portrait to argue that the mcdonnells were too estranged to conspire criminally to trade favors with the vitamin executive , jonnie r williams sr the jury , which heard from 67 witnesses , had to decide whether gifts from mr williams and mr mcdonnell s actions on his behalf over two years added up to bribery and extortion at issue was whether the mcdonnells accepted the largess with corrupt intent they were not forbidden under virginia ethics laws from taking 120 , 000 in undocumented loans from mr williams , nor the gifts he bestowed such as a custom golf bag for the governor , louis vuitton shoes for the first lady , and a 15 , 000 check for their daughter s wedding at a time the first couple owed 31 , 000 on their credit cards and were hemorrhaging money on beachfront property the defense argued that actions mr mcdonnell took on behalf of mr williams s company , star scientific , the maker of the supplement anatabloc , were mere political courtesies the former governor testified that he had given mr williams the bare , basic , routine access to government and nothing more but prosecutors argued that mr mcdonnell s actions followed so closely after mr williams s gifts that they were strong circumstantial evidence of a corrupt bargain at one point , mr mcdonnell emailed an aide to see him about anatabloc issues just six minutes after discussing a 50 , 000 loan with mr williams the mcdonnells were shown to have used mr williams like an atm in may 2012 , mr mcdonnell texted the executive , suggesting , per voice mail , would like to see if you could extend another 20k loan mr williams replied within minutes done the government dismissed the defense strategy of portraying the mcdonnell marriage as broken and ms mcdonnell as a nutbag who was smitten with mr williams the former governor was trying to throw his wife under the bus , michael s dry , a prosecutor , said in closing statements but for the mcdonnells , the humiliating portrayal was meant to sow doubt about a criminal bargain by giving jurors an alternate reason for why ms mcdonnell took mr williams s gifts she was gaga for the rich executive , her lead lawyer told jurors they exchanged 1 , 200 texts and phone calls through mr williams , she found emotional solace and a way to spite her pennypinching husband , her lawyers said to maureen , this was about getting away from bob , her lawyer , william a burck , told jurors you might find the mild obsession with jonnie a little weird , he added but weird is not a crime in the end , jurors did not buy it the government relied heavily on the testimony of mr williams on the stand his version of conversations he had with the mcdonnells seemed to dot the i s and cross the t s on the legal definition of a corrupt , quid pro quo deal he said , for example , that before he handed over checks for 65 , 000 in 2011 , ms mcdonnell told him , the governor says it s ok for me to help you , but i need you to help me with this financial situation mr williams said he had reached out to the governor to confirm the arrangement because the governor was the breadwinner in the family mr mcdonnell , he said , thanked him for his help when mr mcdonnell took the stand , he denied that interaction and much else in mr williams s testimony he said that he had no advance knowledge of a 50 , 000 check from mr williams to his wife in 2011 , and that he was too beaten down by their marital rows to demand she return the money i just needed to pick the battles with my wife , he said wearily on the stand mr mcdonnell apologized for bad judgment in accepting mr williams s cash in loans he negotiated himself a year later , as well as numerous 300 golf rounds for himself and his sons but he insisted he had not sold his office no , sir , we do not make decisions based on money , mr mcdonnell snapped at a prosecutor at one point during crossexamination to discredit mr williams , the defense hammered on the fact that he was testifying under a promise that he would not be prosecuted defense lawyers portrayed him as a supersalesman who had conned the mcdonnells and was now trying to con jurors during crossexamination , a defense lawyer allowed mr williams to ramble on without interruption for 45 minutes about his business career , in which he grandiosely claimed that anatabloc was a medical breakthrough on a par with penicillin \( it has been withdrawn from the market after a food and drug administration warning \) as suggested in their body language at the defense table , where they never interacted , and in their comings and goings from the courthouse , the mcdonnells now move in separate spheres he said he was living with a roman catholic priest , a frequent supporter in court , for the duration of the trial their children would hug each parent in the courthouse corridor , or drape arms around their father as he pushed through tv cameras leaving court tuesday after deliberations began , mr mcdonnell said that the past 18 months had been tough on his family , but that he drew strength from his 38 years of marriage and his children after the verdicts , the couple got into separate cars that sped away from the courthouse
seattle pascal tessier is a 17yearold eagle scout in suburban maryland who says scouting made him who he is today , with its lessons about morality , leadership and responsibility and those very strengths , this openly gay high school senior said , are what compel and equip him to fight back now against scout policies on gays that he believes are wrong after long , anxious debate , the boy scouts' national board a year ago to allow openly gay youths to participate in scouting , while continuing to exclude gay leaders age 18 and over it was promoted as a compromise intended to offer the organization time to figure out how to proceed instead , it has brought the scouts only more ire from all directions and produced a house divided the awkwardness of the compromise do n'taskdo n'ttell silence on the one hand , and a supposedly welcoming embrace on the other , with an 18th birthday dividing the two has emboldened gay scouts like pascal to step forward with passionate editorials and online petitions conservative critics have been no less vehement rob schwarzwalder , a senior vice president at the family research council , a washingtonbased group , said judeochristian sexual ethics are fixed dislike or reject them , if you wish , but they are not malleable how can two boys both pledge to be morally straight' when they operate out of two different moral perspectives concerning human sexuality \? the partial ban is also proving legally problematic with two distinct classes of members treated differently in california , for example , state judges could be barred from involvement with the boy scouts under a proposed change of the rules on judicial ethics , which bar participation in groups practicing invidious discrimination but currently exempts nonprofit youth organizations , like the scouts in louisville , ky , the county attorney , in an opinion last month , said the city could no longer make contributions to the boy scouts because the organization violated the city s antidiscrimination policy and of the dozen or so major corporations and foundations , from alcoa to intel , that dropped funding for the scouts last year under pressure from gay advocacy groups like the human rights campaign , none have reopened wallets under the new policy , a human rights campaign spokesman said a spokesman for the boy scouts , deron smith , said the organization had no count of how many churches or other organizations opposed to gay membership may have left after last year s vote , or of how many gays might have joined nationally , he said , the scouts lost 6 percent of their total membership in 2013 , falling to about 25 million youth members and 960 , 000 adult members the scouts lost 4 percent of their membership in 2012 , before the vote our membership policy is that we do not ask people about their sexual orientation , and it s not an issue until they deliberately inject it into scouting in an inappropriate fashion , mr smith said in an email nor do we act on hearsay , allegations of belief or reports of past activities but what is clear , many scouts , leaders and parents around the nation said , is that the discussion itself has shifted , as openly gay scout leaders stay in , or try to straight scouts speak up for their gay parents and straight parents speak up for gay friends we all believe that it s going to be a gosh , i hate to say infiltration but basically recruiting more people to take leadership positions that believe that this policy is wrong , said cate readling , a straight mother of twin cub scouts in oak park , ill , just outside chicago a friend of her sons' in another scout pack 8yearold jordan arnoldanderson , whose mother , mary anderson , is a lesbian has taken a different approach on his own , ms anderson said , jordan went door to door in his neighborhood last fall , asking neighbors and friends to donate directly to his pack , so that none of the money would go to boy scout headquarters i do n't want money to go the bsa because they have discriminatory policies against my mom , jordan told the neighbors , his mother said in liberal , affluent oak park , that approach worked jordan raised 200 what it means to deliberately inject homosexuality into scouting is another question opened by the new policy and it leads , people on both sides of the issue said , to geoffrey mcgrath and the rainier beach united methodist church here in seattle mr mcgrath , a 49yearold gay , married software engineer and an eagle scout , was the scoutmaster of troop 98 , formed last year at the small , 108yearold church in a racially diverse , mixedincome neighborhood south of downtown church leaders knew that mr mcgrath was gay the committee leader at the local scout council that oversees the troop said he knew , as well mr mcgrath even went so far , in a nod to making the new troop welcoming of gays , to give it a number important to gay advocates 98 , the year that matthew shepard , a young gay man in wyoming , was beaten to death but after mr mcgrath spoke about his homosexuality in a television news profile of the troop in march , that quietly shared knowledge became public , and an order came from scouts headquarters in irving , tex , demanding his dismissal the church refused to comply , and just before easter , its charter to have a troop was revoked we were a reconciling church before he got here , said the pastor , the rev monica corsaro , referring to the united methodist movement specifically aimed at gay and lesbian inclusion we 're not going to change that what hangs over the boy scouts in all its discussions about leaders how to pick , train and monitor them is the specter of the past , when some sexual predators were able to use scouting to gain access to victims mr smith , the scouts spokesman , said the organization makes no connection between the sexual abuse , or victimization of a child , and homosexuality still , there is no question that scouting s detailed rules on youth protection are mostly about heading off inappropriate sexual behavior but the new approach since last year s vote , with what amounts to essentially a code of silence about homosexuality , with little to no guidance in the training materials on how to incorporate gay scouts into a troop or to discourage bullying of a gay scout , sends the wrong message , said pascal s mother , tracie felker if you connect the dots , it s still saying that being gay is unacceptable , she said mr smith said pascal s eagle scout status was an honor for life , whatever his age we would not revoke it , he said pascal said he planned , for now at least , to study psychology at the college of wooster in ohio beginning this fall , with the idea of becoming a counselor for adolescents and applying some of the lessons he took from scouting they gave me all the good morals that i have , he said how to value people , how to value their ideas

were officers and crew members aware of potential problems , but afraid to report them \? third , crowds interact unpredictably with technology the most controversial aspect of the wreck of the sewol has been the crew s decision to instruct the passengers to remain in their cabins this may turn out to be a fatal , even criminal error but on an unstable ship , passenger behavior can be a wild card in 1915 , the passenger steamer eastland , chartered for an excursion of young western electric factory workers and known to be prone to listing , capsized at its dock in the chicago river , trapping more than 800 aboard too many passengers were on one side of the boat , perhaps because they had rushed from one side to another as the vessel began to list and the crew tried to stabilize it with ballast the real lesson of the sewol may turn out to be that evacuating a ship or even a building is one of the most complex tasks for technology and human judgment evacuation dynamics , a discipline at the intersection of physics , engineering , architecture and social psychology , is barely 15 years old , but the principle is familiar all of those individual disciplines play a part in a successful evacuation at least two approaches to planning for future emergencies are promising where technology is inherently risky , it is possible to reduce casualties significantly by fostering what social scientists call highreliability organizations teams in which all members take responsibility for safety and respond creatively to failure the best known may be the united states navy s program for flight deck operations on aircraft carriers at sea the researchers gene rochlin , todd laporte and karlene roberts describe a carrier as one gigantic school , not in the sense of rote learning , but in the positive sense of a genuine search for acquisition and improvement of skills for civilian ferries and other passenger vessels everywhere , it s time to design the vessels and organize the crews for safety from the inside out to rethink ship layouts in the light of human behavior in emergencies to be certified in the united states by the federal aviation authority , a commercial aircraft must be capable of evacuation within 90 seconds , even if half the exits are blocked obviously so rapid an evacuation is impossible at sea , nor would it normally be required but a collaboration of designers and behavioral scientists , financed by shipbuilders , shipping lines and maritime insurance companies , should create realistic goals , and then develop new and tested procedures that could avoid panic and cut evacuation time as software for simulation and computerassisted design improves , a new generation of safer designs and more efficient evacuation procedures should be achievable evidence of past successes is all around us today s outwardopening building doors have panic bars and prominent exit signs for a reason lessons learned as long ago as chicago s iroquois theater fire of 1903 , which killed over 600 people , many of whom piled up at exits of a new fireproof structure today s goal should be not just finding blame for failure and giving credit for success in disaster management , but creating a new generation of marine technology
albuquerque an albuquerque police officer fatally shot a suspected car thief on monday during a foot chase in which , officials said , the suspect pointed a gun at the officer as he closed in on her the shooting occurred 11 days after the justice department rebuked the police department for engaging in a pattern or practice of unconstitutional use of deadly force police chief gorden eden made a terse statement to reporters in the morning , reciting the basics of the shooting , like its location the officers spotted the suspect running east of wyoming boulevard on zuni road later , the department released the sex of the victim , the first woman to be fatally shot by the police here since 2010 as of early evening , her name had not been released because her relatives had not been notified chief eden said the officer had been placed on administrative leave , standard procedure in shootings involving the police tensions over the department s use of deadly force have resulted in heated protests against the police in recent weeks twentyfour people have been killed by the police since 2010 , and the city has paid several millions of dollars in legal settlements as a result of some of the deaths none of the officers involved in the shootings have faced criminal charges or , in most cases , other types of internal reprimand the justice department said inadequate training , improper oversight and systemic deficiencies had fostered a culture of permissiveness among officers and undermined the community s trust in them in its report , the result of a 16month investigation into allegations of abuse by the police here , the justice department listed 44 remedies among them were significant revisions to training so officers learn to rely more on verbal warnings and less on stun guns were used pervasively in nonlethal confrontations , including those that involved elderly , drunken or emotionally disturbed individuals the report also suggested the use of clearer procedures for handling people with mental illness , a common thread among most of those killed or wounded in police shootings here it is unclear if mental illness was a factor in monday s shooting mayor richard j berry named a retired veteran of the department , robert huntsman , this month as the assistant chief in charge of overseeing the changes , particularly as they apply to the 1 million set aside for crisisintervention training and programs the choice raised questions among community leaders because of mr huntsman s close ties to chief eden the albuquerque journal , new mexico s largest newspaper , described them as close friends and because many of the shootings took place before he retired in may 2012 while he was there at the albuquerque police department , it was pretty bad , ralph arellanes , state director of the league of united latin american citizens , said monday the league was one of the first groups to call for a federal investigation of the police mr huntsman is just one part of a team that the mayor is assembling to help overhaul the department , mr berry said monday afternoon others include scott greenwood , a member of the american civil liberties union national board , and tom streicher , a former police chief of cincinnati , he said mr berry said he saw no problem with the friendship between mr huntsman and chief eden i have two individuals who have known each other over the years and have a mutual respect for each other , he said mr huntsman will serve as a gobetween for chief eden and the police department s field services , support services and investigative bureaus , and will supervise its internal affairs unit and training academy he is to attend a training session scheduled for police officers on thursday , and the justice department has invited residents to attend that event and bring suggestions federal officials have also urged the community to submit comments and concerns by phone or through email , and invited advocacy and civic groups , victims , police officers and union representatives to a series of yettobescheduled meetings
there was a pitcher in japan in the 1950s and '60s named kazuhisa inao who was so good that the popular saying at the time was god , buddha , inao , in deference to the pitcher s almost otherworldly talent inao retired in 1969 , and the saying stood for decades , until last year , when it was resurrected and modified in honor of a pitcher who had a perfect season now it is god , buddha , inao and tanaka not even daisuke matsuzaka or yu darvish , two celebrated japanese pitchers who preceded masahiro tanaka to the major leagues , could stake that claim but tanaka , like buddha , never lost a regularseason game last year he went 240 with a 127 earned run average for the rakuten eagles , and so warranted the rephrasing and with exalted status will now come olympian news media coverage in the united states the signed tanaka , 25 , to a 155 million , sevenyear contract last month , and tanakasama \( sama is a designation of great respect \) will now be joining a yankees team that already has two revered japanese players on its roster in and hiroki kuroda other major league teams have had as many as three japanese players on the roster at the same time , and one the boston red sox even briefly had four but none have had the prestigious group the yankees now has as a result , the entourage of japanese news media trailing the yankees in 2014 could be a recordsetter when darvish joined the texas rangers in 2012 , he was met at their spring training facility by about 150 reporters , the overwhelming majority of them from japan , according to john blake , the rangers' executive vice president for communications and when darvish arrived , the rangers already had koji uehara and yoshinori tateyama on their roster but only darvish was a star the yankees , in contrast , were already attracting a great deal of attention from the japanese news media because suzuki and kuroda are such prominent players , with suzuki almost surely headed to the hall of fame adding to the japanese interest in the yankees is the simple fact they are the most famous baseball team in the world and that hideki matsui played in the bronx from 2003 to 2009 when matsui , who had previously been a renowned slugger with the immensely popular yomiuri giants of tokyo , showed up for his first spring training with the yankees , the japanese news media s attention was epic numerous television stations and reporters were on hand , and photographers lined up along the foul line from the rightfield foul pole all the way to home plate and then up the left side of the field to the thirdbase dugout i had never seen anything like it , and i'm not sure i ever will again , said jason zillo , the yankees' executive director for media relations so , we 've been down this road before we 've seen it with our own eyes , and we have an idea what to expect it s something to look forward to in all , five major league teams have had three japanese players at one time , according to the elias sports bureau , including the 2012 rangers , the seattle mariners from 2002 to 2005 , the 2003 los angeles dodgers and the 2005 mets , whose roster included kazuhisa ishii , shingo takatsu and kazuo matsui according to elias , the only time a major league team has had four japanese players on its roster at the same time came in september 2009 , when the red sox , for a few days , had matsuzaka , hideki okajima , takashi saito and junichi tazawa on their pitching staff in addition to tanaka , suzuki and kuroda , the yankees have also invited tateyama , a former ranger , to spring training with a chance to make the 25man roster as a righthanded reliever if he does make the team , and if suzuki is not traded and kuroda and tanaka remain healthy , the yankees could become the first team to have four players from japan on its openingday roster we 've had players from japan before , yankees general manager brian cashman said we 've had many players from the dominican republic at one time , or from venezuela so we are used to it once they put on the pinstripe jersey , they are all from the same place they are yankees more specifically , they are outstanding players suzuki has the most major league hits of any japaneseborn player \( 2 , 742 \) and has a shot at reaching 3 , 000 kuroda has a career earned run average of 340 , the lowest of any japanese pitcher with at least 100 starts in the major leagues and tanaka , is , well , tanaka jeff nelson , a former yankees and seattle reliever , was on the mariners when they had suzuki , kazuhiro sasaki and shigetoshi hasegawa playing together it can be a zoo , he said of the coverage that resulted ichiro was the elvis of japan , and there were tons of reporters around but i came from the yankees and i was used to a lot of media so for me , it was n't a big deal at all i enjoyed it nelson said he rarely saw the three japanese players interacting among themselves , and said they almost never went out together hasegawa , who retired in 2006 and still lives in california , was intent on learning english and would socialize with the englishspeaking members of the bullpen actually , the way japanese players interact on a major league team is something that fascinated mike peters , the interpreter for ryota igarashi on the 2010 and 2011 mets igarashi actually formed a japanese bullpen tandem on the mets in 2010 , although hisanori takahashi thrived while igarashi struggled peters said that the traditional japanese mentoring relationship of senpaikohai with senpai representing the higherranking or longerserving player and kohai the newcomer was paramount , and that he expected tanaka to be the kohai to kuroda s senpai i think having kuroda there will help tanaka quite a bit , peters said by telephone from japan kuroda has been through it all he has made the adjustment to the major leagues , and tanaka can learn from him that does n't necessarily mean they will be friends , but they will have the senpaikohai relationship , which is important part of what kuroda , a sixyear major league veteran who turns 39 next week , can do to help tanaka is to show him how to navigate the continual attention according to zillo , 30 japanese news media members have requested credentials for spring training , with dozens more expected to apply not counting those who are members of the baseball writers association of america , who do not need to make specific requests zillo said he expected there would be at least 100 members of the news media with credentials when yankee pitchers and catchers report on feb 14 i'm eager for it , zillo said it s exciting it s exciting for everyone involved
washington a month after the execution of jang songthaek , widely viewed as s secondmostpowerful leader , remains stymied in relations with its reclusive , defiant neighbor this is not a new story though few in beijing are prepared to admit it , china s policies toward north korea have long been a conspicuous failure china s official reactions to the north s internal power struggle have , thus far , been limited largely to formulaic calls for internal stability but mr jang s ouster must be deeply disquieting to senior chinese policy makers , who yet again find themselves on the outside looking in by nearly all indications , leaders in beijing were blindsided by the latest events by contrast , south korean intelligence disclosed mr jang s fall from power a full five days before its stunning climax at a politburo meeting on dec 8 the kim dynasty intends to keep china in the dark as fully as it can chinese leaders , including president xi jinping , voice periodic frustration with north korea , but none seems able or willing to translate pyongyang s ever increasing economic dependence on china into meaningful influence from the earliest years of china s reforms , under deng xiaoping , beijing has repeatedly sought to coax north korea toward gradual economic change , normal relations with the outside world and increased attentiveness to chinese interests yet north korea continues to exhibit its characteristic mix of demands and defiance , including repeated threats aimed at south korea and accelerated development of and longrange ballistic missiles opposed by all outside powers , including china other than some modest steps toward informal marketization in the north , china s policy record on pyongyang over three decades remains unblemished by success mr jang was china s primary channel into the north this did not make him beijing s man , but he had far more extensive international experience than any other leader in pyongyang his control of various business interests in the north and responsibility for special economic zones along the chinese border enabled him to amass substantial economic power beijing probably calculated that mr jang was prepared to open a limited window into the north the chinese may also have seen him as a potential advocate for stability which they had long sought in north korea but never found but mr jang had undoubtedly acquired numerous enemies during decades of unforgiving political warfare in pyongyang there were mounting suspicions within ruling circles that he was too beholden to chinese interests mr jang s accumulation of wealth and his economic links with china proved his undoing once kim jongun , the third leader of the kim dynasty , demanded a redistribution of the spoils north korean officials linked to mr jang now find themselves under suspicion reportedly , others have also been purged or executed advocates of cooperation with china face greater risks as mr kim consolidates his power and demands unquestioning loyalty from all subordinates without reliable allies in north korea , china must deal with an impetuous and grandiose young leader who pays china very little heed mr jang s fall from power is the latest in a long succession of chinese policy failures in north korea many analysts argue that north korea is a buffer state for china , used by beijing to insulate it from american pressure but the reverse is more the case china is a buffer state for north korea , for beijing continues to be pyongyang s primary enabler chinese foreign policy currently appears bold and assertive , but on the peninsula china s stance remains exceedingly riskaverse the question is why beijing continues to exhibit such caution , even outright timidity , toward the north some argue that the legacy of the korean war weighs heavily on the minds of more traditional constituencies within the chinese communist party and army but deeper , current anxieties also inhibit beijing china fears that extreme actions by an unpredictable , heavily armed neighbor with a xenophobic leadership could trigger a larger crisis on the peninsula that would quickly involve china lacking realistic options to control north korean behavior , china prefers instead to avoid doing anything that might alienate pyongyang while china insists that it wants normal statetostate relations with north korea , it is not prepared to impose conditions on its isolated , troublesome neighbor , much less undertake a larger reassessment of its policies as a consequence , mr kim sees little reason to follow china s advice , and he will continue to zealously guard against chinese influence on the north the one exception to china s passivity toward the north is its promotion of closer ties with seoul south korea s trade with china now exceeds 250 billion , more than the south s combined trade with japan and the united states \( china s twoway trade with north korea is worth approximately 6 billion \) south korea s president , park geunhye , has already been welcomed on a state visit to beijing there has been no equivalent welcome for mr kim , and it is not even certain that he seeks one china exhibits ample unease about addressing the larger risks posed by north korea s actions and goals the purge of mr jang serves only to underscore beijing s lack of influence in pyongyang the united states and south korea both hope for more from china , but beijing seems paralyzed in policy indecision the failures of policy on the korean peninsula are not those of china alone , but beijing s risk aversion bespeaks a larger absence of will and imagination on china s part without a more candid conversation among beijing , seoul and washington , the latent risk of an acute threat on the peninsula remains uncomfortably high south korea and the united states seem fully prepared for serious dialogue with china only beijing seems unable to decide , leaving unaddressed the prospect of a severe crisis that cannot possibly be in china s interest
one of the problems with belonging to a faction that s convinced it s on the winning side of intellectual history is that it becomes easy to persuade oneself that one s own worldview has no weak points whatsoever , no internal contradictions or ragged edges , no cracks through which a critic s wedge could end up driven this kind of overconfidence has been displayed , at various points in the human story , by everyone from millenarians to marxists , inquisitors to eugenicists but right now its vices are often found in a certain type of atheistic polemicist , and in a style of antireligious argument that s characterized by a peculiar , almostwilled ignorance of why reasonable people might doubt the scientificmaterialist worldview a case in point the university of chicago professor jerry coyne s response , republished by the new republic , to my christmas column on the various modern american worldpictures and what each one owes to the scene in bethlehem that column took a concluding dig at secular naturalism , for which coyne is a prominent evangelist , suggesting that its view of the cosmos a purposeless , purely physical universe , in which human life is accidental , human history directionless , and human consciousness probably an illusion is at odds with its general political and moral posture \( liberal , egalitarian , rightbased , progressive \) in ways that make the entire worldpicture ripe for reassessment or renovation so it s entirely fair that coyne took the opportunity to deliver some body blows to theism and christianity in return what s striking about his response , though , is the extent to which its own account of the secular , materialist worldpicture actually illustrates precisely the problems and tensions that i was talking about , in ways that even a casual reader should find obvious but which coyne apparently did not he can see the weak points in a religious argument , but the weaknesses of his own side of the debate are sufficiently invisible to him that his rebuttal flirts with selfcaricature let me offer two examples first , to the idea that the materialist s purposeless cosmos poses some problems for the liberal view \( or any view \) of moral and political purpose in human affairs , coyne responds i m not sure what douthat means when he says cosmology does not harmonize at all with the moral picture of secularism cosmology doesn t give one iota of evidence for a purpose \( it could ! \) or for god most of the universe is cold , bleak , airless , and uninhabitable in fact , such a cosmology harmonizes far better with a secular moral picture than a religious one secularists see a universe without apparent purpose and realize that we must forge our own purposes and ethics , not derive them from a god for which there s no evidence yes , secularism does propose a physical and purposeless universe , and many \( but not all \) of us accept the notion that our sense of self is a neuronal illusion but although the universe is purposeless , our lives aren t this conflation of a purposeless universe \( ie , one not created by a transcendent being for a specific reason \) with purposeless human lives is a trick that the faithful use to make atheism seem dark and nihilistic but we make our own purposes , and they re real right now my purpose is to write this piece , and then i ll work on a book i m writing , and later i ll have dinner with a friend soon i ll go to poland to visit more friends maybe later i ll read a nice book and learn something soon i ll be teaching biology to graduate students those are real purposes , not the illusory purposes to which douthat wants us to devote our only life obviously the foregoing is not the end of the argument there are many talented philosophers who have spent their careers trying to iron out this particular kink in the eliminativematerialist fabric , or explaining why it s not actually a major kink at all , and there s no reason why you should take a newspaper columnist s side against their formidable qualifications but the point is that if you re going to argue about this , with a newspaper columnist or anyone , you have to actually make the argument you can t just blithely assert what looks like contradiction and claim to be defending science and reason against the obscurantism of religion or rather , you can but you won t make your side look particularly good then further down , here s coyne on the morals of a materialist as for where altruism comes from , who knows \? my own suspicions are that it s partly genetic and partly cultural , but what s important is that we feel it and can justify it i can justify it on several grounds , including that altruism makes for a more harmonious society , helps those in need , and , as a selfish motive , that being altruistic gains you more respect none of this justification has anything to do with god again , if this is the scientificmaterialist s justification for morality , then the worldview has even more problems than i suggested coyne proposes three arguments in favor of a cosmopolitan altruism , two of which are circular making a harmonious society and helping those in need are reasons for altruism that presuppose a certain view of the moral law , in which charity and harmony are considered worthwhile and important goals \( if my question is , what s the justification for your rightsbased egalitarianism \? saying because it s egalitarian ! is not much of an answer \) the third at least seems to have some kind of darwinianish , quasiscientific logic , but among other difficulties it s an argument that only holds so long as the altruistic choice comes at a relatively low cost if you re a white southerner debating whether to speak out against a lynching party or a dutch family contemplating whether to hide your jewish neighbors from the ss , the respect factor isn t really in play as , indeed , it rarely is in any moral dilemma worthy of the name \( and of course , depending on your ideas about harmony and stability , coyne s harmonious society argument might also seem like a case against opposing jim crow or antisemitism because why rock the boat on behalf of a persecuted minority when stability and order are the greater goods \? \) the point that critics make against eliminativematerialism , which coyne seems not to grasp , is that it makes a kind of hardandfast moral realism logically impossible because if the only real thing is matter in motion , and the only legitimate method of discernment the scientific method , you ll never get to an absolute thou shalt not murder \( or thou shalt risk your life on behalf of your jewish neighbor \) now matter how cleverly you think and argue this is not necessarily a theistic objection it s one of the issues raised in thomas nagel s controversygenerating book , which explicitly keeps religious ideas at arm s length and for that matter there are forms of theism that need not imply moral realism , and euthyphrostyle objections to the union of the two but i don t think those of us who still embrace the traditional western idea of god are crazy to suggest that our cosmology has at least a surface compatibility with moral realism that the materialist conception of the universe s \( nonexistent \) purposes seems to lack so if you re going to defend both materialism and modern rightsbased liberalism , you have to actually address this point headon make a case for a more limited , nonmetaphysical form of moral realism , make a more thoroughgoing attempt to discern some sort of moral teleology in the darwinian story \( though of course coyne has denounced efforts along these lines as creationism for liberals \) , go full relativist and make a purely aesthetic case for cosmopolitanism , i don t care what but give me something that doesn t either beg the question \( we should help people because it helps people ! \) or pretend that there are actually solid selfish reasons for the most costly , heroic , and plainly selfsacrificial forms of nonselfinterested behavior finally , i enjoyed coyne s parting sally douthat is wrong the cracks are not in the edifice of secularism , but in the temples of faith as he should know if he reads his own newspaper , secularism is not cracking up but growing in the us he and his fellow religionists are on the way out , and his columns are his swan song it may take years , but one fine day our grandchildren will look back on people like douthat , shake their heads , and wonder why some people couldn t put away their childish things for a man who believes in a physical and purposeless universe with no room for teleology , coyne seems remarkably confident about what direction human history is going in , and where it will end up for my part , i don t make any pretense to know what ideas will be au courant a hundred years from now , and as i said in the column , i think there are all kinds of worldviews that could gain ground at the expense of my own catholicism and secular materialism alike \( right now , the territory around pantheism and panpsychism seems ripe for further population , but that s just a guess \) but i suppose it s a testament to my own childish faith in the neuronal illusion that is the human intellect that i can t imagine a permanent intellectual victory for a worldview as illserved by its popularizers as atheism is by jerry coyne
mo ne davis , the 13yearold pitcher for the taney dragons from pennsylvania , has been the sensation of the little league world series a 70mileperhour fastball , impeccable control , backtoback shutouts , she s been on the cover of sports illustrated and has been interviewed by nearly every major television network though the taney team s run was ended by an exciting game against chicago the mostwatched little league game in espn history mo ne s achievement is impressive by any standard but why is it that her gender is the anomaly that makes her talent mediaworthy \? in schoolyards and streets , for as long as most of us can remember , you throw like a little girl ! has been a common insult , almost always directed at a male in philosophy , the phrase often leads to the consideration of an influential essay in feminist literature , throwing like a girl , by the political philosopher iris marion young , who died in 2006 her essay , first published in 1980 in human studies , and reprinted often since , deconstructs this trope to analyze the patriarchal and essentialist assumptions that give the insult its sting it is an essential work not only in feminism , but in thinking about the way embodiment shapes subjectivity , and the essay came to my mind often during the exciting emergence of mo ne the act of throwing is an aggressive one , a projecting outward like shooting an arrow from a bow or a bullet from a gun or martial , like throwing a punch the thrown object aims to hit something , or someone , or at least a strategic mark it s not outlandish to think the act first sprung from hunting , with a rock thrown at prey none of these characteristics , at least within the parameters young describes , are even remotely associated in our culture with the feminine young acknowledged that throwing like a girl is an observable phenomenon the girlie throw results from a restricted use of lateral space that tends to come only from the localized part of the body that is doing the action the hand and forearm and rarely uses the whole arm , the whole body , or the extended space around the body that is necessary to execute the throw women tend to concentrate our effort on those parts of the body most immediately connected to the task , she writes , and do not bring to the task the power of the shoulder , which is necessary for its efficient performance think of the woman as she passes the pickle jar to the man to open the inability to not open the jar has nothing to do with inherent strength , young argues , but has to do the utilization of the entire body for the task , something that is not rooted in anatomical or biological limitations , but the whole social , political and aesthetic history of how females come to learn to be their bodies in space and time a space surrounds us in imagination that we are not free to move beyond , young writes of women such restriction , constriction and fragmentation can be observed in many everyday movements , including the way a woman walks , sits and carries books \( girls and woman most often carry books embraced to their chests , while boys and men swing them along their sides \) women s movements tend to be reserved , protective , and reactive betraying that the woman experiences herself as rooted and enclosed the experience of female embodiment in sexist society closes space , time and the imagined future possibilities of becoming and achievement it is a closure not just of the body , but of the mind and will feminine existence experiences the body as a mere thing a fragile thing , which must be picked up and coaxed into movement , a thing that exists as looked at and acted upon , young writes to be sure , there certainly are boys who throw like girls \( my own little league memories involve having my throwing style being laughed at by the other boys \) likewise , there are women who do not have comportments that are so restricted if you observe bodies on the subway or in any city street , you will see women who move more freely and men who are constricted more variations would emerge in observing both men and women from african , asian or arabic cultures young herself writes , the account developed here claims only to describe the modalities of the feminine bodily existence for women situated in contemporary advanced , industrial , urban , and commercial society young did not mean her theory to be comprehensive or without exception , only to emphasize that , it is in the process of growing up as a girl that the modalities of feminine bodily comportment , motility , and spatiality make their appearance in young s conception , to throw like a girl has nothing to do with some mysterious female essence that prevents girls from throwing balls or being athletic , but has its source in the particular situation of women as conditioned by their sexist oppression in contemporary society throwing like a girl is a result of the way that females learn to be in their bodies and learn to move in patriarchal space women in sexist society are physically handicapped for young , the issue is larger than the physical specifics it is the body , not the mind or spirit , that is the ground of freedom she draws from the work of the french philosopher maurice merleauponty , who , young writes , locates subjectivity not in mind or consciousness , but in the body  the most obvious image of the loss of freedom is the body shackled in a prison cell but just because the chains are not immediately visible , does not mean that the body is not surrounded by various social constrictions and limits if the body is the ground of meaningmaking and subjectivity , the female body in sexist society quickly learns to cut off the very medium through which it might make meaning and cultivate subjectivity all athletes are broken down into eversmaller measurable stats height , weight , 40yard dash , vertical leap , etc the language we use to describe the athlete is often language used to describe the inhuman or the animal freak , beast , more so when it comes to black athletes further , athletes become an object of capital , a brand to be marketed and sold , to have their face and name mechanically reproduced , disseminated , traded , and quantifiable as profit where then remains the subject \? where then the freedom or , in the language of the existentialists and phenomenologists , the transcendence of the athlete \? the female athlete has the additional burden \( de beauvoir s way of describing how the female experiences her body \) of the contradiction \( she must be both subject and object , masculine and feminine , active and passive \) that make the obstacles preventing the realization of their subjectivity and freedom seem insurmountable mo ne has already had to face such dismissal and sexism in an interview on fox and friends , the show s host eric bolling asked mo ne a blatantly sexist question what about a you know , typically , uh , i don t know , more femalefriendly sport , like soccer \? no \? mo ne , without hesitation , replied , well , i play soccer actually \( the way that soccer is often dismissed as feminized in american culture is a subject for a whole other essay \) part of the contradiction of female embodiment is the fact that in performing the very activity that would reclaim the patriarchal domination and colonization of the space and time , the woman possibly opens herself to even more scrutiny and objectification the female body on display , as is the case with athletes , becomes another commodity in the economy of male gazes her effort to enter the realm of male freedom through her athletic activity only serves to further discredit her as a female because now she is manly , or butch , or she becomes a hot athlete , a pretty little automaton who is not taken seriously \( think especially of the different ways in which the popular discourse depicts athletes like serena williams and maria sharapova \) to open her body in free , active , open extension and bold outwarddirections is for a woman to invite objectification , young writes it also leads to the threat of invasion of her body space the most extreme form of such spatial and bodily invasion is the threat of rape young female athletes like mo ne davis should be encouraged and supported , not treated as anomalies but as models of what it means to throw like a girl young girls must learn that their embodiment is a source of freedom , not incarceration , a source of pride , not shame athletic activity encourages not only selfmastery but mastery of the space and time through which they become not to become strong like the boys , but to to realize the wholeness of their personality , to be free mo ne , and all of the other great female athletes past and present , do not only challenge the ways we think about athletic excellence , but , more important , they begin to undo the oppressive and objectified ways in which women come to be in their bodies mo ne is not simply throwing amazing pitches , serena is not simply acing serves , maya moore is not simply swishing nets they are resisting the colonized space around the female body they are liberating the female body from its shackles they are models of activity and autonomy that are as important to gender equality as any law might be freedom is not simply a phenomenon of the will , as the stoics might insist our bodies are both the ground and medium that make freedom possible to throw like a boy or act like a man or any of the thousand phrases that use man as the model of subjectivity betrays the patriarchal situation inside which our society shapes bodies , shapes what constitute freedoms and what types of bodies are allowed to realize those freedoms for the woman the very act of reaching back , twisting the body , and hurling an object forward to its target is an act of revolt it is the assertion of space and place , of freedom and subjectivity to throw is to not simply be in space , but to be the very ground of space and time young s essay is an important reminder in this context , to throw is not simply a movement of the body , but a way for the subject to assert herself , her subjectivity , and her freedom by rising above and beyond mere embodiment i throw , therefore i am

in 2005 , when tamara green told and the philadelphia inquirer that drugged and sexually assaulted her in the early 1970s , one of mr cosby s lawyers publicly branded the allegations absolutely false , while his aides approached another newspaper with damaging information about her , according to court documents five years earlier , after an actress on mr cosby s tv series cosby told the police that he had tried to put her hand down his sweatpants at his new york townhouse , mr cosby s lawyers threatened the national enquirer with a 250 million defamation suit for publishing detailed comments about the incident by the woman s relatives and when mr cosby acknowledged an extramarital affair in a 1997 interview with dan rather , his agent telephoned the president of cbs entertainment to demand that the segment not air on 60 minutes as planned it did not , although cbs news said the decision had nothing to do with the call as accusations of sexual assault continue to mount against mr cosby more than two dozen women have gone public , the latest last monday the question arises as to why these stories never sparked a widespread outcry before while many of the women say they never filed police complaints or went public because they feared damaging their reputations or careers , the aggressive legal and media strategy mounted by mr cosby and his team may also have played a significant role an examination of how the team has dealt with scandals over the past two decades and into this fall reveals an organized and expensive effort that involved quashing accusations as they emerged while raising questions about the accusers' character and motives , both publicly and surreptitiously and the team has never been shy about blasting the news media for engaging in a feeding frenzy even as the team made deals or slipped the news organizations information that would cast mr cosby s accusers in a negative light playing hardball with people who make \( and report on \) incendiary claims is hardly a new tactic in the celebrity world but given the volume and severity of the recent charges , with numerous women saying mr cosby drugged and then sexually assaulted them , some legal and public relations practitioners question the wisdom of continuing to counterpunch sometimes in a case like this , less can be more , said benjamin brafman , a criminal defense lawyer who represented dominique strausskahn attacking someone who is perceived to be a victim' can often be unproductive i would suggest , mr brafman added , a softly spoken denial rather than an outspoken challenge to the integrity of the women now coming forward simply put , it may be better to say nothing than try and engage so many the team behind mr cosby s longtime strategy has included john p schmitt , a lawyer from the new york law firm patterson belknap webb tyler norman brokaw , mr cosby s longtime agent at the william morris agency until late 2012 and norman s son david brokaw , who has been mr cosby s publicist for 40 years in addition , at several critical moments over the past few decades , mr cosby has called on martin d singer , an 850anhour lawyer with a reputation for playing rough on behalf of clients like charlie sheen and arnold schwarzenegger when they found themselves embroiled in controversy he is a bulldog , david r ginsburg , executive director of the entertainment , media and intellectual property law program at the ucla school of law , said of mr singer mr singer s intensity was on full display in the first week of december after judy huth filed a civil suit in los angeles superior court , alleging that in 1974 , when she was 15 , mr cosby plied her with drinks and forced her to perform a sex act on him in a bedroom at the playboy mansion in court papers , mr singer said ms huth s claim was meritless and nothing short of a shakedown according to mr singer , ms huth and her lawyer had first demanded money to keep them from going public and ms huth had tried unsuccessfully to sell the allegations to a tabloid 10 years earlier \( ms huth s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment \) it was not the first time that the word shakedown had been used to describe the motives of those coming forward with accusations of sexual abuse by mr cosby back in 2005 , after andrea constand , a temple university basketball manager , told the police in pennsylvania that mr cosby had drugged and sexually abused her at his home in pennsylvania the year before , a story appeared on celebrity justice , a tv show and website created by the founder of tmz sources connected with bill cosby , the show reported , said that before ms constand had approached the police , her mother had asked mr cosby to make things right with money the show went on to say that a cosby representative had called this a classic shakedown mr singer was the cosby representative in question , another member of mr cosby s legal team said at a court hearing in 2005 , and the next year ms constand sued him for defamation \( her lawyers denied the charge at the time \) that suit and ms constand s suit against mr cosby were later consolidated and settled confidentially mr singer declined to comment for this article mr schmitt , who has been a lawyer for mr cosby for more than 30 years , has also played a significant role both behind the scenes and publicly perhaps most notably in beating back the accusations of autumn jackson , who claimed to be mr cosby s daughter when ms jackson , in 1997 , threatened to sell the story to the tabloid the globe unless mr cosby paid her 40 million , mr schmitt agreed to wear a recording device as part of a law enforcement operation that charged her with extortion and after ms jackson was found guilty , mr schmitt took the unusual step of appearing on geraldo rivera s cnbc show , rivera live , in 1997 , and saying that mr cosby would take a blood test to determine paternity mr schmitt declined to comment for this article the cosby team s media strategy over the years has been a mix of hardball and playing ball , sometimes even with the same news organization though the cosby legal team threatened the national enquirer in 2000 with a 250 million lawsuit , relations with that tabloid were decidedly more friendly five years later after ms constand , the temple university employee , had gone public with her accusations against mr cosby , the national enquirer was pursuing a story about another woman , beth ferrier , who said mr cosby had drugged and sexually assaulted her in the mid1980s in exchange for not publishing its article about ms ferrier , the enquirer got an exclusive interview with mr cosby \( the headline bill cosby ends his silence my story ! \) , according to recently unsealed court documents team cosby would also try to apply pressure behind the scenes in 1997 , soon after mr cosby s son , ennis , was murdered in los angeles , mr cosby gave his first interview to dan rather of cbs news for much of the two and a half hours of questioning , mr rather focused on the crime and how mr cosby was dealing with the grief but he then gingerly asked about ms jackson and the extortion charges , which had just become public days before mr cosby , surprisingly , acknowledged the affair with the mother and said that he could possibly be the father when the network aired the newsiest tidbits from mr rather s forthcoming 60 minutes segment on the morning and evening news programs , norman brokaw , mr cosby s william morris agent and one of the most powerful people in television at the time , called leslie moonves , then the president of cbs entertainment , to complain about the treatment of the network s star days later after mr rather had recorded his audio for 60 minutes cbs news decided to scrap the segment cbs executives denied any corporate interference , saying journalistic reasons had prompted the move in the biography cosby , mark whitaker writes that bad blood between don hewitt , the powerful executive producer of 60 minutes , and mr rather also drove the decision mr hewitt , who despised mr rather , was furious that the newsiest excerpts had already been broadcast mr moonves and mr rather declined to comment during this recent spate of accusations , the cosby team has suggested that the proliferation of accounts is itself a reason to distrust them and has pointed to apparent inconsistencies in some of the women s stories it has also systematically directed its ire at the news media , which it claims is engaged in a blind rush to judgment against a man who has never been convicted or charged mr singer threatened to sue buzzfeed last month as it prepared an article about accusations by janice dickinson , a onetime supermodel , that mr cosby drugged and raped her in 1982 in lake tahoe in california you proceed at your peril , mr singer wrote , saying that ms dickinson had told a contradictory story in her memoir more than a decade earlier and in the past 10 days , he has sent angry letters to cnn and the daily news , accusing them of abandoning any journalistic rigor in their coverage the media has consistently refused to look into or publish information about various women whose stories are contradicted by their own conduct or statement , he wrote in his letter to the daily news mr singer is n't the only one following the blamethemedia handbook on dec 15 , mr cosby s wife , camille , finally broke her silence and joined the defense of her husband in a statement released by david brokaw , she said , there appears to be no vetting of my husband s accusers before stories are published or aired she concluded none of us will ever want to be in the position of attacking the victim but the question should be asked who is the victim \? but casting doubt on or aiming vitriol at the accusers can have consequences in 2005 , when mr cosby s team denied tamara green s accusations that he had drugged and sexually assaulted her in los angeles in the early 1970s , she did not pursue legal action but this month she was ready to fight back mr cosby s team had greeted her renewed claim of sexual assault by saying it was a 10year discredited accusation that proved to be nothing at the time , and is still nothing on dec 10 , ms green filed a defamation suit against mr cosby , saying the denials basically branded her a liar i want it put to a jury , ms green said earlier this month i want it ended , finally i want my name restored
you know , i actually used to be so worried about not having a body , but now i truly love it i m not tethered to time and space in the way that i would be if i was stuck inside a body that s inevitably going to die samantha , in her set in the nottoodistant future , spike jonze s film her explores the romantic relationship between samantha , a computer program , and theodore twombly , a human being though samantha is not human , she feels the pangs of heartbreak , intermittently longs for a body and is bewildered by her own evolution she has a rich inner life , complete with experiences and sensations her raises two questions that have long preoccupied philosophers are nonbiological creatures like samantha capable of consciousness at least in theory , if not yet in practice \? and if so , does that mean that we humans might one day be able to upload our own minds to computers , perhaps to join samantha in being untethered from a body that s inevitably going to die \? might we humans be able to upload our minds to computers , perhaps to join our digital lovers in the virtual universe \? this is not mere speculation the future of humanity institute at oxford university has released a report on the technological requirements for uploading a mind to a machine a defense department agency has funded a program , synapse , that is trying to develop a computer that resembles a brain in form and function the futurist ray kurzweil , now a director of engineering at google , has even discussed the potential advantages of forming friendships , her style , with personalized artificial intelligence systems he and others contend that we are fast approaching the technological singularity , a point at which artificial intelligence , or ai , surpasses human intelligence , with unpredictable consequences for civilization and human nature is all of this really possible \? not everyone thinks so some people argue that the capacity to be conscious is unique to biological organisms , so that even superintelligent ai programs would be devoid of conscious experience if this view is correct , then a relationship between a human being and a program like samantha , however intelligent she might be , would be hopelessly onesided moreover , few humans would want to join samantha , for to upload your brain to a computer would be to forfeit your consciousness this view , however , has been steadily losing ground its opponents point out that our best empirical theory of the brain holds that it is an informationprocessing system and that all mental functions are computations if this is right , then creatures like samantha can be conscious , for they have the same kind of minds as ours computational ones just as a phone call and a smoke signal can convey the same information , thought can have both silicon and carbonbased substrates indeed , scientists have produced siliconbased artificial neurons that can exchange information with real neurons the neural code increasingly seems to be a computational one you might worry that we could never be certain that programs like samantha were conscious this concern is akin to the longstanding philosophical conundrum known as the problem of other minds the problem is that although you can know that you yourself are conscious , you cannot know for sure that other people are you might , after all , be witnessing behavior with no accompanying conscious component in the face of the problem of other minds , all you can do is note that other people have brains that are structurally similar to your own and conclude that since you yourself are conscious , others are likely to be conscious as well when confronted with a highlevel ai program like samantha , your predicament wouldn t be all that different , especially if that program had been engineered to work like the human brain while we couldn t be certain that an ai program genuinely felt anything , we can t be certain that other humans do , either but it would seem probable in both cases if the samanthas of the future will have inner lives like ours , however , i suspect that we will not be able to upload ourselves to computers to join them in the digital universe to see why , imagine that theodore wants to upload himself imagine , furthermore , that uploading involves \( a \) scanning a human brain in such exacting detail that it destroys the original and \( b \) creating a software model that thinks and behaves in precisely the same way as the original did if theodore were to undergo this procedure , would he succeed in transferring himself into the digital realm \? or would he , as i suspect , succeed only in killing himself , leaving behind a computational copy of his mind one that , adding insult to injury , would date his girlfriend \? ordinary physical objects follow a continuous path through space over time for theodore to transfer his mind into a computer program , however , his mind would not follow a continuous trajectory his brain would be destroyed when the scan was made , and the information about his precise brain configuration would be sent to a computer , which could be miles away furthermore , if theodore were to truly upload his mind \( as opposed to merely copy its contents \) , then he could be downloaded to multiple other computers suppose that there are five such downloads which one is the real theodore \? it is hard to provide a nonarbitrary answer could all of the downloads be theodore \? this seems bizarre as a rule , physical objects and living things do not occupy multiple locations at once it is far more likely that none of the downloads are theodore , and that he did not upload in the first place worse yet , imagine that the scanning procedure doesn t destroy theodore s brain , so the original theodore survives if he survives the scan , why conclude that his consciousness has transferred to the computer \? it should still reside in his brain but if you believe that his mind doesn t transfer if his brain isn t destroyed , then why believe that his mind does transfer if his brain is destroyed \? it is here that we press up against the boundaries of the digital universe it seems there is a categorical divide between humans and programs humans cannot upload themselves to the digital universe they can upload only copies of themselves copies that may themselves be conscious beings does this mean that uploading projects should be scrapped \? i don t think so , for uploading technology can benefit our species a global catastrophe may make the world inhospitable to biological life forms , and uploading may be the only way to preserve the human way of life and thinking , if not actual humans themselves and uploading could facilitate the development of brain therapies and enhancements that can benefit humans and nonhuman animals furthermore , uploading may give rise to a form of superintelligent ai ai that is descended from us may have greater chance of being benevolent toward us finally , some humans will understandably want digital backups of themselves what if you found out that you were going to die soon \? a desire to contribute a backup copy of yourself might outweigh your desire to spend a few more days on the planet or you might wish to leave a copy of yourself to communicate with your children or complete projects that you care about indeed , the samanthas of the future might be uploaded copies of deceased humans we have loved deeply or perhaps our best friends will be copies of ourselves , but tweaked in ways we find insightful susan schneider , an associate professor of philosophy at the university of connecticut , is the author of the language of thought and science fiction and philosophy
the new york playwright david adjmi , best known for off broadway satirical works like marie antoinette , went to federal court on thursday to try to salvage his play 3c , which has been tied up by the copyright owner of three s company , the landmark television comedy that mr adjmi deconstructs through a dark lens in 3c in a 20page complaint , which was accompanied by supportive comments from acclaimed theater artists like jon robin baitz , tony kushner and stephen sondheim , mr adjmi asked the southern district court of new york to declare that 3c does not infringe on the copyright of three s company , which ran from 1977 to 1984 and remains in syndication mr adjmi s lawyers , citing the first amendment and the legal doctrine of fair use , argue that 3c is an original parody that only borrows some elements from the sitcom to examine its premise , character types , and homophobia and sexism in that era on the sitcom a single man , jack , pretended to be gay to live with two single women , janet and chrissy , and appease the uptight landlord , mr roper in the play a single man , brad , is a closeted gay man who pretends to be openly gay to live with the single women , linda and connie , and appease the uptight landlord , mr wicker the play explores the pain and selfloathing of the characters and includes drug use and sexually graphic dialogue , none of which were part of the sunny sitcom 3c had a twomonth run off broadway in 2012 , drawing mixed reviews its shot at a longer life in regional theater and overseas productions was stymied when lawyers for three s company issued a ceaseanddesist letter and told mr adjmi that he was using at least 17 elements from three s company too many , in their view , and constituting a commercial threat to the sitcom mr adjmi , afraid of being sued , agreed not to allow further productions , though he never signed anything no theaters have mounted the play since then , leaving mr adjmi without income from the play after shaking off his fears , mr adjmi , 39 , said he felt that bottling up the play was wrong , and he also wanted to take advantage of offers to publish the play in an acting edition by samuel french , and in a collection of his works organized by the theater communications group neither publisher will go forward , however , if a legal threat continues from three s company lawyers i think it s lethal for a culture to require artists to ask for permission to comment creatively on earlier works in the culture , like three s company , mr admji said in a telephone interview and i want this play to be out there as part of my body of work the three s company copyright owner , dlt entertainment , still contends that 3c too closely overlaps with the sitcom , and might confuse people who think the play is supposed to be a spinoff of the television show our position hasn t changed 3c is something that might harm our property , including a possible stage version of the television show that we ve been actively pursuing , said donald taffner jr , president of dlt entertainment , in an interview he declined to comment on the specifics of mr adjmi s suit because he had not yet seen it mr adjmi s lawyers cite multiple examples of parodies that were protected under the fair use doctrine , including the novel the wind done gone \( which retells much of gone with the wind from a slave s perspective \) and a saturday night live sketch that featured a tourism jingle from biblical times , i love sodom , sung to the tune of i love new york plays like mr burns \( which uses elements from the simpsons \) and dog sees god \( a parody of the peanuts cartoons \) have also successfully avoided copyright problems by taking personality traits and references from the original material and presenting them in wholly new ways

continent s biennial championship at each stop , the fear and stigma of ebola leads to what players say is demeaning and discouraging treatment the seychelles rather than host sierra leone , but did

playing in the street , only to see them run away , shouting , ebola , ebola you already know you are an outsider , lahoud said to be cast out by 4 and 5yearold kids is pretty disturbing scornful chants from congolese fans began as sierra leone headed toward the stadium and did not cease until the match ended , the players said the next day , seven leone stars began a long and circuitous return to their club teams in the united states and europe during a long layover in nairobi , some said they attempted to have a meal in the city but were prevented from leaving the airport by kenyan

a year or so ago , gay rights advocates were protesting mr putin for russia s antigay policies , using mr gergiev as proxy on thursday evening some two dozen ukrainians and their supporters greeted mr gergiev s appearance at carnegie hall , protesting the russian invasion and annexation of crimea and mr gergiev s endorsement of it mr gergiev was conducting the munich philharmonic , a late substitute for its music director , lorin maazel , who has been ill since mr gergiev is the orchestra s music director designate , and is scheduled to take over from mr maazel in 2015 , the substitution made perfect sense in the abstract the ukrainians begged to differ carnegie hired putin s puppet , they chanted gergiev out of new york and periodically , they sang the ukrainian national anthem the posters strived for poetry or effect some almost succeeded when the cannons are heard , the muses are silent some failed miserably crimea river none of this carried into the hall to the contrary , clive gillinson , carnegie s executive and artistic director , made a point of thanking mr gergiev from the stage for making a special trip from europe for the appearance , arriving at 11 30 friday morning and planning to fly back at 5 saturday morning \( actually , that s a pretty typical day for mr gergiev \) and the audience showed nothing but admiration for mr gergiev and his performances , evidently without regard to his politics
washington no one wrote about blondes like raymond chandler there is the small cute blonde who cheeps and twitters and the big statuesque blonde who straightarms you with an iceblue glare , he wrote in the long goodbye there is the blonde who gives you the upfromunder look and smells lovely and shimmers and hangs on your arm and is always very , very tired when you take her home there s the pale , anemic , languid blonde with the soft voice you ca n't lay a finger on her , chandler notes , because in the first place you do n't want to and in the second place she is reading the waste land' or dante in the original and when the new york philharmonic is playing hindemith , he writes dryly , she can tell you which one of the six bass viols came in a quarter of a beat too late i hear toscanini can also that makes two of them none of his descriptions , however , conjures the two regal blondes transfixing america at the moment hillary and elsa those close to them think that the queen of hillaryland and the snow queen from disney s frozen have special magical powers , but worry about whether they can control those powers , show their humanity and stir real warmth in the public heart just as elsa s coronation suddenly became fraught , so has hillary s like arendelle , america is frozen the war still rages in iraq , the clintons still dominate the political scene and hillary still obsesses about money , a narrative thread that has existed since she was thwarted in her desire to build a pool at the governor s mansion in poor arkansas and left the white house with a doggie bag full of sofas , rugs , lamps , tvs and china , some of which the clintons later had to pay for or return even chelsea was cashing in , getting a ridiculous , 600 , 000ayear scion salary from nbc , far greater than that of many of the network s correspondents as a clinton white house aide once explained to me , hillary , though a methodist , thinks of herself like an episcopal bishop who deserves to live at the level of her wealthy parishioners , in return for devoting her life to god and good works after feeling stifled at times and misunderstood , after suffering painful setbacks , the powerful and polarizing elsa and hillary proclaim from their lofty height that they 're going to let it go and go for it \( although elsa s wolves are not as fierce as the fox predators after hillary \) i do n't care what they 're going to say , elsa sings at the climactic moment when she decides to let down her hair , ratchet up her star power and create her glittering ice palace let the storm rage on the cold never bothered me anyway ! hillary had a similar cri de coeur in her interview with diane sawyer when sawyer asked her about the focus on her appearance that once kept her so scripted , cautious , safe , hillary replied when you 're in the spotlight as a woman , you know you 're being judged constantly i mean , it is just neverending and you get a little worried about , ok , you know , people over on this side are loving what i am wearing , looking like , saying people over on this side are n't you know , your natural tendency is how do you bring people together so that you can better communicate \? i'm done with that i mean , i'm just done she continued i am over it , over it i think i have changed not worried so much about what other people are thinking she vowed to now say what i know , what i believe , and let the chips fall it would make a great idina menzel anthem , but it s not believable that hillary rodham clinton will suddenly throw caution and calculation to the wind having markettested the genderneutral model in 2008 , this time hillary is presenting herself as a woman who has suffered the slings and arrows of sexism her apology for being wrong about voting to authorize w to invade iraq took 11 years to spit out , and she told the council on foreign relations on thursday that she could not have predicted the success of al qaedainspired insurgents in seizing control of iraqi cities if some bold voices had fought going into a patently unnecessary war against a country that had nothing to do with 9 11 a war , waged ignorantly for silly , macho reasons , that was never properly debated or planned in the white house america would not be in a global crouch now , and iraq would not be a killing field hillary s new memoir , like her last one , is a testament to caution and calculation it does n't feel written so much as assembled by a hillary for president algorithm all this excitement is being ginned up , but nothing exciting is happening there is n't one surprising or scintillating or provocative word in the whole book hard choices is inert , a big yawn in her if they 'd listened to me mode , she is distancing herself from the president on syria , russia and the bergdahl trade because she does not , as the former republican strategist matthew dowd puts it , want to be defeated by obama twice the opening of her book tour presidential campaign has featured some stumbles , causing some commentators to wonder if she has grown rusty and tonedeaf , isolated in the ice palace she erected to keep out the loathed press no one doubts that hillary is tough and knowledgeable but the question of how scarred and defensive she is , given all the fights and rough times she has gone through , and how that affects her judgment now , is a legitimate one has she given up the mywayorthehighway imperiousness that doomed her health care efforts \? has she toned down the defensiveness that exacerbated the whitewater affair \? has she modified the endsjustifythemeans mindset that allowed her to participate in the vivisection of young women she knew bill had been involved with \?

seattle , artistic director of pacific northwest ballet , staged a revelatory giselle for that company here in 2011 yet giselle is danced everywhere so what needed to be revealed \? in truth , the basic text of this central work is in a terrible state all 'round the world \( the same is true for most 19thcentury ballet classics , alas no classic play , opera or concert work is presented today laden with anachronistic and showy changes that are standard for the 19thcentury ballets \) mr boal s staging was a giselle stripped of mannerisms , with some surprising details and a wealth of mime and it was fresh , alive , suspenseful a giselle good for people new to the ballet , as well as for scholars the main problem was that it used borrowed designs , from the houston ballet s staging now , it has acquired its own designs , by j r me kaplan , that are attractive , efficient , full of detail but the designs add a different problem they change giselle by setting it in the 19th century instead of the late medieval era the act i huntsmen carry rifles the gamekeeper , hilarion , rival suitor for giselle s hand , is impressive in a frock coat when albrecht is caught by the wilis , the spirits of maidens abandoned at the altar , and told to dance to death , he has removed a furlined cloak and riding coat he dances in waistcoat and boots though this works remarkably well the 19thcentury features are underplayed rather than made a gimmick it robs giselle of its mythic quality this could have been an exemplary staging instead , it is an offbeat example of director s theater yet , in many respects , this is still a yardstick giselle it often shows how this ballet should go i caught this year s last three performances last weekend at mccaw hall here nothing knocked the barnacles off the ballet better than the bright tempos set by emil de cou and allan dameron the playing of the pacific northwest ballet orchestra \( despite an off patch from the brass section at one performance \) remains the finest of any american ballet troupe , beautifully showing the sensuous harmonies of the score the dancing is to match stylish , clear , ebullient i'm sorry to have missed carla k rbes s giselle this time in 2011 , this marvelous ballerina was already compelling of the three casts i saw , saturday afternoon s was much the finest , in her farewell weekend after a long career with the company , was riveting , a model of the art that conceals art jerome tisserand brought distinction , finesse and ardor to albrecht the same performance included james moore s fiery hilarion carrie imler s shimmering , proud myrtha and a shiningly innocent account of the act i peasant pas de deux by angelica generosa and kyle davis on saturday evening , lesley rausch s giselle had complete dance clarity but little emotional vulnerability her albrecht , seth orza , is an admirable partner but dances too weightily on sunday afternoon sarah ricard orza s giselle had pathos but none of the dance hunger that fuels this drama william linyee , her albrecht , was fair in every way but unmemorable the production not only makes hilarion too classy but too decent \( listen to how furtive his music is \) though the giselle choreography is always variously attributed to three 19thcentury choreographers jean coralli , jules perrot or marius petipa it s actually encrusted with diverse 20thcentury accretions crucial aspects of the drama have become diluted or perverted and the music , by adolphe adam \( with a few additions by friedrich burgm ller , ludwig minkus and others \) , is usually played at soporific tempos this production has no pedanticism it s neither a reconstruction of the original 1841 giselle \( on which coralli and perrot worked in paris , but much of which we can now only imagine \) nor the russian giselle \( shaped by petipa and extensively notated in 18951903 \) instead , it draws from various sources between 1842 and 1910 , while also including a few obvious mid20thcentury additions we 're reminded that giselle has always been a work in progress , but shown that some older features make it more subtle and interesting it s amazing to see an american company doing the sign gestures of period mime with weight , space , clarity not all the performers are natural actors , but all of them are lucid the characters are perfectly delineated even when not utterly embodied every character becomes more rounded the greatest single revelation lies in the dances for myrtha , queen of the wilis , who summons giselle to join her troupe in act ii myrtha becomes more expressive and complex , less acrobatic with ms imler , she resembles a young queen victoria \( in notamused mode \) multifaceted , fluently regal , sensuously committed to dance , tipping this way and that , making one magnificent circuit of jumps that stretch in the air before pouncing in arrival the character of bathilde , albrecht s aristocratic fianc e and giselle s unwitting rival , becomes far more sympathetic most productions of giselle end hammily on albrecht alone at dawn in the forest after giselle s ghost has returned to her grave , but this one returns to the old , more dramatically subtle ending giselle with her last gesture encourages him to remember bathilde , who , now arriving in the forest , shows him compassion but one crucial touch has been eroded from this revival , though it existed in the 2011 version in giselle s last act ii solo , after she approaches the recumbent albrecht , she should dance away with come ! gestures this motion is the final turn of the screw in giselle , when giselle , hitherto reluctant to dance her lover to death , now shows her side as a wili , surrendering herself to the love of dance and beckoning him to immolate himself at her side the notation says she lures him this important giselle , itself a work in progress , needs to maintain and raise its own standards
olympic opening ceremonies are a little like a matchcom first date the host country , dolled up with costly hair extensions , christian louboutin heels and a brandnew black cocktail dress , recounts amusing childhood anecdotes and college triumphs but leaves out her dwi arrest \( or , in the case of russia , the gulag \) russia is n't alone in airbrushing the past and puffing up its chest at the 2002 winter games in salt lake city , the united states had to show resilience after the terrorist attacks of sept 11 , 2001 , and also get past the bidding scandal for those games russia has a uniquely troubled history , but every host nation has something to prove and hide that s also true of a host network , like russia , has a lot riding on these olympic games the today show , for so long no 1 , is now steadily beaten by good morning america on abc nbc just shoved aside jay leno , who was no 1 in late night , for a younger talent , jimmy fallon , whose ability to maintain the primacy of the tonight show has yet to be proved it did n't help network karma that bob costas was forced by an eye infection to don eyeglasses and work from an odd isolated studio it looked like an ice cave in oz at an olympic broadcasting center far from the action accordingly , nbc erected its own potemkin village for the olympic coverage it passed over current today hosts and reached out to a more popular alumna , meredith vieira , to add some charisma to matt lauer s coverage of the opening ceremony nbc also recruited the new yorker editor david remnick , author of lenin s tomb , to lend some intellectual heft remnick told his cohosts that russia s president , , did n't care if the world saw him as an autocrat putin , he said , wants russians to see themselves as a modernizing great power like putin s presidency , the ceremony was majestic , grandiose and quite humorless with much of the artful theatricality but none of the selfdeprecating touches that distinguished the london olympics in 2012 yet even the most russiacentered pageantry and overthetop slavic spectacle reindeer herders , ballet dancers , tchaikovsky , sputnik were presented in a slick , disneyesque package , including an introductory video with a little girl in a white dress , lyubov , who floated on a cloud of dreams through an alphabet of russian history \( t was for tolstoy and television \) it was a little bit alice in putinland , but also fantasia on the black sea and an indication of how much russia has adapted to western values since it shook off soviet rule putin may be hoping to use the games to project slavic power and russian exceptionalism , but friday s immersion course in mother russia had an unmistakable glint of hollywood makebelieve and showbusiness pizazz china s opening ceremony in 2008 in beijing was far more indigenous , a staggering paean to communiststyle mass regimentation , discipline and collective selfeffacement the most elaborate special effects friday celebrated a more palatable past peter the great , the russian imperial navy , war and peace but there were glancing allusions to some elements of soviet history , like the october revolution perhaps the most telling throwback to soviet times was russian television s handling of a glitch in the pyrotechnics five giant snowflakes were supposed to morph into olympic rings and explode into fireworks , but one failed to open properly and the fireworks fizzled one of the snowflakes is not quite cooperating , lauer said this is what happens when you are this ambitious in a show like this russia s channel one switched to rehearsal footage so russian viewers would n't see the misstep when the camera showed putin in the stands , applauding the ukrainian team with measured enthusiasm and a small , smug smile , lauer reminded viewers of putin s love of martial arts and other sports remnick put it differently he loves to perform his own machoness president obama did n't attend the event , but he gave costas an interview that was n't exactly flattering to putin s selfimage obama said that privately , the russian president always treated him with respect , but that he made a point of looking bored in joint interviews for domestic consumption my sense is that s part of his shtick back home politically as wanting to look like the tough guy , obama said us politicians have a different style we tend to smile once in a while
even before the newest version of call of duty went on sale last week , these games about real and imagined wars made up the bestselling firstperson shooter series in history , with , according to guinness world records but despite annual sales in excess of 1 billion for five years running , there have been signs that the juggernaut is in decline so the latest entry , call of duty advanced warfare , is an acknowledgment that after 11 years and 11 games , it s time to start over activision , the game s publisher , has trumpeted the many ways that the new game is a break from calls of duty past advanced warfare was in development for three years , instead of the usual two the series is in the hands of a new studio , sledgehammer games , founded by some of the people behind the very fine game dead space this call of duty is set far in the future instead of during world war ii or the nearpresent , and its soldiers wear hightech exoskeletons that allow them to leap and punch like superheroes rather than ordinary grunts it  and , for a while in the singleplayer campaign , it seems as if advanced warfare might pull it off , matching the ridiculous fun of the first two call of duty modern warfare games while dropping the gestures toward moral seriousness a fourlegged tank that resembles a robot turtle crawls above mitchell , the american marine that the player controls , as he fights against an invading force of north koreans in seoul insectlike drones swarm at him he rips the doors off cars to use as shields advanced warfare is visually astonishing , with the best video game faces i 've ever seen some scenes with the actors troy baker and gideon emery manage to escape the socalled of computer animation , the feeling of revulsion you get when you 're looking at a face that is almost but not quite human mr spacey is less fortunate he plays jonathan irons , the chief executive of atlas , a corporation that comes to possess the world s largest standing army because his face is so recognizable , your brain subconsciously registers all the ways that irons does n't look quite like the kevin spacey you have seen on screen as on his tv show last week , mr spacey s video game visage has the eyes of a carp that s been in the refrigerator for three days still , i 'd rather have fisheyed kevin spacey than no kevin spacey at all he brings a subtlety to his performance that is rare in video games , conveying his character s villainy with calm certitude rather than rantings if only the interactive parts of the story were as supple a good game makes you feel as if you were playing a musical instrument , your fingers keeping time with the action on screen too often , advanced warfare made me feel as if i were in an orchestra , standing in front of a piano , a snare drum and a gong while waiting for the conductor to look at me and announce which one i should bang on for a single note too much of the game is a script that must be followed do this one thing just right to continue , or start over and do it again rather than a possibility space that the player can explore and master routinely , i would charge ahead of my computercontrolled companions , only to look back and see a follow icon floating above one of their heads once , i beat my computer teammate to our objective , only to have to retreat , fetch him , kill a stray enemy and then follow him back to the spot where i had just been standing while trying to rescue a hostage , i pulled a trigger to shoot , only to see the scene restart because i did n't click a thumbstick instead to punch someone at another moment , i tried to move and fire at an enemy , only to have to restart because the game wanted me to click the thumbstick to sweep his leg throughout the game , movement is done with the left thumbstick , whether you 're walking forward through a corridor or crawling up a sheer edifice like spiderman , thanks to your magnetic gloves and yet , at one point , the game asks you to alternate triggers left , right , left , right to scramble over some tree roots thanks to moments like these , i did n't feel as if i were learning a system of interactions and exploiting them i felt as if i were playing a game of simon , the 1970s callandresponse toy the multiplayer battles face none of these problems the game s competitive modes are reinvigorated by the new tactics , like doublejumping in midair and bursting forward or sideways \( some players reported having trouble connecting to activision s servers over the weekend , but i had no such problems i played on a playstation 4 \) if you can tolerate the juvenile and occasionally obscene banter from teammates and opponents , maybe you wo n't care about the failings of the storybased campaign but when the text press r3 to melee appears on screen during climactic moments , it shows that the creators have failed to teach the player how to succeed without handholding this is the game design equivalent of helicopter parenting
where does creativity come from \? for centuries , we 've had a clear answer the lone genius the idea of the solitary creator is such a common feature of our cultural landscape \( as with newton and the falling apple \) that we easily forget it s an idea in the first place but the lone genius is a myth that has outlived its usefulness fortunately , a more truthful model is emerging the creative network , as with the crowdsourced wikipedia or the writer s room at the daily show or the real heart of creativity the intimate exchange of the creative pair , such as john lennon and paul mccartney and myriad other examples with which we 've yet to fully reckon historically speaking , locating genius within individuals is a recent enterprise before the 16th century , one did not speak of people being geniuses but geniuses genius , explains the harvard scholar marjorie garber , meant a tutelary god or spirit given to every person at birth any value that emerged from within a person depended on a potent , unseen force coming from beyond that person as late as the renaissance , people we 'd now consider quasidivine creators were more likely to be seen as deft imitators , making compelling work from familiar materials shakespeare , for example , did not typically dream up new ideas for plays but rewrote , adapted and borrowed from the plots , characters and language of previous works romeo and juliet , as mark rose , a professor at the university of california , santa barbara , notes , is an episodebyepisode dramatization of a poem by arthur brooke of course , theater is inherently collaborative but the elizabethan stage was more like the modern film industry , where the writer is generally less an auteur than a piece of a machine surviving records show three or four or even five playwrights receiving pay for a single production , according to the columbia professor james shapiro the irony is that shakespeare , whose world serves so well to illustrate a collaborative \( or networked \) idea about how good work is made , would become the icon of the solo creator the big change began with enlightenment thinkers , who sought to give man a dignified , central place in the world they made man s the center of their universe and created a profoundly asocial self meanwhile , as the feudal and agrarian gave way to the capitalist and industrial , artists needed to be more than entertaining they needed to be original , to profit from the sale of their work in 1710 , britain enacted its first copyright law , establishing authors as the legal owners of their work and giving new cultural currency to the idea of authors as originators this is when we start to see the modern use of genius in an essay published in 1711 , joseph addison cited shakespeare as a remarkable instance of these great natural geniuses those lit up by an inner light and freed from dependence on previous models but it was during the romantic era that the true cult of the natural genius emerged , ms garber writes with shakespeare as its signal example he was a convenient case so little biographical material existed that his story could be made up paradoxically , the most potent illustration of shakespeareasgenius manifested itself as an apparent challenge to it how could the son of a glover with a provincial education have written so knowingly of kings and queens and faraway lands \? it must have been another , dissenters said , with the earl of oxford emerging as a favorite candidate what s remarkable here is the underlying assumption that shakespeare s plays emerged entirely outside the giveandtake of the theater shakespeare doubters , the cleveland state university scholar james marino says , are taking the lone genius idea and doubling down today , the romantic genius can be seen everywhere consider some typical dorm room posters freud with his cigar , the rev dr martin luther king jr at the pulpit , picasso looking wideeyed at the camera , einstein sticking out his tongue these posters often carry a poignant epigraph imagination is more important than knowledge but the real message lies in the solitary pose in fact , none of these men were alone in the garrets of their minds freud developed psychoanalysis in a heated exchange with the physician wilhelm fliess , whom freud called the godfather of the interpretation of dreams king coled the civil rights movement with ralph abernathy \( my dearest friend and cellmate , king said \) picasso had an overt collaboration with georges braque they made cubism together and a rivalry with henri matisse so influential that we can fairly call it an adversarial collaboration even einstein , for all his solitude , worked out the theory of relativity in conversation with the engineer michele besso , whom he praised as the best sounding board in europe now , from disparate directions , a new view of the self has been gathering steam that allows us to begin seeing these old stories as though for the first time many factors are at play , not least the rise of the internet , both for its actual mechanisms that bring people together and for its potency as a metaphor and the social science of relationships is flourishing , starting with the relational foundations of human development consider what happens when 4montholds interact with their mothers they mimic one another s facial expressions and amplify them a baby s grin elicits a mother s smile , which leads the baby to a fullon expression of joy round mouth , big eyes both parties , writes the psychiatrist susan c vaughan , are processing an ongoing stream of stimuli and responding while the stimulation is still occurring the implication , ms vaughan argues , is that emotions are peopled from the start , centered in an interpersonal exchange rather than in an atomized self this is just one piece of an impressive body of research in social psychology and the new field of social neuroscience , which contends that individual agency often pales next to the imperatives of a collective the elemental collective , of course , is the pair two people are the root of social experience and of creative work when the sociologist michael farrell looked at movements from french impressionism to that of the american suffragists , he found that groups created a sense of community , purpose and audience , but that the truly important work ended up happening in pairs , as with monet and renoir , and susan b anthony and elizabeth cady stanton in , i found the same thing most strikingly with paul mccartney and john lennon why is this \? for one thing , given that our psyches take shape through oneonone exchanges , we 're likely set up to interact with a single person more openly and deeply than with any group the pair is also inherently fluid and flexible two people can make their own society when even one more person is added , roles and power positions harden this may be good for stability but problematic for creativity three legs make a table stand in place two legs are made for moving pairs also naturally engage each of the two people involved in a larger group , an individual may lie low , phone it in but nobody can hide in a pair it s going to take some time to truly accept the significance of pairs in creative life , in part because so many partners , if they do their job well , remain hidden to the outside world most vera nabokovs never get acknowledged partnership is also obscured when the two people have distinct public identities cs lewis and jrr tolkien did n't collaborate in the traditional sense , but , as a scholar of their work , diana pavlac glyer , has shown , the influence of each on the other was critical to the work of both the pair is the primary creative unit not just because pairs produce such a staggering amount of work but also because they help us to grasp the concept of dialectical exchange at its heart , the creative process itself is about a push and pull between two entities , two cultures or traditions , or two people , or even a single person and the voice inside her head indeed , thinking itself is a kind of download of dialogue between ourselves and others and when we listen to creative people describe breakthrough moments that occur when they are alone , they often mention the sensation of having a conversation in their own minds this phenomenon is so uncanny that the writer elizabeth gilbert has proposed that we return to the myth of the muses to help characterize it that does n't mean there literally are fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff , ms but the core experience described by the musecreator interaction that of one entity helping to inspire another is almost always true this raises vital questions what is the optimal balance between social immersion and creative solitude \? why does interpersonal conflict so often coincide with innovation \? looking at pairs allows us to grapple with these questions , which are as basic to the human experience as the push and pull of love itself as a culture , we 've long been preoccupied with romance but we should also take seriously something just as important , but long overlooked creative intimacy
the mostly mozart festival has been , but plenty of it still looks staid at first glance , an overtureconcertosymphony program of brahms , brahms and brahms with encores of brahms appears conservative but it did n't turn out that way with paavo jarvi and the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen , who stormed through this thursday concert at alice tully hall with a rare intensity this team has impressed with , accounts of beethoven symphonies influenced by the historically informed performance movement a fashion for smaller orchestras , faster tempos and leaner sounds has changed the way audiences expect to hear the classical repertoire in which mostly mozart specializes the same ca n't be said of brahms , despite the efforts of conductors like , whom mr jarvi called one of the great musical revolutionaries in a recent gramophone article still , chamber orchestras like the kammerphilharmonie are now justifiably tackling brahms symphonies , with or without period trappings brahms himself conducted these works with remarkably varied forces , sometimes with fewer than 50 players , occasionally with over 100 i 've found that smaller orchestras can bring revelatory clarity and physical dynamism to this music three years ago at the london proms , i heard bernard haitink lead the chamber orchestra of europe in scintillating , intricate readings of the and symphonies last year at lincoln center , thomas dausgaard and the swedish chamber orchestra gave  none of those performances had anything like the fresh , commanding force of this symphony no 2 at the work s premiere in 1877 , the vienna philharmonic probably fielded nearly double the 51 players of the kammerphilharmonie but beyond academic debate , numbers only matter in relation to the size of any given theater alice tully hall suited the kammerphilharmonie well , helping it sound rich and powerful , even though vibrato was reserved for more lyrical moments transparent textures allowed unusual , chatty woodwind details to contribute to the raucous finale what made this performance extraordinary was mr jarvi s pliant pacing as the , brahms favored and himself employed considerable elasticity of tempo , but few now dare the extremes of early20thcentury conductors like and  mr jarvi did it s a brave strategy one false move can render whole movements incoherent when it works , when it sounds spontaneous and innate to the music rather than imposed upon it , symphonic development is raised to another level of drama with risk came reward in this dark , ultimately triumphant reading from mr jarvi and his virtuosic orchestra the academic festival overture began the concert at a lively romp the piano concerto no 1 , with the soloist lars vogt , was less convincing there was too much flexibility and idiosyncrasy to go around , despite the affinity among pianist , conductor and orchestra mr vogt s playing was dreamily effective in the slow movement , but alternately square and fussy elsewhere his encore , a waltz , benefited from greater restraint and mr jarvi led suave , showy encores of two hungarian dances
kabul , afghanistan an afghan appeals court confirmed death sentences on monday against five of the seven defendants in a notorious robbery and rape case , despite their claims that their confessions were extracted through torture for the other two defendants , the court found insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty , so it reduced their sentences to 20 years' imprisonment the seven men were accused of dressing in police uniforms and stopping a caravan of cars returning from a wedding in the paghman district , less than half an hour s drive from kabul robbing the occupants and raping four of the women by the roadside the kabul police department was under enormous public pressure to solve the case , which prompted national outrage and revulsion but women s rights activists have noted that the outrage was less an expression of concern about the women s welfare than about the perceived dishonor to the victims' husbands that pervasive sense of male privilege to the degree that afghan women and girls are still commonly seen as marital property , and are frequently subject to socalled honor killings even when they are the victims of sexual attacks has remained despite efforts to reform afghanistan s legal code to enshrine more protections for women almost from the start , questions have been raised about whether the suspects were being railroaded by the government president hamid karzai promised to approve the death penalty against the men even before on sept 7 the entire case against them rested on their confessions and on their identification by victims at a police lineup but all seven men said that they had been severely beaten by police officers until they confessed to the rapes , and that the police had told the victims whom to identify in a lineup that included no one other than them when the lady who picked me out first came in , she put her hand on the chief of the criminal investigation division , and then on the cook , qaisullah , one of the five condemned men , said at the appeals court hearing on monday , referring to two police employees who would have been in plain clothes then they showed me to her , and she picked me like many afghans and several of the other defendants , mr qaisullah uses only one name human rights watch said the identification procedure was not a lineup but a showup , in which the police indicated to the victims who the suspects were the five men whose death sentences were confirmed on monday did not deny being part of the gang that carried out a robbery at the scene , but they said they had nothing to do with the rapes after that beating , i would have confessed to adultery with my mother , said azizullah , one of the five men , describing at the hearing his interrogation by the police another , mohammad nazar , said that he had acted only as a lookout and that the police had beaten him for five days until he confessed i never even saw the women taken from the cars , he said through sobs at the hearing mr azizullah s wife and sister were in the audience at the hearing on monday , wearing blue burqas why are the victims not present here \? the sister , habiba , asked the court why are none of their relatives here \? you should have strong proof when you are handing down death sentences the two men whose death sentences were reduced to prison terms testified that they had been in the process of committing a separate burglary when the police arrested them , and then had been beaten until they confessed to involvement in the rapes one of them , saifullah , said the police had forcibly put a uniform on him before photographing him to support their case against him the other five defendants confirmed to the appellate judge , atiqullah aqiq , that they did not know the two burglars there was little sympathy in the crowded courtroom for any of the accused asadullah wahdat , head of the legal aid office that provided three lawyers to defend the men , said that all three had received death threats and that one had withdrawn from the case as a result mr wahdat said the lawyers had not been given the legally required seven days to prepare their defense the appeals court heard testimony from two policemen and from two women who said they had recognized some of the accused when their trial was televised , and accused them of having robbed their homes at gunpoint in four previous episodes the paghman case shows how abusive and dysfunctional the afghan legal system remains , not only for suspects but for women who are survivors of sexual violence , phelim kine , deputy asia director of human rights watch , said in a statement the public reaction was very much because of the men s honor , said wazhma frogh , executive director of the the arrests were to save the honor of the men , not the women the men of the country felt dishonored
kansas city , mo dayton moore sat in the home dugout at kauffman stadium early wednesday afternoon , a few hours before his would burst from that same bench onto the field as champions of the american league david glass , the ' owner , found moore , the team s general manager , and told him how much he had enjoyed over the baltimore orioles the game , glass said , was baseball the way it was meant to be played glass , 79 , the former walmart chief executive , asked moore if he could do anything for him just cheer , moore replied because , really , glass had already done plenty he has never given moore a very high payroll , but he has provided him with something even more precious the time to implement a vision that has , at last , led the royals to the world series they roll in with eight consecutive victories , a record to start a postseason dayton told the glass family , this is what we need , ' and they 've supported him , said mike sweeney , the former royals first baseman and a baseball operations assistant his vision s come to fruition , and it s beautiful unwavering sweeney last played for the royals in 2007 , moore s first full year as general manager that season sweeney finished a contract worth 55 million , a figure the royals still have not exceeded for any one player there were no quick fixes for moore and the royals , no easy ways out of a postseason drought that stretched to 1985 there was only a process i know he took heat because , along the way , when we were n't winning as much as fans thought we should , he used the word process , ' and people made fun of that , said mike arbuckle , a senior adviser to moore but it a process he stuck to every part of the process to get us where we are , and his leadership has allowed us to do that the blueprint was to nurture alex gordon and billy butler , then the royals' best young players , and sign them to longterm contracts develop more top prospects through the draft and internationally and sign them , too trade other prospects for outside help and sign a few bargain free agents , if possible all of it has happened , and all with the underpinnings of an unrelenting philosophy moore believed the royals could not rely on power hitters to be competitive the ballpark was too big , and even if a young player did become a top slugger , he would price himself out of the royals' budget through salary arbitration it was cheaper to cultivate speed , which players could use not only on the bases but also in the field , thus aiding the pitchers when we set out to put a team together , we knew we were going to have to do it with pitching and defense and speed , moore said we know we 're not going to have power , but hopefully our hitters can give us a professional atbat and put the ball in play we still struggle in a lot of areas it s not a pushbutton club the royals make contact better than any other team their hitters had the fewest walks and by far the fewest strikeouts in the majors this season they also hit the fewest homers , but led in stolen bases they averaged 402 runs per game , just below the major league average of 407 so it was an ordinary offense , in terms of output , with an unusual character through that prism , it is easier to understand manager ned yost s stubborn fondness for socalled small ball he has wellfounded confidence that his hitters will put the ball in play , and that his base runners can cause havoc i'm real comfortable in my own skin , yost said i do n't feel like i need vindication i'm not looking for it do n't care for it none of this was ever about me moore has emphasized consistency of vision , from glass on down every spring , moore said , he has told the team that everyone s success is tied together he has been open with players about his strategy , and has felt a responsibility to them to augment the roster after a fourth consecutive season with at least 90 losses in 2012 part of creating organizational harmony is articulating a plan and doing everything you can to execute it , moore said when we sign our players longterm , they all want to win these guys are the most competitive people on the planet and they want to be a part of a winning team , a winning culture so we made a commitment we 've got to give our absolute best as a leadership team , in baseball operations , to support their efforts at the time , outfielder wil myers had never played and , significantly , had never failed in the major leagues he was baseball america s minor league player of the year in 2012 , and his value could not have been higher moore packaged myers with three others to the tampa bay rays for an ace , james shields , and the top setup man wade davis the royals won 86 games last season , narrowly missing the playoffs , then added starter jason vargas and second baseman omar infante , both with fouryear contracts , through free agency the players appreciated the show of confidence and for gordon , the team s cornerstone , the bond with moore runs deeper a former college infielder , moore sold gordon on a plan to move from third base to left field in 2010 , citing examples of others , including milwaukee s ryan braun , who had made successful transitions gordon , drafted second over all in 2005 , before moore s arrival , had seemed like a bust at the time he became an allstar and a gold glove winner when i was struggling , he wanted to make sure i was ok , gordon said the first thing he said was , i want to make sure you and your family are good' he really cares about you and he s very supportive i 've only worked for one gm , but i ca n't imagine there s a nicer or better person in this business , and i know the guys in here feel the same way on the field after winning the pennant , moore marveled at gordon s effort on in the fifth inning it was only the latest sparkling defensive play of the royals' postseason , with others by eric hosmer , mike moustakas , alcides escobar , lorenzo cain and nori aoki we understood from day 1 the importance of having athletes who could run down the baseball here , moore said the reason we 're successful is our starting pitchers throw strikes and our bullpen matches up well late and the outfield catches everything in the air that s been the most consistent part of our team no other outfield in the majors has as much square footage as kauffman stadium s , and moore acknowledged that he used to lobby glass to move in the fences glass always resisted , insistent that doing so did not align with a plan based on pitching and defense the boss was right , and no team may be more suited to its ballpark than the royals it s as dynamic a team as you 'll see , said raul ibanez , the veteran outfielder , who also played for the royals in the early 2000s you have to know your identity , and this team knows how to play its game if the players did not understand who they were , they would not last here long the royals' adherence to a rigid selfimage , honed through years of patience , has given them another identity american league champions
as the trading deadline approached last week , manager terry collins sought out the veteran pitcher to see if the constant trade rumors about him had become a distraction colon , considered the mets' most marketable and available asset , simply shrugged his shoulders rumors are part of the game , he told collins the deadline passed , and colon remained a part of the rotation , with the mets hoping he will have an opportunity to pitch for them in the playoffs but the team is surely keeping an eye on colon s perceived value he could still be sent to a contender if he is placed on waivers colon did nothing to make his case in a mostly unimpressive outing sunday , his first since the deadline , allowing six runs in four and twothirds innings in to the at citi field i never pay attention to that stuff , colon said in spanish about the trade rumors i'm a member of the mets , and whatever they choose to do , that s their decision the loss kept the mets on the fringes of the national league wildcard race the team is now six and a half games behind san francisco and st louis and six back of pittsburgh , which lost to arizona , 32 , on sunday colon was trying to become the third active pitcher with at least 200 wins , after the giants' tim hudson \( 213 \) and the yankees' c c sabathia \( 208 \) , and the third dominicanborn pitcher , after juan marichal and pedro martinez , to reach the mark he was also trying to become the third pitcher , after martinez and orel hershiser , to hit the milestone as a member of the mets for me , it s very important because i want to be in the same club with marichal and pedro , colon said he entered the start on a bit of a hot streak , having allowed three runs in his past 15 innings , in starts against seattle and philadelphia before the game , collins praised colon s improved fastball command , saying it was a main factor in his success yet colon , who would have to be dealt away by aug 31 in order to be eligible for the postseason with another team , seemed to lose that control sunday after starting the game with two scoreless innings , colon fell into trouble in the third he allowed a leadoff single to brandon crawford , who moved to second on madison bumgarner s sacrifice bunt hunter pence followed with a linedrive home run that struck the black railing above the fence in leftcenter field brandon belt extended san francisco s lead to 30 with a fourthinning home run that just cleared the rightfield wall near the foul pole colon was pulled after he conceded three more runs in the fifth today , he just did n't have his good stuff , collins said , adding when he s really on , you can see guys start to swing and then hedge because there s late life it was n't there today the giants padded their lead with two runs in the seventh off reliever carlos torres and a run in the ninth , on pence s second home run of the game , off dana eveland the mets' offensive woes in the series continued as well the team had only two hits as bumgarner threw a complete game with just 94 pitches the mets have managed a combined two hits through the first six innings of the games in this series , one on friday against ryan vogelsong \( in the sixth \) and none on saturday against jake peavy in addition , the mets have scored in two of the 27 total innings in the series in fact , one could argue that the mets have had just one good inning a fourrun seventh against peavy in the series at one point on sunday , bumgarner had a higher batting average \( 271 after his fifthinning single \) than all but two mets in the team s starting lineup the mets' chances of a turnaround in monday s series finale seem grim they are set to face hudson , who has a 271 earned run average they , top to bottom , have quality arms , and then when you 're struggling to consistently put runners on base and you have some guys in funks , you get the results that you 've gotten the last three days , mets third baseman david wright said we were lucky to have that good inning yesterday to pick up the win i got to get it going and we have some guys that need to get it going wright had one of the two hits off bumgarner , a brokenbat single in the seventh , but he is mired in a 4for28 slump i just need to stop fouling off pitches i should be hitting , wright said i need to swing at some better pitches stop chasing i think i'm chasing a little much right now colon could have mets opponents chasing after his services but owed 11 million next season , those odds grew a bit longer on sunday colon said he put the loss behind him the moment he was taken out of the game after all , bad outings , like trade rumors , are part of the game
the garden was ready the capacity crowd wearing special blue stanley cup finals tshirts was loud and prepared for the ' first home game in the finals since 1994 but the experienced , who had never won a playoff game at madison square garden , spoiled the party once more the kings' top players guided them to a victory , a 30 win that put them up three games to none over the rangers the veteran jeff carter scored with 08 of a second left in the first period , and then marian gaborik , the former rangers forward , and anze kopitar set up defenseman jake muzzin for another score early in the second center mike richards made it 30 late in the second , and goaltender jonathan quick turned away all 32 shots the rangers sent his way , leaving the kings on the verge of completing a sweep we are a very good team when we get ahead , said the kings' captain , dustin brown , who centers the line with gaborik and kopitar we grind away and gradually take over games carter and richards , who were key pieces when the kings beat the devils in six games to claim the franchise s first cup two years ago , each had strong games , with carter collecting a teamhigh four shots on goal we 're a team playing with confidence , richards said kopitar , who led the kings in scoring in the regular season , had his teamleading 21st assist gaborik , who leads all scorers this postseason with 13 goals , was making his first appearance on garden ice since the rangers traded him to columbus in april 2013 the blue jackets dealt him to the kings this season , in march his line buzzed henrik lundqvist and the rangers' net all night the kings had only 15 shots , but it felt as if they dominated play much of the night we played a solid game , no more than that , kings coach darryl sutter said gaborik had his ups and downs while with the rangers two seasons of 40plus goals and a 22goal campaign in which he was hampered by injury culminated in a difficult final season under john tortorella and a lessthanideal departure for gaborik but in his three months as a king , gaborik has flourished now he is a victory from hoisting the cup on his former home ice i have great memories of my time here , gaborik said monday after the kings' morning skate but it s all about business now
detroit a family of five with no water for two weeks who were embarrassed to ask friends if they could bathe at their house a woman excited about purchasing a home who learned she would be held responsible for the previous owner s delinquent water bill all 8 , 000 of it a 90yearold woman with bedsores and no water available to clean them these are the stories that keep mia cupp up at night ms cupp is the director of development and communication for the wayne metropolitan community action agency , a nonprofit contracted by the state of michigan to work as a humanservices agency for detroit in august 2013 , with a 1 million allocation , wayne metro became the only program to assist residents with water bills ms cupp quickly learned that this was by far the greatest need in january alone , wayne metro received 10 , 000 calls for water assistance , many of them referred directly by the detroit department of water and sewerage it supported 904 water customers over 10 months before exhausting its funding in june ms cupp said wayne metro still gets hundreds of calls a day from residents but it has no way to help them , and nowhere to refer them detroit borders the great lakes system , containing 21 percent of the world s surface freshwater the lakes are the source of the city s water supply , but a growing number of residents ca n't turn on the tap over the past three months , the water department has conducted an aggressive shutoff campaign to get more than 90 , 000 customers to pay 903 million in pastdue bills between march 25 and june 14 , 12 , 500 detroit customers had their water shut off the average monthly water bill in detroit is 75 for a family of four and the department is increasing rates this month by 87 percent over the past decade , sales have decreased by 20 to 30 percent , while the water department s fixed costs and debt have remained high nonpayment of bills is also common the increasing strain on the department s resources is then passed on to customers but residents are n't the only ones with delinquent accounts darryl latimer , the department s deputy director , told me that the state of michigan holds its biggest bill 5 million for water at state fairgrounds \( the state disputes the bill , arguing that it s not responsible for the costs of infrastructure leaks \) a revealed that joe louis arena , home of the detroit red wings , owed 82 , 255 as of april ford field , where the detroit lions play , owed more than 55 , 000 cityowned golf courses owed more than 400 , 000 as of july 2 , none had paid mr latimer said the department of water and sewerage would post notice , giving these commercial customers 10 days to pay before cutting service but he did not say when and in the meantime the city is going after any customers who are more than 60 days late and owe at least 150 the department reports that 60 percent of its customers pay in full or begin a payment plan within 24 hours of a shutoff , and water service is reinstated mr latimer said that this proved that many could afford their bills , and simply were n't paying them the city of detroit , which filed for bankruptcy protection a year ago , certainly has not just the right but the obligation to demand payment of outstanding bills but cutting water to homes risks a public health crisis instead , the water department should more aggressively target delinquent commercial customers who carry a large share of the unpaid bills it should enact a comprehensive plan to fix leaking pipes flooded streets are common here , and water customers whether the state or ordinary residents must pay for sewerage , not just running water , and often are billed erroneously for these leaks the department must also ensure that water is shut off to abandoned buildings , and eliminate errors in address transfers mr latimer explained that the department used addresses rather than names as the collectible agent on an account a problematic practice in a city of 80 , 000 vacancies ,  ms cupp said that the average bill for the residents wayne metro has helped was 1 , 600 she saw one as high as 10 , 000 the water department s standard payment plan requires at least a 30 percent down payment this is out of reach for many to increase participation , the department should eliminate the down payment , as well as the 30 reconnection fee it charges the department last week , saying that it would introduce a financialassistance program on july 1 in partnership with a nonprofit , the heat and warmth fund , and would use more than 800 , 000 in funds collected through 50cent donations on monthly bills this was good news , but the announcement was premature on july 1 , a representative for the nonprofit said the program might not be operational until august meanwhile , ms cupp said wayne metro had asked the water department to stop giving out its number to needy customers until it could get additional funding mr latimer said that mass shutoffs were the only way to find the shirkers those who can pay will do so quickly but their neighbors are left to fill jugs of water at the homes of friends or at fire hydrants to meet basic needs even for a city that has grown accustomed to limited city services , like streetlights and police response times , this is a new low i 've seen water problems in poor countries and the third world , said maude barlow , the board chairwoman of the nonprofit food and water watch but i 've never seen this in the united states , never
you cannot beat alabama vs louisiana state on a saturday night in baton rouge this is one of the most bruising rivalries at one of the loudest , most electric sites in sports the field will be flooded with future nfl talent alabama is looking to stay alive in the sec west and secure a spot in the college football playoff lsu needs a win to make itself a factor in the division since 2007 , alabama has won three national titles and lsu has one in 2011 , no 1 lsu beat no 2 alabama , 96 , in overtime in tuscaloosa , ala , in one of the most anticipated games in recent memory later that season , they met in the national championship game , which alabama won , 210 according to , 42 players who participated in those two games were drafted by nfl teams despite a hostile environment , alabama is a 7point favorite , despite struggling on the road , losing to mississippi and eking out a 1point victory over arkansas quarterback blake sims has looked great at times and seems to be improving every week , but this will be a supreme test the tide controls its destiny winning the division and the southeastern conference championship game will surely secure alabama a place in the college football playoff the tigers started slowly in the conference , losing to mississippi state and getting blown out by auburn but they beat florida , kentucky and thenno 3 mississippi , 107 , two weeks ago and are climbing back up the rankings look for the tigers to focus on running the ball leonard fournette , terrence magee , kenny hilliard and connor neighbors give lsu one of the deepest , most talented backfields in the nation on its 95yard gamewinning drive against ole miss , the tigers rushed 12 times for 93 yards a veteran line seems to be jelling at the right time it will face a very good run defense that leads the sec and is second in the nation , allowing only 78 yards per game the tide has not allowed a 100yard rusher and is built to stop a power running team like lsu alabama is big up front , with players like lineman a shawn robinson filling gaps and linebacker reggie ragland leading the team in tackles alabama s offense is far more balanced , thanks to receiver amari cooper , who runs excellent routes and is physical when battling for a ball lsu s secondary leads the sec in pass defense , and the pressure will be on tide running backs t j yeldon and derrick henry lsu has struggled against mobile quarterbacks , and sims s scrambling could be the deciding factor strength versus strength these teams are built to beat each other expect a slugfest , but sims and cooper could give the tide the edge this could be the most important big ten game of the season it is a rematch of last year s conference title game this one is likely for the east division championship for the first time in almost two seasons , the buckeyes enter a game as the underdog ohio state has been scoring tons of points , but against very suspect defenses the buckeyes lost to virginia tech at home and needed two overtimes on the road to beat penn state , which is 14 in the conference quarterback j t barrett struggled in both games he threw three interceptions against the hokies and passed for only 74 yards against penn state michigan state has a very good defense linebacker taiwan jones had 10 tackles in a win over nebraska and eight tackles , one sack and an interception against michigan defensive end shalique calhoun is a great edge rusher and leads the team with six sacks connor cook is an underrated quarterback and is looking to beat ohio state for the second time in two years not many big ten quarterbacks have done that lately receiver tony lippett has had a great season and is cook s favorite bigplay target ohio state s defense has been solid keep an eye on lineman joey bosa , who leads the big ten with 10 sacks of course , michigan state s offensive line has been rock solid , allowing only five sacks last season s conference title game will be remembered for ohio state s failed fourthand2 attempt late in the game that cemented the spartans' win ohio state has struggled in shortyardage situations again this season michigan state coach mark dantonio loves to use trick plays in big games the spartans seem like the pick at home first place in the big 12 is at stake as well as a possible spot in the college football playoff both teams are outside the top four , but the winner will be in the hunt this is all great news for a texas christian team that was unranked entering the season the horned frogs are averaging 48 points per game , second most in the nation , and quarterback trevone boykin is making a late run for the heisman trophy not bad for someone who was shifted from receiver to quarterback last season boykin did not play his best game last week , but tcu forced five turnovers and came from behind to edge west virginia with a late field goal tcu has forced 26 turnovers to lead the nation this is a huge game for the horned frogs if boykin can bounce back and tcu can get the victory , the rest of the schedule is very favorable their remaining opponents have a combined 817 record they would be in a great spot to win the big 12 and slide into the playoff kansas state has a win at oklahoma and still must travel to west virginia and baylor if the wildcats win out , that r sum would be hard to argue with in addition , their one loss was by less than a touchdown to thenno 5 auburn quarterback jake waters has been running the wildcats' offense to perfection while his numbers might not be particularly eyepopping , the fact that he has only thrown three interceptions is over all , kansas state has turned the ball over only seven times only four teams have turned it over less waters s favorite target is tyler lockett , who is second only to his father , kevin lockett , in the program s record books for receiving yards and touchdowns although this is hardly a game people had circled on their preseason calendars , it figures to be a very entertaining affair notre dame is on the cusp of the playoff conversation its only loss was a close , controversial one on the road to thenno 2 florida state this is the last chance for the irish , though none of their remaining opponents is ranked it will be interesting to see how notre dame deals with the loss of the senior middle linebacker joe schmidt to a seasonending injury quarterback everett golson will need to be as outstanding as he has been all season arizona state s lone loss was a 6227 shellacking to thenno 11 ucla the defense has improved and the sun devils are in first place in the pac12 south if arizona state can get a win and hold on against oregon state and arizona , it would secure a spot in the pac12 championship game and , perhaps , a playoff spot the last real test of the season for the ducks and a chance for marcus mariota to make his case for the heisman trophy this has all the makings of a trap game , however it is a road game in a tough environment against a very physical defense that loves to punish quarterbacks oregon is certainly the favorite , but will need to be careful baylor has never won in norman the sooners started the season with high expectations , but two conference losses sent them reeling a suspect oklahoma passing defense will need to find a way to stop a baylor offense that is capable of putting up a lot of points in very little time
brussels it was hard to move a muscle on the first floor of iacopo curatolo s house during the inaugural homeplugged music festival , which took place in the western district of stgilles here earlier this month through a thick cloud of cigarette smoke , a throng of roughly 100 scenesters could be seen gathering in his emptied living room illuminated almost entirely by dim sunlight and a neon lamp in the shape of a motorcycle hanging from the wall throughout the festival , which featured four local bands , mr curatolo s house was packed with masses of the musically inclined outside in the garden , he had set up a barbecue under oversize parasols , where his friends helped serve bottles of jupiler beer , cheap wine and hamburgers on homemade sesame seed buns everything s homemade here , mr curatolo said mr curatolo founded homeplugged , a private homecummusic venue , in the summer of 2009 , following a night of drinking with friends over the past few years , it has unexpectedly played a major role in helping establish the still nascent indie music scene in europe s capital now bands vie to play at his home and mr curatolo has been instrumental in introducing new belgian and international artists to the music scene here it started in the living room without any ceremony , and we 've come a long way since then , mr curatolo said my main interest was n't simply to put on a show , he added but to experiment with live recording techniques with bands i actually liked after nearly five successful years of staging oneoff live performances at his house , mr curatolo , 27 , decided to raise the bar this year with a twonight music festival on the bill were the brusselsbased acts , , , and and the imported headliners and  during homeplugged s first year , he sought out traveling performers typically solo acts inquiring directly with booking agents in the netherlands and sweden to help run the shows , he relied on his friends , whom he considers part of the homeplugged collective everyone from the doorman to barman is a close friend and does it for love of the game , mr curatolo said each member has an integral role in making each show a success as an example , the french illustrator , who once lived in a small room on the top floor of the house , provided handdrawn flyers another of mr curatolo s coterie , , who designed the homeplugged logo , helps run each show he and mr curatolo would spend nights searching the web for musical acts to invite to the house there s a diy , rock and folk music scene now in brussels homeplugged helped establish it , for sure , mr ewing said more than 30 artists have played homeplugged and some have gone on to international success , like of iceland none of the brussels bands i 've booked have become famous , but these things take time , mr curatolo said aside from the singersongwriter , who has earned international attention in the past five years , brussels still is n't known for its musical exports or scene , but mr curatolo hopes this will change the house is located along the no 81 tram line , only a few feet from the tracks , in an area of the belgian capital known for its ethnic diversity , art nouveau architecture , and imposing  the neighborhood has changed a lot since homeplugged began there s a palpable vitality in stgilles now , which is a nexus between the neighboring brussels communes of forest , ixelles and uccle the area used to be unpopular , but it s turning into williamsburg , mr curatolo said he began homeplugged as a response to his distaste for the city where he was raised honestly , brussels was just so boring , he recalled nothing ever happened if you were smart , you did everything you could to get of here the middle child of european union administrators from italy , mr curatolo grew up in brussels , but said he always considered it an adopted home he did escape for a spell , foregoing college to become a sound engineer in paris , but , after an unsuccessful stint working in a recording studio there , he came back his father offered him an old house , which mr curatolo was charged with making habitable , so that he could have lodgers in the back of his mind , he knew that opening a recording studio in the basement was his ultimate goal what drove me crazy when i came back was the lack of bands , he lamented they often avoided brussels as a stop on european tours because the city had no indie music scene every time i wanted to see an indie band , i 'd have to travel to ghent or antwerp bigger venues in the city , like and , left a lot to be desired in terms of intimacy mr curatolo recently put the finishing touches on his diy recording studio , which he calls snapshot since it opened , he and his business partner , pierre valfrey , have recorded four albums roughly one per month with a number of interested bands slated to lay down tracks later in the year the first album they recorded was mountain bike s debut , which has received praise nationally as well as in the netherlands now that snapshot is finally a reality , we 're going to record all homeplugged shows , mr curatolo said with these live recordings , he 'd like to start putting out limitededition vinyl , and to establish a label in the future still , for homeplugged , money is n't the draw , at least not yet the first night of the festival sold out and the second came very close mr curatolo does n't make it easy for his audience to procure the 10 euro , or 14 , tickets they 're only sold at one shop in town or at the house he also takes wire transfers , mr ewing said , laughing send him a screenshot of the transaction , and you 're in despite all the successful evolutions to homeplugged , mr curatolo insists that he s always prepared for the worst we still put these shows together expecting nobody to show up , he admitted he tries to keep the noise down to avoid upsetting the neighbors and historically , the shows do n't make money , no matter how many people are in attendance , or how many beers are sold we made 50 profit once , he said i forgot what we did with it mr curatolo does n't like to think about how homeplugged has changed brussels , but rather how he can keep changing homeplugged how he can get more bigger and better bands to play for him i'm still waiting for radiohead to respond to my email
washington just four blocks from the white house is the headquarters of the a widely quoted economic research center whose academic reports have repeatedly warned that increasing the minimum wage could be harmful , increasing poverty and unemployment but something fundamental goes unsaid in the institute s reports the nonprofit group is run by a public relations firm that also represents the restaurant industry , as part of a tightly coordinated effort to defeat the minimum wage increase that the white house and democrats in congress have pushed for the vast majority of economic research shows there are serious consequences , michael saltsman , the institute s research director , said in an interview , before he declined to list the restaurant chains that were among its contributors the campaign illustrates how groups conservative and liberal are again working in opaque ways to shape hotbutton political debates , like the one surrounding minimum wage , through organizations with benignsounding names that can mask the intentions of their deeppocketed patrons they do it with the gloss of research , and play a critical and often underappreciated role in multilevel lobbying campaigns , backed by corporate lobbyists and labor unions , with a potential payoff that can be in the millions of dollars for the interests they represent it is the way of washington now and that is unfortunate , said a republican political consultant who has helped run several presidential campaigns because if it s not dishonest , it s at least disingenuous in this case , the policy dispute is over whether increasing the minimum wage by nearly 40 percent to 1010 an hour within two and a half years would reduce poverty or further it even if the legislation never passes and it is unlikely to , given the political divide in congress millions of dollars will be spent this year on lobbying firms , nonprofit research organizations and advertising campaigns , as industry groups like the and the try to bury it liberal groups , in turn , will be spending lots of money as they try to make the debate a political issue for the midterm elections the left has its own prominent groups , like the and the , whose donors include nearly 20 labor unions , and whose reports , with their own aura of objectivity , consistently that raising the minimum wage makes good economic sense but none has played such a prominent and multifaceted role in recent months as the conservative employment policies institute the employment policies institute , founded two decades ago , is led by the advertising and public relations executive richard b berman , who has made millions of dollars in washington by taking up the causes of corporate america he has repeatedly created officialsounding nonprofit groups like the that have challenged limits like the ban on indoor smoking and the push to restrict calorie counts in fast foods in recent months , mr berman s firm has taken out fullpage advertisements in and and near the capitol with advertisements , including one featuring a giant photograph of representative nancy pelosi , the california democrat who is a proponent of the minimum wage increase , that read , teens who ca n't find a job should blame her these messages , also promoted on websites operated by mr berman s firm , including , instruct anyone skeptical about the arguments to consult the reports prepared by the employment policies institute , most often described only as a nonprofit research organization but the dividing line between the institute and mr berman s firm was difficult to discern during two visits last week to the eighthfloor office at 1090 vermont avenue , a building near the white house that is the headquarters for both the sign at the entrance is for berman and company , as the employment policies institute has no employees of its own mr berman s forprofit advertising firm , instead , bills the nonprofit institute for the services his employees provide to the institute this arrangement effectively means that the nonprofit is a moneymaking venture for mr berman , whose advertising firm was paid 11 million by the institute in 2012 , according to its tax returns , or 44 percent of its total budget , with most of the rest of the money used to buy advertisements disclosure reports filed by individual foundations show that its donors in recent years have included the lynde and harry bradley foundation , a longtime supporter of conservative causes mr berman and mr saltsman would not identify other donors , but did say they included the restaurant industry but its tax return shows that the 24 million in listed donations received in 2012 came from only 11 contributors , who wrote checks for as much as 500 , 000 apiece mr saltsman , 30 , who has an undergraduate degree in economics from the university of michigan and previously worked for the federal bureau of labor statistics , drafts dozens of letters to the editor and opinion articles for newspapers , arguing that increasing the minimum wage would hurt more than help other special institute projects included of lawmakers who support the minimum wage increase asking if they pay their interns the daily caller , a conservative online publication , then released , calling out the lawmakers with unpaid interns as hypocrites the major reports released by the institute are prepared by outside academics , like joseph j sabia , an associate professor of economics at san diego state university , who has collected from mr berman s group over the last eight years to deliver seven separate reports , each one concluding that increasing the minimum wage has caused more harm than good or at least no significant benefit for the poor there is never a good time to raise the minimum wage , mr sabia said at a briefing in the longworth house office building late last month that was cosponsored by the institute , as he laid out the findings of his to capitol hill staff members and reporters you are not reaching the poor workers you want to help mr sabia said in an interview late last month that his research conclusions were developed independently i do n't write advocacy policy briefs , he said his papers are also submitted to academic journals , which publish them after a peerreview process a standard , he noted , that publications put out by leftleaning groups like the economic policy institute often do not meet what is clear is that the reports by the employment policies institute are a critical element in the lobbying campaign against the increase in the minimum wage , as restaurant industry groups , in their own statements and news releases , often cite the institute s reports , creating the washington echo chamber effect that is so coveted by industry lobbyists once you have the study , you can point it to it to prove your case even if you paid to get it written , said one lobbyist , who asked not to be named because his clients rely on him to use this technique but some questions have been raised about the institutefunded work saul d hoffman , a professor of economics at university of delaware , mr sabia used for a 2012 paper funded in part by the institute mr hoffman concluded that the narrow cut of data mr sabia picked was perhaps unintentionally skewed , and once corrected , it would have showed that the 2004 increase in new york state s minimum wage had no negative impact on employment the institute had  mr berman , 71 , a onetime auto mechanic turned labor lawyer and restaurant industry executive , rejected any suggestion that his reports were based on bias or faulty data i get very upset when people say we are putting out junk science and twisted economics , because that happens to be our criticism of other people , mr berman said in an interview at his office yet internal company documents show that members of mr berman s team at least when they have been involved in some of the other corporatebacked projects have discussed ways to massage academic data to change outcomes for example , an published by researchers at the university of southern california concluded that soda had higher concentrations of highfructose corn syrup than advertised mr berman s team , hired by the corn refining industry to defend its sweeteners , mobilized staff at his center for consumer freedom to challenge the results if the results contradict usc , we can publish them , said an email sent to mr berman and other staff in october 2010 from a berman employee at the time , referring to the university of southern california report the exchange became public recently as a result of a lawsuit between the sugar and corn refining industries if for any reason the results confirm usc , we can just bury the data mr berman said that the employee who wrote that email left more than a year ago and that such practices were not allowed at the institute leftleaning groups like the citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington , arguing that the large payments to mr berman s forprofit firm may violate the law , an accusation that berman and company strongly disputes what is most important , said lisa graves , the executive director of an organization responsible for the online publication , is that newspapers detail employment policies institute s corporate ties when they cite research it publishes such disclosure happened in less than 20 percent of the cases over a threeyear period , an analysis by pr watch found they are trying to peddle an industry wish list , but mask it as if they are independent experts , she said they are little more than phony experts on retainer
the conventional wisdom , such as it is , on the political impact of events in iraq , ukraine and elsewhere seems to be that they will empower the republican party s hawkish establishment at the expense of the party s libertarian antiinterventionist wing strengthening the hawks critique of the obama white house , bringing bushera voices back to the fore , and throwing new obstacles in rand paul s alreadydifficult path to the nomination and when you combine this scenario with hillary clinton s nonetoosubtle  positioning of herself as a more interventionist figure than the current president , you have the possibility of the return of a kind of 2004style hawkish center in american presidential politics , in which both clinton and her eventual gop rival \( be it a cruz , a rubio , a bush , a christie , whomever \) would compete to outtough the other on terrorism , syria , iran , isis , putin , and so forth what s interesting about this backto2004 possibility , though , is how poorly it fits with the state of public opinion at the moment the country has understandably soured on this president s foreign policy stewardship , but i ve seen no polling data to indicate that the postbush , let s mind our own business trend is substantially reversing anecdotally at least , the return of rightwing interventionism looks to me more like an elite phenomenon than a mass shift the hawks are having a renaissance on oped pages and in newspaper profiles , but when dick cheney goes on megyn kelly s show he s greeted with questions that he would simply not have encountered on fox news a decade back , and i m willing to bet that more potential gop primary voters will be influenced by glenn beck s mea culpa on the iraq war than will read a single word by robert kagan and then on the democratic side , it s hard to imagine that more than a vanishinglysmall percentage of liberal partisans now believe that obama was wrong to withdraw all us forces from iraq , or would say , if asked , that they want a more militarilyaggressive posture from his successor so this sets up a couple of interesting outsidethebox possibilities in one , hillary clinton s i m more hawkish than obama positioning will gradually become a problem for her in the democratic primary , feeding into a general progressive discontent with her candidacy and helping to inspire the serious intraparty challenge that some smart people \( though not me \) think she ll eventually face in another , she still cruises to the nomination , but her hawkishness has an unexpected effect on the republican primary that is , it could actually end up empowering rand paul this could happen along two vectors first , if it s clear that the next democratic nominee will be a liberal interventionist \( one blessed by neoconservatives , at that ! \) , the partisan , whatever the democrats are for i m against impulse among gop voters won t necessarily make a maximally hawkish line seem as compelling as it would if obama were on the ballot a third time \( recall that george w bush s humble foreign policy was intended , in part , to make a contrast with the interventionism of bill clinton and al gore \) and then second , if hillary faces only token opposition , the public s antiinterventionist inclinations could end up finding a different outlet in the form of higher propaul turnout in primaries where independents and democrats can cast a vote i m just spitballing here , of course , and even with recent events i expect domestic concerns to predominate in the next presidential cycle but i do think the politics of foreign policy in 2016 may be more complicated , and the leftright debate more muddy , than some of the last two weeks commentary would suggest
montreal lore is steeped with inexperienced goalies , from ken dryden to steve penney to patrick roy , all of whom sparkled during the playoffs as rookies another candidate awaited membership in that club on monday night his name is dustin tokarski , and all he had to do in his postseason debut was restore hope to a fan base seized by panic , and to a team reeling after losing its star goalie , carey price , to a right knee injury for the remainder of the eastern conference finals tokarski s performance in a 31 game 2 loss to the was neither brilliant nor disastrous it registered somewhere in the middle , and ordinary or really , a notch better is not going to beat the rangers , not when martin st louis and rick nash are scoring goals , and not when henrik lundqvist , who stopped 40 of 41 shots , is as impermeable as reinforced concrete turnabout is vicious for the canadiens , who trail the rangers two games to none montreal swept tampa bay in the opening round , in part because the lightning s starting goalie , the vezina trophy finalist ben bishop , missed the series with a wrist injury no matter how much faith a team professes it has in its backup goalie or , in tokarski s case , its thirdstring goalie a dropoff in quality from price was to be expected , if not inevitable it is the second consecutive postseason that montreal has lost price to injury everything about this instance is different , from the contentious circumstances surrounding price s unavailability to the decision made by coach michel therrien unlike last year , when therrien merely elevated price s backup , peter budaj , he felt more comfortable monday going with tokarski , a 24yearold with only 10 games of nhl experience therrien was in a dour mood when he announced price s status on monday morning , still fuming because of what for the second consecutive day he called a reckless play by the rangers' chris kreider , who upended price during a collision in the second period of game 1 by then , though , therrien had made his choice he just refused to reveal it he is a steward of a proud organization , and he no doubt recalls the impacts made by the likes of dryden in 1971 , penney in 1984 and roy in 1986 tokarski s credentials held the same kind of promise for the canadiens like price , tokarski won a gold medal in the world junior championship with canada and a calder cup , awarded to the american hockey league champions tokarski also captured the memorial cup , the title of canadian major junior hockey that r sum offsets his minimal nhl experience only three games within the last two seasons and before the morning skate monday therrien told tokarski that he , not the 31yearold budaj , would be starting tokarski practiced , took an afternoon nap and then resumed preparation for the most important game of his life \( he was asked afterward , do you feel the pressure of the entire city right now \? his answer , delivered with a slight smile , there s always pressure , but it s good pressure \) he led his teammates onto the ice , and then stood beside the starters on the blue for the singing of the starspangled banner and o canada in the stands was roughly four times the population of his hometown , humboldt , saskatchewan it s hard not to have nerves , playing in this building , tokarski said but they were good nerves tokarski was unlucky on the rangers' first goal ryan mcdonagh s shot deflected off montreal defenseman josh gorges , but he probably rued his inability to prevent their second when the rangers entered the zone on a 3on2 , tokarski said he expected nash , who onetimed a crossice pass from kreider , not to have shot so quickly the puck appeared to graze tokarski s glove he caught me a bit off guard a bit , tokarski said tokarski had no chance on the third goal , a onetimer from the slot by st louis on a secondperiod power play but he kept the deficit at 31 , made 27 saves and appeared to earn another start , for game 3 thursday in new york we 're pleased with our decision , therrien said if tokarski does start game 3 , the experience helped he will be entrusted with the same mission as before restoring hope to a city and to a team when none , at the moment , seems to exist
the undergraduate who had been writing poems about killing people showed up for his appointment in my office carrying a black canvas backpack he was slim and darkhaired , his mouth torqued into an uneasy smile i had spoken several times about his violent ramblings to the campus police and to the university s office of mental health , and this was what they came up with i should invite the student to my office and calmly begin a conversation with the following question do you have a plan to harm yourself or anyone else \? they didn t specify a course of action if the answer was yes my office is small and square , with glass on three sides an oversize desk takes up most of the floor space i seated the undergrad and his backpack in the corner , leaving the door ajar so he was partly behind it in the open doorway , i seated the student s graduate teaching instructor a shy , softspoken young woman working on her master of fine arts in poetry it was she who had reported to me , her faculty supervisor , that despite clear and repeated instructions , the undergrad was writing things that had nothing to do with class assignments things that made the other students afraid she was to accompany me in the subtle art of interrogation , and the two of us had made an agreement at any sign of a problem , she was to sprint out of the office , assuming that i would be immediately behind her in order to follow us , the student would have to squeeze somewhat awkwardly between my desk and the proppedopen door did i imagine that a 20something poet and her middleaged faculty supervisor could outrun gunfire \? i don t remember what i remember is the backpack in the corner , larger than the typical student model , which attracted my gaze like a dark star and i remember the student s response to my carefully scripted question about a possible plan to harm himself or others if i were going to pull a virginia tech or a columbine , he said , i wouldn t tell you about it , would i \? as a teacher of creative writing , i m accustomed to disturbing subject matter during a typical semester i read depictions of sexual assault , addiction and various flavors of violence , some of it otherworldly \( sepulchers , werewolves \) , some of it inspired by slasher films undergrads often turn to creative writing classes in pursuit of catharsis , returning to their french or physics majors with a renewed appreciation for language but otherwise unharmed and yet i had one colleague whose emotionally disturbed student had found out where he lived and taunted him with intimate , sinister messages , and another who saw her abusive student arrested only after he sent his threats through the mail the student in my office was visibly trembling i m going to ask you that same question again in a minute , i said , trying to speak softly we were already off script the poetinstructor was gazing earnestly at the floor we re concerned about what you ve been writing some of your classmates are frightened they want to drop the course i asked how he was doing in his other classes \( not very well \) how about in general , apart from school \? he confessed to anxiety and a history of depression but no , he did not want to talk to a counselor , because he d done that before i asked about his family \( he was an international student , alone in the united states \) and then his friends \( he said he had none \) then he started to cry the poetinstructor and i made empathetic sounds college was hard , we said both academic and social issues could be very stressful i realized i was avoiding a return to the question perhaps stalling for time , i asked about hobbies what did the student do when he wasn t studying \? did he have an outlet for relieving stress , maybe something outdoors \? yes , he said , the backpack slouched against his leg like a faithful dog guns he d been taking lessons at a shooting range our meeting lasted for almost an hour , and though it wasn t yet noon when it was over , i needed to go home i had sweated through my clothes i never got an answer to the question and because the student s written expressions of mayhem didn t pose a specific threat , there was no recourse , despite consultations with mental health professionals , the student s adviser , the campus police and a faculty committee on student conduct eventually the student dropped out , but before he did so i sat sentry outside his instructor s classroom while she taught her class was at night , at an hour when the building was mostly empty if violence had erupted , i doubt i would have been useful still , i sat outside her classroom , reading , waiting , because it seemed there was nothing else to do , a creative writing professor at the university of minnesota , is the author of the forthcoming novel dear committee members

the opened the door on thursday to the first searches in decades for and gas off the atlantic coast , recommending that undersea seismic surveys proceed , though with a host of safeguards to shield marine life from much of their impact the recommendation is likely to be adopted after a period of public comment and over objections by environmental activists who say it will be ruinous for the climate and sea life alike the american petroleum institute called the recommendation a critical step toward bolstering the nation s energy security , predicting that oil and gas production in the region could create 280 , 000 new jobs and generate 195 billion in private investment activists were livid allowing exploration could be a death sentence for many marine mammals , and is needlessly turning the atlantic ocean into a blast zone , jacqueline savitz , a vice president at the conservation group oceana , said in a statement on thursday oceana and other groups have campaigned for months against the atlantic survey plans , citing interior department calculations that the intense noise of seismic exploration could kill and injure thousands of dolphins and whales but while repeats those estimates , it also largely dismisses them , stating that they employ multiple worstcase scenarios and ignore measures by humans and the mammals themselves to avoid harm many marine scientists say the estimates of death and injury are at best seriously inflated there s no argument that some of these sounds can harm animals , but it s blown out of proportion , arthur n popper , who heads the , said in an interview it s the flipper syndrome , or free willy' how the noise affects sea mammals' behavior in the long term an issue about which little is known is a much greater concern , he said a formal decision to proceed with surveys would reopen a swath off the east coast stretching from delaware to cape canaveral , fla , that has been closed to petroleum exploration since the early 1980s actual drilling of test wells could not begin until a white house ban on production in the atlantic expires in 2017 , and even then , only after the government agrees to lease ocean tracts to oil companies , an issue officials have barely begun to study the petroleum industry has sunk 51 wells off the east coast none of them successful enough to begin production in decades past but the interior department said in 2011 that 33 billion barrels of recoverable oil and 312 trillion cubic feet of natural gas could lie in the exploration area , and nine companies have already applied for permits to begin surveys committed in 2010 to allowing oil and gas surveys along the same stretch of the atlantic , and the government had planned to lease tracts off the virginia coast for exploration in 2011 but those plans collapsed after the deepwater horizon oil rig disaster in april 2010 , and the government later banned activity in the area until 2017 thirtyfour species of whales and dolphins , including six endangered whales , live in the survey area environmental activists say seismic exploration could deeply imperil blue and humpback whales as well as the north american right whale , which numbers in the hundreds surveys generally use compressedair guns that produce repeated bursts of sound as loud as a howitzer , often for weeks or months on end the interior department s estimate said that up to 27 , 000 dolphins and 4 , 600 whales could die or be injured annually during exploration periods , and that three million more would suffer various behavioral changes but many scientists say death and injury are not a major concern decades of seismic exploration worldwide have yet to yield a confirmed whale death , the government says it is quite unlikely that most sounds , in realistic scenarios , will directly cause injury or mortality to marine mammals , brandon southall , perhaps the bestknown expert on the issue , wrote in an email exchange most of the issues now really have to do with what are the sublethal effects what are the changes in behavior that may happen dr southall is president of , an environmental consultancy in santa cruz , calif loud sounds like seismic blasts appear to cause stress to marine mammals , just as they do to humans experts say seismic exploration could alter feeding and mating habits , for example , or simply drown out whales' and dolphins' efforts to communicate or find one another but the true impact has yet to be measured there is no easy way to gauge the longterm effect of sound on animals that are constantly moving these animals are living for decades , if not centuries , said aaron rice , the director of cornell university s bioacoustics research program the responses you see are not going to manifest themselves in hours or days or weeks we 're largely speculating as to what the consequences will be but in my mind , the absence of data does n't mean there is n't a problem
peoria , ariz the rebuilt their spring training complex this year , and now , they hope , they have reshaped their identity the man with three lockers one with his name above it , between two empty stalls in the far left corner of the clubhouse is the cornerstone , charged with reviving a sagging brand it took a 10year , 240 million contract for the mariners to lure from the , and he is not thinking too far ahead that is for the best , and in line with the franchise s vision i do n't want to think about five years from now , cano said tuesday after his first workout i want to go year by year we 're going to play 2014 you do n't want to think about '17 , what s going to happen the mariners , who have lost half their fans in the last 11 years , cannot worry about how cano will play later in the deal after four losing seasons in a row and eight of the last 10 overpaying for cano was their best hope to be relevant beyond their ace righthander , felix hernandez when i got the job five years ago , we were saying we wanted to build the thing through player development and scouting , general manager jack zduriencik said we 've done that we 've stripped it down , now we 've built it back up , and we 've got some really nice young players but we were at a point that we had a star in felix , and we did n't have a star on the field we thought it was important to launch out and try to bring in a really good player they found one in cano , a fivetime allstar who has averaged 160 games the last seven seasons his combination of highlevel production and durability is rare , especially at second base , although his habit of not always hustling on ground balls remains a flash point kevin long , the yankees' hitting coach , told the daily news that while he roots for cano , he never understood why cano refused to run hard every time cano would not return fire tuesday , but his new manager , lloyd mcclendon , did i did n't know he was the spokesman for the new york yankees , mcclendon said of long my concern is robinson cano in a seattle mariners uniform and what he does moving forward mcclendon said he spoke with cano and emphasized that he expects a fair effort from every player but he added in the big scheme of things , would i rather have a guy out there for 160 games , hitting 300 and driving in over 100 \? i 'll take that cano , a career 309 hitter , averaged 24 homers and 97 runs batted in per season for the yankees in the history of the mariners , only four players have reached or exceeded those levels in a season , and none since bret boone in 2001 that was also the year seattle last reached the playoffs zduriencik added more than cano to his young core , acquiring closer fernando rodney and outfielders logan morrison and corey hart morrison , who spent the last four seasons with the marlins , said that when he was traded to seattle in december , he knew of only three players on the team hernandez , cano and center fielder michael saunders i could n't even tell you their records , if they were above 500 or not they 're just one of those teams i did n't pay attention to , morrison said , adding that the new additions had changed the expectations there s definitely a message that they want to win , and they want to win right now brad miller , 24 , hit 265 as a rookie last season and projects to be cano s doubleplay partner at shortstop he said he was startled this winter when he learned from a friend that his team had signed cano i could never picture him in anything other than a yankee uniform , miller said , because that s what i 've grown up seeing him play in but that was cano , all right , whipping his slick lefthanded swing on the dusty back fields , a mariners compass rose on his cap a complementary star until now , cano is the frontman for the mariners , who put him on the cover of their pocket schedule and seasonticket brochure hernandez , a former cy young award winner , seems happy to cede the spotlight he is tied to the mariners through 2020 , and decided to stay partly because he believes in the plan of the front office hernandez , from venezuela , spent most of his winter in seattle , including early february , when the seahawks won the super bowl the parade was unbelievable , hernandez said i watched it on tv i was going to go , but it was too many people it was crazy it was like a million people the mariners still seem a long way from staging a similar party they paid a lot for cano to bring them closer , but for an organization stuck in neutral , progress has to start somewhere i chose here , i'm here now , and i'm excited , cano said i just ca n't wait for the season to start
maryland regulators this month revoked the medical license of an anesthesiologist for helping six ill people , none of whom had terminal conditions , to commit suicide the doctor , lawrence d egbert , 87 , lost the maryland medical license he had held for more than 60 years after a disciplinary panel for the found that he had engaged in unprofessional conduct while working as the medical director for the , which offers aid to people who are suffering from intolerable medical circumstances state regulators said that dr egbert had acted as what the network calls an exit guide for six people in maryland from may 2004 to november 2008 dr egbert reviewed their applications and medical records and recommended accepting them as members , said the order , which was signed by christine a farrelly , the executive director of the board of physicians dr egbert attended their suicide rehearsals he held each member s hand and talked to him or her each of the patients died , the state said , of asphyxiation caused by helium inhalation , and dr egbert removed the hoods and helium tanks from the places where the five women and one man died those patients had been diagnosed with conditions that included parkinson s disease , multiple sclerosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in a brief telephone interview on tuesday evening , dr egbert said he planned to appeal the board s decision what we 're doing should be available to any patient with an incurable , horrible disease that they 've tried everything on , and it does n't seem to work , he said the state , he said , misportrayed me and was undermining what he defends as a constitutional right to advise people how to die in its order on dec 12 , the board of physicians it had deemed dr egbert s conduct unprofessional the board said he had violated the american medical association s code of medical ethics and that his activities were illegal under maryland law it is unclear whether dr egbert will be prosecuted in maryland maryland regulators first charged dr egbert with misconduct in late 2012 , and an administrative law judge recommended more than a year later that he lose his medical license maryland records show that dr egbert has not been disciplined within the last decade by other state medical boards the decision in maryland is the latest effort by government agencies to sanction dr egbert for his activities before he could stand trial in georgia , the state s supreme court voted to strike down the law under which he was being prosecuted he was acquitted of criminal charges in arizona he is also facing prosecution in minnesota dr egbert has been loosely compared to dr jack kevorkian , the michigan pathologist who in 1998 was videotaped administering a lethal cocktail to a 52yearold man we kind of look upon him like we do dr kevorkian one of the pioneers of all of this who helped bring attention to the movement , said dr frank kavanaugh , an advisory board member for final exit network i think that there are some people who do it quietly , dr kavanaugh added he always spoke out he was always a bit of a pioneer and a rebel
donetsk , ukraine rocket fire slammed into an elementary school and a city bus here on wednesday morning , killing nine people , while fighting continued to rage at the donetsk airport although both the ukrainian government and the separatist rebels who hold donetsk formally declared a ceasefire on sep 5 , the increasing tally of the dead and wounded in recent days has shown the agreement to be largely a fiction several witnesses said that a biology teacher , a parent and a rebel fighter of the donetsk people s republic were killed in one rocket attack , at elementary school 57 zoya nikolayevna , the school s receptionist , said that all of the students were in class when she heard two loud claps , and the windows of the building blew in none of the students were killed , she said i was late ringing the bell to end the first day of classes , which ended early , she said i ca n't imagine what would have happened if i had been on time they could have been killed down the street , a rocket that appeared to have been launched in the same volley struck a public bus , killing six and leaving the hollowedout shell of the bus burning in the street for hours the ukrainian army and the separatists blamed each other for the attack the city remains under rebel control and the attack came from the direction of the airport , which is held by the army near the school , there were large fragments of metal consistent with grad rockets , which are fired somewhat indiscriminately from truckmounted , multiplerocket launchers and are used by both sides in the conflict mikhail s zoloto , the deputy director of the donetsk morgue , said in an interview this week that more than 1 , 400 bodies had passed through the morgue since march 15 , when the fighting began it is not uncommon for the morgue to take in dozens of bodies a day , he said , especially on mondays when he and his colleagues return to work after the weekend in total , the war has left more than 3 , 500 people dead foreign minister sergey v lavrov of russia on wednesday accused the west and western news outlets of trying to hush up war crimes that he said had been carried out by ukrainian military and paramilitary forces chief among them was a claim that rebels had found more than 400 bodies in mass graves in a city near donetsk held for some time by army forces however , a senior rebel leader told the interfax news agency that only nine bodies had been found in the graves we were misunderstood , said andrei purgin , the deputy prime minister of the donetsk people s republic we meant that 400 was the general number of unidentified bodies that remain in morgues in donetsk in the neighboring zaporizhzhya region , ukrainian officials buried 54 unidentified government fighters at a public ceremony , where many supporters and mourners expressed anger both at the rebel republics and at the kiev government for what they called mismanagement of the war effort we need another change in government , said vasily parashin , a volunteer fighter for the zaporizhzhya national guard , a proukrainian volunteer unit , as he shoveled dirt into one of the graves mr parashin , 52 , a former factory worker , said that he was ready to fight but would prefer to remain in his native zaporizhzhya to defend it from a possible invasion i am not opposed to going to kiev when this is all over , he said we need new people there , generals and officers , not the politicians playing their political game the 54 men were killed during a battle in the city of ilovaysk , seen as a turning point in the overall conflict , where several proukrainian paramilitary battalions suffered a ruinous defeat at the hands of russian and rebel artillery many of those present said they believed the government had intentionally underestimated the number of government soldiers killed in the fighting angel , a soldier from the donbass battalion who did not want to give his full name for fear of reprisals , said that 40 of the soldiers from his battalion who were killed in an attack on their troop transport had been classified as missing , and that the real number of dead are far higher than what you see in the press
maybe it s those five oscar nominations for the wolf of wall street , including for best picture , best director and best actor , but we seem to be in another of those moments in popular culture when hollywood plies us with skewed answers about how wall street miscreants caused so much mayhem we have seen this movie before the genre owes much to the director oliver stone s original wall street , which played off the excesses of the 1980s and was released just after the crash of 1987 , when the dow jones industrial average fell 226 percent on a single october day but more recent grist for the mill has been provided by wall street money never sleeps , margin call and arbitrage jordan belfort , the antihero of the wolf of wall street , played by leonardo dicaprio , is a direct descendant of mr stone s creation , gordon gekko he of the maxim , greed , for lack of a better word , is good as a cautionary tale of a repeat cycle of greed that led to our latest bubble and bust , the wolf of wall street is quite a portrait that the director has painted for us there are the quaaludes and the mounds of cocaine , the prostitutes and the hamptons mansions , the substancefueled orgies and the fast cars , the deceit and criminality , and yes , the greed and did i mention the quaaludes \? it s all wildly entertaining even if , technically , the business model depicted in mr scorsese s film is fairly remote from any actual or even figurative wall street bank in the boiler room operation located at a long island strip mall , barely qualified salesmen pressured the na ve into buying highly risky stocks of marginal companies i can sympathize with mr scorsese s problem can you imagine the box office bomb that would have resulted had he chosen a scenario in which mr dicaprio played a recent ivy league graduate poring over an excel spreadsheet at 2 am \? but it s not only hollywood that is marketing lurid depictions of a wall street culture prone to the most flagrant of moral lapses last month , that j t stone , the pseudonym for the assumed goldman sachs banker behind the satirical gselevator twitter feed \( 619 , 000 followers and counting \) , had inked a deal for straight to hell true tales of deviance and excess in the world of investment banking mr stone s tellall book promises to reveal a world that is far more abhorrent , and yet , way more entertaining than people can imagine but do these portrayals bear any relation to quotidian life in the salt mines of high finance \? my 17 years' experience on wall street , mostly spent as a mergers and acquisitions banker at lazard , merrill lynch and jpmorgan chase , where i was a managing director , admittedly ended a decade ago , but it could not have been more different from what these popularculture sensations would have us believe about working in finance \( true , i never worked at a bucket shop like stratton oakmont the twobit brokerage started by jordan belfort , the author of the memoir adapted by mr scorsese as the wolf nor did i ever work on a trading desk at goldman sachs , so perhaps i missed the raucous and ribald workplace that mr stone is intent on portraying \) my wall street was an endlessseeming succession of late nights , ruled by the demands of clients and bosses an investment banking crisis , in my world , was when a surly senior banker would finally deign to look at a client presentation the night before it was due the ensuing tirade would require me and my team to pull allnighters to make the changes she or he demanded mine , too , was the glamour of a redeye flight to a european capital to meet with the executives of a large corporation there was no time for sleep because of the inevitable fiddling with the presentation i remember biting the inside of my lip to stay awake in those lateafternoon meetings i lived in a constant fugue state , rushing from one meeting to the next , constantly hoping a chief executive would pursue the deal i was advocating getting hired for a new assignment , with its potential for a multimilliondollar fee for the firm , was a rare moment of drugfree euphoria to be followed by the long downer of sleepless nights as i toiled to make the deal happen i used to say of investment banking that it was good one day a year the day you got your bonus the kicker that bonus was nothing more than the present value of an inevitable pink slip being well paid but expendable was a fact of life hubris and excess \? yes , i saw plenty , too there was always the banker or trader who , without a second s thought , would plunk down 100 , 000 in cash for a porsche 911 carrera or 250 , 000 for a summer rental in the hamptons and how to top the fact that richard s fuld jr , the final chief executive of lehman brothers , is estimated to have made 520 million in cumulative compensation while presiding over the collapse of his firm \? yet my abiding memory is the drudgery of it all none of which has ever been captured on film or in print with good reason much of what happens on wall street is terrifically boring the allocation of capital is not , as a rule , sexy but the way capital becomes available to start new companies or to allow existing ones to expand and hire new workers is vital for our collective wealth as a society that is wall street s untold tale the crucial and economically beneficial role capital markets play as much fun as they are as fantasies , what the caricatures of wall street do is obscure the very real need to change the behavior of wall street s bankers , traders and executives i am not talking about drinking and drugging people who overindulge quickly burn themselves out on wall street the change wall street needs is about what people get rewarded to do , which is to take risks with other people s money we saw how corrosive bad incentives were in the years leading up the financial crisis , when huge bonuses were paid to those who bundled up millions of faulty mortgages into securities and sold them as safe investments to people all over the world many of them knew better , but they did it anyway speculating without any concern about being held accountable is exactly what the army of wall street bankers and traders will continue to do regardless of the fact that this very behavior was a key cause of the recent financial mess , that is what they are still being rewarded to do wall streeters like to extol the complexity of their work , but in reality , it s that simple the doddfrank act , the volcker rule , the increased capital requirements and the rest have done next to nothing to change the fundamental fact that bankers and traders are still being rewarded to take imprudent risks with other people s money in order to get big bonuses that s the wall street reality the rest is just entertainment
on wednesday evening , new york city ballet , in a quadruple bill of works choreographed to tchaikovsky music by its cofounder george balanchine , and plunging its audience into the quintessence of classical ballet , strongly suggested that it has again become the world s foremost ballet company and perhaps the best news is that the troupe s orchestra , led on this occasion by clotilde otranto , played the tchaikovsky scores with a greater tonal beauty and eloquence of phrasing than i have heard from it these scores are familiar , but the evening had moments when phrases seized the heart anew at city ballet , tchaikovsky is spelled tschaikovsky the reasoning is good that s how the composer spelled it when he visited new york in 1891 the four scores in this program , which recurs in repertory through oct 19 , were composed from 1877 to 1887 the serenade for strings the pas de deux music created for the second cast of the original swan lake and the third and fourth orchestral suites in those few years tchaikovsky established in depth and breadth the dance elements that he so often made fundamental to his music balanchine was by no means the first to make ballets to tchaikovsky s concert music , but throughout his long career he returned to tchaikovsky scores , often reworking or supplementing pieces he had made before wednesday s ballets were serenade \( a 1934 piece that he revised up to the last years of his life \) , mozartiana \( his 1981 version of a score he had choreographed several times before \) , tschaikovsky pas de deux \( 1960 \) and tschaikovsky suite no 3 \( a 1970 work reaching its climax in its theme and variations final movement , which he had choreographed in 1947 \) in these four pieces , balanchine redefined the romanticclassical quintessence of ballet chivalrous , fervent and sparkling there are five companies with outstandingly strong and influential classical styles in ballet the mariinsky of st petersburg , the bolshoi of moscow , the royal danes of copenhagen , the royal of london and city ballet i 've watched four of these this year , and from 2009 to 2011 watched the fifth , the royal danes , in three cities none of them are in ideal shape but wednesday night s performance , like many this year , showed that city ballet s classical dancing is gorgeously alive above all in terms of dance musicality and that it is doing more to honor its heritage than any of those other troupes a supplementary virtue is that it also has the best track record of any company this century for important choreographic premieres but , as most of the 21stcentury choreography in tuesday s openingnight gala showed , this area is more perilous most ballets that night showed how their choreographers could work only within the blandly sexist formulas of older classical ballet but the four balanchinetchaikovsky pieces on wednesday took us into the living heart of ballet s orthodoxy you can criticize aspects of the balanchine style the insistent frontality the preeminence of women and the presentation of men as their squires the far greater attention to ceremony and malefemale love than to matters of companionship and community and even features of its celebrated musicality but no ballet choreographer has ever left the world with so impressive , diverse and influential a body of work serenade surely the most miraculous of all ballets amazed again , with the corps de ballet borne on the music and with gloriously individual central performances by sara mearns , sterling hyltin and teresa reichlen this ballet contains so much the way it says individual lives pass , but the ballet academy endures the fleeting images of grief , love , loss and death the consolatory support that the group gives to individuals and the extraordinary transcendence ms mearns and ms hyltin were often breathtaking generous , expansive , urgent whereas the heroine of serenade gradually attains an exalted condition , apparently addressing the numinous , the prima of mozartiana starts out that way yet mozartiana takes us in the opposite direction , back into the mortal world and into sublime humor it was heartening to see maria kowroski dance this role with new flair although she does n't have the technical resources to play with her music and to make wit from the deliberately unorthodox strokes that embellish the solo variations in the th me et variations finale , her quietly spectacular beauty on this occasion cast a spell tyler angle s elegant charm does much to help the chief male role of mozartiana , but he makes its dance accents conventional , even glib daniel ulbricht , despite his smart timing , cannot show the \( very elusive \) musical point of the gigue solo perhaps the best news here was that the long menuet for four women , which so often proves tedious , was alive with enthusiastic freshness the whole performance suggested that city ballet s women are reaching new peaks of ardor , sweep and playfully expansive authority the blaze of ashley bouder s dancing in the tschaikovsky pas de deux was wonderfully multifaceted the astonishing impetus she achieved in topspeed passages had touches of swagger and amusement as her partner , gonzalo garcia , most of whose balanchine dancing with city ballet has been tepid , showed incisiveness and glee rebecca krohn distinguished the opening l gie of tschaikovsky suite no 3 with fervor and in the final tema con variazioni \( why did tchaikovsky use french and italian on different occasions for the same musical construction \? \) , tiler peck and joaquin de luz danced with supreme virtuosity this finale is grander than these two remarkable dancers there is something too collected about ms peck s dazzling way of playing with time , and mr de luz s phrasing flattens some dynamic contrasts but the technical level of both was so high that i feel guilty making cavils it s exciting to contemplate the season that lies ahead

every day the headlines from the arab world get worse an al qaeda affiliate group , aided by foreign fighters , battles with seven different homegrown syrian rebel groups for control of the region around aleppo , syria the iranian embassy in beirut is bombed mohamad chatah , an enormously decent former lebanese finance minister , is blown up after criticizing hezbollah s brutish tactics another proal qaeda group takes control of fallujah , iraq explosions rock egypt , where the army is now jailing islamists and secular activists libya is a mess of competing militias what s going on \? some say it s all because of the power vacuum america has absented itself from the region but this is not just about us there s also a huge values vacuum the middle east is a highly pluralistic region shiites , sunnis , kurds , christians , druze and various tribes that for centuries was held together from above by ironfisted colonial powers , kings and dictators but now that vertical control has broken down , before this pluralistic region has developed any true bottomup pluralism a broad ethic of tolerance that might enable its people to live together as equal citizens , without an iron fist from above for the arab awakening to have any future , the ideology that is most needed now is the one being promoted least pluralism until that changes , argues marwan muasher , in his extremely relevant new book the second arab awakening and the battle for pluralism none of the arab uprisings will succeed again , president obama could have done more to restrain leaders in iraq , egypt , saudi arabia , iran or syria from going to extremes but , ultimately , argues muasher , this is the arabs' fight for their political future if 500 , 000 american troops in iraq , and 1 trillion , could not implant lasting pluralism in the cultural soil there , no outsider can , said muasher there also has to be a will from within why is it that some 15 , 000 arabs and muslims have flocked to syria to fight and die for jihadism and zero have flocked to syria to fight and die for pluralism \? is it only because we did n't give the good guys big enough guns \? as muasher , a former jordanian foreign minister and now a vice president at the carnegie endowment in washington , put it in an interview three years of the arab uprising have shown the bankruptcy of all the old political forces in the arab world the corrupt secular autocrats who failed to give their young people the tools to thrive and , as a result , triggered these uprisings are still locked in a struggle with islamists , who also have no clue how to deliver jobs , services , security and economic growth \( tunisia may be an exception \) as long as we 're in the this zerosum game , the sum will be zero , says muasher no sustainable progress will be possible , argues muasher , without the ethic of pluralism permeating all aspects of arab society pluralism of thought , pluralism in gender opportunities , pluralism in respect to other religions , pluralism in education , pluralism toward minorities , pluralism of political parties rotating in power and pluralism in the sense of everyone s right to think differently from the collective the first arab awakening in the 20th century was a fight for independence from colonial powers , says muasher it never continued as a fight for democracy and pluralism that war of ideas , he insists , is what the second arab awakening has to be about neither the autocrats nor the islamists can deliver progress pluralism is the operating system we need to solve all our problems , and as long as that operating system is not in place , we will not get there this is an internal battle let s stop hoping for delivery from the outside this will take time na ve \? no na ve is thinking that everything is about the absence or presence of american power , and that the people of the region have no agency that s wrong iraq is splintering because prime minister maliki behaved like a shiite militiaman , not an iraqi mandela arab youths took their future in their own hands , motivated largely by pluralistic impulses but the old order proved to be too stubborn , yet these youth aspirations have not gone away , and will not the arab world will go through a period of turmoil in which exclusionist forces will attempt to dominate the landscape with absolute truths and new dictatorships , writes muasher but these forces will also fade , because , in the end , the exclusionist , authoritarian discourses cannot answer the people s needs for better quality of life as history has demonstrated overwhelmingly , where there is respect for diversity , there is prosperity contrary to what arab societies have been taught for decades by their governments to believe that tolerance , acceptance of different points of view , and critical thinking are destructive to national unity and economic growth experience proves that societies cannot keep renewing themselves and thereby thrive except through diversity muasher , who is returning to jordan to participate in this struggle for diversity , dedicated his book to the youth of the arab world who revolted , not against their parents , but on their behalf
tom wolf , a wealthy businessman and a former peace corps volunteer , won the democratic nomination for governor of pennsylvania on tuesday , setting up what his party hopes will be one of its best chances this fall to flip a governor s mansion now held by a republican , virtually anonymous before spending as much as 10 million of his own money on television ads , will face to credit him for an improving economy and to forgive him for a drop in education spending in his first year speaking to supporters after his victory at a minorleague baseball stadium in york , his hometown , mr wolf accused mr corbett of leading an administration that wants to hollow out our schools and play fast and loose with jobs this week , mr corbett seized on the latest report of the state s declining unemployment rate , the lowest since september 2008 , which will probably be a central issue in the general election even before the primary , mr corbett began attacking mr wolf , the clear democratic frontrunner , by tying him to the administration of gov edward g rendell , a democrat under whom mr wolf served for 18 months as revenue secretary mocking the beatup 2006 jeep that mr wolf is seen driving in his campaign ads , mr corbett released an ad showing a stalledout jeep and blaming mr wolf for serving in government during a time of high taxes and rising unemployment with 85 percent of districts reporting , mr wolf , 65 , led with 58 percent of the vote , and the associated press declared him the winner over three rivals all three were probably better known to voters just six months ago representative , a fiveterm congresswoman from the philadelphia suburbs , the state treasurer and , a former state secretary of the environment but ms schwartz captured just 18 percent of the vote , mr mccord 16 percent and ms mcginty less than 8 percent ms schwartz , who made a rare ad boasting of her support of president obama s , had sought to appeal to women to end the old boys' club in harrisburg , the capital she led in early polls last year but once mr wolf began airing television ads in late january two months ahead of his rivals , who were busy fundraising he shot to a doubledigit lead that continued to widen it was a textbook case of flooding the airwaves to create a likable image with voters the ads , which featured mr wolf driving his black jeep , introduced him as a phd graduate of the massachusetts institute of technology who once drove a forklift for his family s kitchen cabinet business , and who after growing rich shared the profits with employees none of the four democrats stood apart when it came to their attacks on mr corbett all agreed and mr wolf is likely to continue raising the issues that the governor was responsible for a 1 billion cut to education during his first year in office mr wolf also called for a tax on natural gas drillers , which he said should do more to share their prosperity with the state mr corbett opposes taxing drillers more , saying they will move to other states mr corbett , in a message to supporters before polls closed , professed no preference for who his rival might be they all represent the same biggovernment taxandspend policies that have failed us before , he wrote in arkansas where democrats hope to retain the office held by gov mike beebe , who is unable to run because of term limits mike ross , a former congressman , defeated lynette bryant for the party s nomination mr ross will face the republican nominee , asa hutchinson , also a former congressman , in november mr hutchinson defeated a little rock businessman , curtis coleman in georgia , as expected , jason carter , a democratic state senator and grandson of former president jimmy carter , and gov nathan deal , the republican incumbent , won primaries and will face each other in november
athens leonardo dicaprio s face glowed triumphantly from a large billboard here atop the athinaion , an old movie theater where the wolf of wall street was recently playing mr dicaprio had just been nominated for an oscar , and vasilis dimitriou had painted him larger than life , with a gleaming gold statuette against a sea of red and black brush strokes the look was vintage movie poster , bordering on 1940s noir , imbuing mr dicaprio with a mysterious allure befitting humphrey bogart back in the day mr dimitriou , 78 , has never met a hollywood star , but he has painted thousands of them nearly every week since the age of 15 , he has immortalized legends of the screen in dreamlike friezes of love , anger , pride or temptation often deftly , sometimes not , but always with flair heroes are depicted as if from the pages of a comic book in a moody haze of luminescence and shadow , with an atmosphere that flits between reality and fantasy the romanticized images evoke an earlier age of celluloid , movie magazines and cigarettesmoking starlets , incongruous in an age of dvds and downloads , digital marquees and movies on demand today , he is the last living movie billboard painter in greece , and one of only a handful in europe , his craft on the verge of extinction when silent films took off in the 1920s , hollywood studios employed graphic designers to convey the glamour and excitement of new releases , and handmade billboards came to adorn theaters around the world the rise of the automobile helped spur a booming industry of painted highway billboards across america , europe , africa and in asia but in an era of massproduced printing , the practice has been all but snuffed out only a tiny number of people like mr dimitriou keep up the tradition painting is always on my mind , he said one recent evening in his brightly lit atelier , surrounded by a kaleidoscope of paint pots and billboardsize canvases when i finish a poster and put it in the theater , it s a thrilling feeling , knowing that people will see it and feel some magic his left hand is stiffened with parkinson s disease the result , doctors suspect , of a brief stint as a boxer in his youth he no longer climbs paint ladders easily , and his arm can tire after hours of holding a brush but none of that deters the trim , feisty mr dimitriou athenians of all ages are familiar with his work , even if few have ever met him there was something stylized and nostalgic about the painted billboards , said george athanasopoulous , 50 , who remembers being transfixed by them as a child like for james bond , he would do a portrait of roger moore surrounded by guns , he recalled today , there is a sameness to everything , mr athanasopoulous added but what he does is very special for a nearoctogenarian , mr dimitriou has a daunting schedule each affiche takes three to four days to complete , and he paints one to two a week for the athinaion , which has employed him for more than 40 years and is the last theater in athens to eschew studiomade photographic posters dressed in a wool cap and a black sweater , he bustled about his small work space , a lowslung stucco building with one wall made to the exact dimensions of the athinaion s billboards a cropped image of mr dicaprio s head rested near paint pots , while pen lope cruz , smoldering in a studio shot from the 2001 movie blow , pouted from a wall my girlfriend , mr dimitriou said with a smile nearby , a scrapbook bulged with photos of his renderings the exorcist , forebodingly painted in chiaroscuro , blood oozing down the greek letters of the title lolita , with a lithe , prepubescent dominique swain stretched in a wet dress on the grass , her toe pointed in the air ali , with will smith s boxer face tensed like a bull s mr dimitriou grew up poor in the athens suburb of kypseli his father was often absent during world war ii to fight in the greek resistance as the german army advanced to bide time , the boy began drawing , and a passion seized him lacking money for pencils or even paper , he would scrounge chalk and sketch pictures on sidewalks then the war crashed in on his reveries after his eighth birthday , nazis stormed their home and took his father away miraculously , his father survived execution , crawling from a mass grave and making his way back to the house , covered in blood he went to stay with comrades and continued fighting it was the last the boy would see of him for two years mr dimitriou took refuge in his drawing , and after the war ended , it would become his ticket out penniless , he and his friends climbed trees at an outdoor cinema to catch the latest films one night the manager chased them , and mr dimitriou jumped into the theater , where the projector operator collared him and suggested he volunteer in exchange for watching films soon , the manager noticed mr dimitriou s drawing talent and asked him to try painting movie posters i would interpret the scene my own way , he recalled his favorite stars got the best treatment if i saw gary cooper and marlon brando , i 'd paint brando , who had a rawer allure , he said eventually , 10 theaters around athens would commission his work for mr dimitriou , it was a golden age of cinema back then , you would go to the movies in a suit and tie , he recalled women would wear beautiful dresses there was an intermission , and half the theater would go the foyer to have a drink and discuss the movie now that s gone so , too , is the industry that he and a small army of artists used to keep alive but his local legend remains this month , mr dimitriou tacked up a canvas in his atelier and sketched a montage for winter s tale , featuring jessica brown findlay in her cinematic debut after downton abbey to make paints that wo n't run in the rain , he boiled glue on a makeshift stove and added it to powdered pigments chrome yellow , red , lapis blue , turquoise he worked silently and methodically , climbing a ladder and squatting on stools as he made his way across the canvas when it was ready , he drove to the athinaion with his soninlaw to hoist the poster on the marquee a man approached i'm a huge fan , he said , giving mr dimitriou a hug later , back in his atelier , mr dimitriou sighed recognition was gratifying still , he said , it does n't feel so good knowing that this is a dying art he leafed through the pages of his scrapbook , and gazed at oil paintings he had done for himself , including a redhued homage to ms cruz as long as i can keep painting , i 'll do it , he said when i stop breathing is when i 'll stop painting
washington s new memoir was out , and the president was livid the president , it asserted , was blind to major problems and presided over a white house with a lack of principles the president told aides the book was a case study on how to screw the white house the year was 1971 , the president was richard m nixon and the author , mr panetta , had written his original memoir after serving as nixon s civil rights chief so if feels a little raw about mr panetta s latest memoir , worthy fights , published tuesday amid a flurry of news media appearances , at least he has some company the white house tellall or tellsome , as the case may be is hardly a new phenomenon for the presidency in recent decades , it has become a ritual in washington , particularly during second terms when advisers departed from first terms chronicle their experiences for history or good royalties or both , often with a harsh edge what may be new is how much more amplified these books have become with the advent of the internet , social media and cable television , none of which were a part of american life when mr panetta s first book came out 43 years ago mr obama finds himself under repeated assault as criticisms are excavated from his own team s accounts , refashioned into political missiles and fired at him with precision and repetition even before anyone had actually read mr panetta s latest book , critics were seizing pieces of it to make points gov bobby jindal of louisiana cited mr panetta this week in arguing that mr obama should have left troops in iraq house republican aides sent out to their huge email lists mr panetta s criticism of mr obama s decision to rule out using ground troops against the islamic state the most important thing i learned from my experience , said matt latimer , who wrote a memoir of his time as a speechwriter for president george w bush , was that people do n't really want an honest look at history in these memoirs they want a partisan weapon for the white house , the emergence of yet another memoir has been greeted with weary resignation after books by robert m gates , hillary rodham clinton and timothy f geithner the cycle has become familiar the author , or an aide , typically gives mr obama s staff a headsup and insists that the book is generally positive but what the president s aides understand , even if the author does not , is that does not matter if there is a hint of criticism , it will be highlighted by a publisher eager to generate attention and by a news media on the hunt what hurts is when the criticism ratifies the doubts that already exist , said ari fleischer , mr bush s first white house press secretary and when it comes from someone who s on the same team , it validates the point of view of the critics mr panetta s analysis tends to square with that of critics and he is not the only one with a new book making similar points christopher r hill , who was the ambassador to iraq under mr obama , is out with his own book , outpost , arguing that the administration neglected baghdad although vice president joseph r biden jr said it was inappropriate to write while the president was still in office , mr obama offered no criticism the president intentionally sought out strong , experienced cabinet members who would speak their minds , denis r mcdonough , the white house chief of staff , said by email he understood that could make for a messy process and public rehash of arguments that comes with the territory and makes for better policy that s why the president will continue to follow that approach people have to make their own judgments on whether they want to write books on their experience mr mcdonough s comments reflect the view of white house aides that taking issue with such books will only keep them in the public spotlight longer without oxygen being added , they burn themselves out more quickly , said anita dunn , a former white house communications director for mr obama mostly , the books are staples of the second term in the second four years of the reagan administration , david stockman wrote about the president s funny budget math , donald regan exposed nancy reagan s reliance on astrology , and larry speakes revealed that he had made up quotations in bill clinton s second term , george stephanopoulos wrote of his disillusionment working for the president , robert reich complained that mr clinton had abandoned progressive economic policies , and dick morris confessed that he sent the first family to wyoming for vacation because it tested better in polls in the first term of the second bush administration , david j frum , a former speechwriter , wrote one of the first bush white house memoirs and viewed it as largely positive , even titling it the right man television bookers canceled interviews because it was not negative enough , he said that is , until someone leaked a couple of critical passages to the drudge report , which produced the impression that it was a harsh portrayal other bush white house memoirs that followed were genuinely harsh , including those written in the first term by or with the cooperation of top officials like richard a clarke and paul o'neill and in the second term by david kuo and scott mcclellan the toughest book on mr bush may have been by mr mcclellan , his former press secretary , who wrote that the iraq war was sold to the public with a sophisticated political propaganda campaign mr latimer waited until after mr bush left office to publish i thought that would mute some of the criticism i would receive , said mr latimer , now a partner at a literary agency called javelin but it did not instead , he was excoriated by some republican friends as disloyal looking back now , he said , the notion of loyalty seems situational all the republicans cheer panetta for writing this memoir against obama , and it s the same people who would be tuttutting panetta if he was working for a republican president doing this , he said by the same token , democrats are unhappy about this when they had no problem with aides to president bush writing theirs mr latimer and mr frum argue that such books are important for history people owe a duty of loyalty to the president they served , mr frum said they also owe a duty of loyalty to the taxpayers who paid their salaries but others said that the books chilled inhouse discussions it creates a climate for anyone who works in the white house where they have to constantly ask themselves how they 're going to be portrayed by their colleagues , ms dunn said mr panetta has seen this before but last time , he had been fired by nixon for being too aggressive in pushing school desegregation in the south he later switched parties and ran for congress this time , he remains an admirer of mr obama and considers his book broadly positive i think if the president takes time to read it and for that matter , joe biden he is going to enjoy the book , he said in an interview maybe but they probably wo n't enjoy the controversy
dakope , bangladesh when a powerful storm destroyed her riverside home in 2009 , jahanara khatun lost more than the modest roof over her head in the aftermath , her husband died and she became so destitute that she sold her son and daughter into bonded servitude and she may lose yet more ms khatun now lives in a bamboo shack that sits below sea level about 50 yards from a sagging berm she spends her days collecting cow dung for fuel and struggling to grow vegetables in soil poisoned by salt water climate scientists predict that this area will be inundated as sea levels rise and storm surges increase , and a cyclone or another disaster could easily wipe away her rebuilt life but ms khatun is trying to hold out at least for a while one of millions living on borrowed time in this vast landscape of river islands , bamboo huts , heartbreaking choices and impossible hopes as in yokohama , japan , this week , at the top of the agenda is the prediction that global sea levels could rise more than higher seas and warmer weather will cause profound changes climate scientists have concluded that widespread burning of fossil fuels is releasing heattrapping gases that are warming the planet while this will produce a host of effects , the most worrisome may be the melting of much of the earth s ice , which is likely to raise sea levels and flood coastal regions such a rise will be uneven because of gravitational effects and human intervention , so predicting its outcome in any one place is difficult but island nations like the maldives , kiribati and fiji may lose much of their land area , and millions of bangladeshis will be displaced there are a lot of places in the world at risk from rising sea levels , but bangladesh is at the top of everybody s list , said rafael reuveny , a professor in the at indiana university at bloomington and the world is not ready to cope with the problems the effects of climate change have led to a growing sense of outrage in developing nations , many of which have contributed little to the pollution that is linked to rising temperatures and sea levels but will suffer the most from the consequences at a climate conference in warsaw in november , there was from countries that face existential threats , among them bangladesh , which produces just 03 percent of the emissions driving climate change some leaders have demanded that rich countries compensate poor countries for polluting the atmosphere a few have even said that developed countries should open their borders to climate migrants it s a matter of global justice , said atiq rahman , executive director of the and the nation s leading climate scientist these migrants should have the right to move to the countries from which all these greenhouse gases are coming millions should be able to go to the united states river deltas around the globe are particularly vulnerable to the effects of rising seas , and wealthier cities like london , venice and new orleans also face uncertain futures but it is the poorest countries with the biggest populations that will be hit hardest , and none more so than bangladesh , one of the most densely populated nations in the world in the ganges delta , made up of 230 major rivers and streams , 160 million people live in a place onefifth the size of france and as flat as chapati , the bread served at almost every meal though bangladesh has contributed little to industrial air pollution , other kinds of environmental degradation have left it especially vulnerable bangladesh relies almost entirely on groundwater for drinking supplies because the rivers are so polluted the resultant pumping causes the land to settle so as sea levels are rising , bangladesh s cities are sinking , increasing the risks of flooding poorly constructed seawalls compound the problem the country s climate scientists and politicians have come to agree that by 2050 , rising sea levels will inundate some 17 percent of the land and displace about 18 million people , dr rahman said bangladeshis have already started to move away from the lowestlying villages in the river deltas of the bay of bengal , scientists in bangladesh say people move for many reasons , and urbanization is increasing across south asia , but rising tides are a big factor dr rahman s research group has made a rough estimate from small surveys that as many as 15 million of the five million slum inhabitants in dhaka , the capital , moved from villages near the bay of bengal the slums that greet them in dhaka are also built on lowlying land , making them almost as vulnerable to being inundated as the land villagers left behind ms khatun and her neighbors have lived through deadly cyclones a synonym here for hurricane and have seen the salty rivers chew through villages and poison fields rising seas are increasingly intruding into rivers , turning fresh water brackish even routine flooding then leaves behind salt deposits that can render land barren making matters worse , much of what the bangladeshi government is doing to stave off the coming deluge raising levees , dredging canals , pumping water deepens the threat of inundation in the long term , said john pethick , a former professor of coastal science at newcastle university in england who has spent much of his retirement studying bangladesh s predicament rich nations are not the only ones to blame , he said in of decades of tidal records published in october , dr pethick found that high tides in bangladesh were rising 10 times faster than the global average he predicted that seas in bangladesh could rise as much as 13 feet by 2100 , four times the global average in an area where land is often a thin brown line between sky and river nearly a quarter of bangladesh is less than seven feet above sea level such an increase would have dire consequences , dr pethick said the reaction among bangladeshi government officials has been to tell me that i must be wrong , he said that s completely understandable , but it also means they have no hope of preparing themselves dr rahman said that he did not disagree with dr pethick s findings , but that no estimate was definitive other scientists have predicted more modest rises for example , robert e kopp , an associate director of the at rutgers university , said that data from nearby kolkata , india , suggested that seas in the region could rise five to six feet by 2100 there is no doubt that preparations within bangladesh have been utterly inadequate , but any such preparations are bound to fail because the problem is far too big for any single government , said tariq a karim , bangladesh s ambassador to india we need a regional and , better yet , a global solution and if we do n't get one soon , the bangladeshi people will soon become the world s problem , because we will not be able to keep them mr karim estimated that as many as 50 million bangladeshis would flee the country by 2050 if sea levels rose as expected already , signs of erosion are everywhere in the ganges delta the world s largest delta , which empties much of the water coming from the himalayas there are brick foundations torn in half , palm trees growing out of rivers and rangy cattle grazing on island pastures the size of putting greens fields are dusted white with salt even without climate change , bangladesh is among the most vulnerable places in the world to bad weather the vshaped bay of bengal funnels cyclones straight into the country s fanshaped coastline some scientists believe that rising temperatures will lead to more extreme weather worldwide , including stronger and more frequent cyclones in the bay of bengal and rising seas will make any storm more dangerous because flooding will become more likely bangladesh has done much to protect its population by creating an earlywarning system and building concrete storm shelters the result has been a vast reduction in stormrelated deaths while cyclone bhola in 1970 killed as many as 550 , 000 people , cyclone aila in 2009 killed 300 the was the nearly 10foot wall of water that roared through villages in the middle of the afternoon the poverty of people like ms khatun makes them particularly vulnerable to storms when aila hit , ms khatun was home with her husband , parents and four children a nearby berm collapsed , and their mud and bamboo hut washed away in minutes unable to save her belongings , ms khatun put her youngest child on her back and , with her husband , fought through surging waters to a high road her parents were swept away after about a kilometer , i managed to grab a tree , said abddus satter , ms khatun s father and i was able to help my wife grab on as well we stayed on that tree for hours the couple eventually shifted to the roof of a nearby hut the family reunited on the road the next day after the children spent a harrowing night avoiding snakes that had sought higher ground , too they drank rainwater until rescuers arrived a day or two later with bottled water , food and other supplies the ordeal took a severe toll on ms khatun s husband , whose health soon deteriorated to pay for his treatment and the cost of rebuilding their hut , the family borrowed money from a loan shark in return , ms khatun and her three older children , then 10 , 12 and 15 , promised to work for seven months in a nearby brickmaking factory she later sold her 11 and 13yearold children to the owner of another brick factory , this one in dhaka , for 450 to pay more debts her husband died four years after the storm in an interview , one of her sons , mamun sardar , now 14 , said he worked from dawn to dusk carrying newly made bricks to the factory oven he said he missed his mother , but she lives far away discussions about the effects of climate change in the ganges delta often become community events in the village of choto jaliakhali , where ms khatun lives , dozens of people said they could see that the river was rising several said they had been impoverished by erosion , which has cost many villagers their land muhammad moktar ali said he could not think about the next storm because all he had in the world was his hut and village we do n't know how to support ourselves if we lost this , he said , gesturing to his gathered neighbors it is god who will help us survive surveys show that residents of the delta do not want to migrate , dr rahman said moving to slums in already crowded cities is their least preferred option but cities have become the center of bangladesh s textile industry , which is now the source of 80 percent of the country s exports , 45 percent of its industrial employment and 15 percent of its gross domestic product in the weeks after the storm , the women of dakope found firewood by wading into the raging river and pushing their toes into the muddy bottom they walked hours to buy drinking water after rebuilding the village s berm and their own hut , shirin aktar and her husband , bablu gazi , managed to get just enough of a harvest to survive from their land , which has become increasingly infertile from salt water some plots that once sustained three harvests can now support just one others are entirely barren after two hungry years , the couple gave up on farming and moved to chittagong , bangladesh s secondlargest city , leaving their two children behind with mr gazi s mother mr gazi found work immediately as a day laborer , mostly digging foundations ms aktar searched for a job as a seamstress , but headaches and other sluminduced health problems have so incapacitated her that the couple are desperate to return to dakope i do n't want to stay here for too long , mr gazi said if we can save some money , then we 'll go back i 'll work on a piece of land and try to make it fertile again but the chances of finding fertile land in his home village , where the salty rivers have eaten away acre upon acre , are almost zero dozens of people gathered in the narrow mud alley outside mr gazi s room as he spoke some told similar stories of storms , loss and hope , and many nodded as mr gazi spoke of his dreams of returning to his doomed village all of us came here because of erosions and cyclones , said noakhali , a holloweyed 30yearold with a single name who was wearing the traditional skirt of the delta not one of us actually wants to live here
overview how can goods and burdens be fairly divided among groups of people \? what are the characteristics of an equitable division procedure \? in this lesson , students explore the concept of fair division by researching and demonstrating the basic techniques in this modern field by investigating different division strategies in various contexts , students will learn about the essential characteristics of a fair procedure , analyze the strengths and weaknesses of various algorithms and learn how this important principle in mathematics and economics applies to the real world materials computers with internet access warmup have students consider the problem faced by albert sun , as stated in the opening to his piece to divide the rent , start with a triangle last year , two friends and i moved into a small threebedroom apartment in manhattan we chose it for its relatively reasonable price around 3 , 000 a month and its convenient location just finding it was a challenge , but then we faced another one deciding who would get each bedroom the bedrooms were different sizes , ranging from small to very small two faced north toward the street and had light the third and smallest faced an alley the largest had two windows the midsize room opened onto the fire escape have students offer some suggestions as to how mr sun and his soontobe roommates might have handled this situation make a list , and be sure that these typical approaches are included have students discuss the benefits and shortcomings of each method , and have them consider the questions which method is fairest , and why \? and how would you handle the situation \? related in to divide the rent , start with a triangle , albert sun describes how he turned to mathematics to find a better way to split the rent but as it turns out , a field of academics is dedicated to studying the subject of fair division , or how to divide good and bad things fairly among groups of people to the researchers , none of the typical methods are satisfactory they have better ways the problem is that individuals evaluate a room differently i care a lot about natural light , but not everyone does is it worth not having a closet \? or one might care more about the shape of the room , or its proximity to the bathroom a division of rent based on square feet or any fixed list of elements can t take every individual preference into account and negotiation without a method may lead to conflict and resentment background vocabulary read the entire article with your class , then answer the questions below questions for discussion and reading comprehension activity first , have students play around with this nyt interactive feature to get a sense of how the fair division algorithm mentioned in the article works by clicking on a vertex , one can change the room preference for the given player at the given set of prices , and then see how the other vertexes in the triangle change as a result this particular algorithm , developed by the mathematician francis su , is based on a deep mathematical result known as sperner s lemma however , there are several simpler and more accessible techniques in fair division then , for the main activity , have students research these basic fair division techniques listed below and prepare presentations on each in addition to demonstrating how their chosen method works , students should describe the procedure s strengths and weaknesses what kinds of goods can be divided using the method \? what kinds of goods can t be divided using the method \? what is required of the players in this method \? students should also explain how the technique possesses the important characteristics of a fair division strategy that the players are free to make independent choices that the players are guaranteed a fair share and that no external authority is needed basic fair division strategies in each of the following situations , the people involved in the division process will be referred to as players , and the set of goods to be apportioned will be called s a full presentation of all these techniques , including examples , can be found here \( pdf \) dividerchooser \( two players \) this is the classic method of dividing a single item that can be cut up in any way , like a parcel of land or a piece of cake one player divides s into two pieces and the other player chooses which of the two pieces he or she wants lone divider \( three or more players \) this is another strategy for dividing a single item that can easily cut up into pieces first , player a divides s into three pieces then players b and c independently and secretly make lists of all the pieces they would accept players b and c then share their lists as long as there is something on either of their lists , there will be a fair way to give at least one , if not both , of players b or c one of the pieces player a then takes the remaining piece , or the two remaining players resort to the dividerchooser method described above with what remains lone chooser \( three or more players \) this is a third strategy for a single item that can be cut up into pieces two players divide s between themselves into two fair shares using the dividerchooser method explained above they then each divide their shares into three pieces the third player now chooses one of the three pieces from each player sealed bids this method can be applied to a large collection of items of varying values , like an estate first a list is made of all the available items players secretly write down what they are willing to pay for each item \( their bids \) each player s fair share is the total amount that person is willing to pay for all the items on his or her list , divided by the total number of players the bids are made public , and every item is given to its highest bidder if a player ends up receiving more than his or her fair share , that person must contribute the difference in cash into a pool , which is then divided evenly among all the players at the end the method of markers this method also can be applied to a large set of items of varying values all the items are put in a row in decreasing order of value , with the most valuable item at the far left each player separates the items into fair shares by placing markers at various positions along the row everything to the left of the leftmost marker goes to the player who placed it there , and his or her remaining markers are removed everything to the left of the new leftmost marker goes to the player who placed it there , and his or her remaining markers are removed , and so on at the end , any remainder is split among the players last diminisher this method works for dividing up a single item among many people the players are ordered randomly , and the first player suggests a way to cut off a share of s that he or she would accept each other player can either approve that share , or diminish it by some amount and claim it as his or her own if this happens , each of the other players must now either approve the new share or diminish it and claim it once all the other players approve a share , it is given to the last diminisher , and the procedure starts again with the remaining players and the remnants of s going further this rental calculator allows you to explore dr su s algorithm more deeply by changing the total rent and number of rooms create a hypothetical rentsharing situation with your friends and see what happens , or find your own division problem the calculator can help you with dr su also has a fair division calculator available on his home page , and there are several interactive demonstrations of fair division available at cut the knot math once you are familiar with the various methods of fair division , see if you can invent a division procedure of your own but be sure to verify that it satisfies the conditions of being a true fair division strategy another variation of fair division problems is requiring that the results to be envyfree in an envyfree division , every player must be guaranteed to a share he or she feels is the largest share , not just a share he or she considers fair check out one envyfree strategy at math fun facts , and read about how a technique in envyfree division was used to settle a dispute over a jointly owned condominium the object of fair division is for each player to receive an equal share however , in apportionment , the goal is for players to receive proportional shares for example , apportionment strategies are used in assigning congressional seats based on population research the methods of apportionment and see how states can gain or lose seats based on population changes fair division strategies have many realworld applications , like the dividing of inheritances and estates , resource sharing and territorial disputes scour the new york times for stories where

new delhi last week , penguin , one of india s biggest publishing houses , declared that it would withdraw and destroy remaining copies of a book on hinduism written by wendy doniger after dinanath batra , a rightwing campaigner filed a lawsuit terming the book dirty and perverse in response to the story , we asked readers whether they think freedom of speech is undergoing a gradual and cumulative attack in india we received an overwhelming response , with close to 400 comments on the website when the comments thread was finally closed many also logged into facebook to post their views many of the readers agreed that censorship was not the appropriate response to bad speech and that penguin should never have caved into pressure all over the world , personal freedom and free expression are under increasing attack by democratic and nondemocratic regimes , wrote uziel from florian polis , brazil the reader also said the practice continues in the united states bulwark of those basic rights after the events of 9 11 it will be a sad day for india if mr batra succeeds in his crusade to outlaw and replace every book that he finds offensive , a reader with the user name scb919f7 said some people seem to have forgotten that books can and should do more than simply confirm their own opinions and worldviews sirajul islam , a reader from dhaka , bangladesh , remarked that the political climate is worsening in india decisions like this \( both the writing and publishing a book on hindu extremism at a sensitive time and then withdrawal destruction of the print copies \) imply that the liberal space in hinduism as well as in indian politics is being pruned , and what used to be the fringe is starting to become the mainstream , mr islam said sallie g from new york said freedom of speech in india had died when it became the first nation to ban salman rushdie s book the satanic verses after threats of violence by indian muslims mr rushdie s book was banned in india in 1988 after a flurry of criticism that the book decried islam and its tenets readers like anuradha mukherjee said on facebook that the book contained a lot of factual errors and misinterpretations , and that the issue was blown out of proportion however , she agreed that there was no need to destroy the book pradeep from ontario , canada , said he believed that penguin s decision was more of a corporate one in response to peaceful protests peaceful protest of the contents of a book or speech is a civil right and an act of free speech itself , said pradeep had the government banned the book s publication , that would have been a clear violation of free speech had the protests been violent , it would have been a blow to india s liberal orientation fortunately , none of the above happened however , vikas sharma , a reader from the united states , said it was wrong to vilify mr batra for what was a fair and legal campaign against a publishing powerhouse with millions in profit and an army of lawyers he also said that since penguin acceded to the lawsuit , then there must be something wrong with the book more reader perspectives and opinions can be found here and also on facebook
washington had a rough rollout for her new book and likely presidential quest there were gaffes , awkward answers and a relatively slow response to criticism it does n't much matter the carefully calibrated book on her years as secretary of state alternately interesting , evasive , insightful and selfserving and the choreographed media tour \( ranging from softballs tossed by chicago s mayor , rahm emanuel , to a tense exchange with the national public radio host terry gross over mrs clinton s changing views on gay marriage \) soon will be only minor anecdotes she faces larger opportunities and challenges , according to top analysts from both parties no other wouldbe presidential contender approaches her stature or public appeal none , for now , will face the same scrutiny some of today s headline grabbers the attack on the united states diplomatic outpost in libya or the reemergence of monica lewinsky will diminish or disappear what voters will want to hear from her , or any other candidate in an election without an incumbent , is what she would do as president and where she would lead the country her previous service is an entry ticket again but not a guarantee of success , as she learned in 2008 there is a delicate balancing act with , because embracing change means creating distance from his policies it s a tougher task than vice president george hw bush faced in 1988 with president ronald reagan , who was more popular than mr obama is now mr bush was able to simultaneously stress continuity and modest change that will be harder in 2016 for a selfstyled policy nerd who has been in the limelight for more than two decades , her views on the dominant economic issues remain relatively vague over the next year , she will need to define whether she s a wall street democrat or has moved closer to the populist views of senator elizabeth warren what does she think about tougher regulation of big banks or redistributive tax reform \? even on foreign policy , hard choices , her latest book , does n't much differentiate her views from those of the president there are a few exceptions , such as her desire to move more aggressively to assist the insurgents in syria is there a clinton doctrine on the appropriate use of force \? what are the economic and political implications of an american pivot to asia \? there will be personal and ethical questions she backtracked from her assertion in response to a question about her bigmoney speeches to vested interests that she and her husband were broke when they left the white house she has n't explained why she still needs to get 200 , 000 for a speech to goldman sachs group now that the couple is worth as much as 50 million in the hillary constellation , there are greedy acquaintances eager to trade on their supposed relationship with her that s not unusual , just potentially more harmful in her case if she decides to run , she may want to lay down a simple law you work for me and nobody else that could help avoid a repeat of the unseemly situation in 2008 when her top strategist , mark penn , was simultaneously working for the colombian government hard choices does offer insights , including a vivid description of the mission to kill osama bin laden , a chilling portrait of president vladimir v putin of russia and a reminder of the brilliance of her irrepressible , sometimes suffocating , top lieutenant , the late richard c holbrooke \( conveniently , she avoids the radical candor , a term she likes , that might offend anyone who could reciprocate an example she praises the former national security adviser tom donilon as a valued colleague , yet people close to the former secretary describe , with specificity , how she lashed out at the white house aide for sabotaging his old friend mr holbrooke \) as mrs clinton probably knows , she wo n't have an easy path to a presidential coronation unforeseen events and crises will occur why \? because they always do
sofia , bulgaria delcho delchev came back for many of his generation , this is commuting against the tide of emigration from his native bulgaria into the rest of europe but mr delchev , a 34yearold architect , is one of the founders of a nonprofit group called that has been trying since 2009 to brighten up this former soviet outpost with lowbudget civic art and design projects a few years ago , he returned to bulgaria , turning down an offer to stay in france , where he had been studying in some ways , sofia might not seem like the most inspiring place for an architect rows of sovietera buildings stack up like dominoes along the landscape , many crumbling sculpture from the communist and czarist eras dominates public spaces , unemployment has been rising sharply , and for months protesters have been gathering in the city s streets to denounce the latest government , which is viewed as corrupt and out of touch but sofia is also a city with parks and green spaces , and one can see the younger people chafing to break free of aesthetic homogeneity in a central park downtown , a giant sculpture depicting soviet soldiers has had runins with various graffiti artists it was recently covered in pink paint , and the name of the notorious big , a rapper killed in 1997 , is scrawled on one side mr delchev decided he liked the broader and more open canvas offered by bulgaria i thought i would find more fields to work as an architect here than in europe , because , already there , the situation was very overcrowded , he said in a recent interview , referring to the wealthier countries of the european union \( bulgaria became a member in 2007 \) new buildings were very rare , so i prefer to be in developing countries probably because of my soul , i prefer to organize life as i want , rather than just to go to some place that is very arranged and i have less to do as a creator transformers , a group of more than 20 architects and architectural students , has its work sprinkled around the city they are perhaps best known for whimsically painting over large and unsightly outdoor one was covered with an abstract figure with fish eyes dancing against a bright blue sky , another a cartoonish criminal posing for a mug shot , a third featured a smirking cat the project was so popular that imitations began springing up around the city , like one electrical box painted to resemble a cassette tape and stereo now we are seeing new painted boxes , and the people are thinking transformers did this , but we had nothing to do with it , mr delchev said , laughing transformers also designed a playground in a neighborhood of the beleaguered roma minority and created an ambitious of the city s cultural institutions and promising abandoned sites some of the group s projects are experiments in interactivity , like a stand built at a city marketplace where passersby could offer ideas about how to improve the market s design in another project , the transformers built a with ends designed to fit precisely around the large hexagonal flower pots that dot the city and resemble giant concrete screws i saw the flower pot and thought , let s make something with a sense of humor , ' said valeri gyurov , 31 , another of the founders we try to transform bad things or normal things or boring things into something fresh , so people can appreciate them , have fun with them and start using them for mr gyurov , transformers was a lifeline out of a dull job he had designed two government buildings for his previous employer , but neither ended up being built because of the financial crisis each of us , we were working at different architectural studios on socalled normal projects , but none of us was happy or fulfilled by this work , and we wanted to do something alternative , he said it was a hobby at the beginning , but then it became a fulltime job and a profession not that it has been easy raising money is a persistent challenge the group receives grants from a variety of foundations as well as the municipality of sofia , though the relationship with the city is not always easy they are making huge operations rather than trying to make small things , that would be more human scale and understood by the people , mr delchev said mr gyurov did credit the city for working with transformers we criticize the municipality a lot , but they try to learn from their mistakes , he said recently , the city hired transformers to assist other groups in creating sofia s entry in the , a design competition sponsored by bloomberg philanthropies , a foundation created by the former new york city mayor michael r bloomberg that offers grants for urban projects the america for bulgaria foundation is providing a grant of roughly 60 , 000 this year to transformers , specifically to fund a workshop the group has set up for architecture students nadia zaharieva , the foundation s director for arts and culture , said the group represented a more open way of operating in a city where civic projects are often awarded with little transparency the transformers has been trying to change the status quo , she said they pick up small projects sometimes they are very small but through small steps , they try to change the stale environment on a recent afternoon , mr delchev could be found working on one of those small projects he was assembling a park bench made of two connected sewer pipes for a municipal competition , designed to look like the wooden fighting sticks used by ninjas its reception was not universally positive while mr delchev put the tubes together , an 82yearold retired electrical engineer , vasil tsankov , walked past and did a double take who can sit on this \? he exclaimed in bewilderment , perhaps not grasping the jovial spirit of a ninja bench mr delchev seemed amused by the feedback and offered mr tsankov an apple from a crate stuffed full of them that was sitting in the trunk of his hatchback amid power tools then he coaxed a couple of reporters into helping him haul his bench to its destination across the park for mr delchev , at least , this land in transition is the perfect setting reality in bulgaria , he said , is more provocative and challenging
a cincinnatiarea abortion clinic has ended its fight with the state over a license revocation and will stop performing surgical abortions this week , clinic officials said wednesday , blaming gov john r kasich and accusing him of trying to end all abortions in ohio the development will leave just one facility in the cincinnati area offering surgical abortions and none offering lateterm abortions , said dorothea langsam , a lawyer for the clinic , the lebanon road surgery center in sharonville rules approved by the republican governor last year prohibit publicly funded hospitals from having patient transfer agreements with facilities that provide abortions but ohio law simultaneously requires such transfer agreements to be in place , in what abortion rights groups have called a de facto restriction on abortion the clinic in sharonville did not have such an agreement , but operated for the past few years with the health department s approval under an exception that allowed it to use backup doctors who could admit patients to hospitals the department revoked the clinic s license after questioning whether it had followed the rules
jersey city max unger , seattle s starting center , hails from hawaii , excelled as a rebounder for his high school basketball team and , about 100 pounds ago , loved to skateboard none of that would be relevant to the outcome of the except that unger s chief adversary , denver s 335pound defensive tackle terrance knighton , probably knew all those facts last week as part of his preparation , knighton vowed to research unger s personal life , compiling a dossier from which he will goad and taunt him when they line up inches apart on sunday i want to know everything about him , knighton said unger s success at neutralizing knighton will influence the production of marshawn lynch , who with every punishing rush could fulfill seattle s twin goals of sustaining long drives while limiting the ' possessions the matchup of denver s premier runstopping defender and a twotime pro bowler entrusted with clearing space at the fulcrum of the ' offense is one of several that will help decide what should be one of the more compelling super bowls of recent vintage for the first time in 23 years , and the fifth time over all , the game will feature the league s topranked offense against its topranked defense and the 235point disparity between the broncos' average scoring output \( 379 \) and the seahawks' average points allowed \( 144 \) is the largest in super bowl history , according to no team was more efficient inside the red zone than denver no team was stingier inside the red zone than seattle i do n't think they 've played a defense like us , seattle linebacker bobby wagner said nor , though , have the seahawks played an offense like that of the broncos , whose quarterback , , at 37 , set the nfl singleseason record for passing yards and touchdowns manning has a unique capacity to decipher defenses and upload information before the snap , then adjust by calling a play that exploits a weakness with diminished but adequate arm strength i 've thrown a lot of yards and touchdown ducks , so i'm actually quite proud of it , he said last week manning relies even more on timing and precision , on maximizing the short routes by receivers who excel at running after the catch denver s fastdeveloping plays , coupled with his quick release and a solid offensive line , create a comfortable pocket that has rarely been breached manning , hardly known for his mobility , has been hit only once during the postseason , and through 18 games including the playoffs , he has been sacked only 18 times the ball s just not in his hands long enough to get there , for the most part , seattle coach pete carroll said , adding we 're going to have to get him to hold the football some and at least make him go to his second or third decision if we can do that , it gives us a chance the word that carroll and his defensive coordinator , dan quinn , use most when describing their mission is affect as in , the seahawks must affect manning on sunday by sacking him , hitting him , moving him off his spot it varies with the coverage , but quinn said that a quarterback can usually avoid being hit if he can get rid of the ball in 27 seconds or less this season the ball has been in manning s hands for an nfllow average of 236 seconds , according to  to harass manning , the seahawks will probably adhere to their principles unlike many teams , they generate pressure without blitzing and lean on their physical defensive backs to maintain coverage as a fourman rush pressures the quarterback their two primary defensive ends , michael bennett and cliff avril , have combined for 19 sacks and 10 forced fumbles , and their aptitude for stripping the ball could be a factor against manning , who had 10 fumbles during the regular season even so , the seahawks recognize that the ball will usually be leaving manning s hand through more traditional means , one being a type of crossing route that has emerged as perhaps denver s signature play it is called the pick , or a rub , and it succeeds when a receiver runs his defender into a third party , usually another teammate , to gain separation it is legal as long as the receiver does not go out of his way to interfere with the defender , and it is a primary reason so many of the broncos' receivers demaryius thomas , especially are able to gain yardage after the catch the play tends to succeed most against mantoman coverage , although the seahawks play a fair amount of zone from reviewing film , several of their defenders could see that teams that were shredded by the pick play , like new england in the afc championship game , had failed to disrupt the receiver s release off the line of scrimmage delaying him by even a fraction of a second could affect the entire play , giving the pass rush added time to reach manning they just take the pick play , seattle linebacker wagner said we 're very aware of the pick plays when they show up , we 're going to hit them that , too , is the approach of lynch , who so embraces contact that when asked last week for his impression of the seattle assistant tom cable , he said all i knew about him was that he punched people that s my type of person lynch is powerful enough to lug tacklers an extra 10 yards , elusive enough to slip through the narrowest creases his bruising style meshes with the seahawks' offensive philosophy , what the coordinator darrell bevell described as imparting our will on the other team and showing our toughness bevell said they were willing to throw 40 times to win , if necessary , but really , that is not what they want they want to hand the ball to lynch , early and often , creating favorable downanddistance situations and extending series and wearing down the broncos' defense , which never buckled in stopping new england s running game two weeks ago that afternoon in denver , the patriots , trailing for much of the game , abandoned the run early the seahawks are unlikely to do the same on sunday , meaning that by the end of the game , knighton should be well acquainted with a certain skateboardloving center even more , perhaps , than he was before the game may the best man win , knighton said
moscow russians tend to think about politics in terms of weatherreport jargon in late december , for example , when president vladimir putin began to set his prisoners free , many people began asking is this a thaw \? the conclusion to that question discussed over holiday dinner tables and on social networks was nearly unanimous it is not opinions differed only in the degree and the timing of the next big freeze this is strange , considering the formidable list of those who were granted amnesty the former oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky two members of the punk band pussy riot , maria alyokhina and nadezhda tolokonnikova the 30 greenpeace activists arrested in september during a protest against drilling in the barents sea four of the young people held in detention since the may 2012 clashes between protesters and the police \( the socalled bolotnaya case \) the teacher ilya farber , charged with bribery and thousands of lessknown people , including minors , war veterans , pregnant women and mothers , who are now being granted amnesty the charges could have been dropped in a more consistent fashion , critics say , but the scale of the pardons is too great to dismiss many people , most of them held for political reasons , are free nothing like this had ever happened during mr putin s years in power even if his only motivation was to avoid being lectured by world leaders during the winter olympics next month in sochi , the december amnesties may prove highly significant , sending a message of moderation to the police , prosecutors and judges but whether the massive flood of amnesties amounts to a sea change is still in doubt everyone understands that the pardons were a oneoff event , not a systemic reform the freeing of highprofile prisoners matters little by itself the fact that the legal system has been getting consistently tougher despite the release of some prominent prisoners does not leave me with much optimism , at least for the near future as president , dmitri medvedev , now prime minister , took steps to humanize the criminal code , but those efforts have been largely reversed legislative changes over the past year have granted greater power to law enforcement structures , not reformed them huge fines are now levied for illegal street protests , libel decriminalized under mr medvedev s presidency is once again a criminal offense , and the government has banned socalled gay propaganda the police and the investigative committee the main investigative authority in russia remain systemically corrupt , the courts are not independent of the kremlin , and the penitentiary system remains a stalinist institution before mr medvedev s reforms , law enforcement agencies used their power to put pressure on entrepreneurs , extracting bribes and taking stakes in business ventures under president medvedev , the authority to open criminal cases for tax evasion was taken away from the investigative committee and given to the more professional federal taxation service president putin give it back to the committee despite these reversals , there remains in russia an important minority that may yet prove a barometer for systemic change this minority , impossible to define in ethnic , religious or demographic terms , is beyond mr putin s influence it is an amorphous group of professional people , middle class workers , small business owners , intellectuals , artists , writers and assorted bohemians yuri pivovarov , a historian of russia , has a term for those who have not been ground down by the regime they are russia s spare individuals , neither part of the power mechanism , nor of the unquestioning population their one common feature is that they are independent of the sources of income controlled by the government it s easier to say what this group does not do than what it does its identity lies in the fact that it does not accept the regime s rules mr khodorkovsky said in a recent interview that mr putin aspires to be the deng xiaoping of russian politics the wise arbiter between actors and groups but once he realized that there was a part of the russian society that did not accept his refereeing , mr khodorkovsky said , he simply factored that part out of his political scheme mr putin and his associates realized that they could not win the big cities so they tried to demonstrate that they could afford to discard their critics as politically negligible they began to emphasize the root of the russian people , those living outside major urban centers , as their power base in practical terms , that meant leaving out moscow , st petersburg and other big cities after all what is moscow \? in the words of sergei ivanov , mr putin s chief of staff , it consists of street cleaners , car drivers , office plankton , journalists and bloggers who do n't produce anything derided and dismissed by officials , this minority of spare individuals is in fact of great political importance true , they cannot unite , but that is only natural these people are independent and different , they are not supposed to be united although they are not represented by any political party , the fact remains that most of the kremlin s policies alternatively toughening and relaxing the system have been in response to their actions in 2011 , angry cubicle dwellers poured into the streets , refusing to accept the official results of parliamentary elections widely believed to have been rigged in 2012 , the kremlin had to end the practice of appointing regional governors and restore gubernatorial elections , and also relaxed the rules for the registration of political parties the following year , it even allowed an election that seemed reasonably fair the moscow mayoral race a few days ago , mr putin eased a ban on public protest in sochi , the venue of the olympic games apparently , now that most of the celebrity prisoners are free , the kremlin no longer sees reasons why anyone would protest the issue has been addressed , not in a systemic fashion , but it has been addressed the independent minority has been the ultimate cause the word for spare in russian \( lishniy \) also can be translated as superfluous , excessive , odd or unneeded but in fact , spare individuals are none of these things they are indispensable when they act , the kremlin reacts they raise an issue , the kremlin responds , and amid the game of alternate thaw and freeze , one can recognize a warming trend will this work forever \? it is hard to say predicting politics in russia is as tricky as trying to predict the weather
the new york philharmonic s summertime classics concerts , which began on wednesday at avery fisher hall , are an opportunity to see the orchestra kicking back , its president and executive director , matthew vanbesien , writes in the playbill the musical selections are eminently listenable , an article a few pages later says in that article , the conductor , , describes the genesis of the series , now in its 11th season , as an effort to create an unstuffy concert hall experience \( it s unclear whether the word is mr tovey s , that of the philharmonic s former executive director zarin mehta or the author s \) mr tovey adds that the goal is to program works that the orchestra has n't played in a long time it would be easy to recommend a concert consisting of philharmonic rarities , but this was n't really it the orchestra has played all six of the works on wednesday s program in the past decade or so nor was it unstuffy , unless you count the players' warmweather dress code of white tops and black bottoms , or mr tovey s genial dry humor in remarks between numbers in practice , the summertime classics series is popsclassical by another name , played loudly and more or less crisply on wednesday , that meant a program with not one , but two pieces that were featured in disney s fantasia of 1940 three , if you count the encore , which was the evening s second selection from tchaikovsky s nutcracker suite eminently listenable is the question here mussorgsky s night on bald mountain , arranged after the composer s death by rimskykorsakov , is so disjointed and flat that one doubts it would ever be played had disney not given it such prominence tchaikovsky s marche slave is repetitive , but even its dulling volume pales next to that of shostakovich s festive overture , which opened the concert the most substantial work on the program was rachmaninoff s piano concerto no 1 , notable wednesday for a sumptuous , powerful , subtle performance by the soloist , even her most poundingly virtuosic passages were distinguished by a variety of touch and color , and she was sensitive throughout to the piano s interactions with the orchestra \( the first movement also featured a characteristically sweet solo from sheryl staples , the orchestra s highestranking violinist now that its concertmaster , glenn dicterow , has retired \) rachmaninoff s opus 34 vocalise and the waltz of the flowers from the nutcracker the encore was mother ginger s raucous melody from that ballet rounded out the concert is it elitist to feel frustration at a program like this \? the depressing thing is not that the philharmonic wants to play music that s popular , but that the music thought to be popular in concert halls has n't changed since 1940 \( do n't hate the players hate the game \) these light standards , heavy on fanfares and loud climaxes , offer a passing thrill of recognition , but they do n't stimulate perhaps wednesday was just a letdown after the orchestra s forwardthinking june programs last month began with the ny phil biennial , a of new and recent music , and continued with , over which brandnew works by anthony cheung and sean shepherd had been dolloped like maraschino cherries none of it felt stuffier than wednesday s summertime classics installment
to the end of his life , chester nez recalled the first message he sent over the radio while serving at guadalcanal enemy machine gun nest on your right destroy receiving the message , american forces eliminated the threat mr nez , a former united states marine who died on wednesday at 93 , had sent the message not in english but rather in a code he had helped create it originally went much like this anaai \( enemy \) naatsosi \( japanese \) beeldooh alhaa dildoni \( machine gun \) nishnaajigo nahdikadgo \( on your right flank \) diiltaah \( destroy \) the code was fashioned from navajo , the language that mr nez grew up speaking , was later barred from speaking and still later helped craft into a military code so impervious that it helped the united states secure victory in the pacific in the summer of 1945 mr nez was the last surviving member of the 29 original navajo code talkers , who at the urgent behest of the federal government devised an encrypted version of their language for wartime use they and the hundreds of navajos who followed them into battle used that code , with unparalleled success , throughout the pacific theater not fully declassified until 1968 , the navajo code remains the only oral military code that has never been broken mr nez s death , at his home in albuquerque , was confirmed by judith schiess avila , the coauthor of his memoir , code talker , published in 2011 for mr nez and his fellows , was quite literally a war of words their work , and the safety of tens of thousands of american servicemen , depended crucially on the code that they had created during 13 fevered weeks in 1942 , as the prospect of allied victory in the pacific seemed increasingly uncertain members of other native american tribes , including the comanche , choctaw and winnebago , using codes based on their languages , were also recruited for the war effort , serving in europe and north africa but the navajo , who served in the pacific , furnished the war s single largest contingent of code talkers about 400 navajos followed the original 29 to war of that later group , about 35 are still living , the navajo times , a tribal newspaper , reported this week serving on the front lines in the pacific s key battles , mr nez and other members of the marine corps s 382nd platoon made up entirely of navajos recruited for their fluency in the language used the code to relay movements of american and enemy troops , casualty reports , coordinates of strategic targets and other vital intelligence to marines in the field there were no machines or other devices that could scramble voice communications that could be used on the front lines , david a hatch , the national security agency s historian , said in an interview on thursday what the code talkers did was to provide absolute security for the information we transmitted on the radios , denying to the enemy vital information that we were picking up from their communications in 2001 , mr nez and the 28 other creators of the code were awarded the congressional gold medal , most posthumously , by president george w bush the men of the 382nd have been commemorated in a string of recent books a hollywood film , windtalkers \( 2002 \) , starring nicolas cage and adam beach and even an action figure ,  what remains less well known is what took place before they went off to war , when the 29 present at the code s creation built a covert communications system whose crystalline simplicity belied its linguistic impenetrability nor did every account of the code talkers' work focus on what happened when they returned to the united states there , for mr nez and others , hardships included posttraumatic stress disorder and marginalization by the very country they had served chester nez was born on jan 23 , 1921 , in chichiltah , nm , known in english as two wells , and reared on the navajo reservation nearby his mother died when he was very young his navajo given name has been lost to time his surname , pronounced nezz , means very tall in the language the nez family had been fairly prosperous , and chester grew up herding its large flock of sheep but in the 1930s , responding to what it deemed overgrazing in the region , the federal government slaughtered tens of thousands of navajo sheep , including the nez family s they were reduced to subsistence farming at 8 , chester entered the first of a series of bureau of indian affairs boarding schools that he would attend in new mexico and arizona assimilation into white society was the goal of such schools , and he was assigned the name chester , after president chester a arthur students were forbidden to speak navajo the penalty for doing so , mr nez recalled , was a beating , or having one s mouth washed out with a bitter , brown soap in 1942 , when mr nez was a high school student , a marine corps recruiter visited his school the marines were looking for young men who were bilingual in english and navajo he enlisted in may when joining the marine corps , i thought about how my people were mistreated , mr nez said in a 2005 interview but then i thought this would be my chance to do something for my country after boot camp in california , he and the initial navajo cohort were sent to camp elliott , in san diego , and told to come up with a code based on navajo the plan was the brainchild of a world war i veteran named philip johnston the son of missionaries , he had been reared among the navajo and spoke the language fluently after the japanese attack on pearl harbor , mr johnston persuaded the marine corps that navajo whose syntax and tonal contours differ vastly from those of english would be the perfect vehicle for encoding spoken communication charged with creating a code that was fast , accurate , memorizable and uncrackable , the 29 navajos set to work in the spring of 1942 the code they conceived used two layers of encryption the first layer was the navajo language itself , known to be understood by only a handful of nonnavajos , none of them japanese but what the men developed that spring went far beyond ordinary navajo , and that was where the second layer of encryption came in first , they created a glossary of hundreds of words used in battlefield communication while some were simply navajo translations of their english counterparts , many others were  for america , for instance , they substituted nehemah \( our mother \) lieutenant colonel became chechilbetahbeshlegai \( silver oak leaf \) battleship was lotso \( whale \) , submarine was beshlo \( iron fish \) and destroyer was calo \( shark \) the men also developed an encrypted alphabet that could spell any english word for each letter of the roman alphabet , they substituted one or more navajo words the words' english translations began with the encoded letter to indicate a , a code talker would say wollachee \( ant \) , belasana \( apple \) or tsenill \( ax \) b was nahashchid \( badger \) , shush \( bear \) or toishjeh \( barrel \) , and so on the result was a system that sounded nothing like navajo yet could be employed with great facility by those trained in its use the japanese tried , but they could n't decipher it , mr nez told cnn in 2011 not even another navajo could decipher it if he was n't a code talker handed a written english message , a code talker took to his radio , relaying that message , encoded , to a compatriot at the front the navajo on the receiving end , having memorized the entire code , rendered the message back into english and passed it on the written english copies were destroyed immediately we acted as coding machines , transmitting messages that would have taken a couple of hours in just a couple of minutes , mr nez said in a 2012 interview with the website we could never make a mistake , because many communications involved bombing coordinates after guadalcanal , mr nez was sent to the battles of bougainville , in papua new guinea guam and the islands peleliu and angaur it was no soft service on angaur , an american service member mistook mr nez for japanese and put a gun to his head before a superior intervened the code talkers were considered so indispensable that they were given little respite , often working 35 hours straight without food or rest , hunkered down in foxholes or dodging bullets we would land on the beaches , which were littered with dead japanese bodies , mr nez told the arizona republic in 2011 my faith told me not to walk among the dead , to stay away from the dead but which soldier could avoid such \? this was war war is death i walked among them about a dozen code talkers were killed in action mr nez returned home from the war to less than ideal conditions he was unable to vote new mexico did not grant suffrage to american indians until 1948 when , in uniform , he went to the federal building in gallup , nm , to register for the identity card that indians were then required to carry , a white civil servant told him , you 're not a full citizen of the united states , you know prohibited , like all the men of the 382nd , from discussing his service , mr nez was plagued by nightmares and spent more than five months in a san francisco military hospital my condition was so severe i went psycho , he said in a 2005 lecture i lost my mind yet of the returned code talkers , he considered himself among the lucky ones some turned to drinking or just gave up , mr nez said in an interview last year his father came to his rescue , explaining that his nightmares were caused by the spirits of dead japanese mr nez underwent a traditional healing ceremony , and the dreams largely ceased he studied art at the university of kansas , but left before graduating when his money from the gi bill ran out \( the university awarded him a degree in 2012 \) after serving stateside in the korean war , mr nez worked for many years as a painter and muralist at what is now the veterans affairs hospital in albuquerque mr nez s marriage to ethel pearl catron ended in divorce his survivors include two sons , michael and tyah nine grandchildren and 11 greatgrandchildren four other children died before he did a few years ago , mr nez lost both legs to diabetes , long epidemic among native americans in his many interviews and public appearances , mr nez expressed unmistakable pride in his wartime work but the irony of what that work entailed was far from lost on him all those years , telling you not to speak navajo , and then to turn around and ask us for help with that same language , he told usa today in 2002 it still kind of bothers me
the stanley cup finals between the and are the ninth being carried by and its cable companion , nbcsn \( and its versus and oln antecedents \) , a long period of media stability for the nhl under nbc , the finals have averaged as many as 57 million viewers \( last year s original six battle between boston and chicago \) and as few as 18 million \( the 2007 ottawaanaheim series \) now , as teams from the nation s two largest markets meet , some wonder if this is the formula for record viewership it is not or more correctly , we do not know for certain the hypothesis has not been tested often enough with the right teams in the markets a great rating is about how long the series goes , said sam flood , the executive producer of nbc sports we 're rooting for the opposite team to win each game translation the network makes more money the longer a series goes , and , by the way , it s more exciting if it s not a sweep the two markets met in championship series three times recently in 2002 , 2003 and 2012 , once in the nba finals and twice in the stanley cup finals but none of the series were the best tests of the twomarket formula because the nets , the devils and anaheim were part of them , but not the knicks or the rangers in 2002 , the ts in a series that drew an average of 157 million viewers , more than three million fewer than the previous season when the lakers beat philadelphia , the nets and san antonio , two teams without great national followings , combined to generate only 99 million viewers in the 2003 stanley cup finals , the devils and the ducks , who had yet to drop the mighty from their name , attracted 36 million viewers , the best for the league until 2008 and 2009 when successive detroitpittsburgh series drew about 45 million viewers each but when the kings played the devils in the 2012 finals , only three million were interested if the blackhawks had not lost to the kings in the western conference finals , a chicagonew york series might have produced record viewership fans love original six series the blackhawks and the bruins led the league in the number of cable households watching their local games according to nielsen , chicago averaged 152 , 000 , and the bruins had 120 , 000 the rangers , on msg network , ranked third , with 96 , 000 but the kings were far lower , with 23 , 000 , and the ducks were well below them , with 13 , 000 during the second and third rounds of the playoffs on nbc s networks , the chicago market averaged 513 , 000 households , boston 424 , 000 , the rangers 362 , 000 and the kings 157 , 000 and if you look at the number of households that were tuned to the opening game of the last two stanley cup finals , you can understand that chicago would have attracted more viewers than the kings in the finals in 2012 , the 874 , 000 households in the chicago market watched game 1 in 2013 , 231 , 000 watched in los angeles it s going to be different than if the hawks were in , flood said during a conference call on tuesday eddie olczyk , nbc s analyst for the finals who is also the blackhawks' analyst on cable , said the team had blended the success of winning two stanley cups in the past four seasons with innovative marketing that was aided drastically a few years ago when the owner rocky wirtz reversed his father s longtime refusal to show home games on tv you could argue that the blackhawks sit atop the sports totem pole in chicago , he said by telephone tuesday no team has had more recent success alas , it will be the rangers and the kings , 20 years since the to win the cup back then , the series was broadcast nationally on espn but the network was blacked out in new york , where the games were shown on msg the series averaged 24 million viewers on espn , which would have been more if canadian markets like vancouver , british columbia , were included in nielsen s united states calculations a year earlier , when the montreal canadiens defeated the kings in five games to win the cup , the viewership averaged a lessimpressive 18 million one ingredient that is missing from nhl viewership is a collection of crossover stars who can bring in a lot of casual fans to the postseason we have a lot of players who are mustsee appointment television , olczyk said , but probably too few leap over the boards and into the living rooms of those who are not diehard hockey fans the , an index that assesses the appeal of athletes and entertainers in a broad array of characteristics , gives longtime stars sidney crosby and alex ovechkin middling scores of 4066 and 3977 , and rangers goalie henrik lundqvist , the star of an advil commercial campaign , a 3781 the top dbi among nhl players was charted by wayne gretzky , who last played 15 years ago his 7477 score was boosted by an awareness level that comes from redefining his sport if lundqvist shuts out the kings in four straight having conquered a computergenerated rhinoceros made of pucks for advil he would not surpass gretzky
boston the countdown to the world cup finals in brazil is getting harder to ignore , but other global sporting diversions are still there for the savoring before the sounds and sights of soccer overwhelm the landscape over the next three weeks , the marathon will be one of them first , on sunday , kenenisa bekele , the smooth and selfcontained ethiopian , perhaps the greatest track distance runner of all time , will move up and make his marathon debut in paris then on april 13 , mo farah , the british star who is clearly the best track distance runner at the moment , will move up and make his marathon debut in london with the great haile gebrselassie acting as celebrity pacemaker two days later , here in boston , there will be a commemorative procession to honor the victims of last year s marathon bombings , followed on april 21 by this year s race with a record field , raw emotion and increased security guaranteed the has been better known for its iconic scenery , including a champs lys es start , and growing appeal to recreational runners than for its ability to attract superstar talent , but bekele s participation is a clear break with the past usually it s not in our policy to have the best marathon runners , said thibault vellard , the race director , in a telephone interview we are more focused on the mass , the 49 , 999 people running , except for a bekele but we had the opportunity to have him for his first marathon , and you only have one first time , and so it was a great opportunity and that is why we decided to change our policy bekele , of course , had to like the idea , too , and though he and his longtime agent , jos hermens , did negotiate with the london organizers , who were assembling a powerhouse field , bekele ultimately chose the less pressured environment paris and london are both prestigious marathons , bekele said after making his decision but for this distance you have to acquire experience , and i think paris fits me better i have to learn how to handle the rhythm and the distance london often has the best marathoners in the world and the race is not so regular paris is going to allow me to control the race better and to go with the rhythm i choose and it s a city i like that has been good to me hermens said paris made sense for bekele because the race can be built more around him bekele claimed his first title in paris at the world championships in 2003 , winning the 5 , 000 meters in total , he has now won three olympic gold medals and five world championship gold medals he also has won an astounding 11 world titles in crosscountry and still holds the world records on the track in both the 5 , 000 \( 12 minutes 3735 seconds \) and the 10 , 000 \( 26 1753 \) those marks have endured for nearly a decade , and it is difficult to see anyone seriously challenging them soon even farah although bekele has announced his intent to keep racing on the track this year , too but for now it is going to be intriguing to see who turns out to be the faster , more natural marathoner two track stars of this caliber have not tried the marathon since kenya s paul tergat and bekele s ethiopian domestic measuring stick gebrsalessie did so in the early 2000s but tergat and gebrselassie made their elite debuts one year apart , not one week apart like bekele and farah this is quite a fight from a distance between bekele and mo , vellard said but i think bekele just wants to run his race and not focus on what is going to happen in london after long struggling with a chronic calf injury , bekele is back to full health and full training , but farah , who is coached by alberto salazar in the united states , is the one who appears to be at the peak of his powers after just completing the same doubledouble that bekele once did by sweeping the 5 , 000 and 10 , 000 at the olympics and world championships recently , kenenisa s performances have not been what they were in 2008 or 2009 , said ken nakamura , a leading marathon statistician if he had made his debut in 2010 , after his backtoback doubles , that would have been really big but in that sense , mo is now in that position , and he is making his debut in his home country , which makes it even bigger , as does the fact that the london marathon is more prestigious than paris it also tends to be quicker if you average the top 10 performances at the major marathons , london ranks fifth behind berlin , dubai , rotterdam and chicago paris , with more changes in elevation , lies ninth with the course record , set in 2012 by kenya s stanley biwott , at two hours five minutes and 12 seconds bekele wants at least that record and wants to break 2 05 in the process , which would put him in rare company only seven men have broken 2 05 in their first marathon , and none of them were past their 30th birthday the world record stands at 2 0323 , set in september by wilson kipsang of kenya , and the expectation is that bekele and farah are capable of challenging it and perhaps pushing the event closer to the attentiongrabbing twohour barrier the consensus is also that they probably will need time to adjust to the 42kilometer distance i think both haile and paul tergat , being track runners , it took them about five marathons to run their world records , said hermens , a former leading distance runner for the netherlands so it takes adjustment what you see now is you have a lot of young athletes , 22 or 23 , who are running 2 04 or 2 05 , but they have never trained on a track they went immediately into marathon running but if you have 10 years of hard training on the track and speed work , somehow the body has to adapt a little differently than other athletes' and now it s a big question how quickly you can adapt , and my hope is that kenenisa can do it a little bit quicker but we can only find out in the race he s has done the long runs he has done good training , and he s in good shape now we have to see what it means in real life both bekele and farah have trained for their marathon debuts at altitude in africa farah spent three months in kenya , and bekele based himself at home in ethiopia , with plenty of meetings in the capital of addis ababa to check on the progress of his various commercial ventures , which include the recently opened kenenisa hotel hermens , who also has long represented gebrselassie , believes it is time for bekele to refocus on sport he has to get his act together , and stay motivated and forget about business and run for five or six years , hermens said he also believes bekele should focus less on the 40yearold gebrselassie s aura and achievements he s competitive off the track with haile , and he should n't do that , hermens said they 're not really friends , and that s more from his side than haile s on the track is a different matter , and bekele will continue to follow gebrselassie s lead on sunday , he finally will get his first taste of the original endurance foot race i ca n't wait to see him under pressure and watch how he can manage the race , said vellard it s the unknown for everyone how fast he can go after the 21st kilometer
thierry henry scored 51 career goals for france , but none was more memorable or controversial than the last one he set up for les bleus so perhaps it is fitting that with 51 days to go until the start of the 2014 world cup , we track back to nov 18 , 2009 , the final day of qualifying for the 2010 world cup in south africa o before a penaltykick shootout , and with france and ireland tied , 11 , on aggregate \( and on away goals \) , henry performed an act that will forever be reviled in ireland , revered in france and compared to the first hand of god goal , against england at the 1986 world cup after the match , , now a striker for the new york red bulls who is in the final year of his contract with major league soccer , was contrite , but he said basically that the hand ball should have been seen by an array of match officials if you see something , say something no one did henry and france went on to play in the tournament in south africa , but it was a trip that ended in dissension , with nicolas anelka and some of his teammates rebelling against the way the team was being managed henry did not start a match in south africa and france did not win one , heading home after a firstround loss to the host nation
lake buena vista , fla there are two holes to fill in the ' infield , and two questions are always asked about them who is going to replace robinson cano at second base \? and who is going to play third base \? is rarely mentioned , as if he were not even a yankee the past 10 seasons , much less one who hit 309 home runs during that time the perception is not that kelly johnson is replacing rodriguez it is more that he is going to be the next yankees third baseman and johnson is fine with that no , no , johnson said , shaking his head at the mere idea that he is replacing rodriguez , who is serving a seasonlong suspension for using performanceenhancing drugs i do n't look at it like that it does n't even cross my mind and i do n't mean that in any disrespect but that , to me , is not the case and no one has said it s the case , so it s not anything that i would ever perceive , nor would i ever create that perception i'm here to do what i can do , do my job , and that s all i can worry about johnson , 32 , is an eightyear major league veteran he has played in 1 , 051 games , but only 16 at third base all 16 of those games came last season , when he played for tampa bay , occasionally filling in for evan longoria he has been a career second baseman , but the yankees have brian roberts , who , like johnson , was an offseason freeagent signing , playing that position johnson has been a fast learner , which was the yankees' hope when they signed him he started at third base again wednesday , going 0 for 2 with a walk and a run scored in the yankees' 70 win against the atlanta braves the game lowered johnson s spring training batting average to 258 , almost identical to his career 253 average but the yankees , in many ways , are not looking for another rodriguez they are looking for a third baseman who can field cleanly , hit a bit and stay healthy they once had a player like that scott brosius brosius , a career 257 hitter with the same type of occasional power as johnson , spent four seasons with the yankees in three of them , 1998 through 2000 , the team won the world series in rodriguez s 10 years , often filled with drama and occasionally with acrimony , the yankees won one series rather than copy a page from recent history , the yankees have flipped back to what worked for them 15 years ago third base is a new position for johnson , and he has been busy most mornings on the back fields of the yankees' spring training complex , working with mick kelleher , the team s de facto infield instructor he s picked it up real fast , kelleher said i think he s confident he likes the position we 've done a lot of early work this spring his learning curve has been pretty rapid we 've covered a lot of stuff , and he has picked it up very well i was surprised , because it s a very difficult position to play there are intricacies to the position beyond the obvious angles , reaction time , throwing distance and the like when you shift to a new spot , it comes with new responsibilities , johnson said at third base , you 're also responsible for bunts there are cutoffs , relays , little nuances i'm working hard so far , the yankees like what they see manager joe girardi stopped short of saying johnson would be the everyday third baseman , but he said , he s going to play a lot let s put it that way girardi added that before camp , the yankees had weighed the idea of a thirdbase platoon johnson is a lefthanded hitter , and eduardo nunez , a natural shortstop who has gained experience at third base , hits from the right side we kind of thought a little bit about that going into the season , when we signed kelly , girardi said of a possible platoon but his atbats have been good against righthanders and lefthanders so the position continues to look like johnson s , with little mention of the superstar player who preceded him there inside pitch ivan nova had his strongest outing of spring training , throwing six and a third innings of twohit ball against the braves , striking out five and walking none nova , 25 , said he was feeling more comfortable as a major league pitcher , although he stopped short of saying he was a veteran nova offered an exchange he had with the pitching coach larry rothschild earlier in the week as an indication that he was maturing larry said , what are we going to work on \? ' i told him , keeping my ball down' he said wow i remember you used to say , i do n't know you tell me' derek jeter , who continues to receive warm applause in opposing stadiums , was 0 for 4 , lowering his spring batting average to 132 joe girardi said he was not concerned my guess is that he s not going to panic either way , girardi said i think the important thing is that he just feels good , and if he feels good , he 'll be in a good place jacoby ellsbury continued to nurse a tight right calf , and he will again sit thursday , pushing the number of days that he has been unavailable to five in his place against the braves , the rookie adonis garcia knocked in two runs with a double
jacksonville , fla after four days of deliberation , the jury in the racially tinged trial of michael dunn , a florida man who set off another firestorm over the state s selfdefense laws when he shot a teenager to death in a parking lot during a dispute over loud music , said it could not agree on whether mr dunn had acted to protect himself or was guilty of murder the jurors did find mr dunn guilty of three counts of seconddegree attempted murder for getting out of his car and firing several times at the dodge durango sport utility vehicle in which jordan davis , 17 , was killed three other teenagers , the subjects of the attempted murder charges , were in the car but were not struck mr dunn continued to fire at the vehicle even as it pulled away on the attempted murder convictions , he could be sentenced to 60 years in prison judge russell l healey of duval county declared a mistrial on the count of firstdegree murder , which applied only in the death of mr davis the jury also failed to reach agreement on lesser charges that are automatically included in jury instructions those were second and thirddegree murder and manslaughter the state attorney for jacksonville , angela corey , said immediately after the verdict that she planned to retry mr dunn on firstdegree murder ms corey said she hoped jurors would explain why they could not agree on that charge , which could help her team in the new trial mr davis s parents , who wept after the verdict , said they were grateful for the jury s decision to convict mr dunn of attempted murder and would await his retrial it has been a long , long road , and we 're so very happy to have a little bit of closure , said lucia mcbath , mr davis s mother mr dunn s lawyer , cory strolla , said that mr dunn was in shock over the verdict and that his parents were devastated there were no winners everybody lost , mr strolla said it s hard to call it a victory mr dunn s sentencing hearing was expected to occur in march the case was steeped in racial overtones mr dunn , 47 , is white , and the teenagers black it also drew renewed attention to florida s expansive selfdefense laws that allow people who say they feel threatened to use lethal force to protect themselves the trial began six months after the verdict in another highprofile case that focused on race , in which was acquitted in the fatal shooting of a black teenager , trayvon martin the 12 jurors , who had been sequestered since feb 6 , consisted of four white men , four white women , two black women , one hispanic man and one asianamerican woman some black leaders expressed disappointment that there were no black men on the jury the deadlock means that at least one juror had reasonable doubt about the prosecution s version of events the prosecutors had argued that mr dunn did not shoot mr davis in selfdefense , as he testified he shot him , they said , because he was enraged that when he asked the teenagers to turn down the music booming from their vehicle in a gas station parking lot mr dunn described it to his fianc e as thug music mr davis did not do so and then cursed him repeatedly mr dunn , who was visiting from out of town , left the scene and did not call 911 or the police after the shooting instead , he returned to his hotel , and the next morning drove two and a half hours to his home in brevard county the prosecutors said his behavior did not jibe with the actions of a man who had fired in selfdefense they also argued that mr dunn had had enough time to reflect before shooting , which was why they accused him of premeditated murder coming on the heels of the failure to convict mr zimmerman in july , the verdict was a blow to ms corey , who was the special prosecutor in the zimmerman case the verdict wo n't sit well with the black community in jacksonville , said ken jefferson , a vice president for operation save our sons , a group that tries to help young men in jacksonville , where blacks make up 30 percent of the population there is a feeling of being able to shoot black people and get away with it , he said , particularly after the zimmerman case mr strolla said the prosecutors had overcharged mr dunn , reaching for premeditated murder because they were seeking vindication after their showing in the zimmerman trial mr dunn , who testified on tuesday , told jurors that mr davis had pointed a shotgun at him from the window of the durango , threatened to kill him and then tried to get out of the car it was only then , mr dunn said , that he reached into his glove box , unholstered his 9millimeter pistol , put a round in the chamber , and fired 10 times it was jordan davis who kept escalating this to the point where i had no choice but to defend myself , mr dunn said on the stand it was life or death mr davis , a high school senior who had spent the day with three friends on the day he was killed , nov 23 , 2012 , was hit three times and died in the car he would have turned 19 on sunday the prosecutors argued that mr dunn had fabricated his story about the shotgun to bolster his selfdefense claim the police never found a shotgun , and no witnesses ever reported seeing one the teenagers testified that none of them had a shotgun in the car that was why no one shot back at mr dunn , the prosecutors said the trial , which lasted six days before deliberations began on wednesday , was the latest courtroom test for florida s expansive selfdefense statutes , including the socalled stand your ground provision under the law , mr dunn needed only to have been convinced that he saw a shotgun , whether or not one was present since their son s death , the davises have worked to try to change florida s selfdefense laws , including the stand your ground provision , which grants wide latitude to people who believed they face a threat the prosecutors portrayed mr dunn as a man who felt threatened right away because he viewed the teenagers as gangsters mr strolla disputed that notion and said mr dunn has maintained it was the violent rap subculture , not race , that influenced mr davis s behavior legal analysts said the defense had a relatively weak case because only mr dunn said he had seen a shotgun , and his fianc e s testimony undermined his credibility to back his claim , mr dunn was forced to testify , always a risky move since it opens a defendant up to crossexamination he testified very straightforward and honest , mr strolla said in what prosecutors called a wow trial moment , the fianc e , rhonda rouer , shaking on the witness stand , said that mr dunn had not mentioned to her in the night and day they spent together before his arrest that any of the teenagers had a shotgun ms rouer was inside the gas station convenience store when the shooting occurred but there were weaknesses in the prosecutors' case mr strolla repeatedly told jurors that no shotgun had been found because the police had failed to thoroughly search for it the teenagers , he said , had three minutes to hide the weapon after they drove to a nearby lot to escape the gunfire they thought this was just another murder in jacksonville , mr strolla , referring to the police , said at a news conference before the verdict mr strolla also underscored what he said were inconsistencies in the testimony of the teenagers and cast doubt on the witness who said he had heard mr dunn say , you 're not going to talk to me that way , before reaching for his pistol
have spent a huge sum of money to assemble a roster intended to challenge the , the nba s twotime defending champions and the standardbearers of the league on saturday night , the nets received contributions from every corner of that roster to deliver a vital counterpunch in this eastern conference semifinal series after the nets dropped the first two games in miami , six of their players scored in double figures in game 3 on saturday to help pummel the heat , 10490 , in front of a vibrant capacity crowd at barclays center it was not an elimination game , but it had the feel of one , and the nets will try to carry their newfound confidence into game 4 at home on monday night we wanted to show them that we 're not scared of them , said paul pierce , who relished the loud atmosphere while scoring 14 points the heat had 16 points in the first quarter from , who finished the night with 28 , and 20 points from dwyane wade but the nets showed a new level of aggressiveness and physicality on defense to shut down the rest of the team on the offensive end , the nets moved the ball as well as they have in this postseason , finishing with 26 assists and making 15 3pointers , a franchise playoff record in a series that has been headlined by allstars and most valuable player award winners , probable hall of famers and mammoth contracts , game 3 belonged to the nets' reserves and role players andray blatche contributed 15 points and 10 rebounds in his best game of the playoffs mirza teletovic \( 12 points \) hit four 3pointers , all in the second half , to help close out the game you ca n't game plan for that , joe johnson , who led the nets with 19 points , said of the team s depth coach jason kidd said before the game that the nets needed to focus on improving the small things like free throws , which he said would start runs and end runs rebounding slowing down the heat s 3point shooters and controlling the lane it was a long , daunting list of small things but after the game , kidd could have checked off nearly every item the nets finished with a huge advantage in rebounds , 4327 they held miami to 33 percent from behind the 3point line they limited the heat to 26 points in the lane aside from those areas , the microscope was also on deron williams , who did not score in game 2 on thursday night williams scored the first basket of the game , and then , in just over four minutes , dished out three assists williams finished with 9 points , struggling again with his shooting , but had 11 assists nine of those assists resulted in 3pointers the way they are playing me with two on the ball and coming up at me , i need to make the right plays and get people the ball , williams said i think i did that james came out attacking , too halfway through the first quarter , he bounced through the entire nets defense and flipped in a layup with pierce s arms wrapped around his shoulders but the nets persisted , and the fans , who booed james s every touch of the ball , erupted with cheers when guard shaun livingston drained a 36foot shot just before the firstquarter buzzer that cut the heat s lead to 3029 livingston had attempted just six 3pointers in the regular season and none in the playoffs before saturday even before that shot , everything about the atmosphere at barclays center felt heightened from the first round there was a new video to accompany the player introductions the dance team debuted a routine the building exceeded its usual celebrity fan quota for the first time in this postseason , the stands were packed before tipoff the nets gave out free tshirts to every paying customer , and before the game , they singled out people who were slow to put them on , displaying them on the video screen to be subjected to peer pressure the crowd buzzed every time blatche shimmied inside , executed a twirling feint or dribbled the ball behind his back he paced the nets early on , scoring 13 points and grabbing six rebounds in the first half the fans roared when teletovic drilled a 3pointer to open the fourth quarter , extending the nets' lead to 17 about two minutes later , the reserve guard alan anderson nailed a 3pointer from the corner that put the nets ahead by 18 points on the ensuing possession on the other end of the court , anderson tangled his arms around those of ray allen , who eventually tumbled to the floor allen popped to his feet , anderson removed his mouth guard , and the players exchanged words before their teammates separated them we 're at home , man , and we 're going against the champs , anderson said when asked about the nets' apparent hard edge the scuffle was a minor moment in a big night , but it symbolized the sense of urgency from the depths of the nets' roster

this week s poetry pairing features to my mother by edgar allan poe and the oped column muddling through mother s day by frank bruni after reading the poem and the article , tell us what you think or suggest other times content that could be matched with the poem instead born in 1809 in virginia , edgar allan poe rose to prominence as a leading man of letters in america when he directed several journals in the 1830s his own writing gained attention in the late 1830s and early 1840s , but the profits from his work remained meager he supported himself by editing magazines in philadelphia and new york city today , poe s stature as a major figure in world literature is primarily based on his ingenious and profound short stories , poems and critical theories , in which he made a powerful case for the short form in both poetry and fiction to my mother by edgar allan poe because i feel that , in the heavens above , the angels , whispering to one another , can find , among their burning terms of love , none so devotional as that of mother , therefore by that dear name i long have called you you who are more than mother unto me , and fill my heart of hearts , where death installed you in setting my virginia s spirit free my mother my own mother , who died early , was but the mother of myself but you are mother to the one i loved so dearly , and thus are dearer than the mother i knew by that infinity with which my wife was dearer to my soul than its soullife in muddling through mother s day , frank bruni writes about mother s day from the point of view of a son whose mother is no longer living i went through the names programmed into my cellphone , looking for moms tina she was one , so she got a text message happy mother s day barbara she was one , so she got a message as well so did adelle , lisa , sylvia happy mother s day , happy mother s day , happy mother s day saying it to all those other mothers , as if that would make up for not being able to say it to my own for anyone who has lost a parent long before he or she expected to , mother s day and father s day are unsettling occasions , prompts to show appreciation that become prods to revisit grief they re also proof that the world is full of accidental actuaries i don t know how else to explain it the number of people who look at you and seem to calculate , correctly , that when you re 33 years old , your mother should not yet be gone , and that there s a good chance , according to median life expectancies , that she s still around when you re 37 and even when you re 40 , unless she had you late did you send flowers to mom \? some acquaintance or stranger will ask a meaningless conversation filler , a verbal tic and you won t give the right or full answer , because no offense was intended , and none was taken you ll smile , vaguely or nod , misleadingly or lie , politely , saying yes , then changing the topic someone else will tell you to be sure you don t forget mom today to that , at least , your response will be honest i never do mother s day , i quickly learned , was the feast of the assumptions i say that without any rancor , but with some bafflement in a world of so many broken and untraditional families and of so much heartache , why should there be a bouquetprimed mother in the picture \? there s no point to guessing as much if i never knew exactly what to say to the people who guessed , i was even less sure how to mark the day , when i d always had a meal with mom if logistically possible , talked with her if not usually i just moped and it s wrong , the notion that feeling sorry for yourself is counterproductive sometimes it s just the ticket but on this mother s day , i ll trade moping for a testimonial i was i am one of the four luckiest children i know , my siblings being the other three we had a mother who held us in esteem and held us to account told us we were magnificent and told us we were miserable exhorted us to please her but found ways to forgive us when , all too frequently , we didn t and made certain that we knew she was there for us until , unimaginably , she wasn t visit the poetry pairings page to find out more about our collaboration with the poetry foundation , and to read ideas for using any week s pairing for teaching and learning
you would n't think that sailing over the equator could cause so much drama or , for that matter , be a museumworthy event but the drama , or more precisely the pageant , of the centuriesold maritime ceremony of crossing the line is noteworthy enough that the in manhattan has collected hundreds of items documenting the ceremonies that were held aboard the ship the flight deck full of planes may be the public face of the intrepid , but the museum s mission is also to record life on the ship part of that life was the equatorcrossing ceremonies the ship held during its 31year active life a former sailor from wisconsin and another from virginia who crossed in the 1960s added to the museum s collection in the last year , donating photos and documents tied to their experiences people often have a sense that they want the collection material to come home to the ship , where the guys have the memories , said jessica williams , curator of history and collections for the museum it s for other people to understand what they went through while they were on board the event is indeed memorable because it s so odd it dates to the time when ships were made of wood and sailors paid heed to king neptune sailors who had never crossed the equator were initiated into the king s domain by those who had already crossed in a ceremony that today sounds brutal the rookies , called pollywogs , were often beaten and thrown over the side by the veterans , known as shellbacks it was fraternity hazing at sea , and even officers were not immune charles darwin crossed as a pollywog in 1832 in the beagle , according to the beagle project , a website dedicated to the voyage , and was  these days , the ceremony is more humiliation than mutilation i became a shellback in 1974 when my ship , the uss sacramento , crossed in the indian ocean as i recall , we were awakened early , forced to wear our underwear over our jeans and fed a breakfast doused in hot sauce \( a menu donated to the intrepid shows pollywogs were fed something called jellyfish sandwiches and seaweed au jus , which was cold spaghetti with green food coloring \) we were then told to gather outside on the deck and were greeted there by dozens of snarling shellbacks holding cutoff lengths of fire hoses we had to crawl from the forecastle to the stern through a gantlet of shellbacks slapping us with the hoses and that s slapped , not beaten the day before , pollywogs receive a subpoena from king neptune to appear before his court so at the end of my crawl , i had to , while still on my knees , pay my respects to sailors dressed as the king , his queen and the fat royal baby , who grabbed my head and rubbed it over his naked , greasesmeared belly weird family despite all the mock horrors , nobody bled , there were no fights and , best of all , we did n't have to work that day to mark our initiation , we received colorful certificates attesting to our shellback status the museum has a certificate and a few other items under glass on the hangar deck from an intrepid ceremony in 1944 photos , documents and movies of ceremonies are in storage ms williams said there were no immediate plans to rotate other items into that display she also said the museum had not decided what to do with the movies , although the museum is considering establishing an online database of items that could include them garrett myers , 68 , of lake ridge , va , donated about 50 photographs and other items from when he crossed in 1968 he said he felt lucky to have participated many people are in the navy for a long time and do n't get to cross the equator , he said i felt very fortunate and looked forward to it , but was a bit nervous you did n't know what they were going to do it sounds as if mr myers got the standard fare pollywogs were dressed up as women and paraded on the flight deck pollywogs were put in a stockade and shaving cream was sprayed into their hair and they were , of course , hit with hoses people were screaming at you people were hitting you , he said none of it was brutal it was all in good fun , but not necessarily in good taste ronald wishman , 69 , of greendale , wis , said he also had to crawl through a canvas chute filled with garbage , a disgusting moment i remember from my crossing among the items he donated were his subpoena and the ship s daily newsletter , called the plan of the day , for the date the ship crossed in 1967 he and mr myers said they had considered passing on the mementos to their children , but feared the materials could be lost , so they gave them to the museum my stuff may not be displayed today , but it may be in two years , mr myers said whatever i donate will be preserved and in the care of the museum and it s to preserve something of me it turns out that my father , james , went through the ceremony on the uss west virginia during his certificate is in tatters , but mine is pristine , good enough to donate if my ship had become a museum why \? because my mother , mary , had it framed and proudly hung it on her bedroom wall i graduated from college a few years after the ceremony my diploma did not get the same treatment
hillary clinton recently reignited the wholostsyria debate when she suggested that president obama made a mistake in not intervening more forcefully early in the syrian civil war by arming the prodemocracy rebels i 've been skeptical about such an intervention skeptical that there were enough of these mainstream insurgents , skeptical that they could ever defeat president bashar alassad s army and the islamists and govern syria so if people try to sell you on it , ask them these questions before you decide if you are with clinton or obama 1 can they name the current leader of the syrian national coalition , the secular , moderate opposition , and the first three principles of its political platform \? extra credit if they can name the last year that the leader of the snc resided in syria hint it s several decades ago 2 can they explain why israel a country next door to syria that has better intelligence on syria than anyone and could be as affected by the outcome there as anyone has chosen not to bet on the secular , moderate syrian rebels or arm them enough to topple assad \? 3 the united states invaded iraq with more than 100 , 000 troops , replaced its government with a new one , suppressed its islamist extremists and trained a moderate iraqi army , but , the minute we left , iraq s moderate prime minister turned sectarian yet , in syria , iraq s twin , we 're supposed to believe that the moderate insurgents could have toppled assad and governed syria without any american boots on the ground , only arming the good rebels really \? 4 how could the good syrian rebels have triumphed in syria when the main funders of so many rebel groups there qatar and saudi arabia are sunni fundamentalist monarchies that oppose the very sort of democratic , pluralistic politics in their own countries that the decent syrian rebels aspire to build in syria \? 5 even if we had armed syrian moderates , how could they have defeated a coalition of the syrian alawite army and gangs , backed by russia , backed by iran , backed by hezbollah all of whom play by , which are no rules at all without the us having to get involved \? 6 how is it that some 15 , 000 muslim men from across the muslim world have traveled to syria to fight for jihadism and none have walked there to fight for pluralism , yet the syrian moderates would not only have been able to defeat the assad regime had we only armed them properly but also this entire jihadist foreign legion \? the notion that the only reason that the islamist militias emerged in syria is because we created a vacuum by not adequately arming the secular rebels is laughable nonsense syria has long had its own sunni fundamentalist underground in 1982 , when then president hafez alassad perpetrated the hama massacre , it was in an effort to wipe out those syrian islamists so , yes , there are cultural roots for pluralism in syria a country with many christians and secular muslims but there s also the opposite do not kid yourself that is why on , i was told by the local free syrian army commander , muatasim bila abul fida , that even after assad s regime is toppled there would be another war in syria it will take five or six years , he added , because the islamist parties want shariah , and we want democracy there were always going to be two civil wars there the liberals and jihadists against assad and the liberals and jihadists against each other do n't get me wrong my heart is with the brave syrian liberals who dared to take to the streets and demand regime change unarmed these decent , good people , the kind you would like to see running syria but it would take a lot more than better arms for them to defeat assad the jihadists here iraq is instructive you need to go back to the 2010 elections there when ayad allawi , a secular shiite , who ran with sunnis , shiites and christians on a moderate , pluralistic platform like syria s moderates actually won more seats than his main competitor , prime minister nuri kamal almaliki what enabled that \? i 'll tell you the us decapitated saddam s regime , then helped to midwife an iraqi constitution and elections , while us \( and iraqi \) special forces either arrested or killed the worst sunni shiite extremists we took out both extremes without reading them their miranda rights that is what gave iraq s moderate center the space , confidence and ability to back multisectarian parties , which is what many iraqis wanted when our troops left , though , that center could n't hold i do n't want us troops in syria any more than anyone else , but i have no respect for the argument that just arming some prodemocracy rebels would have gotten the job done yes , there has been a price for obama s inaction but there is a price for effective action as well , which the critics have to be honest about it s called an international force we are dealing not only with states that have disintegrated , but whole societies and rebuilding them is the mother of all nationbuilding projects will the ends , will the means otherwise , you 're not being serious
whitney wolfe , the former vice president of marketing at tinder , the onlinedating app , recently filed suit against her former employers she claims damages for sexual harassment , discrimination and defamation and also details the story of her contributions to the company s founding the allegations she levels at her former coworkers tell a larger story , though , about how tech startups try to spin their stories of how an idea is generated and successfully brought to life the coveted founding story starts with a college \( or high school \) dropout who noodles on his computer and creates a worldchanging innovation \( an engineer from mit or harvard is a close second \) once the startup is established , product control is prized to maximize flexibility the preferred means of growth are bootstrapping \( financing the company through personal means or the company s early revenue \) or a successful series a round of fundraising from venture capitalists leading to an ipo \( selling your startup to a wealthy , powerful company like google , apple or facebook may leave the idea intact and the founders flush , but autonomy will be lost , and the founders will be left riding the bus to work \) tinder didn t strictly follow this narrative the app was born under the aegis of an incubator at iac , an internet company after ms wolfe filed her lawsuit , nick summers , who wrote a profile of tinder for bloomberg businessweek in 2013 , revisited the subject to reveal how the company had tried to hide certain aspects of its history in his initial reporting on tinder , mr summers found that sean rad , the chief executive , and justin mateen , the chief marketing officer , were reluctant to admit iac s role tinder would check all the boxes of the classic rocketing digital startup success college dropout founder , colorful offices , young users , and a geometric growth curve if it weren t for one minor detail it s not actually a startup tinder will never have a splashy initial public offering or the thrill of announcing a billiondollar acquisition by a large corporation , because it s already owned by a large corporation mr rad and mr mateen were keen to hide this arrangement , mr summers wrote , and pretend that they were living the dream of being wined and dined by silicon valley moneymen mr summers s account of a manipulated founding story didn t strike readers as unusual and may point to another underlying reason why ms wolfe s early contributions have since been obscured just about every major la tech co rewrites their origin story it is a town of storytellers after all http tco xshpupek39  sean percival \( percival \) 3 jul 14 commenters discussing the tinder lawsuit on hacker news wrote , if you don t create this false narrative \( and let s be clear , 90 of the startup narratives you hear are altered to make the story more attractive \) , people won t pay attention someone else posted that a successful startup born out of an incubator that is funded by a multibilliondollar company is far less compelling for everyone than we had this idea for this app and it spread like wildfire and now the vcs are coming knocking at our door media coverage of the tech industry often offers factors that are most likely to create a successful business last november , techcrunch studied the top 39 unicorn companies , businesses that have made more than 1 billion the article breaks down attributes of each company to identify indicators of success of the companies considered , 90 percent of factors were shared these included enterprise founder ceos with technical degrees companies with 2 cofounders who worked or went to school together companies whose founders had prior tech startup experience and whose founders were in their 30s or older mr mateen and mr rad may have taken note that successful companies had three or fewer founders none had greater than six shanley kane , a cultural critic of silicon valley , argues that these heroic stories conceal social realities and perpetuate the inequality of the industry in an interview with fast company labs , she argues that this narrative conceals the privilege of the dropout coder many of these dropouts , she argues , must have had money behind them and access to computers from a young age in order to become a successful entrepreneur the high school dropout story is always the story of a white guy you never hear about women who drop out of high school and go on to found companies ms kane points out that most individuals leading startups tend to be single , white men without the obligations of family weighing on them there are a lot of people who can t take advantage of those opportunities people who don t have parents subsidizing their living , people who have school debt , people who have families , who need to be able to support other people whether those are parents or children or a partner it s this fairly narrow class of person which has a certain level of economic stability that is able to take a risk like that the tech industry has been criticized for its embrace of culture fit companies hire based on a candidate s ability to mesh with the culture of the organization as it already exists , but given the overrepresentation of men in the industry , that often means women and people of color are disproportionately affected by culture fit ms wolfe s gender , in the prevailing narrative of startup success , was another strike against her ms kane says of culture fit on the surface level it tends to mean we just don t like you you re different from us we don t want to figure out how to work with you when the standard of proof for hiring or firing someone only has to be culture fit , it s easy to see how discrimination can quickly become a problem and how startup culture can become fairly homogenous ms wolfe claims that when mr mateen was harassing her , she went to mr rad for help his response was that she was being annoying and dramatic , as documented in her lawsuit mr rad also told her if she was unable to disengage it would be her fault , not mr mateen s sexism in silicon valley not to mention its diversity problem is well documented but how will people who have remained outliers in the industry be written into the narratives of success \? i am 100 sure that in january , the tinder ceo told me they had a female cofounder http tco 02edblinr5  tess rinearson \( tessr \) 3 jul 14 revisiting his tinder story , mr summers concludes , startups fail and succeed because of the real actions of their workers , not because of an agreedupon myth created after the fact
charlotte , nc it s hard to imagine a more cynical fraud according to an indictment unsealed last week by the manhattan district attorney s office , post9 11 phobias of airplanes and skyscrapers were among the fictitious ailments described by retired new york city police officers and firefighters who , in a scheme involving as many as 1 , 000 people , are accused of ripping off the social security disability system by filing false claims as an administrative law judge responsible for hearing social security disability cases , i'm more familiar than most people with the system but everyone has a right to be outraged by the recent charges officials estimate that the fraud cost the federal government 400 million if true , it is the largest theft in the history of social security according to court papers , the fraudsters claimed to be so ill that they could not leave their homes to work , but many posted photographs on facebook of themselves on motorcycles and water scooters , fishing and playing sports how did they expect to get away with it \? well , here s a littleknown fact neither the staff members of the social security administration , who review initial claims , nor judges like myself , who hear disputed cases , are allowed to look at facebook in the context of a case even if something in the case file suggests a claimant is not telling the whole truth , social security administration policy prevents us from looking at social media , for fear that we cannot be trusted to properly assess the information gathered there no facebook , no pinterest , no twitter , no tumblr none of the sources that most employers routinely use to check the credibility of potential employees are available to us it gets worse when a disputed case comes before an administrative law judge , a vast majority of claimants bring an attorney after all , the average claim , if successful , will yield a payout of some 300 , 000 in lifetime benefits with so much at stake , it s only reasonable that a person who believes that he has wrongly been denied benefits would hire a lawyer but is n't it equally reasonable that the taxpayers should have an attorney present to challenge a claim that might be false \? sorry , no luck when i conduct a hearing \( which occurs with no members of the press or public present , because of privacy concerns \) , the claimant can bring an attorney , but the system does not provide the government with one the taxpayers have no advocate on their behalf to ask questions , challenge medical evidence or review the 500 to 700 pages of materials that make up a typical case file not only that , but because of social security administration policy , i am no longer allowed to order independent psychological testing to help determine whether a claimant is telling the truth social security disability courts have millions of claimants and constitute one of the world s largest judicial systems but the system is not run by anyone with real judicial experience instead , we are at the mercy of unelected bureaucrats whose only concern is how many cases each judge can churn out and how fast we can do it the social security administration is currently run by an acting commissioner president obama should appoint a permanent leader with recognized professional experience in the field of social insurance the association of administrative law judges , for which i serve as president , favors modernizing disability hearings so that we can give claimants a fair hearing while also protecting taxpayers our courtrooms ought to look more like what you see on law and order or the good wife each side should have an advocate , allowing judges to narrow the facts in dispute and apply the law in a neutral manner and judges and their staff members should be able to use social media , including facebook though it is not clear from the manhattan district attorney s indictment if any of the claims in question ever wound up before an administrative law judge , it is clear than the current antiquated system handicaps the effective review of cases and encourages brazen behavior the system needs to be made more trustworthy and fully transparent the actions of a few crooks must not be allowed to threaten the disability payments of millions of people who are genuinely disabled , many of whom paid into the disability insurance fund during their working lives an adversarial system with both sides represented and all evidence on the table is the best way to root out fraud and ensure that legitimate claims are paid
for almost a decade , taylor swift has been waging , and winning , a war , smiling all the while country music has been was a natural enemy for her hidebound , slow moving , lousy with machismo she could break the rules and make people nervous simply by showing up and yet country was also a hospitable host body she faced almost no direct competition there , and it s a genre that embraces success , grudgingly if need be most important , country gave ms swift context it made her a transgressor , which means even her most benign songs could be read with mischievous intent from the outside , she looked like a conquering titan but from the inside looking out , even as the genre s biggest star , she was always something of an underdog , multiplatinum albums and accolades be damned that she would one day abandon country has long been clear it s a big box , and a porous one , but a box all the same 1989 \( big machine \) , though , her fifth album and the first that does n't at all bother with country , manages to find a new foe full of expertly constructed , slightly neutered songs about heartbreak , 1989 , which is to be released on monday , does n't announce itself as oppositional but there is an implicit enemy on this breezily effective album the rest of mainstream pop , which 1989 has almost nothing in common with modern pop stars white pop stars , that is mainly get there by emulating black music think of miley cyrus , justin timberlake , justin bieber in the current ecosystem , katy perry is probably the pop star least reliant on hiphop and rb to make her sound , but her biggest recent hit featured the rapper juicy j she s not immune ms swift , though , is having none of that what she does n't do on this album is as important as what she does there is no production by diplo or mike will madeit here , no guest verse by drake or pitbull her idea of pop music harks back to a period the mid1980s when pop was less overtly hybrid that choice allows her to stake out popular turf without having to keep up with the latest microtrends , and without being accused of cultural appropriation that ms swift wants to be left out of those debates was clear in the video for this album s first single , the spry shake it off , in which she surrounds herself with all sorts of hiphop dancers and bumbles all the moves later in , she surrounds herself with regular folks , and they all shimmy unselfconsciously , not trying to be cool see what ms swift did there \? the singer most likely to sell the most copies of any album this year has written herself a narrative in which she s still the outsider she is the butterfingers in a group of experts , the approachable one in a sea of high post , the smalltown girl learning to navigate the big city in that sense , the most important decision taylor swift made in the last couple of years had nothing to do with music she bought a pad in new york , paying about 20 million for a tribeca penthouse it was a molting , the culmination of several years of outgrowing nashville combined with interest in ms swift that placed her in tabloid crosshairs just like any other global star but it also afforded her the opportunity once again to be seen as a na f in nashville , she 'd learned all the rules , all the back roads now , with that place more or less in the rear view , she is free to make the john hughes movie of her imagination that s 1989 , which opens with welcome to new york , a shimmery , if slightly dim celebration of the freedom of getting lost in gotham everybody here was someone else before and you can want who you want \( as a gesture of tolerance , this is about 10 steps behind kacey musgraves s \) ms swift has n't been the type to ask permission in her career , but she has long seen herself as a stranger to the grandscale fame that new york signifies someday i 'll be living in a big ol' city she taunted a critic on mean , from her 2010 album speak now now here she is , making the new york spotlight her backlight on this new stage , ms swift is thriving and crucially , she is more or less alone , not part of any pop movement of the day she has set herself apart and , implicitly , above the era of pop she channels here was a collision of sleaze and romanticism , of the human and the digital but there s barely any loucheness in ms swift s voice her take on that sound is sandpapered flat and polished to a sheen the album , named for the year she was born , is executive produced by ms swift and max martin , and most of the songs are written with mr martin and his fellow swede shellback both men have helped shape the last decade of pop but what s notable here is their restraint \( mr martin also did almost all the vocal production on the album \) ms swift s old running buddy nathan chapman produced this love , a mournful ballad that would have been at home of the hunger games catching fire soundtrack , and the only song here that could be mistaken for a concession to country the best countrydefying songs on her last album , red especially i knew you were trouble , another collaboration with mr martin and shellback were also a move toward forwardsounding pop ms swift has many charms but stylistic envelope pushing has not always been among them and yet those songs showed her to be more of a risk taker than she 'd ever been , and savvy enough to know her fans would follow that vanguard attitude , though , is n't to be found on 1989 , which is largely filled with upbeat , tense songs on which the singer stomps out much of whatever was left of her youthful innocence the taylor swift of this album is savage , wry , and pointed the high mark is style , which recalls something from the original miami vice soundtrack , all warm synths and damp vocals midnight you come and pick me up no headlights , she oozes at the beginning of the song by the chorus , she s flirty , but back in the verses , she s skeptical and a little bedraggled ms swift has often sung in a talky manner , emphasizing intimacy over power and nuance , but on 1989 she uses her voice processed more than ever in different ways than before the coy confidence of how she shifts gears leading up to the bridge in shake it off , slithering out the line , but i keep cruising , immediately changing the song from gumsnapping glee to powerful release or the way she sweetly drags out the long e in beat on welcome to new york or the bratty background chorus chants on all you had to do was stay her most pronounced vocal tweak is on wildest dreams , a sweaty and dark tale of dangerous love in the verses , ms swift sings drowsily , as if seducing or just waking up i said no one has to know what we do' his hands are in my hair his clothes are in my room then , at the bridge , she skips up an octave , sputtering out bleats of ecstasy , before retreating back under the covers on this album , ms swift s songwriting is n't as microdetailed as it has been , instead approaching heartbreak with a wider lens , as on this love tossing , turning , struggled through the night with someone new and i could go on and on , on and on lantern , burning , flickered in my mind for only you but you were still gone , gone , gone and while there are certainly references to some of ms swift s highprofile relationships , the album on the whole feels less diaristic than her previous work but do n't be distracted by for whom the belle trolls she trolls with glee , and that s what matters take the clever blank space , a metanarrative about ms swift s reputation as a dating disaster saw you there and i thought oh my god , look at that face you look like my next mistake love s a game , want to plaaaaaay \? this is ms swift at her peak it s funny and knowing , and serves to assert both her power and her primness by contrast , the songs where she sounds the least jaded how you get the girl , welcome to new york are among the least effective it s hard for ms swift to still sell na vet she s too wellknown and too good at her job that s likely at least part of the reason that the bonus edition of this album includes three voice memos recorded by ms swift on her telephone that showcase bits of songs in their early stages they 're there as gifts for obsessives , but also as boasts , flaunting her expertise and also her awshucks demeanor i wish you would shows her singing without any vocal manipulation , and though the lyrics to i know places and blank space changed a bunch from this stage to the final version , it s clear that the melodies were intact , and sturdy , from the beginning there are a few songs in which production dominates the two songs written and produced with jack antonoff \( of fun and bleachers \) out of the woods and i wish you would , which burst with erupting drums , moody synths and sizzling guitars and bad blood , which has booming drums reminiscent of the billy squier ones often sampled in hiphop but these are outliers ms swift has always been melody first , and if she wanted to give herself over to a producer and sound of the moment , she could have gone several different , more obvious routes , or even stayed in country , which is as hiphop inflected as pop is these days \( for the record , there are a few sortofmodern phrases sprinkled through the lyrics this sick beat , mad love and the chorus of shake it off , where she squeaks the players gonna play , play , play , play , play and the haters gonna hate , hate , hate , hate , hate though they are mostly there to underscore just how out of place ms swift sounds singing them \) but by making pop with almost no contemporary references , ms swift is aiming somewhere even higher , a mode of timelessness that few true pop stars aside from , say , adele , who has a vocal gift that demands such an approach even bother aspiring to everyone else striving to sound like now will have to shift gears once the now sound changes but not ms swift , who s waging , and winning , a new war , one she 'd never admit to fighting
moscow the deputy prime minister in charge of s space programs said sunday that he had started to impose restrictions on global positioning system base stations here , as retribution for the refusal of the united states to allow similar base stations on american territory that would improve the accuracy of russia s navigation system the restrictions will not cause any disruption in the operation of gps , as the american satellite navigation system is more commonly known still , they are a sign of how deeply soured relations have become between the united states and russia in the months since the kremlin s annexation of crimea , and other longsimmering disputes , including russia s granting of asylum to edward j snowden , the fugitive national security contractor the deputy prime minister , dmitri o rogozin , said that as of sunday the gps base stations in russia could not be used for military purposes , and he announced a deadline of sept 1 for the united states to agree to allow base stations on its territory for russia s navigation system , glonass otherwise , he said , the gps terminals would be shut down for good we have worked out and implemented measures that exclude the use of these gps stations for military purposes , mr rogozin wrote in a blog post now they are under our full control mr rogozin is one of the most prominent russian officials to be sanctioned by the united states over president vladimir v putin s policies toward ukraine , and mr rogozin is known for occasionally bellicose , including a recent suggestion that american astronauts may soon need a trampoline to reach the international space station as part of the recriminations over crimea , russia has threatened to end its cooperation with nasa , which has relied on russia for manned space travel since the retirement of the american program mr rogozin recently said that russia would seek to oust the united states from its work on the space station after an agreement on the project ends in 2020 despite mr rogozin s assertions , the base stations in russia are not all vital for gps operations , and he acknowledged that there would be no disruption in service to people and businesses relying on gps for help ranging from assistance with airplane navigation to directions to the nearest coffee shop the is run using a master control , a backup control station , two command and control antennas and 16 monitoring sites none of which are in russia last year , the central intelligence agency and the pentagon to back away from plans to allow glonass stations on american territory , citing fears that they might aid russia in spying on the united states , or could even improve the accuracy of russian missiles in december , congress that all but barred the russian stations from being built that was before the invasion of crimea russia says the stations are intended only to improve the accuracy of its navigation the gps sites in russia are part of passive base stations that are used in geodesic research the breakdown of cooperation between the united states and russia poses potentially serious complications for researchers
sochi , russia with an outsize extravaganza that reached deep into the repertory of classical music and ballet , traversed the sights and sounds of the world s largest geopolitical expanse , soared into outer space and swept across millenniums of history in a celebration of everything from czarist military might to soviet monumentalism , a swaggering , resurgent russia turned its winter olympic aspirations into reality on friday night after seven years of building to this moment the opening of what is believed to be the most expensive olympic games in history the message of the overthetop ceremony was simply this in a big way , russia is back as if there were any doubt \( where russia may be headed amid an economic slowdown , continuing rights abuses and suppression of political dissent that have drawn sharp criticism , especially in the west was a question for another day \) the 18chapter , nearly threehour opening ceremony began at the symbolic moment of 8 14 pm 20 14 , as time is counted here and provided a majestic spectacle that included a glowing troika of horses made of light streaking through a snowbound sky , the multicolor onion domes of st basil s cathedral bobbing in the air literary references to gogol , tolstoy and nabokov images of stalinist skyscrapers and performances by russia s storied ballerinas , musicians and singers if there were any traces of national selfconsciousness lingering nearly a quartercentury after the collapse of communism and the loss of superpower status , they were put aside for the evening also set aside , however briefly , were the many political controversies of late , including criticism of a law banning homosexual propaganda and disputes over political influence in ukraine , human rights abuses and other issues that prompted some western leaders not to attend the games instead , what unfolded in the fisht olympic stadium the centerpiece of the newly built olympic complex stretching from the black sea coast up into the caucasus mountains was sheer pageantry and national pride , with all of the homespun promotionalism , mythmaking and selfaggrandizement that are the modern trademark of such ceremonies the music included pieces by alexander borodin , georgy sviridov , stravinsky and tchaikovsky , with selections from swan lake and the nutcracker there were roles for the opera soprano anna netrebko the prima ballerina diana vishneva and russia s bestknown conductor , valery gergiev of the mariinsky theater there were cossack dancers and singers from the more than 600yearold sretensky monastery choir there were salutes to russian science and innovation , including nods to mendeleev , who codified the periodic table of elements , and igor sikorsky , the inventor and aviator the russian flag was raised by the cosmonaut sergei krikalev the former first lady naina yeltsin was in the audience and the olympic torch was carried on its final steps by a cadre of russia s most famous athletes , including the goldmedalwinning rhythmic gymnast alina kabaeva , the champion polevaulter yelena isinbayeva and the tennis star maria sharapova , who won a silver medal at the summer games in 2012 if the renarration of history in the opening ceremony occasionally involved some breezing past inconvenient episodes the stalinist purges that killed millions , for instance , and the gulags that imprisoned and killed millions more the ceremony was , in many respects , the introduction to the world of a recreated russia , one far different from the union of soviet socialist republics that hosted the summer games in moscow in 1980 the national anthem played to the crowd of 40 , 000 in the stadium and heard by billions more watching on television around the world was the same music played nearly 35 years ago but the lyrics have been rewritten , with lines about the united , mighty soviet union and the great lenin replaced by references to russia our sacred homeland and wide spaces , for dreams and for living in this sense , unlike the most recent comparable spectacles which celebrated enduring traditions and reveled in ironic selfdeprecation , or which firmly declared the emergence of a new power the sochi ceremony was a toast to reinvention the sochi games , in many respects , reflect a personal ambition of president vladimir v putin , the most audacious in a series of megaprojects that illustrate the nation s rise from postsoviet chaos under his leadership as with the other projects , including last summer s universiade in kazan , the games were largely financed by russia s oil and gas wealth , and by many of the billionaires , socalled oligarchs , who have profited most handsomely from it stateowned companies like gazprom and sberbank also made huge investments the 1980 games , boycotted by the united states and dozens of other nations , have shadowed much of the preparations for these games , and in many ways the sochi olympics have been designed to supplant memories of that time philip barker , a historian of the olympics , said the moscow games were also notable for the first opening ceremony that was a true spectacle before that , it was a parade of teams , a bit of kids dancing , and that was it , mr barker said still , compared with friday night , the 1980 event seems rather quaint like so much else in modern russia , sochi s opening festivities were painstakingly choreographed yet oddly unpredictable , with a few surprises not all of them good at the beginning , one of the five gigantic snowflakes intended to burst into olympic rings failed to open the show , formally titled dreams about russia , was produced under the leadership of konstantin ernst , the director of channel one , russia s largest statecontrolled television channel , and a staunch loyalist to mr putin at a news conference earlier in the day , mr ernst noted that russia could not compete when it came to popular music and instead would rely on what it had done best for centuries classical we cannot , like london , boast of a great number of worldfamous pop performers that s why we focus more on the most popular part of russian music classical music , he said the ceremony also showcased russian ballet , with performances not just by ms vishneva , the star soloist with the mariinsky ballet , but also by svetlana zakharova , a principal dancer with the bolshoi ballet ivan vasiliev , now with american ballet theater and other stars in one sketch , the dancers brought to life a ballroom scene from tolstoy s war and peace , and mr vasiliev drew gasps with his signature gravitydefying leaps in a buzzstirring departure from the emphasis on the classics , mr ernst chose the girl duo tatu for the final act of the preshow and used the duo s song not gonna get us to accompany the arrival of russia s athletes during the parade of nations popular in the early 2000s and one of the few russian pop acts with worldwide fame , tatu was perhaps best known for dressing as schoolgirls and kissing onstage a display that now could potentially generate problems under russia s law banning gay propaganda the central character in the show , however , was a littleknown 11yearold , liza temnikova , from krasnodar , the capital of the region where sochi is the daughter of two taxi drivers , she won the role in a casting call her character , named lyubov , which means love , led the audience on a journey across centuries , as well as russia s roughly 4 , 400mile expanse , across nine time zones , from europe to the pacific ocean , and from the arctic sea to the black sea the show celebrated not only russian geography but also the cyrillic alphabet \( which gave a surprise twist to the order in which countries marched into the arena \) as well as the military prowess of peter the great it also delved into russian fairy tales with the story of the mythical city of kitezh , submerged in a lake by its prince rather than surrendered to the mongols , leaving only the sound of the church bells tolling on the surface on summer nights and , of course , there was some love for mr putin , russia s paramount leader for 14 years , who the program noted is also an alpine skier and has learned to ice skate and play ice hockey just before 10 30 pm , mr putin fulfilled his role carefully dictated by the olympic charter and uttered a single sentence declaring the games officially opened a barrage of redwhiteandblue fireworks immediately shot into the night sky notably , mr ernst designed a show that , like mr putin , was not shy about embracing certain aspects of the soviet past some of the most striking sketches involved an artistic view of the 20th century , glossing over some of russia s darkest times , with a focus instead on industrialism and the avantgarde the sketches illustrated the period with huge mechanical cogs and gears , spinning and churning , as well as with images of the stalinist skyscrapers that are among the most recognizable buildings in moscow , and perhaps most dramatically , with an image of vera i mukhina s iconic sculpture worker and peasant woman whatever the soviet union s ideological failings , the ceremony reflected a view , clearly shared by mr putin , that its sheer bigness especially its unification of russia s multitude of ethnicities should be admired no doubt , one of the most enduring images for the audience was that of the glowing white troika , the chariot drawn by three horses immortalized in gogol s novel dead souls where art thou soaring away to russia \? give me the answer ! but russia gives none , gogol wrote in the book , published in 1842 all things on earth fly past , eyeing the troika , and all the other peoples and nations stand aside giving it the right of way
the changing nature of politics has reshaped lobbying , not necessarily for the worse top dogs in washington s influence industry are losing ground to a new breed the strategic adviser with clean hands , who stands aloof from the grunt work of cornering members of the house and senate in capitol hallways and the hassle of remembering committee secretaries by name , is now ascendant never mind those nightly fundraisers if you look at the numbers , it may seem that lobbying is in decline , but it is n't it s just taking different forms what was once straightforward lobbying has become , in effect , a full service pradvertisingsocial media operation , very little of which is covered by federal regulation in a field buffeted by the economic meltdown of 2008 , the current legislative standstill on capitol hill , the emergence of hightech competitors and the passage of the \( which subjects registered lobbyists to a stringent regulatory regime including the threat of criminal sanctions and prison time \) , this shift in the influence industry poses a broader question are the days of the gladhanding lobbyist , carrying an envelope of pac checks and the proposed wording of a client s legislative amendment , numbered \? carter eskew , a founding partner of , which lobbies and provides a host of other services to clients , raised this question in a conversation with me looking to future sources of new revenue , eskew has concluded that relationship lobbying' is dead , or at least not where the growth will be the traditional lobbyist , he argues , is no longer the minence grise of days past but instead has been reduced to serving as a conduit for campaign contributions from corporate and trade association pacs to candidates the action has shifted to what is known in the business as strategic advice how to convince and mobilize voters and opinion elites in support of a client s agenda according to eskew , many years ago , members of congress figured out what they really needed to worry about were their own constituent groups and their own voters so what does this new strategic adviser actually do \? he or she can plan out a legislative campaign or a drive to affect the implementation of regulation , determine which officials and agencies must be dealt with , and propose potential coalition partners interestingly , all this can be done without making direct contact with elected officials , congressional aides or topranked department and agency appointees and employees this armslength approach permits strategic advisers to avoid lobbying registration and reporting requirements ed gillespie , a former chairman of the republican national committee and a key adviser to george w bush , is the embodiment of the measured camouflage of top

responsive politics , lobbyists 2012 out of the game or under the radar \? contends that lobbyists are purposely changing their modus operandi auble \( see figures and \) charts the decline in the number of washington lobbyists from a 2007 high of 14 , 837 to 12 , 433 in 2012 , and a drop in their disclosed compensation from a 2010 high of 355 billion to 331 billion in 2012 it remains a challenging environment , , a registered democratic lobbyist , told me in a phone call first , courtesy of the great recession , and now there is a perception of dysfunction , nonproduction , that there s not a hell of a lot of action on the hill that translates into truly serious legislation that s not all at the end of 2010 , house republicans , under pressure from the tea party , special provisions for individual members creating such local projects as roads , bridges , dams and federal buildings earmarks had been the bread and butter of firms that specialized in winning federal project grants for their clients for example , the lobbying firm cassidy and associates has paid for the earmark ban \( see \) fees paid to cassidy fell from 223 million in 2009 to 155 million in 2012 negative trends in reported fees mask some less visible but highly lucrative developments the legislative battles preceding the 2010 enactment of the doddfrank finance industry reforms and the affordable care act were the last two major moneymakers for publicly registered lobbyists since then , however , there has been a of on washington lawyers , sometimes referred to as shadow lobbyists , who do not need to register or disclose fees , but who are attempting to influence the writing of regulations governing doddfrank by such agencies as the securities and exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission in a for the sunlight foundation , , a political scientist at james madison university , estimated that for every registered lobbyist there is at least one shadow lobbyist who is getting paid to influence public policy without making any public disclosure of fees or clients lapira found a ratio of 523 to 477 of shadow lobbyists to registered lobbyists lapira makes the working assumption that the shadow lobbyist collects the same amount in fees as the publicly registered lobbyist an annual average of 270 , 000 per person using lapira s reasoning , to influence legislative and regulatory outcomes in 2012 doubled from 31 billion to 67 billion falling entirely outside the scope of regulation is what s known as lobbying mobilizing stockholders , suppliers , trade association members and members of any sympathetic constituency to write letters , call their congressmen and send emails this tactic has been around for decades , but every year it become more technically sophisticated for example , last march , kate ackley of roll call that which helps corporations navigate their most challenging political , legislative and regulatory problems anywhere in the world scheduled hundreds of hill meetings and generated more than 31 , 500 constituent calls to congressional offices on behalf of the retail industry leaders association , along with

campaign helped win passage of legislation restricting the fees credit card companies could charge merchants we did n't come anywhere near the threshold for lobbying , dci group spokesman craig stevens told roll call we are very diligent to honor the letter and spirit of all the rules and regulations that congress has set forth ed rogers , who worked on the presidential campaigns of ronald reagan and george hw bush , is currently a registered lobbyist and chairman of \( formerly barbour griffith rogers \) bgr , in addition to straightforward lobbying , has a webbased practice and a public relations arm rogers noted in an interview that the internet is changing the nature of lobbying now it s essential to manage the google hole , what s google got about you , you have to inject content , enhance the good and dilute the bad the same assertive approach , rogers argues , applies to youtube videos and wikipedia entries never let a negative go unanswered , if there is something bad on the web , you need to match it with something good stuff on the web has a much longer halflife than it used to be with newspapers , you have to tend to it , rogers told me in of the services it provides , eskew s glover park group shows how far beyond traditional lobbying the influence business has gone in this respect , the merging of lobbying into a much more encompassing collection of strategies and approaches is illustrated by the conglomeration of lobbying and other influence specialties under one corporate roof the premier example of this can be found at , a worldwide advertising , marketing and public affairs company , with 350 subsidiaries the list of wpp s washington firms keeps getting longer and includes blue state digital , benenson strategy group , bursonmarsteller , direct impact , hill knowlton strategies , dewey square group , penn schoen berland , pbn hill knowlton strategies , prime policy group , qga public affairs , palisades media ventures , the glover park group and wexler walker public policy associates when lobbying is merged into a behemoth of this scope , it is no longer lobbying as your parents understood the concept it is now an integral part of a much broader system of corporate leverage and control , a system that has left the federal regulation of this new breed of influence strategists far behind
abd alrahman iii was an emir and caliph of c rdoba in 10thcentury spain he was an absolute ruler who lived in complete luxury here s how he assessed his life i have now reigned above 50 years in victory or peace beloved by my subjects , dreaded by my enemies , and respected by my allies riches and honors , power and pleasure , have waited on my call , nor does any earthly blessing appear to have been wanting to my felicity fame , riches and pleasure beyond imagination sound great \? he went on to write i have diligently numbered the days of pure and genuine happiness which have fallen to my lot they amount to 14 abd alrahman s problem was n't happiness , as he believed it was unhappiness if that sounds like a distinction without a difference , you probably have the same problem as the great emir but with a little knowledge , you can avoid the misery that befell him what is unhappiness \? your intuition might be that it is simply the opposite of happiness , just as darkness is the absence of light that is not correct happiness and unhappiness are certainly related , but they are not actually opposites images of the brain show that parts of the left cerebral cortex are more active than the right when we are experiencing happiness , while the right side becomes more active when we are unhappy as strange as it seems , being happier than average does not mean that one ca n't also be unhappier than average one test for both happiness and unhappiness is the positive affectivity and negative affectivity schedule test i took the test myself i found that , for happiness , i am at the top for people my age , sex , occupation and education group but i get a pretty high score for unhappiness as well i am a cheerful melancholic so when people say , i am an unhappy person , they are really doing sums , whether they realize it or not they are saying , my unhappiness is x , my happiness is y , and x y the real questions are why , and what you can do to make y x if you ask an unhappy person why he is unhappy , he 'll almost always blame circumstance in many cases , of course , this is justified some people are oppressed or poor or have physical ailments that make life a chore research unsurprisingly suggests that racism causes unhappiness in children , and many academic studies trace a clear link between unhappiness and poverty another common source of unhappiness is loneliness , from which about 20 percent of americans suffer enough to make it a major source of unhappiness in their lives there are also smaller circumstantial sources of unhappiness the princeton psychologist measured the negative affect \( bad moods \) that ordinary daily activities and interactions kick up they found that the no 1 unhappinessprovoking event in a typical day is spending time with one s boss \( which , as a boss , made me unhappy to learn \) circumstances are certainly important no doubt abd alrahman could point to a few in his life but paradoxically , a better explanation for his unhappiness may have been his own search for wellbeing and the same might go for you have you ever known an alcoholic \? they generally drink to relieve craving or anxiety in other words , to attenuate a source of unhappiness yet it is the drink that ultimately prolongs their suffering the same principle was at work for abd alrahman in his pursuit of fame , wealth and pleasure consider fame in 2009 , researchers from the university of rochester conducted tracking the success of 147 recent graduates in reaching their stated goals after graduation some had intrinsic goals , such as deep , enduring relationships others had extrinsic goals , such as achieving reputation or fame the scholars found that intrinsic goals were associated with happier lives but the people who pursued extrinsic goals experienced more negative emotions , such as shame and fear they even suffered more physical maladies this is one of the cruelest ironies in life i work in washington , right in the middle of intensely public political battles bar none , the unhappiest people i have ever met are those most dedicated to their own selfaggrandizement the pundits , the tv loudmouths , the media knowitalls they build themselves up and promote their images , but feel awful most of the time that s the paradox of fame just like drugs and alcohol , once you become addicted , you ca n't live without it but you ca n't live with it , either celebrities have described fame like being an animal in a cage a toy in a shop window a barbie doll a public facade a clay figure or , that guy on tv , according to research by the psychologist donna rockwell yet they ca n't give it up that impulse to fame by everyday people has generated some astonishing innovations one is the advent of reality television , in which ordinary people become actors in their daytoday lives for others to watch why \? to be noticed , to be wanted , to be loved , to walk into a place and have others care about what you 're doing , even what you had for lunch that day that s what people want , in my opinion , said one 26yearold participant in an early hit reality show called big brother and then there s social media today , each of us can build a personal little fan base , thanks to facebook , youtube , twitter and the like we can broadcast the details of our lives to friends and strangers in an astonishingly efficient way that s good for staying in touch with friends , but it also puts a minor form of fameseeking within each person s reach and several studies show that it can make us unhappy it makes sense what do you post to facebook \? pictures of yourself yelling at your kids , or having a hard time at work \? no , you post smiling photos of a hiking trip with friends you build a fake life or at least an incomplete one and share it furthermore , you consume almost exclusively the fake lives of your social media friends unless you are extraordinarily selfaware , how could it not make you feel worse to spend part of your time pretending to be happier than you are , and the other part of your time seeing how much happier others seem to be than you \? some look for relief from unhappiness in money and material things this scenario is a little more complicated than fame the evidence does suggest that money relieves suffering in cases of true material need \( this is a strong argument , in my view , for many safetynet policies for the indigent \) but when money becomes an end in itself , it can bring misery , too for decades , psychologists have been compiling a vast literature on the relationships between different aspirations and wellbeing whether they examine young adults or people of all ages , the bulk of the studies point toward the same important conclusion people who rate materialistic goals like wealth as top personal priorities are significantly likelier to be more anxious , more depressed and more frequent drug users , and even to have more physical ailments than those who set their sights on more intrinsic values no one sums up the moral snares of materialism more famously than st paul in his first letter to timothy for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after , they have erred from the faith , and pierced themselves through with many sorrows or as the dalai lama pithily suggests , it is better to want what you have than to have what you want so fame and money are out how about pleasures of the flesh \? take the canonical hedonistic pleasure lust from hollywood to college campuses , many assume that sex is always great , and sexual variety is even better this assumption actually has a name the coolidge effect , named after the 30th president of the united states the story \( probably apocryphal \) begins with silent cal and mrs coolidge touring a poultry farm the first lady noticed that there were very few roosters , and asked how so many eggs could be fertilized the farmer told her that the virile roosters did their jobs over and over again each day perhaps you could point that out to mr coolidge , she told him the president , hearing the remark , asked whether the rooster serviced the same hen each time no , the farmer told him there were many hens for each rooster perhaps you could point that out to mrs coolidge , said the president the president obviously figured these must be happy roosters and notwithstanding the moral implications , the same principle should work for us right \? wrong in 2004 , looked into whether more sexual variety led to greater wellbeing they looked at data from about 16 , 000 adult americans who were asked confidentially how many sex partners they had had in the preceding year , and about their happiness across men and women alike , the data show that the optimal number of partners is one this might seem totally counterintuitive after all , we are unambiguously driven to accumulate material goods , to seek fame , to look for pleasure how can it be that these very things can give us unhappiness instead of happiness \? there are two explanations , one biological and the other philosophical from an evolutionary perspective , it makes sense that we are wired to seek fame , wealth and sexual variety these things make us more likely to pass on our dna had your caveman ancestors not acquired some version of these things \( a fine reputation for being a great rock sharpener multiple animal skins \) , they might not have found enough mating partners to create your lineage but here s where the evolutionary cables have crossed we assume that things we are attracted to will relieve our suffering and raise our happiness my brain says , get famous it also says , unhappiness is lousy i conflate the two , getting , get famous and you 'll be less unhappy but that is mother nature s cruel hoax she does n't really care either way whether you are unhappy she just wants you to want to pass on your genetic material if you conflate intergenerational survival with wellbeing , that s your problem , not nature s and matters are hardly helped by nature s useful idiots in society , who propagate a popular piece of liferuining advice if it feels good , do it unless you share the same existential goals as protozoa , this is often flatout wrong more philosophically , the problem stems from dissatisfaction the sense that nothing has full flavor , and we want more we ca n't quite pin down what it is that we seek without a great deal of reflection and spiritual hard work , the likely candidates seem to be material things , physical pleasures or favor among friends and strangers we look for these things to fill an inner emptiness they may bring a brief satisfaction , but it never lasts , and it is never enough and so we crave more this paradox has a word in sanskrit upadana , which refers to the cycle of craving and grasping as the dhammapada \( the buddha s path of wisdom \) puts it the craving of one given to heedless living grows like a creeper like the monkey seeking fruits in the forest , he leaps from life to life whoever is overcome by this wretched and sticky craving , his sorrows grow like grass after the rains this search for fame , the lust for material things and the objectification of others that is , the cycle of grasping and craving follows a formula that is elegant , simple and deadly love things , use people this was abd alrahman s formula as he sleepwalked through life it is the worldly snake oil peddled by the culture makers from hollywood to madison avenue but you know in your heart that it is morally disordered and a likely road to misery you want to be free of the sticky cravings of unhappiness and find a formula for happiness instead how \? simply invert the deadly formula and render it virtuous love people , use things easier said than done , i realize it requires the courage to repudiate pride and the strength to love others family , friends , colleagues , acquaintances , god and even strangers and enemies only deny love to things that actually are objects the practice that achieves this is charity few things are as liberating as giving away to others that which we hold dear this also requires a condemnation of materialism this is manifestly not an argument for any specific economic system anyone who has spent time in a socialist country must concede that materialism and selfishness are as bad under collectivism , or worse , as when markets are free no political ideology is immune to materialism finally , it requires a deep skepticism of our own basic desires of course you are driven to seek admiration , splendor and physical license but giving in to these impulses will bring unhappiness you have a responsibility to yourself to stay in the battle the day you declare a truce is the day you become unhappier declaring war on these destructive impulses is not about asceticism or puritanism it is about being a prudent person who seeks to avoid unnecessary suffering abd alrahman never got his happiness sums right he never knew the right formula fortunately , we do
shortly after the first group of finished batting practice , manager matt williams casually asked outfielder bryce harper if he was feeling well harper nodded and continued running into the dugout williams s inquiry , as informal as it was , was one of several measures the nationals took wednesday to ensure that harper , their budding superstar , was not experiencing concussionlike symptoms after he was kneed in the head while sliding into second base in the second inning of monday s season opener after passing every test , harper was back in the lineup harper struck out twice in four atbats in the nationals' 51 win over the mets , but he looked impressive throwing out ruben tejada , who was trying to score on juan lagares s double , at home in the fifth inning after the game , williams said , he proved today that he s good to go harper did not want to speak although harper was cleared to return monday after being examined by a mets physician between innings , concussion symptoms often do not manifest themselves for 24 to 48 hours harper was examined again after the game monday , but he was not tested on tuesday s day off after monday s game , harper told reporters that he had a headache , but none of the cloudiness and dizziness often associated with concussions on wednesday , as part of the nationals' concussion protocol , harper was evaluated by team trainers after he had indoor batting practice he was examined again after he had batting practice outside once cleared , harper was allowed to stay in the lineup , where he batted sixth he said he slept great last night , williams said as of the time he got here today , he has no issue with nausea or dizziness or anything like that it certainly did not appear as if harper was feeling any concussion symptoms when he walked into the clubhouse bobbing his head while wearing headphones he declined to speak with reporters because he was scheduled to undergo the exams , but he did say he was feeling great when approached in the dugout his batting practice performance was almost enough to convince doubters during one stretch , harper launched a shot into the tarp past the centerfield wall , and on the next pitch he hit a ball into the mets' bullpen while the perception might be that harper was rushed back into the game monday the initial exam lasted just six minutes several players said they believed that major league baseball , with the measures it requires to get a player back on the field after a violent head collision , is doing an adequate job of protecting them against longterm brain injuries it shows major league baseball is taking the safety of their players very seriously , said nationals outfielder denard span , who played in just 70 games in 2011 because of a concussion that s what it s all about we play this game very hard and we want to do the best we can and win championships and win titles and all that stuff , but at the end of the day life is bigger than baseball and all of us have families and we want to live life after baseball drew storen , the nationals' closer and player representative , said with all the problems the nfl has had , there s definitely awareness for it now i feel that players and teams are erring on the side of doing the right thing because obviously there s pretty significant health consequences that can come from that ultimately , span said , teams must rely on players to be honest about their injuries , and players must get past the stigma of perceived weakness should they decide to sit out a game that s just the perception of sports in general if you do n't see blood , if you do n't see a broken bone , then the average person or average peer thinks you should go out there and play , span said you just have to trust yourself

audiences , like french presidents , ca n't always be trusted american idol is learning the lesson that val rie trierweiler , the recently discarded first consort of france , was dealt when president fran ois hollande turned out to have a younger mistress american idol still has good bones particularly with this season s cosmetic tweaks , this fox show looks rosily well preserved and perhaps even better than last year and the one before but it still ca n't really compete with the other , younger singing competition the voice , the hit nbc show that begins a sixth season in february , is a knockoff with some moves that lured away many idol fans it could be chemistry , but usually it s just math seniority is n't much of a turnon when something new comes along the heart wants what the heart does n't already have american idol now holds itself up as a national treasure in need of respect and customer loyalty , like the smithsonian or pbs the first episode opened with what looked like a political campaign ad young wouldbe contestants held up signs about their dream in a morninginamerica montage farmers in cornfields , welders , fishermen the show calls itself iconic and takes its mandate so seriously that some promos include a clip of the usually laidback judge harry connick jr scolding a purposefully bad contestant who , as he puts it , disrespected the process there is something almost valiant about american idol and its bid to stay relevant , or at least boost its ratings in its 13th season the cast has changed again ryan seacrest is still the host , but none of the original three judges are still there , and the current ones mr connick keith urban , a judge last season and jennifer lopez , a judge in two previous seasons are appealing celebrities and genuine pop music stars they banter gently with one another but are kind to contestants yet even with more likable stars , american idol is feeling its age beginning in 2002 , idol captured the national imagination as a saucy upstart , a cheerfully vulgar show that allowed nobodies to seek instant stardom at the small cost of ridicule from simon cowell , one of the original judges and a creator of the series for years , freakishly bad performances were part of the package at its peak , american idol was the nation s most watched series the season 4 finale drew a record 38 million viewers this season , the jan 15 premiere attracted 152 million viewers , down 16 percent from 179 million last winter , and the ratings have been slipping downward since then the tryouts this year are more streamlined some auditions are edited into medleys of three , a few contestants' back stories \( heartwarming \) are woven right into their audition bad performances are cut mercifully short , losers and weirdos are spared humiliation there are new features , including a metal isolation booth in which candidates wait , on camera , for the green light to flash but even with all the renovations , idol tryouts seem antiquated next to the 3d auditions on the voice , where judges have their chairs turned backward , so they hear the voice before they see the physique the judges then compete among themselves to see who will slam the buzzer first on a good prospect , and then they compete again by wooing a winning performer to their teams that conceit , which adds a bit of comeuppance to celebrity , may suit today s more populist mood compared with that show s dizzying pinball antics , idol auditions seem like a game of mahjongg and idol is n't hiding its gray hairs it s hard not to look your age when so many contenders say that they 've been watching the show since they were babies one of them , tristen langley , 15 , is the son of a finalist from season 1 , nikki mckibbin \( she came with him to his audition , and , pageant mom style , mouthed the words as he sang \) the judges this season play into the generation gap mr connick , 46 , winced gamely when a young singer said ms lopez was her idol , then assured him that he , too , was a star my mother loves you , is how she put it mr connick seems to enjoy the codger role , expressing shock at a teenager who has a treble clef tattoo \( adam levine , one of the judges on the voice , has arms so ink mottled , he looks as if he is wearing an oriental rug \) when it was time to vote , mr connick playfully said to the boy , i'm going to say no to the tattoo , but yes to you mr connick at least tries to enliven the show , making fun of himself and teasing his costars , but it s a tough haul mr urban is handsome and good humored but not particularly charismatic ms lopez looks radiant , but she has surprisingly little pizazz she presides regally over the auditions but is otherwise as sweet and insipid as a disney princess american idol is n't what it used to be , of course that kind of success ca n't last forever it is still a wellmade show with a large , mixedage audience it may not be the most exciting competition on the air , but to its credit it is not trying to squeeze into tighter jeans and imitate younger , newer shows like many a woman of a certain age , idol is trying to find a more dignified posture now that the bloom of youth has faded
kabul , afghanistan with billions of dollars in american aid increasingly flowing straight into afghan government coffers , the united states hired two global auditing firms three years ago to determine whether afghanistan could be trusted to safeguard the money the findings were so dire that american officials fought to keep them private but the money has continued to flow , despite warnings from the auditors that none of the 16 afghan ministries could be counted on to keep the funds from being stolen or wasted the problems unearthed by the auditors are detailed in a report to be published thursday by the , an american government watchdog the findings raise new questions about the efficacy and wisdom of giving huge amounts of aid directly to a government known for corruption the inspector general s report is likely to increase tensions with president hamid karzai , who has bristled for years at what he says is an orchestrated campaign by president obama s administration to undermine his government with embarrassing revelations and leaks american officials have little affection for mr karzai these days , and the deteriorating relationship between the countries has already affected the flow of aid congress cut the budget for development aid in afghanistan roughly in half , to about 112 billion , in the current fiscal year that step was in part a rebuke of mr karzai s increasingly vitriolic statements about the united states , and his refusal to sign a longterm security agreement that american and afghan negotiators put together last fall aid from western countries pays most of the afghan government s expenses the united states' contribution is by far the largest , and washington has pushed in recent years to route more of it directly to the afghan government and less through programs managed by american officials the direct assistance , which now accounts for about half of all american aid to the government , was a centerpiece of the obama administration s strategy to build a credible national government that could capitalize on the battlefield gains made by the surge of american forces in 2009 and 2010 just as the surge yielded military gains against the taliban that have proved to be transient , the efforts to transform the afghan government have been undercut by the corruption that pervades mr karzai s administration , as illustrated in the audits and the internal american risk assessments they engendered for instance , 2365 million earmarked for the afghan ministry of public health was in danger of misappropriation arising from payment of salaries in cash , according to a united states agency for international development risk assessment cited by the inspector general the afghan mines ministry could be paying higher prices for commodities and services to finance kickbacks and bribes , another assessment based on the audits said john f sopko , the special inspector general , who is known for , called the strategy of delivering more direct assistance the biggest gamble with taxpayer money that usaid has ever made his report , provided to the new york times ahead of its public release , acknowledged that the aid agency was simply following a policy set by senior officials in the obama administration , and that direct aid payments to the afghan government would probably continue no matter what problems were found his chief recommendation was that the agency apply more pressure on afghan ministries to clean up their operations the agency , which has grown accustomed to harsh reports on its work in afghanistan from the inspector general , characterized the latest report as one with lots of smoke but no fire the agency said that despite all the warnings about risks , the report outlined no specific instances of fraud as this audit does not examine the implementation of usaid direct assistance programs , we do not believe this report has any basis on which to question whether the identified vulnerabilities have been addressed prior to funds being made available , donald l sampler jr , the assistant to the administrator for afghanistan and pakistan at the agency , wrote in a letter responding to the report the agency also said it had taken steps to forestall fraud and would continue to do so as an example , it cited the routing of money to each ministry s separate account at the afghan central bank with the american aid funds isolated from each ministry s general account , american officials can keep closer tabs on how the money is spent american officials have earmarked 896 million in assistance to date that they want to deliver directly to afghan ministries but because of the waste and corruption issues , they have disbursed only 2017 million of that we did n't say , we 'll give you 50 percent , come hell or high water , ' said s ken yamashita , a usaid veteran who coordinates aid spending at the american embassy in kabul we never said , we will give you 50 percent even if you do n't have the right systems in place' we said we will work towards that , in a way that is reasonable american officials are displeased with the release of the inspector general s report , saying it is likely to infuriate the afghan officials who allowed the auditors from the two auditing firms , kpmg and ernst young , to examine their operations the release will probably lead to reduced cooperation from the afghan government , and could undermine our ability to conduct proper oversight of direct assistance programs in the future , the aid agency warned the inspector general in a letter it implored the inspector general to not make this sensitive material available to the public the inspector general disagreed , arguing that the public s right to know outweighed the need for secrecy the report accuses the agency and the state department of not being forthright with congress , saying that while the risk assessments were shared with congressional staff members , related information that detailed the most troubling aspects of the program was not , including assessments that afghan agencies had taken less than 10 percent of the measures they could have taken to reduce the risk that aid money would be lost to afghan mismanagement or corruption since becoming inspector general in 2012 , mr sopko has often argued that the public s right to know about problems with american spending in afghanistan , actual or potential , is paramount , and that it trumps the need for confidentiality except in cases involving classified information it is a line of argument that has among the american officials who deal with afghanistan , many of whom believe that his work is now undermining their own they say that the inspector general s team rarely takes into account all of the facts , and that some of the audits are more concerned with the potential for waste or fraud than with documenting actual instances of either
paris the three young frenchmen were arrested as they tried to make their way to syria to wage jihad they had not harmed anyone in france or made plans to do so , according to the evidence at their trial in january , but in france these days , seeking to fight in syria is enough to bring a charge of plotting terrorism and in this case in prison france , and much of europe , have grown steadily more concerned over the past year about the possibility that the main terrorist threat could come from their own citizens , european passport holders who can move relatively easily between their homelands and the battlefields of syria , where islamist rebel groups are fighting the government of president bashar alassad in that climate , france is becoming especially aggressive by arresting wouldbe jihadis even before they leave the country or set foot on a battlefield france s fears came to the fore on sunday when officials announced the in the killings of three people at the jewish museum in brussels last month , a 29yearold frenchman said to have spent time in syria last year on monday , the french authorities said they had arrested four men they described as jihadi recruiters operating in the paris region and in the south of france and one french citizen living near brussels , the latest in a string of cases intended to disrupt the flow of french citizens , usually young men of north african and arab descent , to syria interior minister bernard cazeneuve said monday that he and justice minister christiane taubira would seek to pass legislation to expand the legal grounds for arrest and prosecution in cases involving plans for terrorist acts , but no violence manuel valls , the french prime minister , said in january while serving as interior minister that the threat of jihadis returning home to europe represents for me , without a doubt , the greatest danger that we must face in the coming years it s a phenomenon of unprecedented size , mr valls said adding to the growing concern , united states officials said last week that for the first time linked to al qaeda had carried out a suicide bombing , having traveled from florida to wage jihad france s use of a preemptive strategy is being watched closely by other governments , many of them brushing aside concerns about civil liberties to employ their own techniques to reduce what they consider a substantial risk to their national security all of them are mindful of similar terrorist threats not least because the number of foreign fighters flocking to syria is on course to exceed even that of those who waged the antisoviet jihad in afghanistan , and this time even more europeans are involved of the 11 , 000 foreign fighters estimated to be in syria , as many as 2 , 000 are from europe , including 400 to 500 from france , said peter neumann , who runs the international center for the study of radicalization at king s college london , citing figures from several months ago that could be higher now on sunday , president fran ois hollande said about 700 residents of france were fighting or had fought in syria france and britain have begun to try to use family members as an early warning system to alert authorities when they see signs of a loved one becoming radicalized britain has begun a program to detain those who have gone to syria on their return , charging many of them with terrorism offenses before the suspects have taken any overt action this year bosnia put in place a 10year prison sentence for anyone convicted of trying to fight in a foreign war , a measure clearly aimed at syria on friday , the authorities arrested six men in the spanish enclave of melilla in north africa , charging them with recruiting jihadis to travel to syria france moved earlier and more aggressively than many other nations , in part because of the 2012 case of the terrorist mohammed merah mr merah , a french muslim who had trained in afghanistan , returned to his home city , toulouse , and killed three french soldiers , three jewish children and a rabbi who was the father of two of the children we always had this worry , said ludovic lestel , a government prosecutor in paris , referring to the phenomenon of islamic extremists trained abroad who return and strike their home countries but the mohammed merah case proved that a single person could go with a jihadi group to train himself and come back to perpetrate an attack in france , mr lestel said before the most recent spate of arrests , including that of mehdi nemmouche , the frenchman arrested in connection with the killings in brussels , there were more than 50 terrorismrelated cases at various stages in the paris courts , which handle all terrorism cases regardless of where the people are apprehended , mr lestel said a number of french defense lawyers say they are concerned that the trend toward intervening early to head off any jihadi threat raises civil liberties issues we 've created laws that are very powerful , said pierre de combles de nayves , a paris lawyer who has represented 10 to 15 clients charged under the terrorism laws in france , one now punishes before the attacks , he said , noting that those who leave for syria have not actually harmed anyone in france what have they done in france \? in france all they have done is to purchase a ticket it is impossible to foresee who will leave for the purpose of carrying out terrorism , mr de combles de nayves said mr lestel and thomas fiquet , another prosecutor in paris who specializes in terrorism cases , say the authorities based their preemptive arrests on intelligence about suspects' intentions in the case of the three men tried in january , they were arrested as they prepared to board a flight in st tienne , in central france , headed for gaziantep , a city in eastern turkey they were going to buy military and paramilitary equipment they were trying to obtain a weapon and to train themselves at the use of explosive devices they were looking for a destination linked with jihad , mr lestel said during the trial , prosecutors described how in conversations that were wiretapped by the security services , the three men referred to the trip to syria as their vacation plans at one point , one suspect , youssef ettaoujar , who appeared to be the leader , said to one of the others that there was no need to bring weapons because they provide them , apparently referring to the groups of fighters in syria in addition to the strengthened terrorism laws , the french are working to diminish departures by creating a website to help parents and relatives learn about the signs of radicalization the government has also set up a phone number that relatives and friends can use to reach social workers or psychologists to discuss worrying behavior they can also use the number to reach the police and border authorities to alert them to a relative s radicalization none of these measures , however , appear to have significantly stanched the flow of wouldbe fighters to syria many european jihadis come from communities where youth unemployment is high a 15yearold and a 16yearold from toulouse , largely radicalized on the internet , stole their parents' credit cards and bought airplane tickets to turkey , and one managed to cross into syria before deciding to come home a 15yearold girl named zo , who is from a secularized muslim family , was unhappy and alienated in school , but she became enamored of the jihad narratives on islamic social networks and went to syria to marry a fighter , said yassine yakhouti , a defense lawyer who is familiar with her case as for the three men who went to trial in january , one seemed to be committed to the more extreme islamic ideas associated with al qaeda the other two worked in lowpaying jobs , one as a host in a store on the champs lys es and the other delivering pizza , and they appeared to be seeking direction in their lives one of them , fares farsi , now 22 , said in court that he was unsure about the whole project my parents were getting divorced at the time , mr farsi said for my father , i was a troublesome element of the family , he said i was going through a period of selfradicalization i was very easily influenced i had doubts about carrying those weapons there was no doubt , however , about the sentence he received three years
let me be clear i do not believe that nazi war criminals should get social security benefits i don t care if they earned those benefits , whether they snuck into this country or were among the nazis invited to the united states after world war 2 nazi war criminals don t deserve taxpayer help for their retirement that said , the crowing this week by some members of congress over the house s passage of a bill denying social security benefits to nazis was ridiculous this is what our elected leaders are doing \? at a time when congress is ignoring immigration reform , stumbling and bumbling over a whole pack of wars , threatening to shut down the government once again , failing to provide adequate living wages to working americans and adequate unemployment benefits to nonworking americans , letting the bridges and highways fall apart , and so many other things \? the nazi bill is a political freebie passing it does not constitute a real achievement or a profile in courage the issue is , at best , trivial the associated press , whose investigation prompted this action , reported in october that dozens of suspected war criminals and ss guards got social security benefits after leaving the united states under a deal they made with the justice department to avoid prosecution or forced deportation of those nonagenarian fiends , the ap said in october , there are at least four living beneficiaries the small number does not mean , once again , that the payments were acceptable the ap said that millions went to these people over the years but none of that excuses the gas bagging by the democratic cosponsor of the bill , representative xavier becerra of california , on tuesday the perpetrators of the holocaust have no place in the united states of america and under no circumstances should they have access to our crown jewel , social security , he added , leaving out other contenders for crown jewel , like the constitution congress is taking swift action to ensure that these heinous war criminals can no longer exploit a loophole to receive benefits , mr becerra said this vote shows that congress can and will continue to protect the hardearned social security benefits that millions of americans rely on how , exactly , do the payments to at least four undeserving people jeopardize benefits for those millions \?
white house aides at times gave blunt assessments of some of the other political actors they were dealing with a case in point bruce reed , then mr clinton s domestic policy adviser \( and until recently chief of staff to vice president joseph r biden jr \) , sent a memo to david shipley , then a speechwriter , about a talk the president would give mentioning welfare in alabama the state has a retrograde governor who s not exactly famous for common sense or compassion , mr reed wrote \( the governor at the time was fob james \) other aides were also free with their views in two different memos to hillary rodham clinton , chris jennings , a health care adviser , summed up some of the characters she would encounter representative pete stark , democrat of california a fierce advocate who wins more than his share of victories but as a result is probably one of the more disliked members in the congress representative henry a waxman , democrat of california has tremendous respect among consumer interest groups but is not well liked at the state level representative jim cooper , democrat of tennessee increasingly concerned that his viewpoints are being ignored and could be a problem , particularly in the press , if we don t get him to at least feel we are considering his opinions representative sander m levin , democrat of michigan his appetite for meetings can never be satiated , and he may be mad that we are not holding one this week representative norman y mineta , democrat of california very upset that there has been no meeting with the asian pacific members of the congress , and so a mollifying call is probably advisable and , of course , there was newt gingrich , the republican speaker who was mr clinton s principal adversary on capitol hill for much of his presidency at one point in 1995 , the two were scheduled to address the same newspaper forum in dallas paul begala , an adviser to mr clinton , sent a memo to white house aides urging that mr clinton use the opportunity to put mr gingrich in his place gingrich s ratings continue to plummet , mr begala wrote at this pace he ll pass baseball owners in the race to the bottom  peter baker mrs clinton had a contentious relationship with the white house press corps during her husband s first term and felt uncomfortable with washington political reporters , according to memos written by her advisers that were released on friday hillary is comfortable with the local reporters and enjoys speaking with them , wrote lisa caputo , mrs clinton s spokeswoman this will help us get around her aversion to the national washington media and serve to counter the tone of the national media ms caputo pointed to the media strategy employed during the 1992 campaign i think it is important for us to consider returning to our 1992 campaign press strategy and have her do local interviews in the local markets , ms caputo wrote good local press will develop into a ripple effect which will begin to influence the coverage of the national newspapers the memos reveal the consistent struggle of mrs clinton s aides to help the first lady express the warm , funny , maternal side of her personality to the press in the white house , that meant a focus on soft magazine articles and discussions with small , influential groups hillary should own the women s media , ms caputo said that included interviews with people magazine and barbara walters , and events like hosting a hillary clinton fan club visit at the white house with fawning first lady watchers from across the world the memo discusses the clintons 20th wedding anniversary , including a big party and a wonderful photo spread to people magazine of photos from the party couple with old photos of their honeymoon notes about press strategy during the clinton years highlight the rapid change in the media landscape ms caputo informs mrs clinton that the internet has become a very popular mode of communication but beyond the mainstream media , mrs clinton s advisers suggested she sit down for offtherecord dinners with opinion makers in new york sidney blumenthal , a clinton adviser and former new yorker writer , had volunteered to arrange the dinners with intellectuals and elites , including victor s navasky , then editor of the nation magazine , who are not the mainstream new york media , but rather those people whom the new york times respects intellectually ms caputo also recommended that mrs clinton s closest aides , including melanne verveer , ann stock , ann lewis and lissa muscatine , have relaxed meals with members of the white house press corps we can all tell wonderful hillary anecdotes that humanize her and show the press the good person that she is , ms caputo wrote i believe if we were all out there consistently , we would erode the notion in the press that sometimes exists of hillary being in a bunker mentality  amy chozick the documents illustrate that mrs clinton had hoped that her beijing speech would manifest into a quintessential moment that would cement her feminist credentials in a 1995 memo that lays out the proposed media strategy for beijing , lisa caputo , her spokeswoman , says the goal of the trip is to underscore mrs clinton s longstanding work and advocacy on behalf of women , families and children the memo also highlights a communications challenge mrs clinton continues to face as she seeks to define her tenure at the state department her focus on improving the lives of women and girls , her aides consistently remind reporters , has deeper national security and geopolitical implications it s important to stress the interconnection between these issues , ms caputo wrote if women flourish , families flourish , economies flourish and therefore communities and societies are healthy , strong and flourishing part of the media plan included an interview with dan rather this will help to reinforce our message that women s issues are not soft issues , ms caputo wrote the press strategy also included an interview with the los angeles times because california is an important state for us politically and the paper understands pacific rim politics mrs clinton was also instructed to recycle portions of your speeches in china and your speech to the denver women s economic forum into an oped for usa today  amy chozick one thing was clear from the clinton memos anything that had to do with health care was run by hillary clinton for approval case in point in an april 7 , 1993 , memo proposing the creation of a war room to handle communications about the fight for a health care bill , meeghan prunty suggested that the appropriate people be consulted next steps float this idea to everyone who needs to approve it \( ira , hrc \? , all people who we would expect to provide staff be staff , mandy paul stan \? , etc \)  michael d shear mrs clinton has made her speech at the united nations fourth world congress on women in beijing a central part of her poststate department charitable efforts in the leadup to the 20th anniversary of her 1995 speech , she recently introduced a no ceilings initiative at the bill , hillary chelsea clinton foundation that will use data to track and measure the progress of women and girls since the speech nearly every time she speaks publicly now , mrs clinton refers to the moment in beijing when she declared that women s rights are human rights , and human rights are women s rights the documents released friday reveal the planning and strategy behind mrs clinton s beijing speech and put her work on women s issues at the state department and beyond into a broader context that dated back to her early years in the white house our overall message will be one that focuses on women as agents of change , as active and full participants in their societies , meeting the challenges of today and those that will have to be met in the years to come , mrs clinton said  she reached out to private corporations to sponsor the beijing meeting and the events around it in the type of publicprivate partnership that became the centerpiece of her husband s postpresidential philanthropic work how much money do you need from the private sector and why have you waited until the first of july to try to get it , only a few months before the conference \? one potential donor asked  mrs clinton blamed state department bureaucracy for the late plea for 900 , 000 the process was very bizarre , she told executives from self magazine and lady foot locker , among others involved in the events leading up to the speech we had an enormous amount of difficulty getting clearance to do this for reasons that i do not fully understand , mrs clinton said as secretary of state , mrs clinton made relations with china and the asia pacific region central to her mission a task that some critics say has been dropped since she left the administration but , in 1995 , she had harsh words for the chinese this conference is being held in a country that practices infanticide , she said there are some very real tensions that are going to surface at this conference but she said there was also hostility in congress over her speaking at the conference there is hostility in our own country toward this congress , she said  amy chozick many of the documents from the health care debates of 1993 sound similar to today s battles over the affordable care act i m not going to underestimate the political battle that will ensue because of this , mrs clinton said in a september 1993 meeting on capitol hill with democratic leaders she fielded lawmakers concerns over her proposed health care overhaul and recognized that it needed to be done before the midterm elections if we don t get this done by the close of business next year , if this isn t signed , sealed and delivered by election day 1994 , i think we can forget about us doing very well in the election , mrs clinton said the remarks almost foreshadow the challenges democrats currently face in midterm elections over the obama administration s unpopular health care overhaul lawmakers expressed worries that the plan would not reach the poorest people in need of insurance coverage i m much more concerned about the unsophisticated people , congressional district by congressional district , one democratic member of congress said i d much rather have rankandfile people feel comfortable about this from the start than every ceo in america in 1994 , democrats ended up being penalized by voters in part because of their ugly failure to pass a health care overhaul now , republicans for a third election cycle \( after 2010 and 2012 \) are attacking democrats for what is actually in law there are signs that mrs clinton did underestimate the pushback her plan would face from insurance companies we anticipate having some allies and having some opposition from the insurance industry , she told the senate labor committee the insurance industry , meanwhile , had geared up its 14 million harry and louise tv advertising campaign to turn public opinion against mrs clinton s planned health care overhaul  amy chozick it s hard to imagine hillary clinton , who just served four years as secretary of state , as a neophyte when it comes to foreign policy but in 1995 , that is what she was on may 2 of that year , strobe talbott , then the deputy secretary of state , wrote mrs clinton , the first lady , a letter thanking her for agreeing to participate in an interview on moscow s radio nadezhda in the letter , mr talbott praised mrs clinton , saying that it s a terrific idea part of the president s purpose in going to moscow is to reach out to the russian people , he wrote he also added that i have asked my executive assistant , victoria nuland , for her thoughts on the best approach nearly 20 years later , ms nuland is assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs at the state department the 1995 letter from mr talbott goes on for two pages as he tries to describe the geopolitical situation in russia for mrs clinton the basic point to stress is that russians are exceedingly id even say increasingly concerned about security and stability , mr talbott said your message should be that we admire what they have already done and we support them in what they are trying to do  michael d shear a 1999 memo from chris jennings , a health care adviser to president clinton , is an eerie echo of the accusations that republicans today lodge against president obama for misleading the public that they could keep their health care plans in an email to jeffrey shesol , one of mr clinton s speechwriters , mr jennings offered advice on some parts of a speech related to medicare then he offered an aside one more thing , which i know you can do little to nothing about the president keeps claiming that prescription drug coverage will save money over the longrun while there are definitely individual cases where this is true , in aggregate , any new drug benefit will require significant new investments for both the short and long term he ended the email with oh well cj mr jennings returned to the white house briefly last year to help president obama roll out the healthcaregov website  michael d shear the section on hillary rodham clinton on microcredit and microdevelopment was a jumble of documents from the mid1990s , some of them out of order , that generally discussed administration efforts within international bodies to promote efforts to provide small loans for women in developing nations to start small businesses memos from staff members discussed planning for international conferences , including the 1995 world conference on women in beijing nothing suggested the sort of globally provocative remarks that mrs clinton would make in beijing in which she declared that women s rights are human rights and took issue with china s onechildonly policy and dowry deaths in a jan 2 , 1997 , memo , the president s national security council advisers told mrs clinton s staff that the first lady , not president clinton , should attend an international microcredit summit in washington since his participation would raise expectations of attendees for more united states aid toward microloan programs \( and because the host organization was unpredictable \) a may 1995 staff memo listed american right to life groups accredited for a united nations women s conference , including catholic organizations and wellknown antiabortion groups like eagle forum while saying little about the groups on the list , and nothing judgmental , the memo cautioned recipients do not distribute it outside the building  jackie calmes in 1994 , after news organizations reported on abuses of foreign workers , sweatshop conditions and low wages in the northern mariana islands , a united states territory in the western pacific , the clinton administration threatened a federal crackdown a mid1970s covenant with the united states exempted the territory from federal labor and immigration laws , and it had become a major garment manufacturing hub , with workers flocking to it from china , korea and thailand in the 1980s and 1990s the documents include reports and background on the situation in the territory , as well as drafts of a letter bill clinton wrote to froilan c tenorio , governor of the island , dated may 30 , 1997 in the letter , mr clinton said , i am writing now out of concern about certain labor practices in the islands that are inconsistent with our country s values the letter said that federal officials had for years urged the territory s officials to correct the problems , but that the problems had persisted i have , therefore , concluded that federal immigration , naturalization and minimum wage laws should be applied to the commonwealth , as provided by the covenant , mr clinton wrote he added that he would work with congress to amend the covenant several bills were later introduced in congress to curb worker exploitation , but ultimately none were passed into law during the bush administration , a law was passed that required the territory to raise its minimum wage yearly until it reached the federal minimum wage it is currently 555 an hour , with the next increase set for 2015  kitty bennett according to a list of topics , the papers being released on friday concern muchdiscussed areas like mrs clinton s health care task force and the clinton administration s response to early attacks by al qaeda there are also topics that rarely excite partisans , like the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands , the united states information agency and mrs clinton s efforts as first lady to encourage microcredit investment in third world countries the documents are the first batch of a larger set of papers withheld until now under exceptions to public disclosure requirements in federal law , exceptions that expired a year ago as mrs clinton prepares for a possible second campaign for the presidency in 2016 , friends and foes alike will pore over the documents for information that elaborates on her actions as first lady before she became a senator and then secretary of state recent reports on the oncesecret papers of a friend of mrs clinton s who died in 2000 , diane d blair , have heightened interest in that period , and in the current supercharged political environment even small revelations can become magnified or provide fodder for political debate  peter baker
london angered and dismayed by the downing of a malaysian airliner over ukraine , european leaders cast about for some form of joint response to the tragedy on friday but beyond calls for an international inquiry , they showed few signs of immediately following the united states in imposing harsher sanctions on russia with sentiments ranging from shock to fury , political leaders across the globe urged a rapid , independent and international effort to investigate the crash , which killed 298 people and provoked accusations and counteraccusations about who brought the plane down speaking to reporters in berlin , chancellor angela merkel of germany , which has close economic ties with moscow , said there were many indications that the malaysian airliner was shot down the ukrainian government and its promoscow separatist foes in eastern ukraine , where the plane crashed , have blamed each other for bringing it down american and ukrainian officials say the jetliner was brought down by a russianmade antiaircraft missile but ms merkel declined to answer repeated questions about whether she would support tougher sanctions against president vladimir v putin of russia , beyond the more limited measures to which the european union has already agreed the united states imposed a new and tougher round of sanctions on russian companies and business executives on wednesday before the downing of the airliner on thursday rather , ms merkel suggested that the best solution lay in ending the conflict russia s responsibility is clear , she said on friday , calling on mr putin and his government to do their part to find ways to reach a permanent ceasefire it will be a difficult path , but there is no alternative to a political solution , the chancellor told reporters at her annual summer news conference with the berlin press corps , ms merkel suggested indirectly that france should halt its military exports to russia , noting that germany had stopped its military cooperation with russia this year we have not introduced any export limits to specific sectors on the european side , so i cannot say anything at this time , she told reporters in berlin the legal situation allows for such exports ms merkel went on to point out that germany had put on ice a joint exercise with russia that was our response to the situation at the moment , she said officials in brussels said it was possible that the european union would set a deadline to list additional russian oligarchs and companies as part of a toughened european sanctions policy announced this week but the bloc was likely to remain deeply divided between those member states ready to confront moscow and those that are reluctant , the officials said the formal deadline for the european listings is the end of this month , but they might now be published on tuesday or shortly afterward the officials , who spoke on the condition of anonymity under the bloc s protocols , said it was also possible that european leaders would hold a previously unscheduled summit next week at that gathering , they might discuss questions about whether france should freeze weapons sales to russia and whether to send military aid to ukraine in the meantime , investigators will seek to determine whether the jetliner was struck by a russiansupplied surfacetoair missile , as ukrainian officials have insisted the europeans would require a high burden of proof about russian complicity before taking measures that would strike at mr putin s inner circle , the officials said , particularly those involved in the russian energy supplies on which many european economies depend for his part , mr putin called on friday for a thorough and unbiased inquiry into the disaster he also spoke with the dutch prime minister , mark rutte , who broke off a vacation after learning that a majority of those who died in the crash were dutch the netherlands has declared a national day of mourning for the 154 dutch citizens reported killed in a telephone conversation with mr rutte , the russian leader underlined that the tragedy yet again highlighted the need for the swiftest peaceful solution to the acute crisis in ukraine , the kremlin said in a statement , echoing earlier russian comments about the bloody conflict in eastern ukraine , during which promoscow separatists have recently claimed to have shot down ukrainian military transport planes later on friday , mr putin attended a religious ceremony at the trinity lavra of st sergius , a monastery north of moscow , as scheduled he spoke briefly about the historical importance of the russian orthodox faith , but made no reference to current events in ukraine in britain , prime minister david cameron summoned a meeting of the highlevel crisis response committee known as cobra , which debates matters of national security nine britons were reported to be among the dead from flight 17 the committee takes its name from the location of its meetings in cabinet office briefing room a if , as seems possible , this was brought down , then those responsible must be brought to account , and we must lose no time in doing that , mr cameron said after the meeting it is an absolutely shocking incident and cannot be allowed to stand the harshest public criticism came from prime minister tony abbott of australia , who said that the russian response to the crash was deeply , deeply unsatisfactory the dead were reported to have included 28 australians the russian ambassador to australia had met earlier with the foreign minister , julie bishop the initial response of the russian ambassador was to blame ukraine for this , and i have to say that is deeply , deeply unsatisfactory , mr abbott said , adding that the idea that russia can somehow say that none of this has anything to do with them because it happened in ukrainian airspace frankly does not stand up to any serious scrutiny this looks less like an accident than a crime , he said , and if so , the perpetrators must be brought to justice in france , officials said they were still trying to determine whether any french citizens had been on the flight initially , the foreign minister , laurent fabius , said there had been at least four french passengers , but then said it was unclear britain has submitted a united nations resolution calling for an international investigation into the crash a proposal was expected to be discussed at a special meeting of the united nations security council in new york on friday the british call for an international inquiry has been echoed by the white house the united nations secretary general , ban kimoon and the nato secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen it is important that a full international investigation should be launched immediately , without any hindrance , to establish the facts and that those who may be responsible are swiftly brought to justice , mr rasmussen said in a statement the organization for security and cooperation in europe said it had conducted two videoconferences with prorussian separatist groups , which had agreed to secure the site of the crash to provide safe access for rescue teams and for national and international investigators and to cooperate with the ukrainian authorities in eastern europe , which has watched russia s maneuvers in ukraine with growing alarm , there were calls to bring the perpetrators of the crash to justice unspeakable horror for the passengers of downed flight , poland s foreign minister , radoslaw sikorski , on twitter condolences to families , justice for perpetrators and those who enabled them in a barely veiled criticism of russia and the promoscow separatists in eastern ukraine , he told reporters in warsaw , this is how delivering advanced weapons to bandits ends
kabul , afghanistan afghanistan s already tumultuous election grew more perilous on monday after the announcement of preliminary presidential runoff results that were rejected by the candidate , leading some of his most powerful supporters to call for protests and even the forming of a breakaway government in releasing the preliminary results , which showed ashraf ghani roughly a million votes ahead of mr abdullah , with 81 million ballots cast , the afghan election commission cautioned that there was no winner yet , as millions of votes could be subjected to a special audit for fraud but the caveat seemed to have little effect on many of the candidates' supporters after nightfall , ghani backers went into the streets , unleashing celebratory gunfire in several cities some were already hailing mr ghani as the presidentelect at the same time , there were reports that abdullah supporters were demonstrating in kabul , denouncing a coup by the election commission after his campaign tersely rejected the election s legitimacy one showed dozens of men , including police officers in uniform , chanting long live president abdullah and spraying gunfire both candidates , along with the afghan government , the united nations and the united states , have called for calm and restraint but the question of what the ethnic cores of their political bases might do largely pashtun for mr ghani , and largely tajik for mr abdullah has loomed over the deepening political deadlock in recent weeks that crisis had seemed to ebb in recent days , as the campaigns of mr abdullah , a former foreign minister who ran for president against hamid karzai in 2009 , and mr ghani , a former finance minister and world bank official , began meeting to thrash out an agreement on how much of the vote would be subjected to an audit at the same time , united nations and american officials separately pressed cases for a widespread audit the talks continued into monday , and it remained unclear throughout much of the day whether the country s independent election commission would announce the preliminary results , which had already been delayed for days the american ambassador , james b cunningham , and jan kubis , the united nations special envoy for afghanistan , took part in at least some of the meetings , officials said the announcement finally came just as afghans were breaking their daily ramadan fasts , and it appeared to catch the abdullah camp off guard , fulfilling what many campaign officials had described as one of their worst fears in the weeks since the june 14 runoff the ballot total reported by the commission was around a million votes higher than the seven million votes it estimated in june a figure that itself had immediately led to , saying the total had been vastly inflated by ballot box stuffing and highly improbable turnout numbers in areas that had supported mr ghani in the first round in the weeks since , the process has been fraught with tension over mr abdullah s boycott and accusations of systemic voterigging though ahmad yousuf nuristani , the chairman of the election commission , cautioned on monday that there is no winner yet , the reaction to his announcement was swift and negative from many quarters the obama administration , which had remained mostly quiet about the election , offered a strongly worded statement emphasizing that the preliminary results were not final or authoritative and it demanded that afghan election officials implement a thorough audit whether or not the two campaigns agree a full and thorough review of all reasonable allegations of irregularities is essential to ensure that the afghan people have confidence in the integrity of the electoral process and that the new afghan president is broadly accepted , said the statement , released by the state department in monday s announcement , mr nuristani said that the independent election commission , while tallying the preliminary results , had already thrown out more than 11 , 000 votes from 1 , 930 polling stations about 60 percent of the disqualified votes had been cast in favor of mr ghani , with the reminder cast for mr abdullah in addition , the two candidates had agreed that votes from nearly another third of the country s 22 , 000 polling stations would be set aside for a special audit to spot fraudulent votes , mr nuristani said he added that it would be up to the separate election complaints commission to conduct the inquiry the complaints commission said later monday that it was ready to do the audit on top of complaints it was already adjudicating , if the campaigns requested it but no such request had been made , said nader mohseni , a spokesman for the complaints commission officials from the abdullah campaign said there had been no agreement on the audit , and they said there would be no talks after the announcement , which they had been led to believe would not be made on monday none of the election commissions have any legitimacy for us , said fazal rahman oria , spokesman for mr abdullah the result is informal by all means , and we do not accept the result his comments were mild in comparison to statements from two of mr abdullah s most powerful backers , both former warlords with large ethnic constituencies muhammad mohaqiq , who is running as mr abdullah s first vice president , described the preliminary results as a coup against voters , and said it had given mr abdullah s team the right to form the government muhammad atta noor , the other former warlord , who is currently the governor of balkh province in northern afghanistan , said in a separate statement today s announcement by the commission paves the ground for the next measures , from massive protests to the formation of a parallel government secretary of state john kerry responded to the threats with a stern statement , saying there is no justifiable recourse to violence or threats of violence , or for resort to extraconstitutional measures or threats of the same any action to take power by extralegal means will cost afghanistan the financial and security support of the united states and the international community , mr kerry said in a statement released tuesday morning in kabul there was no immediate response to the announcement from mr ghani , but tens of thousands of his supporters took to the streets to celebrate in kabul , where celebratory gunfire could be heard , and in many other parts of the country where pashtuns dominate , including the southern city of kandahar there , thousands of people turned out to see traditional dancing and drumming after the announcement , and a powerful member of the kandahar provincial council , hajji agha lalai , also invited thousands of people to a breakfast on tuesday in honor of mr ghani the reactions from both camps hinted at far darker facets to the election , which increasingly appears to have exposed the ethnic and factional rifts that plunged the country into civil war in the 1990s , but that president karzai has managed to keep buried over the past 12 years mr abdullah himself has been careful to avoid inflammatory remarks about parallel governments or any other radical measures his campaign said he would speak on tuesday
viewers of masterpiece on sunday can be forgiven if they forget they 're watching and start tweeting about death comes to downton , and wondering where lady mary is it s not that pemberley , played by in north yorkshire , england , and downton abbey , played by highclere castle in hampshire , look all that much alike but there s something similar about the way each is a major character , lovingly photographed from every flattering angle and in pemberley , as in downton , there is an emphasis on upstairsdownstairs relations and the responsibility of the gentry to their servants and tenants none of this , you suspect , was lost on the executives at bbc , where the show originated , or at pbs , where it s playing now amid the magnificence of the setting you can forget for a moment that this glossily produced , finely wrought , slightly dull twonight miniseries is actually connected to a piece of british storytelling of even higher standing perhaps than downton abbey jane austen s pride and prejudice the exact source is p d james s 2011 death comes to pemberley , a pride and prejudice sequel that drops in on elizabeth and darcy six years after their marriage , when they are ensconced at his family estate , and embroils them in a murder mystery the two most famous argumentative lovers of postshakespearean literature are played here by anna maxwell martin and matthew rhys with skill , intelligence and a bit too much restraint it s as if they 've been told that they need to be the parents mr rhys looks uncomfortable much of the time , as nervous as he does when he s carrying out a particularly difficult feat of espionage on the americans more lively are some of the excellent supporting cast like matthew goode \( of the good wife \) as the invidious wickham , who is the suspect in the killing that takes place on the pemberley grounds , and eleanor tomlinson as darcy s sister , georgiana the most vivid performance is given by jenna coleman , the current companion on doctor who she s so squeally and broad as lydia , elizabeth s youngest sister and wickham s wife , that she seems to be in a different , less distinguished and possibly more entertaining show
munich what was it that so offended anna netrebko \? a whiff of scandal preceded the opening of the director hans neuenfels s new production of puccini s manon lescaut here at the bavarian state opera this month , when ms netrebko , the russian star soprano who was to sing the title role , pulled out late in the process , citing artistic differences with the director was it rodents again \? for a 2010 production of wagner s lohengrin at the bayreuth festival , mr neuenfels had dressed chorus members as giant padded rats would there be graphic scenes of depraved sex \? none of the above for sure , much of the manon lescaut i watched on thursday is grotesque and bleak , the product of a director who does n't shy away from selfreferential cleverness and textual liberties but in the end , the production s alienating elements powerfully focus the attention on its characters' struggles to assert their humanity and their passion in a shrill , material world and the stark , neonlit sets illuminate two dramatically fearless singers and the palpable chemistry between them as manon , the soprano kristine opolais turned in a dramatically honest and vocally assured performance but the star of this show is the tenor jonas kaufmann , who offered a blazing , noholdsbarred portrayal of her steadfast lover , des grieux the orchestra , under the direction of alain altinoglu , sounded sensational puccini s adaptation of antoinefran ois pr vost s 1731 story of the passionate , fickle manon , torn between her love for des grieux and her passion for money and bling , is a challenge for any director the product of at least four librettists , the story jumps among as many different settings , with yawning narrative gaps in between mr neuenfels offers texts of his own to fill in the void , some projected on the curtain during scene changes , others offered as footnotes on the back wall some are useful enough puccini never does explain why the two lovers are on the run in the final scene in a fictitious louisiana desert but here , des grieux has killed the governor s son , who was in love with manon , in a duel other language is plain daft better a slaughtered pig than vegan disappointment is one fairly representative sample as for the audience , mr neuenfels offers this we search for tragedy like pigs for truffles perhaps that statement provides a clue to the chorus , whose members totter around like metallic teletubbies in padded jumpsuits with enormous , exaggerated bottoms that make their feet look like pigs' trotters in the paris scene manon , egged on by financial troubles and her venal brother , lescaut , has left des grieux for a rich older man the chorus members appear in plush scarlet ecclesiastical robes as they fondle her pillow and sniff her bed linen wearing colors redolent of wealth \( silver \) and power \( scarlet \) , they represent the forces opposing love by contrast , the costumes \( by andrea schmidtfutterer \) for the principals are sober and unremarkable black suits for the men , a somewhat more theatrical , elongated coat for lescaut , who was sung with a glowing full baritone by markus eiche manon undergoes a process of unraveling , from the fetching young thing in beret and calflength skirt of the opening scene to the corporate sexiness of her pantsuit and heels in paris and the sinner s shift she wears in le havre , after she has been arrested for theft and awaits her banishment to america in the louisiana desert , she appears disheveled , barefoot , in zombielike black the secondary roles are well cast dean power brings a nervy , bright tenor to the part of edmondo the mezzosoprano okka von der damerau is an alluring madrigal singer , the bass evgenij kachurovsky powerful as the comandante ulrich ress is a creepy dance master with hairy stockings and a werewolf beard and mane manon is a capricious and contradictory romantic heroine , and ms opolais s coolly contained portrayal offers little psychological insight the character s own selfassessment is unreliable dying of thirst , she curses her beauty , when it is really her taste for luxury and willingness to let men make decisions for her that has brought on her downfall vocally , ms opolais captures something of that detachment her soprano is silken and supple , its center of gravity pleasantly full in the upper third of her range but it would have been nice to see her take more risks , matching mr kaufmann s fearless commitment he gives a riveting performance that pushes his naturally warm , darktoned tenor beyond prettiness the extraordinary chemistry between the two leads makes the most lasting impression mr kaufmann and ms opolais have sung these roles together before , this summer at the royal opera house in london to say that they are comfortable with intimacy is an understatement in the final , desperate scene in the desert , they paw , caress and clutch at each other mr kaufmann frantically tries to find ways to ease her discomfort , pushing wild strands of hair out of her face , pushing his jacket under her head as a pillow , covering her forehead in kisses even during the numerous curtain calls , they kissed , hugged and beamed at each other the promise of a netrebkokaufmann power couple had fired up ticket sales ahead of the opening if there were any regrets about ms netrebko s late departure , they were drowned in the prolonged ovations for ms opolais
the title character cate blanchett plays in blue jasmine has reminded some commentators of blanche dubois and others of ruth madoff but the role of jasmine french , the selfdeceiving society type reeling from her husband s fraud , reminds the actress of none other than shakespeare s richard ii throughout the course of that play , you have somebody who s experiencing a gulf between the role and the title of king , and who he is as a man , ms blanchett tells the bagger , who writes here that the actress has been a frontrunner for the best actress oscar for months jasmine isn t likeable , but that didn t deter the actress in this video , she explains , i think it s a little bit syrupy to try and play to an audience s sympathy
ajaccio , corsica in june , corsica s most active separatist group , the national liberation front , or flnc , declared an end to its decadeslong armed resistance against the french mainland for many , its communiqu outlining a process of demilitarization and progressive exit from clandestine activities was a surprising reversal since the establishment of the flnc in 1976 , there have been over 10 , 000 terrorist operations on the island the flnc and other separatist groups claimed responsibility for about half of these \( most of which targeted the homes of noncorsicans \) the flnc has also been implicated in some 40 assassinations but despite what the separatists would like to believe , only a tiny minority of locals support independence weakened over the years , the flnc now consists of a handful of activists most corsicans are disgusted with the decades of bloody fighting over disbursements by the french government aimed at buying peace , and patriotic taxes imposed by separatists on local businesses when snitches are killed , a code of silence , or omert , ensures that culprits are rarely brought to justice in the most egregious case , omert enabled the separatist yvan colonna , who in 1998 brutally murdered the prefect claude erignac , paris s most senior representative in corsica , to hide on the island for four years before being arrested corsicans also resent that , over the years , many separatists abandoned their lofty ideals and turned to organized crime many are making fortunes blackmailing local mayors for permits to build condominiums on pristine shores , or getting involved in casinos or foreign drug deals these mafiosi , who are responsible for hundreds of murders on the island , are today s real corsican curse despite its unpopularity , the flnc s decision to renounce armed conflict might , at first sight , appear to have come from a position of strength the move stems from the adoption by the corsican assembly since 2013 of three major separatist demands consideration of the corsican dialect as a coofficial language a reference in the french constitution that would pave the way for expanding corsica s administrative autonomy , granted in a and , in april , mandatory fiveyear permanent residency on the island as a prerequisite for buying property the flnc communiqu that the residency vote had influenced their decision to abandon violence we think there now exists an opportunity to take a historic step in the fight for national liberation but corsican assembly members on the right and left who backed the demands know they will never become law the assembly has no legislative powers its resolutions must be approved by the french national assembly , and can often only become legally binding through constitutional modifications \( for which there must be a threefifths majority in both houses of the legislature \) a corsican senator and vocal adversary of separatism , nicolas alfonsi , declared the resolutions a dead end as the government will not submit a constitutional revision to parliament some see the corsican assembly s approval of the statutes as a purely cynical attempt by the island s traditional parties , which are staunchly opposed to independence , to win separatist votes ahead of regional elections in december 2015 , which conquered corsica in 1769 , never treated it as a colony napoleon , born the same year in ajaccio , the island s capital , remains a national hero many corsicans are prominent establishment figures charles pasqua was interior minister in two administrations bernard squarcini headed france s domestic intelligence service under president nicolas sarkozy jeanmarie colombani ran the daily newspaper le monde from 1994 to 2007 nonce paolini chairs tf1 , france s largest private television network no french government would risk the explosion of a nation that took a thousand years to assemble particularly as preparations are under way to fuse the country s 22 regions into if a corsican exception were confirmed , nothing would prevent brittany and alsace , for example , from demanding similar treatment in ajaccio in june , interior minister bernard cazeneuve conveyed paris s disapproval a desire to preserve a special identity must not set out a path toward breakup , he said paris has already been chastened by an eruption of violence in brittany last october after the proposal of an ecotax on heavy trucks protesters donned the red caps worn by bretons in 1675 to protest a stamp tax and which prefigured those worn during the french revolution paris hurriedly , not wanting to reawaken a historic longing for regional liberties corsican separatists envy france s farflung territories , particularly those in the indian ocean and south pacific , which have been granted greater autonomy but , paradoxically , there is no solidarity overseas with corsica s separatist cause with the possible exception of new caledonia , which has vast nickel resources and is slated for a referendum on independence , none would renounce the advantages of being french for the dream of independence the same could be said of the majority of corsica s 300 , 000 inhabitants the island s relatively weak economy has long been dependent on generous financial support from paris , including tax breaks and subsidies for transportation to and from the mainland about 30 percent of corsicans are civil servants the flnc s carefully worded communiqu does not preclude an eventual resumption of shooting and bombing this would not be without precedent in past decades , several solemnly proclaimed truces have dissolved in bloodshed but in the end the flnc had no alternative to retreating it may claim it has won an ideological battle , but the flnc has lost the war corsica wants to stay french
there is a certain irony in the shorthand that experts commonly use when discussing this country s closest brush with nuclear cataclysm tmi today , those letters are widely understood to mean too much information but well before the advent of social media , tmi referred principally to the three mile island nuclear generating station , a power plant on the susquehanna river in central pennsylvania disaster struck there in 1979 , and when it did , too much information solid , unassailable information was not part of the mix months later , a presidential commission cited a lack of communication at all levels as cause for grave concern americans were frightened , and not just those in pennsylvania fear was intensified because , as the commission said , their right to know what was going on had been sorely compromised then again , so many things went wrong on the susquehanna disaster struck at 4 am on march 28 when watercoolant pumps failed at the plant s new second reactor , known as tmi2 that led to the reactor s overheating , with the temperature rising steadily after a stuck valve misled the operators into halting the flow of emergency cooling water half the core was later found to have melted details of the accident are recounted in the latest offering from , a weekly series of video documentaries examining major news stories from the past and their lessons for today in a nutshell , tmi2 lurched through a series of crises for nearly a week later found plenty of blame to go around the plant s designer , babcock wilcox the federal nuclear regulatory commission the local utility , metropolitan edison tmi2 managers and workers and the news media collectively none were spared in a report carrying the subtitle need to change the worst of it fell on march 30 , when radiation was purposefully released into the air to relieve pressure within the system that action fed apprehension beyond the plant s concrete walls that the situation had spun out of control rumors flew so did thoughts of a possible mass evacuation pennsylvania s governor , richard l thornburgh , was loath to go that far , but he did advise pregnant women and small children near the island to find more distant shelter contributing to the pervasive dread was a film that had just come out , , a thriller about a safety crisis at a nuclear power plant in california \( china syndrome in the nuclear industry s argot describes a meltdown so severe that the material might burrow clear to the other side of the world , to china \) during the crisis , some moviegoers emerged from theaters to see scary newspaper headlines about an unsettling scenario in pennsylvania evocative of the onscreen terror they had just witnessed no china syndrome took place at tmi nor were there immediate deaths or injuries as for longterm physical health effects , the thrust of most studies though by no means all is that the disaster s impact was negligible the psychological toll , however , was immense even before the accident , america s romance with nuclear power had begun to chill three mile island sent it into the deep freeze many years passed before the nuclear regulatory commission got a chance to review an application to build a new power plant the devastating 1986 nightmare in ukraine , the worst catastrophe at a nuclear power plant , hardly reassured wary people , even those willing to chalk up that horror to useless soviet engineering and management now we have the continuing ordeal of the plant in northeastern japan , crippled by a 2011 earthquake and tsunami small wonder that strong antinuclear sentiments are expressed , on the heels of the tsunami , to the effect that replacing coal and oil with nuclear power is like trading heroin for crack different addictions , but no less unhealthy or risky yet american attitudes on nuclear power , as measured by opinion polls , are far from irrevocably negative as tmi faded in collective memory , the popularity of that energy source has waxed and waned , each rise tempered by a new cause for alarm , notably chernobyl and fukushima many power plants that had been on the drawing boards before 1979 were built in the last few years , new ones have been proposed , encouraged by president obama , who has described nuclear energy as necessary along with renewable sources like wind and solar in any plan to wean the country from fossil fuels the need for swift action would seem greater than ever , given new warnings from a that time is running short for countries to adopt strategies to keep worldwide carbon emissions from reaching intolerable levels it is hard to grasp how american reliance on nuclear energy could disappear soon , if ever according to the world nuclear association , a londonbased group that promotes nuclear power , there are 104 nuclear reactors in the united states they accounted in 2011 for 19 percent of this country s total electricity output while that is half of what coalfired power plants generated , and roughly 60 percent of that produced by plants relying on natural gas , it is still a lot projections suggest that america s energy needs will only keep growing still , nuclear power scares the pants off people unlike any other energy form the phenomenon is hardly new baby boomers grew up with a stream of 1950s horror movies like godzilla and the amazing colossal man , premised on radiation s monstrous consequences fast forward to chernobyl , whose psychological impact was reflected in a 2005 study conducted under the aegis of several international groups , including the international atomic energy agency this review concluded that the mental health impact of chernobyl is the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident to date a year after fukushima , , a physicist and science historian , wrote for this newspaper s dot earth blog that nuclear fear retained its status as the supreme horror , a psychological malaise that does not accompany other materials that put people at risk of cancer and other deadly illness could the events at three mile island happen again \? not very likely , at least not at three mile island itself tmi2 was permanently shut down , and tmi1 , the first reactor there , would seem not long for this world it is expected to be decommissioned , a process that was supposed to begin this year but has been delayed until 2034 but is that enough to allay all nuclear fears in this country \? many tmiera reactors are still around so it is perhaps not tmi , the modern tmi , to suggest that the probable answer is no
if college isn t in a high school student s plan for any reason , the sense of pressure and judgment that some families feel at this time of year can be overwhelming many seniors are deciding where they want to begin college in the fall , decisions that will be final on may 1 i feel judgment like i haven t felt since my kids were babies , adrienne jones posted on facebook \( where many parents are proudly posting acceptances and decisions \) her son does not plan to enter college when a motherlode reader asked for stories from other parents who have a child who is not interested in going to college , we asked her to tell us a little more she described a child whose primary interests were in creative pursuits , and who is , at best , ambivalent about college he loves to learn but heavyduty academics are not something he relishes , so on that front , i don t want to push him into a fouryear college where he would be miserable and we would spend what amounts to a fortune from our meager budget college of some kind may or may not lie in his future , and she is trying , amid some support from friends and some judgment , to feel sanguine it would really help to hear stories from other parents whose kids found a meaningful life with decent work , without college , she wrote , as well as stories of what children who don t choose college do after senior year so we asked , on facebook , on the blog , and on twitter , for parents to share their stories of noncollegebound kids or of their noncollegebound selves we read about triumphs , we read about alternatives , and we read about regret as promised , here are some of the stories my partner and i are both collegeeducated and assumed that that was the route our intelligent child would take , weary1 of seattle wrote but as middle and high school progressed it became clear that being intelligent is not the same thing as being scholastically inclined , and when you combine that with adolescentonset anxiety disorder

swiftly into a professional future of course , that s not guaranteed , but it s far more likely if you get on that boat that you will get wherever you wanted to go much more quickly and with less pain than if you stay on the dock and watch it leave but for students who are uncertain about direction , ms adams wrote , then it s ok to not get on , to wait for the right boat for you looking back on

design course that is articulated with a local community college and will take another in his senior year somehow , the fact that he can do college in high school has been very empowering for him community colleges can be a compromise they offer a wide variety of certificates and associate degrees , wrote susan of eastern washington everyone keeps saying that not all students need to attend

grenoble , france the hubbub of jostling reporters and television crews is a memory now , nearly two months after the helicopter carrying michael schumacher , the most successful grand prix driver in racing history , landed at university hospital center in this old roman city after traveling from a rocky slope at the m ribel ski resort 45 miles away by air outside the ninestory hospital , only a solitary , weatherstained banner remains to indicate that schumacher is still a patient , deeply comatose and in critical condition , in the fifthfloor neurological intensive care unit schumi , the banner outside the hospital says in bold scarlet letters , using the driver s nickname and the color associated with the ferrari team , with which he won most of his laurels , with a record seven driver s championships and 91 grand prix wins all our thoughts for you and your family in part , the reporters' disappearance from the hospital has been a response to appeals by schumacher s wife , corinna , to spare the family further intrusion into their privacy but the news media s absence tells another more melancholy story , too attention has moved on , with schumacher becoming only the latest , if one of the bestknown , additions to the sobering roll call of those who have fallen into the oblivion for weeks , months or even years of longterm comas after sustaining traumatic head injuries while engaging in potentially hazardous recreational sports doctors in grenoble say that hundreds of injured skiers have arrived at the hospital with concussions and more serious head injuries in recent years some of the injured occupy beds near schumacher s a further reminder of the hazards of winter sports comes from the television sets in the wards , which last week were showing events from the sochi olympics , where several athletes in the skiing , snowboarding and slopestyle competitions sustained head injuries the outlook for schumacher , 45 , has been obscured by the decision of his doctors and his family not to give regular updates on his progress but what is known seems increasingly dispiriting , at least for his prospects of achieving a complete mental and physical recovery , or even of escaping longterm impairment his injuries prompted two operations in his first 36 hours at the hospital to remove blood clots from his brain , and a statement by his doctors after the second operation said scans had revealed multiple clots in deeper areas of the brain that were not accessible to surgery those deep clots , medical experts say , pose the most serious threat to schumacher s recovery , and perhaps to his survival unable to remove them , the grenoble doctors began a new and critical phase of treatment more than three weeks ago an effort to bring schumacher out of the medically induced coma in which he has lain since he arrived on dec 29 since that treatment began , the only medical updates have been unofficial and anonymously sourced reports in german newspapers and magazines those reports prompted a new statement by sabine kehm , schumacher s spokeswoman , who said monday that the process of lifting the coma remained unchanged that was not in itself a denial of the german reports that the attempt to revive him had failed , as experts have said that temporary suspension of the waking process is common in such cases while cautious because of the lack of detailed information coming from the doctors in grenoble , other experts were generally pessimistic if they 're not releasing good news because there is none , then that s very bad news indeed , said gary hartstein , an american anesthesiologist based in li ge , belgium , who worked for eight years until 2012 as head of formula one s medical unit after eight weeks , if there s no sign of waking , what most people would do is unplug , he added others were more sanguine a couple of weeks after you stop sedatives it s too early to say that somebody is in a persistent vegetative state , said david k menon , a cambridge university specialist who heads the anesthesia division at cambridge neuroscience , a research institute noted for its work on traumatic brain injuries but the more time you take to wake up , the less the probability that you 'll have the sort of recovery you 'd hope for one potentially remedial step taken by the family was to invite schumacher s longterm teammate at ferrari , the brazilian felipe massa , to sit with schumacher in his room at the intensive care unit , talking of common experiences in formula one and of developments in the cars for the new season , which begins march 16 in australia i told him everything , about my car , my new team , massa said , referring to his shift from ferrari to the british williams team i told him to wake up many times at m ribel , skiers continue to flock to the slope where schumacher , skiing with his 14yearold son , mick , had his accident , about 7 , 000 feet up the saulire mountain m ribel s slopes were used for the women s skiing events in the 1992 winter olympics , and complaints then , particularly in the downhill , were that the highaltitude descents were too steep but members of the ski rescue team at the top of the mountain , at a station known as dent de burgin the unit that responded to the schumacher accident , summoning the helicopter that took him to grenoble said there had been barely 400 skiing injuries of all kinds requiring evacuation from the slopes by the rescue teams visitors bought more than 13 million day passes at m ribel last year as for schumacher , they said , he had avoided the most perilous descent , which has an 85 percent incline at one point instead he took a gentler , windaround route to a lower slope where , for reasons that remain unexplained , he chose to cross between two heavily traveled pistes , or trails , across an area of ungroomed snowfield strewn with rocks under regulations set by the m ribel authorities , offpiste areas like the one schumacher entered generally carry no warning signs , and there were none where schumacher fell one of the rescue team members , philippe merlin , said an overnight snowfall had left a deep overlay of fresh , uncompacted snow that covered most of the rocks , but allowed schumacher s skis to sink as much as a foot beneath the surface a french police investigation that was formally closed last week , drawing in part from videotape retrieved from schumacher s helmetmounted camera , found that the initial impact had occurred four feet from the piste and that schumacher had been catapulted over the tips of his skis into a headfirst impact with another rock 34 feet farther on that caused his helmet to split the police ruled that there had been no negligence or other error , by m ribel or schumacher , that required further criminal investigation that conclusion met with broad support among skiers on the saulire runs , many of whom said they were satisfied with m ribel s safety arrangements merlin , of the rescue team , who has skied the mountain for more than 40 years , said that schumacher , who owns a chalet nearby , was known on the slopes as a good skier and that what he had done in crossing the rocky area was not unusual it s quite normal , he said but he was unlucky still , the accident has left its mark on a murky day last week , with lowhanging clouds enveloping the gondola lift that reaches the dent de burgin summit from m ribel , groups of skiers could be seen through the mist pausing at the scene of the accident , some pointing their ski poles at rocks beside the piste members of the rescue team said somebody had used a pole in the aftermath of the accident to inscribe a message in the snow for schumacher our prayers are with you , michael , it said
heroic terracotta busts of columbus , franklin , shakespeare , gutenberg , beethoven and michelangelo gaze down from the lovingly restored 1881 facade of the brooklyn historical society , reminding the approaching visitor of what the place was once meant to represent the founders of the society which is now celebrating its 150th anniversary conceived of its building in brooklyn heights as a repository of history that would aspire to the greatest achievements of european civilization and why not \? brooklyn was the thirdlargest city in the united states , the architect was george b post \( who later designed the new york stock exchange \) , and the society s founders were among the elite but in recent years , like , the brooklyn historical society , emerging from years of eclipse , has been reconstituting and redefining itself , probing polemically at the world that gave it birth , testing the fissures in its own conceptual foundations it is partly in that light that an exhibition that opened on wednesday might be understood we are offered a very different roster of representative figures from those who grace the building , including james w c pennington , who escaped slavery in maryland in 1827 , came to live in brooklyn and became a distinguished preacher and abolitionist willis augustus hodges \( 18151890 \) , a free black man who lived in williamsburg , where he started an influential abolitionist newspaper and , a black abolitionist , who invested in brooklyn real estate and died one of the richest women in the united states in 1883 these are extraordinary figures all , and the exhibition , with less than 2 , 000 square feet of space , is really too small for them , for their compatriots and for the theme they illustrate that the history of slavery and abolition in new york , through the civil war , cannot be understood without considering the importance of brooklyn but however small , the exhibition deserves attention , both for its subject and for what it reflects about the historical society s evolution under its president , deborah schwartz the show is presented in a new gallery created as part of a 55 million project that also opened up classroom space , supplementing a 23 million renovation of the landmark building that began in 1999 public programming is being expanded in a new auditorium an education program has also grown and until the spring , a printed 1864 copy of the emancipation proclamation , signed by lincoln , is also on display , accompanied by a selection of the condemnations and acclamations that greeted the document the abolitionist exhibition itself is a declaration of future intentions it unveils an area only recently explored in the society s own holdings \( which include some 100 , 000 volumes , 60 , 000 photographs , more than 2 , 000 maps and atlases , along with oral histories , films and family genealogies which can be sampled in a stunning landmark woodpaneled library \) the subject of slavery in new york city , let alone brooklyn , would have once been considered of minor importance but in and , the newyork historical society showed that the subject was actually central , pointing out , for example , that before the american revolution , new york had more slaves than any american city except charleston , sc , and that even through the civil war , commerce was so important that opinion about slavery in new york was as split as in any border state the new exhibition is slight , compared with those predecessors , so the book edited by ira berlin and leslie m harris and published in conjunction with those shows , should serve as a companion volume here , too but the show s curator and historian , prithi kanakamedala , and its project manager , kate fermoile , take things further , creating a show that should be seen , despite its flaws in 1790 , we learn , about a third of the population of kings county \( now brooklyn \) was black , and nearly all of those people were enslaved but if slavery declined in many northern cities after the revolution , in kings county , it strengthened because it was crucial for the agricultural economy sixty percent of white brooklynites , we are told , were slaveholders \( though , since kings county consisted of six towns brooklyn , bushwick , flatbush , flatlands , gravesend and new utrecht it is unclear if the statistic refers to a part or the whole \) but the information is potent , and so are the displays we see a tuft of flax grown on a flatlands farm and we learn of john jea , born in southern nigeria in 1773 and enslaved on a farm in flatbush freed in 1789 , he taught himself how to read english and dutch , and he published as he traveled as a preacher reproductions of pastoral brooklyn landscapes are here as well , to show what they do n't show slaves at work we learn , through a timeline , of the freeing of slaves by 1827 , of the breaking up of farmland , of the 1837 recession that brought down real estate prices and allowed many blacks to buy land , and of the growth of brooklyn s waterfront , which resembled manhattan s in the importance of sugar , tobacco and cotton all associated with slave labor by 1857 , a wall label tells us , brooklyn was central to the business of slavery \( an overstatement , surely , but we are uncertain because few details are offered \) the timeline wraps around the gallery , while , in its center , the exhibition s designers , including and the firm , have hung screens and panels called activist stations each station presents three black men or women , relating their stories to the unfolding history viewers tug on strings , as if they were pulleys , in order to scroll through images and text on the screens this is how we discover jea , hodges and others it is also how we learn of brooklyn s black abolitionism in 1834 , the year the city of brooklyn was incorporated , an antiabolition riot in manhattan led many abolitionists to consider moving to brooklyn the village of weeksville , established in 1838 by free blacks , began to thrive \( the , a contemporary museum site in brooklyn , along with the , a drama group , are listed as partners in a series of public events \) the village of williamsburg became a destination as well there is so much here that is important that it often exasperates that only minimal text bites are provided , as if anything more would get in the way why does n't the exhibition give us detail about weeksville , for example , which was a community with more than 500 residents in 1855 , supporting two newspapers , several churches , an orphan asylum and a home for the aged \? on many subjects , we have to seek out documents arrayed in reproduction on dowels , like racks of newspapers almost as if reading were being caricatured as oldfashioned it would have helped , too , to have a clearer exposition of debates within the abolitionist world , or how black and white groups interacted the style of the exhibition ends up leaving us with impressions rather than a coherent narrative and some of the figures , like pennington , are so remarkable that it is a puzzle that they are not brought more vividly to life his eyewitness reports on the new york city 1863 draft riots , for example , are chilling and would have added to the exhibition meanwhile , the 15yearold maritcha lyons s fleeing of those attacks for brooklyn s safety is almost the only thing we learn about her not that at the age of 16 , after moving to rhode island , she stood before the state legislature and successfully argued for the admission of blacks to providence public schools one more thing the language often verges on clich the exhibition , we read , tells part of the history of social justice blacks in brooklyn actively resisted their oppression and birthed brooklyn s antislavery movement a community is mobilized abolitionists pursued their revolutionary vision and after reconstruction s failures , activists in brooklyn and beyond continued the struggle for social justice none of these formulaic phrases illuminates the history instead , they seem inserted to rally contemporary passions a concluding panel is titled the struggle continues we are told that the struggle for freedom and justice continues today and that increasingly , urban communities across the world have taken to the streets demanding a fair and democratic society equality in housing , health care , education , employment , food and safety are just some of the issues at stake but this invocation of unspecified street demonstrations and a sweeping roster of issues leaves us unsure of precisely what is being alluded to or what it has to do with abolition and slavery this is one of the challenges that historical societies face as they remake themselves to appeal to audiences and to distance themselves from history as it was once told where is the balance \? place an emphasis on contemporary issues related to the exhibition , with discussions about modernday slavery and about current experiences of muslims \( though not , apparently , about the vast history of slavery in the middle east \) the society is also creating an oral history project called that explores mixedheritage identity these attempts to create a vital institution are intriguing and the society invites multiple visits but currentday tastes and a preoccupation with activist politics are only a part of the story while this approach is meant to be recompense for previous neglect , the busts on the facade remind us that a more ambitious and complete history of brooklyn and its people is yet to come
kars , turkey we have enemies the old kurdish woman said this by way of running me off i had trekked into her mountain hamlet at dusk , hoping to camp nearby she waved a hand at the stone homes around us most were empty there had been a killing between neighbors the house of the perpetrator had been leveled fearing retribution , his relatives had run for their lives armed members of the victim s family were now guarding the place against their return the watchmen s lonesome campfire seesawed in the wind high up on a cliff it s not safe here , the woman apologized so i walked on i slept five miles away in a field over the past three months , while plodding some 350 miles along the steppe trails , rural back roads and modern highways of s kurdish heartland , i 've heard this bleak refrain dozens of times i am crossing the world on foot as part of a project called the the idea involves retracing the first human migration out of africa during the stone age , and reporting current events at the micro level along the ancestral route to south america turkey , the eighth country on my itinerary since leaving ethiopia in early 2013 , was supposed to be easy but while plodding into eastern anatolia this summer , i have been shooed out of kurdish villages , interrogated by kurdish vigilantes and nearly shot twice by frightened kurds none of this is personal , of course friendlessness having enemies is synonymous with kurdishness the world s 30 million kurds , a tough and independent mountain people who mostly practice a moderate brand of sunni islam , are scattered among turkey , iraq , syria and iran states that for generations have perfected the tools of marginalization , counterinsurgency and manipulation to keep their unruly kurdish minorities in check lately , american military support for kurds battling the islamic state in syria has revived a modest dream of pankurdish unity greater cooperation among the region s rival kurdish movements , if not the dawn of a greater kurdistan yet my bootlevel view of kurdish fractiousness suggests how steep that slope may be to be clear i have been overwhelmed by a stunning brand of kurdish hospitality that places nearly every private home and barn at my disposal \( i am walking with a cargo mule \) but this kindness frequently comes entangled in a painful thicket of grievance and suspicion not just among individual kurds , but entire villages and families walking through a stillmythic kurdistan must resemble , i imagine , a foot journey through 19thcentury appalachia kurds appear to share the same violent honor culture and clannish tensions as the frontier scotchirish any ramble in the woods can be fraught i learned about this geography of enmity even before arriving in turkey , when my first kurdish walking guide phoned me , rueful , to back out of the job his family had teetered into a blood feud someone had been shot we could n't even meet in the city of sanliurfa , population 800 , 000 , for fear of bumping into his village foes \( this was a blow he was a highly resourceful person he 'd saved his relatives from the vendetta by engineering a local blackout , then hustling his kin to safety inside the power company repair van \) eastern anatolia is profoundly haunted , of course , by more infamous violence turkey s ruthless suppression of proindependence kurdish guerrillas from the kurdistan workers' party , the pkk i have inched past countless villages depopulated by an insurgency that has claimed 37 , 000 lives but i also have pushed the mule through many new villages spawned by kurdonkurd brawls how old is this place \? i asked sahmettin aydin , the muktar , or headman , of an ancientlooking outpost called pasli about 30 years , he replied our entire village relocated here after a murder case in 1987 religion is another source of friction , especially since the rise of the islamic state extremists in neighboring syria i was mistaken for a jihadist infiltrator and almost shot by a posse of kurds near mount karacadag \( i am going to kill you , one vigilante hissed into the ear of my new walking guide himself a kurd who then frantically dialed a kurdish politician to rescue us \) within minutes it became clear that the real object of their wrath was the kurdish hezbollah , a religious party funded by ankara in part to fight the pkk it is hard to blame the kurds for such flintiness an accident of history and geography crushed them between the ottoman and persian empires for centuries they were obliged by bigger powers to play the role of an unreliable border gendarmerie , with all the attendant betrayals that come with that job but cultures of mistrust wear you down the kurdish region of turkey is beautiful these days , i tramp past poplars that burn golden under ashy winter skies but it is a forlorn sort of beauty i tiptoe through it warily , sometimes with my hands in the air as a sign of surrender the saddest kurdish fratricide i have encountered involved the korucu members of the kurdish village guard set up by the turkish government to battle the pkk they are doomed men , loathed by nationalist kurds as turncoats a few weeks ago , the pkk tied one to a telephone pole and executed him firingsquadstyle they reportedly stuffed a 10lira note in his mouth for good measure last week , three of these militiamen ambushed me i was hiking with my two walking guides in a forested river valley near the plateau town of agri i was lagging behind , punching text messages into a cellphone figures in camouflage sprang from behind the trees they screamed at me they leveled their kalashnikov rifles i flung up my hands to the sky but they kept shouting we could n't understand each other it was the closest i 've come to being shot since covering the iraq war you gave us a scare , one of the assailants said later , meaning that he thought we were pkk he clapped my shoulder he explained that he had enemies he urged me to enjoy the scenery of his fractured land
washington as most republicans were taking a victory lap the morning after the elections , a group of conservatives huddled anxiously in a conference room not far from capitol hill and agreed that now is the time for confrontation , not compromise and conciliation despite republicans' ascension to senate control and an expanded house majority , many conservatives from the party s activist wing fear that congressional leaders are already being too timid with  they do not want to hear that government shutdowns are off the table or that repealing the affordable care act is impossible two things republican leaders have said in recent days if the new republican leadership in the senate is only talking about what they ca n't do , that s going to be very demoralizing , said thomas j fitton , president of , a conservative advocacy group that convenes a regular gathering called groundswell any sense of triumph at its meeting last week was fleeting i think the members of the leadership need to decide what they 're willing to shut down the government over , mr fitton said establishment republicans , who had vowed to thwart the , succeeded in electing new lawmakers who are , for the most part , less rebellious and when the new congress convenes in january , the republican leaders who will take the reins will be mainly in the mold of conservatives who have tried to keep the tea party in check but they have not crushed the movement s spirit as republicans on capitol hill transition from being the opposition party to being one that has to show it can govern , a powerful tension is emerging how to move forward with an agenda that challenges the president without selfdestructing some conservatives believe that the threat of another shutdown is their strongest leverage to demand concessions on the and to stop the president from carrying out immigration reform yet their leadership has dismissed the idea as a suicide mission that could squander the recent gains one thing that will prove popular among the base is a commitment by senator , the presumptive new majority leader , to bring up a bill after 20 weeks of pregnancy , which he is expected to do next year whether the party can reconcile more demands of its base with the will of its leadership could determine how enduring the republican senate majority will be the crop of senators up for reelection in 2016 includes those elected in the first tea party wave of 2010 and in a sign of what is at stake , even some of them are sounding notes of compromise and caution that would have been unthinkable at the height of the right s resurgence i understand the frustrations of the conservative base i am one of them , said senator ron johnson of wisconsin , one of the original class of tea partyinspired senators i also recognize reality we 're not going to pass the entire conservative agenda tomorrow we can certainly lay it out , mr johnson added let s start with the things we can pass does n't that make more sense \? but in a stark reminder of the difficulties republican leaders will face from within their own ranks , other lawmakers popular with the tea party base are saying the fight is on as votes were still being counted on election night tuesday , senator ted cruz of texas said republicans could still work through congress to dismantle the affordable care act even though the president is guaranteed to veto anything congress passes that undermines it after winning a historic majority , it is incumbent on us to honor promises and do everything humanly possible to stop obamacare , mr cruz said in an interview some republican senators rejected that outright there are intelligent things to do , and there are some notsointelligent things to do , said senator orrin g hatch of utah and one of the first things we should do is find some areas of common ground with our democrat friends tea party conservatives , many of whom argue that the government shutdown last year was a sound strategy , said they were baffled by by mr mcconnell that the senate under his control would prioritize policies that republicans knew democrats would also support many also fumed when mr mcconnell stated the obvious republicans do not have the votes to repeal the affordable care act because they cannot override a presidential veto on their own \( it takes 67 votes to do so they have 52 seats now , with the possibility of picking up two more \) the next day , he and speaker john a boehner of ohio wrote for the wall street journal insisting that , indeed , repeal remained a goal any perception that mr mcconnell is not sufficiently committed to repealing the health care law , despite his running hard against it in his own reelection campaign , would renew the same fissures among republicans that preceded the government shutdown that would cause a civil war inside the , said richard viguerie , a longtime conservative activist , referring to anything the party s base saw as a halfhearted attempt at repeal there s almost zero trust between the base and the republican leaders no one did more to demoralize tea party candidates and conservative agitators than mr mcconnell , who to crush every republican primary challenger \( he did \) he also blacklisted republicans who worked with groups supporting insurgents privately , mcconnell aides say they are less concerned these days about the impact of senators like mr cruz , whom they describe as an army of one mr mcconnell believes his standing with conservative voters is solid and he has the votes to prove it he over a tea party conservative , 60 percent to 35 percent an showed him beating his main primary opponent 53 percent to 33 percent among tea party voters he and his allies dismiss their tea party opponents as forprofit conservatives because of the fundraising they do in the name of purifying the republican brand the forprofit wing of the republican party will always have a voice , but after this last election , they do n't have much credibility , said scott reed , the us chamber of commerce s senior political strategist i'm not sure many folks will listen to it much longer governing still matters , and the good news is , everybody who was elected is into governing most of the republicans just elected to the senate appear to be team players cory gardner of colorado , shelley moore capito of west virginia and steve daines of montana are all lowkey members of congress thom tillis of north carolina is the speaker of the state house and a favorite of the party establishment still , tea party conservatives are a formidable voting bloc mr mcconnell will have to negotiate an especially cautious balance between their demands and those of the senators in his conference who are contemplating running for president in 2016 , and so need the support of the party s base with no one is this more fraught than mr mcconnell s fellow kentuckian , senator rand paul mr paul and his advisers say that they recognize tea party supporters helped deliver the senate for the republicans , and that the party ignores them at its peril they showed up , said doug stafford , a senior adviser to mr paul you ca n't look at the turnout models , the polling preelection and the results , and not think that conservatives showed up for this they did
krasnaya polyana , russia when the coach of the canadian women s snowboarding team gathers his belongings each morning , he makes sure he has his hat , his sunglasses , his cellphone and 100 swiss francs the coach , marcel mathieu , works for canada and is currently in russia , but like many people in his line of work , he needs swiss currency the reason that mathieu and many other coaches across most olympic sports make certain they always have a specific amount of cash on hand is that if they want to protest an official decision during competition , they need more than just a strong opinion and an angry yell they also need money unlike major professional sports like soccer , baseball or football , protests are relatively common in olympic sports , and each sport s governing body has strict rules about the protocol there are time restrictions there are guidelines on whether the protest can be oral or must be in writing and there is , ultimately , the bill and do n't try to pull out a credit card at the protest table it has to be cash , said ivor lehotan , the vice president for information for the international biathlon union he added , dryly it s like a processing fee depending on the sport , the fee varies for luge , it is 50 euros \( about 67 \) crosscountry skiing , like snowboard and alpine skiing , demands 100 swiss francs \( about 112 \) but stipulates that all protests must be submitted in english bobsled and skeleton are among the most expensive they require a deposit of 100 euros before any protest will even be considered if multiple countries want to make a similar protest , sharing the tab is allowed there are rules , too , about what can be protested , and coaches have to be well versed on all the nuances in luge , for example , athletes can protest to a jury if something happens during their run that they feel was unfair the only exception listed in the rulebook \? being distracted by a camera flash is not grounds for a protest sometimes at races you will see coaches walking around carrying rulebooks , said peter van wees , who is an executive board member of the fibt , which oversees bobsled and skeleton then if you look close , you will see that they have 100 euros sticking out the top of the rulebook they are showing everyone that they are ready the reasoning behind the francsforfairness plan is not complicated in an effort to weed out the athletes and associations who were the most frequent protesters , most governing bodies opted to make the most egregious complainers pay literally for the time that officials had to spend investigating and issuing a ruling not surprisingly , the majority of protests do not succeed most recently , the australians known in the sliding world as alltooregular grousers protested the results of thursday s women s skeleton race , claiming that the russians had unfair access to a practice area most other competitors , and the jury , found the protest unreasonable the australians' fee , however , was gladly accepted \( in most instances , the protest money goes into the governing body s development fund \) it might not seem like a lot of money , said darrin steele , who is the chief executive of the united states bobsled and skeleton federation and an fibt executive board member but for a lot of the countries there are tiny , tiny budgets , so the fee makes them think whether this is something they really want to do olympic history is littered with stories of controversial protests david wallechinsky , an olympic historian , cited one from the 1936 berlin games in which arie van vliet , a dutch cyclist , was clearly blocked by the german toni merkens during the first race of the besttwooutofthree sprint final van vliet immediately held up his hand to appeal , but the race jury deliberated for so long that the second race had begun before a decision was reached merkens won that one , too , claiming the gold medal the dutch team then filed a more formal protest , but the governing body did not disqualify merkens for his blatant foul , choosing instead to simply fine him 100 german marks while allowing him to keep his medal that was one of the most bizarre decisions , wallechinsky said at the 2012 london games , there were several protests in gymnastics a sport notorious for them including one , from japan on a scoring question , that was upheld and the japanese got their money back while gymnastics requires a 300 deposit to file a protest , that money is refunded if the protest is upheld american olympic fans also remember the drawnout saga from the 2004 games , when paul hamm won the gold medal in the gymnastics allaround only to endure a protest from the south koreans , who contended that their athlete , yang taeyoung , had been given an incorrect starting value on the parallel bars if the value had been calculated correctly , the south koreans said , yang would have won instead of hamm that dispute ultimately went to the court for arbitration in sport , which ruled that it did not have jurisdiction but also noted that it appeared the south koreans had not followed procedure in their protest because they did not file it in a timely manner rulings like that are why coaches and officials are often fanatical about making sure they always find an atm before heading to the competition venue mathieu said he often handed his money to a colleague i sometimes have spent it on food , he admitted and steele , the united states bobsled and skeleton executive , said most teams have a designated person who is responsible for holding the money we put it in an envelope , he said of course , not all sports require their participants to ante up before protesting curling the rare sport that does not use referees \( the players largely police themselves \) takes a more egalitarian approach to dispute resolution our game , said daniel parker , an executive with the world curling federation , is played within the spirit of curling' accordingly , parker added , curling s protest fee is in line with its reputation as the world s friendliest sport there is none

after a road start a few weeks ago , jacob degrom was back at the team hotel , flipping through tv channels , when something caught his eye it was a slowmotion replay of him throwing a changeup he noticed his front side fly open and his arm drag , the same way it had last season , when he was struggling in the minors oh , that s not good , degrom thought to himself when degrom s arm dragged , his pitches flattened out he soon corrected his mechanics with the help of the pitching coach , dan warthen , and returned to form this was another example why the were enamored with him they loved his demeanor , his dedication , how he studied the game they said he truly wanted to be great his ascent continued tuesday , when he threw seven scoreless innings and led the mets to an win over the at citi field his 11 strikeouts tied a career high his single in the second inning started a rally he looked as sharp as he had all season he had renewed the mets' hope this was their fourth win in five games and was , as it so happened , their 4 , 000th win in franchise history manager terry collins had stressed the importance of this fourgame series when it started monday , the braves were atop the national league east , and the mets were 10 games back this was their best chance , if not their last chance , to make a run these are big games for us , and he knows it , collins said of degrom so it s good to have him in there , because that s the only way he s going to improve heeding collins s words , degrom came out firing , striking out five batters over the first two innings he fooled andrelton simmons with a curveball that bounced in front of the plate and beat freddie freeman with a high 96mileperhour fastball degrom \( 25 \) looked determined to outpitch julio teheran , the braves' 23yearold starter who has emerged as a budding star teheran , named to the allstar team , had a 229 earned run average coming in , among the best in baseball last week , he dominated the mets , holding them to a run in seven innings on teheran s second pitch , though , curtis granderson hit a solo home run off the facing of the rightfield porch it was his 14th home run , and it continued the mets' recent power surge they have homered in eight consecutive home games , tying their longest such streak at citi field teheran \( 86 \) was clearly not at his best , and the mets pounced they piled on three runs on the second , all with two outs , sparked by a single from degrom and a tworun double by daniel murphy they tacked on another run in the third , and by the time they chased teheran in the fourth , every mets starter had at least one hit this was among teheran s worst showings all season he had allowed the secondmost earned runs \( 5 \) , the most hits \( 11 \) , and this tied for his shortest outing the mets finished with 18 hits , which set a new season high and set a record for them at citi field degrom , meanwhile , was pitching masterfully he struck out the side in order in the fifth tommy la stella looked as if he might spin like a top as he swung at one changeup jason heyward lined out with two runners on to end the sixth dan uggla flipped his bat when he struck out looking at a slider to end the seventh so many times this season , degrom had been the victim of low run support or a bullpen meltdown he had made six quality starts and had only one win to show for it pitching with a lead put him at ease he did not issue a walk , and of the seven hits he allowed , none went for extra bases he joined nolan ryan and dwight gooden as the only pitchers in franchise history with at least two 11strikeout games in their first 11 appearances he showed you he can certainly compete in this league , collins said if he keeps going out there and using both sides of the plate , and throwing his offspeed stuff for strikes , because of his competitiveness , he s going to be just fine the mets' defense supported him nicely , too murphy turned a nifty double play at second eric young jr made a diving catch in left field everything that could have gone wrong did not that is , until degrom left the braves scored a run in the eighth , as juan lagares was slow relaying a throw to the infield , and two more in the ninth for a brief moment , the mets were teetering rain had started to fall and trash swirled around the infield it seemed fitting this was how the mets looked without degrom on the mound , as if the world was about to end but jeurys familia composed himself , restoring order and securing the win by striking out justin upton
louisville , ky the affordable care act allowed robin evans , an ebay warehouse packer earning 9 an hour , to sign up for medicaid this year she is being treated for high blood pressure and graves' disease , an autoimmune disorder , after years of going uninsured and rarely seeing doctors i'm tickled to death with it , ms evans , 49 , said of her new coverage as she walked around the kentucky state fair recently with her daughter , who also qualified for medicaid under the law it s helped me out a bunch but ms evans scowled at the mention of president obama nobody do n't care for nobody no more , and i think he s got a lot to do with that , she explained and said she would vote this fall for senator mitch mcconnell , the kentucky republican and minority leader , who is fond of saying the health care law should be pulled out root and branch ms evans said she did not want the law repealed but had too many overall reservations about democrats to switch her vote born and raised republican , she said of herself i ai n't planning on changing now kentucky is arguably one of the health law s biggest early successes , with about 10 percent of the population getting coverage through the state s online insurance marketplace albeit mostly through medicaid , not private plans and none of the that plagued other enrollment websites the uninsured rate here has fallen to 119 percent from 204 percent , according to a recent that found only arkansas had experienced a steeper decline but there is little evidence that the expansion of health coverage will help kentucky democrats in this fall s midterm elections republicans hold all of the state s congressional seats except for one , in a district centered in louisville , and none are considered vulnerable this year republicans , who already control the state senate , have a chance of taking the state house of representatives , where democrats hold an eightseat majority and several recent polls have put mr mcconnell ahead of his democratic opponent , alison lundergan grimes , even though his approval ratings are tepid mr mcconnell and other republicans here , while more focused on other issues , like protecting kentucky s coal industry , continue to attack the health law as a symbol of government overreach and democratic bungling and far from flaunting kentucky s strong enrollment numbers , democratic candidates most notably ms grimes have remained reticent about the law , even its successes in many ways , the role that the law is playing in kentucky politics reflects what is going on nationally as the midterm elections approach the law remains deeply unpopular among republicans and independents , and republican candidates still use it to flog their democratic opponents , although not as singlemindedly as before that is partly because voters are more focused on other issues a recent found that among likely voters who think the country is on the wrong track , only 5 percent blamed issues with obamacare more pointed to concerns about the economy , foreign policy , president obama and congress why would people like ms evans who are benefiting from the law vote for candidates who would dismantle it \? gov steven l beshear , one of the few democrats forcefully promoting the law here , said many were driven by a dislike of mr obama a recent found that only 33 percent of likely voters here approved of his job performance , and that 63 percent disapproved the campaign by the affordable care act s critics against it has been very effective in demonizing the phrase obamacare and anything to do with the president , said mr beshear , who cannot seek reelection next year because of term limits so i think you find a reluctance on the part of people , even though the law is benefiting them , to publicly acknowledge it interest groups and candidates , including mr mcconnell , have run more than 10 , 000 broadcast television spots here since january 2013 that mention the law in a negative way , according to kantar media s campaign media analysis group kantar found only one positive , from elisabeth jensen , the democrat challenging representative andy barr in the state s sixth congressional district the ad referred to mr barr s votes to repeal the law , warning that he would restrict our access to affordable health care ms jensen , who is running in a swing district , also ran a praising the law last spring at the state fair s annual ham breakfast , mr beshear tried to humanize the law , describing how several farmers in attendance had signed up for the new coverage and how one had used it to check out a spot that turned out to be skin cancer it s not about the president , he told the crowd of 1 , 600 , who did not applaud once during the six minutes he spent discussing the law it s about you it s about your families it s about your children that message has not persuaded people like billy bishop of lexington , who is retired and gets health insurance through his former employer he said his outofpocket costs had risen sharply while his coverage had gotten worse he blamed the affordable care act particularly its expansion of medicaid to many more lowincome americans i have n't heard anything good about it , to be honest , said mr bishop , who has diabetes and heart stents i 've heard with this , you ca n't get doctors' appointments and people get put on wait lists for surgery nonetheless , at the state fair , mr bishop , 57 , and his wife , cindy , 56 , stopped by an information booth run by kynect , the state s health insurance marketplace mrs bishop was curious about whether she could get less expensive coverage through kynect , even though her husband refused to consider it for himself she took some brochures but said that regardless of what she learned about the cost , she and her husband would vote for mr mcconnell mrs bishop said ms grimes was with obama on everything , and she called the president the worst we 've ever had at the teeming fairgrounds in late august , the kynect booth handed out 26 , 000 reusable shopping bags stamped with its logo and tollfree number , and more fairgoers were clutching them than corn dogs or cotton candy crowds also gathered around information booths sponsored by the managedcare companies providing medicaid coverage for the newly insured , one of which had a star university of louisville basketball player greeting passersby one day all the marketing did not sway teri eisenmenger of louisville , who said she was against the health care law even though it had allowed her adult daughter to get medicaid coverage i do n't like that people are being forced to buy insurance , ms eisenmenger , 58 , said , referring to the law s requirement that most americans get health coverage starting this year or face a tax penalty she is insured through her husband s job at a car dealership , but the premiums are high , she said 1 , 000 a month for the two of them and they might join a christian health care sharing ministry instead members of these pay monthly fees that help members with medical bills , and they are exempt from the penalty for not having insurance most people are going to see things through their partisan default position , said representative john yarmuth , kentucky s lone democrat in congress they separate the personal impact of policies from their perception of what is good for the country despite his unyielding attacks on the law , mr mcconnell also takes positions that suggest he knows it would be difficult to dismantle on whether he would take away medicaid from new enrollees and suggested , without explaining how , that the kynect marketplace could survive even if the law were repealed yet he frequently calls the law a job killer that is driving up premiums and deductibles for consumers charges that resonate with the many kentuckians who are not directly benefiting from the law he has spoken about the law at about 70 hospitals around the state , telling doctors , nurses and administrators that the law is a trilliondollar hit on those of you who provide health care to the rest of us at one such gathering last month , at paul b hall regional medical center in paintsville , dana keaton collett , the hospital s director of rehabilitation services , told mr mcconnell that her insurance rates were rising so sharply that it was not worth keeping her coverage this is the consequence of this awful law , mr mcconnell replied , adding , i'm going to take you on the road with me \( experts say that although insurance costs are indeed going up , they have been doing so for years , and a slowdown in the rate of healthcost growth since 2009 has moderated the increase in premiums for most people \) ms grimes typically avoids talking about the health care law but , when pressed , says she wants to improve it at a candidate forum here last month , during which mr mcconnell called the law catastrophic , ms grimes said , we have to work to streamline the affordable care act to make sure there are n't overburdensome regulations on our businesses she also called for letting more people keep their old insurance policies , a point of contention that emerged last fall when several million people s plans were canceled because they did not comply with the law s coverage requirements some party activists and political analysts say ms grimes is missing an opportunity to excite the democratic base and perhaps siphon votes from mr mcconnell in places like southern and eastern kentucky , where the drop in the uninsured rate has been especially steep by not vigorously defending the law it may be her last , best chance , said al cross , a longtime kentucky political reporter for now , ms grimes is focusing on painting mr mcconnell as a creature of washington who will perpetuate partisan battles and gridlock i think she realizes , as does the mcconnell camp , that this is not going to be an issue that s going to sway people that much one way or the other , mr beshear said so she is concentrating her efforts on where they should be , reminding people of the last 30 years of senator mcconnell and the fact that he is part of the problem in washington , and not part of the solution some kentucky voters seem receptive to that message karen ekstrom , 60 , who described herself as an independent voter , said she and her husband were deeply disappointed with the private insurance he got through kynect with the cost at 439 a month , i really feel we are being ripped off , she said ms ekstrom , who works for a medical marketing company in lexington , is ambivalent about mr obama but she said she planned to vote for ms grimes , mostly because she sees mr mcconnell as spending too much time trying to block mr obama on the health care law and other initiatives i'm tired of that , she said it s a law let it go , move on and get some stuff done
golf courses are covered in hazards ponds , bunkers , thick rough but here is another the golf clubs themselves scientists have determined that striking a rock while swinging a titanium club can create a shower of sparks that are hot enough , and last long enough , to start a brush fire the finding , by researchers at the university of california , irvine , clears up what fire officials in southern california have seen as a mystery the origin of two recent golf course fires , including one that burned 25 acres and injured a firefighter in 2010 steve concialdi , a captain with the orange county fire authority , in irvine , said that in both incidents , golfers using 3irons with titaniumalloy heads had said they hit the ground and created sparks that started the fires that was hard for anybody to believe , concialdi said we were thinking they were started by cigars or cigarettes the authority approached irvine researchers , including james c earthman , a professor of materials science , about verifying the golfers' claims although earthman plays golf only occasionally , his interest was piqued because he knew that bits of titanium could burn spontaneously when exposed to air he remembered an accident from his undergraduate days at rice , when another student was cleaning some titanium particles in a chamber the rag ignited in his hand , earthman said that left a pretty big impression on me he and his colleagues set up a test tee in which they embedded rocks earthman approached a robot manufacturer about borrowing one of its machines to take the swings , he said , but when they found out we were going to hit rocks with it , they declined so he and others took the swings , using three titanium clubs and three with stainless steel heads hitting rocks turned out to be no problem i discovered that it s very easy to crush a rock with a golf club , earthman said like going through butter they recorded the results with a highspeed video camera and reported in a recent in the journal fire and materials that all of the titanium clubs created sparks while none of the steel ones did the impact with the rock abraded the titanium surface , producing small particles up to about onefiftieth of an inch in diameter that burned for up to a second , at temperatures high enough to cause dry vegetation to ignite the real danger seemed to be when you had titanium on the sole of the club and on the leading edge , earthman said that created a lot of sparks , including some that flew as far as four feet the more sparks you have , the further they go and the longer they last , you increase the probability of ignition , he said concialdi said that in one of the fires , the golfer and his partner tried unsuccessfully to put it out using ice from their beer cooler the blaze consumed about an acre , but more damage was averted when a concrete cart path acted as a firebreak given the drought in california and the extreme fire danger , concialdi said , his department had advice for duffers who used titanium clubs and hit a ball into a rocky spot we 're just asking golfers to either take a penalty or , if your fellow golfers will allow you to improve your lie , do it , he said but do not hit the ball in this type of area
montreal , so the reigning clich goes , is a peaceable country , the quaint counterpoint to the aggressive ways of its southern neighbor and while part of that clich is hardly true we 've seen our fair share of wars its central idea generally holds canadians tend to be less reactionary in the face of a perceived threat witness how canada did n't participate in the vietnam war , or the iraq invasion in 2003 cooler heads prevailed , perhaps because \( to borrow another clich \) they were watching a hockey game two recent attacks on canadian soldiers threaten to lay waste to this cheery sensibility on oct 20 , a 25yearold recent convert to islam hit two soldiers with his car in a quebec town about 25 miles outside montreal , killing one before a police officer shot him less than 48 hours later , another islamic convert shot and killed a soldier before dying in a shootout in ottawa with the police and kevin vickers , parliament s sergeantatarms the two attacks sparked nearinstantaneous calls for an increase in surveillance powers for canada s law enforcement and intelligence agencies in recent weeks , i have been saying that our laws and police powers need to be strengthened in the area of surveillance , detention and arrest , prime minister stephen harper told parliament a day after the ottawa attack they need to be much strengthened i assure members that work , which is already underway , will be expedited mr harper is right the canadian government s attempts to erode individual freedoms in the name of security started well before the deaths of the two soldiers last fall , the government shoehorned increased internet surveillance powers into an antibullying bill , which would grant legal immunity to telecommunications companies that voluntarily hand over customer data the bill would also further lower the standards of evidence for police officers seeking to monitor internet activities more recently , the government introduced legislation that would give blanket anonymity to informants for canada s spy agency this would potentially allow for a dereliction of a basic principle of justice an accused person would be unable to face his accusers yet the attacks have apparently loosened the tongues of those in government wanting the country to go even further the government , justice minister peter mackay recently mused , should consider further powers to monitor and remove offensive websites , lest they lead to a poisoning of young minds jason kenney , the minister for multiculturalism , recently suggested that those suspected of terrorist sympathies be subject to preventative detention which the criminal code already permits for longer time periods , and a lower legal threshold for the government to detain them it s worth considering that such measures would not have prevented the recent attacks michael zehafbibeau , the perpetrator of the ottawa shooting , had little online presence his arrest record , a grab bag of drunken driving , drug possession , assault and weapons charges , suggests teenage overindulgence and inner demons , not a budding terrorist having drifted from his family , he lived on the margins of society for years he 'd recently told an acquaintance that the devil was following him around in the case of martin couturerouleau , who hit the two soldiers with his car , law enforcement had already revoked his passport , and he 'd been under surveillance for months including at the mosque he attended he simply had n't done anything to warrant arrest , preventive or otherwise his online presence , meanwhile , was largely an islamicthemed cacophony of antisemitism and cutandpaste screeds against christianity while disturbing , only in the most totalitarian of states would this sort of thing constitute a crime besides , canadian intelligence and law enforcement agencies have performed their jobs admirably without any increased powers canadian law enforcement has prevented at least two potentially disastrous terror strikes on canadian soil in the last decade and the country s spy agency , the canadian security intelligence service , is n't without resources its budget has more than doubled in the last 12 years canadians need only look to the south to see how attacks on individuals and establishments ca n't usually be prevented by increased surveillance of a country s civilians the united states arguably is home to the world s largest and most sophisticated intelligencegathering network , the excesses of which have been documented by leaks from the former national security agency contractor edward j snowden yet none of this prevented the breach of the white house in september , in which an iraq war veteran scaled the white house fence and made it to within feet of where the president and his family live before being apprehended nor has surveillance hindered the ability of various gunmen to inflict mass murder on innocents throughout the years as the former vice president al gore noted last year , in a speech decrying the folly of such mass intelligence gathering , when you are looking for a needle in a haystack , it s not always wise to pile more hay on the haystack theoretically , it would be possible for the canadian government to legislate itself the powers to prevent all such attacks yet the tradeoff constant surveillance , criminalization of dissent , restriction of free movement and the economy would make the country unlivable it would be a travesty if the actions of two troubled individuals moved the country closer to that possibility
east rutherford , nj from the moment two weeks earlier that seattle cornerback richard sherman made his postgame , highdecibel rant on the way to the , he became the attentionsucking foil to denver quarterback s measured , softspoken personality and career turned out , there were a lot of other foils to manning s quest for another super bowl title , sprinkled all across the seattle defense , during the ' 438 victory on sunday night there was safety kam chancellor s ooohinducing tackle on manning s first completion , a 2yarder to demaryius thomas , and then his firstquarter interception of another manning pass there was defensive tackle chris clemons and linebacker cliff avril converging on manning in the second quarter , avril getting enough of the quarterback s arm on a thirdand13 pass to send the ball skyward it dropped into the arms of linebacker malcolm smith , who rumbled 69 yards for a touchdown and there was clemons , again , pressuring manning on a fourth down late in the first half , barely tipping a pass that fell harmlessly to the turf by then , seattle had a suffocating lead , and it was reasonable to wonder whether the highestscoring team in nfl history might become the first team to fail to score in the super bowl the seahawks' defense all sandwich tackles and wicked hits played at a faster speed than the , like toys charged with new batteries and it seemed the only defender not to make a highlight play was sherman they have n't played a defense that flies around like we do , that hits like we do , and we just do it every single play , linebacker bobby wagner said we figured that the longer and longer the game went , they were going to fall eventually sherman , playing left cornerback and guarding whichever of denver s receivers lined up to his side , was rarely tested he allowed a short reception early in the third quarter but was hurt on the next play after a few minutes on the turf , sherman bounded to his feet and , to the cheers of the supercharged seattle fans , jogged to the sideline with a cheerful gait a couple of plays later , he smothered thomas on a deep ball that fell incomplete near the end zone when manning followed by throwing across the middle to wes welker , a dependable safety valve for the denver offense , chancellor broke up the pass early in the fourth quarter , sherman was helped off the field with a right ankle injury and lifted onto a cart , which drove him to the locker room sherman hobbled into the locker room on crutches after the game , his right foot bare , as his teammates celebrated the victory he said he sprained his ankle and insisted he would be all right hey , 29 , he shouted to safety earl thomas come over here give me some love ! the night before the game , manning was awarded the league s most valuable player award for the fifth time but on sunday , his wellchronicled presnap machinations made him look like a traffic cop trying to bring order to a demolition derby sherman stayed mostly out of the fray he was a diversion , just as he was for the two weeks leading up to the game in the nfc championship game against san francisco , sherman made the gamesaving pass deflection in his postgame interview , on live television , he angrily insulted 49ers receiver michael crabtree seahawks coach pete carroll advised his star cornerback to keep the focus on the team , and sherman apologized but it did not stop a divisive flood of attention as fans , pundits and journalists set off to try to explain sherman s behavior in a broader context his upbringing in compton , calif , his stanford education , his surprising rise as one of the nfl s best defensive players at media day on tuesday , a circus of an event that is to journalism what karaoke is to music , sherman s podium was surrounded by waves of reporters those reporters , presumably , would have gone to listen to other players if they were not afraid to miss what sherman might say he was loquacious , playful and complimentary more like himself , certainly , than the bombastic 10 seconds of live television that led to all the attention in the first place the effect was to deflect attention from sherman s teammates , which might have been an advantage for a team that had no players who had been in the super bowl before when it mattered , they took turns starring on sunday , an ensemble cast that combined for one of the greatest defensive performances in the super bowl at one point early in the second quarter , seattle had a 150 lead and had outgained the broncos , 161 yards to 11 seattle had nine first downs , denver none by halftime , after a couple of denver drives gained momentum that was ultimately stuffed by the seattle defense , it was 220 manning had completed 17 of 23 passes for 104 yards , with two interceptions his passer rating was 463 , the type that loses games and far from the 1151 that manning had during the regular season for the game , manning completed 34 of 49 passes for 280 yards and a touchdown his rating was 735 every time it looked as if manning and the broncos might gain traction , the seahawks repelled them midway through the third quarter , seattle cornerback byron maxwell punched the ball out of thomas s hands after a long gain smith , the linebacker who already had an interception return for a touchdown , recovered thomas beat maxwell on the final play of the third quarter to haul in a 14yard touchdown to close the score to 366 , before a 2point conversion but the only suspense it ended was whether the broncos would score at all on seattle s defense after all the bluster , it turned out that the seahawks did not need sherman s mouth to make a statement
newberry , sc a shabby bunkhouse sits just beyond the shadows of this small city s colossal kraft meatpacking plant inside live a few older men with nowhere else to go , and several younger men who pay to throw down a mattress there is also leon jones mr jones , 64 , has an intellectual disability and a swollen right hand that aches from 40 years of hanging live turkeys on shackles that swing them to their slaughter his wallet contains no photos or identification , as if , officially , he does not exist and yet he is more than just another anonymous grunt in a meat factory mr jones may be the last working member of the socalled henry s boys men recruited from texas institutions decades ago to eviscerate turkeys , only to wind up living in virtual servitude , without many basic rights this may sound familiar in 2009 , a sister of one of the men complained to about exploitation in a bunkhouse in iowa , prompting investigations , reforms and a momentous court verdict concerning the workplace abuse of people with disabilities this year , the new york times published and its aftermath that seemed to be the end to an outrageous but isolated iowa story men abused , rescued and reintegrated into the community but a few lingering clues suggested that at least one other henry s boy was out there a leon jones , living beside a south carolina turkey plant so , on a recent autumn morning , i knocked on the door of this bunkhouse , sitting beside a mobile home with its door open in abandonment , not welcome hi , said leon jones tall and with an easy smile , mr jones has been working turkey ever since he left a state institution in 1969 for decades , he hung live birds from shackles now he works an evening shift , sweeping up and disposing of turkeys that arrive by truck already dead doas , they are called he led me to the slapdash dormitory he shares with men who come and go his small bed was in a corner , a few feet from a young man wearing a blackknit jesus cap and watching spanishlanguage television at a loud volume , and not far from a bathroom with open stalls and a wet floor mr jones s locker contained clothes , cowboy boots and a plastic envelope of old cards and letters , the last one from 1992 he also nodded to a small radio on a night stand i got a radio and everything , he said mr jones may have his radio , but what he does not have are most amenities , any connection to government services for people with disabilities and the company of another henry s boy , his older brother , carl wayne carl wayne jones , 65 , lives now in a suburban iowa home with three other men and 24hour staff supervision leon jones has not seen him in decades because their texas bosses decided long ago that carl wayne would work for a client in iowa , while leon would work for one here in south carolina he was nice to me , leon jones said of his brother here is how mr jones came to live in a beatendown bunkhouse many hundreds of miles from his brother and from his home state working turkey , still the jones brothers were the sons of a texas oil worker and his wife , whose name leon jones could not recall a long time ago , he said as boys , they were sent to the abilene state school , an institution for people with developmental disabilities did he like the state school \? nooooo , he quickly said when he was 18 , mr jones was selected to live and learn basic skills at a ranch in texas' hill country the operation , henry s turkey service , trained mr jones and dozens of other young men like him including his brother in the artificial insemination of turkeys namely , to catch and milk the toms , and rush the semen to the henhouse the men became proficient in this dirty job , and a demand developed for their services gradually , the company dispatched crews to work at turkey plants in iowa , missouri , illinois and south carolina , moving employees around like chess pawns to meet the needs of clients most of the operations eventually closed , leaving only a bunkhouse in atalissa , iowa , where carl wayne jones wound up , and one here in newberry , where leon jones landed the owners of henry s turkey service maintained that they had taken in men whom no one else wanted they paid them a subminimum wage under a federal law one they abused that permits lower wages for people with disabilities , based on productivity they deducted most of the men s earnings to cover room , board and other expenses and they allowed their atalissa bunkhouse to descend into squalor , neglect and abuse when the situation in atalissa was exposed in early 2009 , leading to the men s rescue and a sizable judgment against the company in a case brought by the federal equal employment opportunity commission , few knew of its south carolina ties the reason the company had long since sold its newberry operation and , effectively , leon jones and a few other men to a former employee but kim cronkleton and natalie neelmclaughlin , two social workers for the iowa department of human services , were nagged by loose ends they saw leon jones s name on an old company list and remembered that carl wayne jones , one of the men just rescued , had talked of a brother it was always on my mind that this was still going on , ms cronkleton said but nobody ever laid eyes on leon now here was leon jones , as well as three other former henry s boys claude wren , 75 , who left the mexia state school in 1969 johnny hickman , 71 , who left mexia in 1970 and carlos morris , 60 , who left the austin state school in 1973 but mr jones is the last one still working turkey his boss is paul byrd , who owns both the bunkhouse and a company that supplies workers to the kraft plant he lives in texas , but when he visits his business here , he stays in a large furnished apartment , behind a door just steps from mr jones s bed mr byrd said the men s payments are all deposited directly into an association account , from which the costs of their room and board are deducted none have personal bank accounts , he said , because i do n't have birth certificates or anything on them to get id when it was pointed out that they must have had identification if they were receiving federal benefits , mr byrd , who has owned the company since 1985 , said i do n't know how all this got started i have absolutely no paperwork on them mr byrd also said mr jones would be retired soon , but for now was working part time he washes the floor down on the ramps , he said the dead birds that come out of the trucks , he chucks them mr byrd said mr jones uses his 8anhour earnings and his benefits to pay for his bed and food , about 800 a month the company gives mr jones 50 for his weekly trips to walmart , mr byrd said , although he might spend 1 , 000 or so on clothes and a mattress come christmastime the rest of his money is kept locked away , in an envelope i have n't counted what he s got in the envelope , mr byrd said it s about 6 , 000 the life savings from 40 years' hard labor he said mr jones loves to eat and never goes on vacation i 'd love to take him to the beach or something , mr byrd said but , man , it s hard for one person to keep everything going the boss paused , and then said i know it s a long way from a perfect situation mr jones spends his free time watching sports on television in the worn rec room he follows three football teams , each a reflection of where he has ties the dallas cowboys of texas , the university of iowa hawkeyes and the clemson tigers of south carolina when i asked him what he 'd like to say to his brother , carl wayne , he said say , how ya doing \? ' a few days later , mr jones received a visit from robert a canino , the dallasbased lawyer for the eeoc who won a decisive verdict against henry s turkey service last year seeing a connection to the iowa case , he traveled to newberry to meet mr jones and to discuss his troubling circumstances with state officials one day , mr canino drove mr jones to the public library for a surprise a computer monitor flickered , and then , through skype , there appeared a man wearing a dallas cowboys cap his older brother , carl wayne , whom he had not seen for so very long the elder mr jones explained that he lived in a house in waterloo , iowa , with a couple of the henry s men , and that he had a girlfriend he also passed on the news that their mother had died a long time ago the two brothers caught up as best they could they talked about favorite foods , about their cowboys and about maybe , just maybe , getting together sometime
london for a decade now , the tribal town of miram shah in north waziristan has been a slowburning embarrassment to the pakistani military right at the gates of an army base , taliban kidnappers used the town telephone exchange to make ransom demands suicide bombers bided their time in highwalled compounds there before attacking pakistan s major cities notorious militants like the former taliban leader hakimullah mehsud kept houses a few miles from the base those factors made miram shah a magnet for jihadists from across the region , and the world punjabi sectarian killers , uighurs fighting china , al qaeda commanders plotting mayhem in the west the bazaar is bustling with chechens , uzbeks , russians , bosnians , some from eu countries , and of course our arab brothers , david headley , an american who joined the pakistani terrorist group lashkaretaiba , wrote in a 2009 email the pakistani military moved to erase that blemish early monday , when soldiers fanned out across the town , occupying bus stands and shops as they began wresting the town from militant control infantry and special forces units moved from house to house , uncovering networks of tunnels and bomb factories , the military said in a statement at least 15 militants were killed and three soldiers injured in sporadic exchanges of gun and rocket fire , it said , in an account that could not be independently verified the sweep through miram shah marked the second phase of a broader operation against the pakistani taliban and allied militants in north waziristan for the past two weeks , the military unleashed air and artillery strikes as up to 500 , 000 civilians fled the area for neighboring districts more than 30 , 000 troops are said to be involved in the north waziristan operation , ostensibly prompted by a deadly militant assault on pakistan s largest airport , in karachi , on june 8 but military officials said the offensive had been in the works for months , as governmentled peace talks with the taliban faltered , then collapsed information on the fighting , however , is highly limited waziristan is a restricted and perilous area for journalists in normal times , and in recent weeks the military has pushed even local reporters out in its news release on monday , the military press office said that 376 militants and 17 soldiers had been killed in fighting so far the pakistani taliban , whose forces have reportedly fled towns like miram shah for the thickly forested mountains of north waziristan or safer neighboring districts , have not offered a toll the pakistani military s implicit claim that no civilians have died seems unlikely , particularly given its track record of such casualties in previous campaigns in the tribal belt refugees from waziristan told of a more indiscriminate assault in peshawar on saturday , a 15yearold girl named zubana lay on a hospital bed at the khyber teaching hospital , her mother and two brothers at her side her lower body was swathed in bandages that covered what doctors described as serious burns she moaned from pain as she spoke i was preparing lunch for my husband when there was an explosion , and the room went on fire , said zubana , who has just one name i do n't know what happened after that my mother says our house was destroyed i wish i had died her mother , toraan , said her daughter looked like a piece of burned coal when she rescued her from the rubble of their home in khaisoor zar , south of mir ali town she believed the army had carried out an airstrike near their house we saw big planes in the sky that suddenly started dropping bombs , she said the attack occurred on june 9 , one day after the militant assault on karachi airport , she said on that day , the military reported retaliatory airstrikes in khyber district , 100 miles to the northeast , but none around mir ali but it is not unusual for military actions in the secluded tribal belt to go unreported for now , the fighting is concentrated in the towns of north waziristan , miram shah and mir ali , where military experts say they expect pakistani soldiers to face relatively light resistance the fight is expected to be harder , however , if they push into the surrounding mountains the determined military drive follows years of american pressure to crack down on militant havens in north waziristan , which has been the target of at least 273 central intelligence agency drone strikes since 2004 more than any other area in the world american officials suspected that pakistan s reluctance to fight in waziristan stemmed from the military s desire to protect the haqqani network , a formidable fighting group that is a central element of the afghan insurgency and enjoys longstanding ties with the military s interservices intelligence agency pakistani generals have staunchly denied any collusion with the haqqanis , but have admitted that their spies maintain contacts with the group whatever the exact nature of that relationship , in launching the north waziristan ground assault , pakistani officials seem to have acknowledged that allowing militants to control a major town was bad news for their own country , as well as for the west north waziristan s jihadi influx started in 2001 jihadis first fled the american invasion of afghanistan , then later , as the area became a rear base for the taliban insurgency , they arrived to join the fight against nato and afghan forces but the proliferation of jihadis also strengthened pakistan s homegrown taliban fighters , who drew money and inspiration from the foreign visitors , emboldening them to form a formidable threat to the pakistani state the potency of that challenge was underscored by the june 8 attack on the karachi airport , and , more recently , an attack on a landing passenger jet at peshawar airport that killed one passenger and caused several airlines to suspend their services to the area monday s assault on miram shah included the mobilization of tanks , artillery and gunship helicopters in support of infantry forces , a senior security official said in peshawar , speaking on the condition of anonymity this is the beginning of the search , eliminate , clear and control phase , he said there is no turning back the other challenge is humanitarian in nature about 500 , 000 villagers have fled into the adjoining khyberpakhtunkhwa province , creating the country s biggest conflictdriven humanitarian crisis since 2009 the united nations says that at least 66 , 000 people have also fled into khost province in neighboring afghanistan inside pakistan , refugees have complained bitterly about lodging conditions and inadequate facilities provided by the government at local hospitals in northwestern towns
jiangmen , china it has been decades since a train has passed through the old beijie train station in southern china on a recent winter morning , the only sign of activity came from a group of architecture students busy with their sketch pads the station is a twostory building of brick and concrete with stainedglass windows a ticket counter with metal bars still stands in the main hallway on the wall behind the counter is a copy of a train schedule from the precommunist era one silver dollar for a firstclass ticket from this station to the town of san he 70 cents for a secondclass ticket the station is the most prominent survivor of the xinning railway , an ambitious attempt by a chinese businessman who lived overseas in the early 20th century to help modernize his home county , , better known as toishan , a ricegrowing region in guangdong province that was the point of origin for many the project was the precursor of today s vaunted highspeed rails , but it was a private railway , one of china s first , and built solely through the efforts of one man clinging to a vision of strengthening china that man , chen yixi , returned to taishan after spending 40 years in the united states amassing a fortune , mostly as a labor contractor in seattle for railroad projects the money he raised for the xinning railway came primarily from chineseamericans i find it s amazing that peasants from taishan went to the us and canada to make a living and built railways , said liu jin , 46 , a professor at wuyi university in jiangmen and a director of the overseas chinese research center , as he sat in his office showing foreign visitors digital scans of the railway s stock certificates that s how they learned the technology and earned money , and then they came home and used that technology and money to contribute to the modernization of their home region scholars like mr liu have documented the rise and fall of the xinning railway to better understand the modernizing forces in china then and the role of overseas chinese in the taishan region , mr chen and his project his china dream are memorialized a statue of him stands in a pedestrian mall in taishan city , the county seat at doushan , the southern terminus of the railway , there is another statue and also a black locomotive in the main plaza one afternoon , a halfdozen members of a family posed for photographs there i do n't really know him that much , said wing chan , 31 , a mechanic from san francisco who was visiting relatives in the area he took out all his income to build the train in mr chen s home village , a 10minute drive from doushan , a sign by the europeanstyle townhouses he once owned praises his work the museum of overseas chinese in jiangmen has a large exhibition on the railroad it was arguably chen yixi who came closest to attaining the heroic stature attributed to huaqiao , or overseas chinese , in magazines known as qiaokan , wrote , a professor at the university of texas , austin , in dreaming of gold , dreaming of home , a book on transnationalism and the southern chinese that has a chapter on mr chen this wealthy seattle merchant , labor contractor , and railroad engineer conceived and partially fulfilled a plan to rescue taishan from its agricultural stagnation and transform it into a thriving commercial metropole , she wrote through family connections , mr chen first moved to the united states around 1862 , as a teenager he learned english and took engineering classes , and eventually he founded a company supplying labor for railroad projects he became a pillar of the business community in seattle in 1895 , foreign powers seized control of china s railroads through a treaty that resulted from china s defeat in a war with japan it was a significant move in what many chinese feared was a carving up of china by other nations some overseas chinese returned home to try to help build up china , and one route they adopted was to start private railways mr chen took a stab at such a project he was not the first a previous attempt by another overseas chinese businessman to build a private railway had failed mr chen s goal was to build a railway first from taishan city north to jiangmen , where passengers could take boats to and from hong kong eventually the railway would extend south to the coast of the taishan region and be linked to a vast transportation network stretching between southeast asia and europe mr chen and another taishanese man embarked on a campaign overseas that raised 27 million for the project s first stage , ms hsu wrote twothirds came from chineseamericans construction began around 1906 officials raised objections , as did villagers that forced the path of the railway to take many twists a big geographic hurdle was the niuwan river mr chen had to buy a boat from hong kong that could ferry train cars across the water the first stretch was completed in 1909 it ran from doushan in the south to gongyi , on the northern border of taishan the second section , from gongyi to jiangmen , was completed two years later in 1917 , mr chen added a trunk line connecting taishan city to baisha the lines together ran 137 kilometers , about 85 miles the railroad company suffered financial problems , from high operating costs to constant extortion by officials and there was not much of a market for the transportation of manufactured goods across taishan because it was not an industrialized area sun yatsen , the founder of the republic of china , saw potential in mr chen s plans and permitted him to build a port at tonggu , which would be one terminus in the transportation network but with corruption rampant , none of it came to pass mr chen died in 1928 , his dreams unfulfilled in any normal society , this railway would have become a lucrative business center , mr liu said but chen s dream was crushed by the chaos of china after the japanese conquered guangzhou in october 1938 , chinese officials ordered the railroad dismantled so the japanese would not be able to use it one elderly local woman remembered being paid several sacks of rice to help take it apart the glory survives in memories , which are gradually disappearing chen huajia , 84 , recalled riding the railroad as a boy with his father , who took the train from san he to taishan city to get supplies for his restaurant mr chen also remembered other uses for the railroad when the japanese started bombing from airplanes , there was one time when the explosions were close and we ran and hid beneath the railroad bridge near taishan city , he said that was frightening because the explosions were very loud we could hear the bombs as well as the machinegun fire
castellar de la frontera , spain la almoraima , a farming estate at the edge of a nature reserve , is prized by environmentalists home to one of europe s largest cork forests , it is a rare place where deer and boar roam wild within sight of the rock of gibraltar the spanish government , which owns the land , wants to sell it for as much as 300 million euros , or about 376 million , pitching it as a perfect spot for a luxury resort , including a fivestar hotel , a small airport , two golf courses and a polo grounds the proposed sale is part of a rise in public land deals that politicians around the country are promoting in hopes of filling their treasuries and accelerating an economic recovery but they are meeting strong opposition from environmentalists and others who say the deals evoke the kinds of excesses that got spain s economy into trouble in the first place after its real estate bubble burst in 2008 , the country was littered with unsold condominiums , empty arts centers and unused highways now that the economy appears to be recovering , it is back to business as usual , the opponents say the government has n't learned any lesson from the property bubble , said alejandro s nchez p rez , one of the founders of equo , a spanish environmentalist party its goal is still to promote speculative property deals , he said , with a strong focus on tourism , even if that involves handing over patrimony like la almoraima that should clearly belong to all spaniards , as it has genuine ecological rather than financial value there have been no allegations of corruption in the proposed sale of the land but opposition is fed in part by a proliferation of corruption cases in the aftermath of spain s economic crisis that showed the real estate boom to be a result of more than just reckless investment it was also fueled by a lucrative , threeway relationship in which builders acquired construction permits from politicians and financing from banks , often also supervised by the politicians from 2000 to 2008 , spain added about four million houses along its coastline , despite accusations by environmental groups that the building frenzy amounted to an illegal privatization of spanish shores in addition to concerns about the new land sales , regional governments and the administration of prime minister mariano rajoy are facing criticism for helping to regularize those deals , some of which violated regulations the government of andalusia , spain s largest region , recently introduced legislation to adjust the status of as many as 25 , 000 houses built illegally before the crisis many of the houses were acquired by sunseeking pensioners from northern europe , who claim to have never suspected irregularities spain s politicians see the new sales of public lands as a chance to shed unproductive assets , replenish their coffers , stimulate tourism and get the construction industry moving again at la almoraima , farming activities have been struggling , and spain s government is hoping to auction off the estate by early next year last year , the government injected 23 million of subsidies to keep the place running for now , la almoraima , with its lake surrounded by a vast expanse of forest , stands in contrast to the extravagance of marbella and other resorts along the costa del sol , about half an hour s drive away here , rather than shop , visitors come for the donkey rides or hunting season the estate was expropriated from rumasa , a collapsing conglomerate , by the government in 1983 isabel ugalde , the administrator of the property , said that turning the lowkey estate into a trophy tourism asset would help attract more foreign investors to a real estate market only recently emerging from the doldrums a luxury resort , ms ugalde argued , would not damage the surroundings because the new infrastructure would be built on only a tenth of the estate s 14 , 113 hectares , or 34 , 874 acres , while the rest would remain as a nature park if you go to asia , you can see amazing resorts built without any environmental damage , ms ugalde said among those interested in the estate is one of france s richest men , fran oishenri pinault , and his wife , the actress salma hayek the couple took a helicopter flight over the property earlier this year to decide whether to bid on it ms ugalde would not discuss whether mr pinault was the frontrunner to buy la almoraima yet she conceded that the investors who have shown an interest in the estate include some of the wealthiest people in the world , some of whom are just thinking about enjoying the place for themselves that has not pleased local residents or political parties opposition to the project is visible at the local town hall of castellar de la frontera , run by the united left party , which has hung a banner from its balcony denouncing the planned sale the regional government of andalusia , which is run by spain s main opposition socialist party , is opposing the sale as well it recently persuaded a court to rule against the project , by extending the area protected as a nature park to the whole estate the national government is appealing the ruling while environmentalists welcomed the support , they were quick to note that the socialists had helped accelerate spain s construction boom while they were the party in power at the national level from 2004 to 2011 the socialist opposition to the project is just part of the political game once you become the opposition party , said mr s nchez p rez of the equo party when the socialists were in power , they promoted some of the most absurd projects he cited the halfbuilt algarrobico hotel , set on a pristine beach , which has been the subject of a long court battle and is one of several disputed projects that remain unused but standing , even though the supreme court ruled against the hotel s location in 2012 similarly , the regional government of extremadura was ordered last year by the supreme court to destroy an island resort built in valdeca as , a protected nature reserve since then , the extremadura government has continued to argue against the 34 million cost of the destruction , claiming that it would be better for the environment to keep the resort as for la almoraima , jorge bezares , who represents an association of businesses and residents who live near the estate , said mr rajoy s government was showing little sensitivity toward what should have been an opportunity to preserve an emblematic and untouched estate whatever the financial logic for the government of divesting from la almoraima , most locals believe they will not share the benefits cristina castilla , who lives nearby and has been jobless for six years , gave a gloomy forecast even if a luxury resort is built on the estate , she said , all the new jobs will be given to outsiders and none will go to the people who already live here
recently , my 14yearold son , carlos , accompanied me on a trip to give a speech alongside a group of politicians in the large holding room backstage , the speakers milled about , making small talk before our speeches working as my assistant , carlos handed me a bottle of root beer , which , unbeknown to me , he had been shaking \( behold the mysteries of the 14yearold mind \) upon opening it , i sprayed a copious amount onto a distinguished member of congress notwithstanding this embarrassing moment , carlos is ordinarily a great wingman and traveling together gives me the opportunity to do one of my most important jobs demonstrating to my children that work is the epicenter of a good life all the wisdom of the sages reinforces this truth as the buddha lay dying after a 45year career seeking and teaching the way to true consciousness , it is believed that his last words were appamadena sampadetha , which means strive diligently , or , work consciously our labor should be an agreeable path to spiritual enlightenment the data confirm that hard work is correlated with wellbeing the university of michigan s panel study of income dynamics polls thousands of american families , and its 2009 results show that people who feel good about themselves work more than those who do n't it asks how often the respondents felt so sad that nothing could cheer them up my analysis of the study showed that people who felt that way none of the time worked 10 percent more hours per week than those who felt that way most of the time this holds true when we eliminate people who worked zero hours , so it is not merely that unemployed people are miserable this does n't prove that extra work hours chase away sadness , but it weakens any argument that the cure for the blues is a french workweek so vocation is crucial to leading a satisfying life who teaches this truth to children \? many traditions emphasize the role of fathers jesus defended himself to the pharisees for working on the sabbath by saying , my father is always at his work to this very day , and i , too , am working and the talmud instructs us , for a man not to teach his son a trade or profession is equivalent to teaching him to steal the best way for a father to teach this is by example this explains why a child s ability to grow up to be a productive adult is so strongly predicted by the presence of a working father in the home the princeton sociologist sara mclanahan has for decades studied what happens to sons and daughters when their fathers are absent she that after controlling for demographics , children in fatherless families are roughly twice as likely to drop out of high school as kids in intact homes even after controlling for student talent via standardized test scores , a sharp decline in grades and attendance persists and young men who grow up without a father are 15 times more likely to be idle that is , neither in the work force nor in school than those with a father in the home and this brings us to a particularly serious issue this father s day our growing national jobs deficit in 1953 , just 14 percent of adult american men were neither working nor seeking work today , that rate has more than doubled , to 30 percent and this does n't only reflect an aging population with more retired men just after world war ii , 8 percent of noninstitutionalized males ages 25 to 54 were not working today , 17 percent of that same group of men are idle for a good deal of this , we can thank the great recession and our manifestly inadequate policy responses to it the aei economist mark perry the great mancession after observing that the downturn produced the widest gender disparity in jobless rates in modern american history from december 2007 to december 2009 , 217 men lost their jobs for every 100 women who became unemployed to see where this leads without a change in course , look to athens and madrid , to rome and lisbon a combination of culture and policy have left these once great capitals increasingly despondent and idle some will always deny that there is a problem , that americans are foolish for forgoing such continental luxuries as mandatory vacations and the perfect cup of coffee and working harder instead i 've heard it a thousand times from my spanish inlaws we live to work , while they work to live woe unto us , american workaholic rubes ! but leisure and chronic idleness are very different phenomena spain s roughly 25 percent \( for both women and men \) does n't sound much like living to me its 54 percent unemployment rate for young adults does n't sound that great to carlos , either this father s day , i'm grateful to be able to take my son to work root beer and all
anaheim , calif the worst night of nick johnson s career was unfolding at the worst possible time , on a night when his arizona teammates desperately needed him for more than 37 minutes , johnson s only shot that went in the basket did not count , a 35footer that came an instant after the halftime buzzer it was that kind of night , when jumpers bounced off the rim , when floaters rolled tantalizingly around it and spun out johnson took 10 shots , and none of them fell even at the defensive end , where johnson had always made his mark , he seemed helpless like the rest of his teammates to corral guard xavier thames then t j mcconnell knocked away a pass that was being handed to thames mcconnell dived to the court to grab the ball , and as he slid on his back , he flipped it gabe york york shoveled it to johnson , who was streaking to the basket this time , with no one around him , johnson did not miss that basket loosened the tension of the evening for johnson and appeared to do the same for the wildcats , who turned back the aztecs , 7064 , in a west regional semifinal that felt more like a 15round fight topseeded arizona will play secondseeded wisconsin on saturday for a berth in the final four i do n't know if gabe did it on purpose , but he gave me the easiest bucket of the night , said johnson , who finished with 15 points seeing the ball go through the basket with that little finger roll was what i needed to get me started after johnson s layup put the wildcats ahead , 5954 , he buried a 3pointer with 1 minute 52 seconds left and then held off san diego state by sinking eight consecutive free throws there were times when johnson had to fight the feeling that it was just not his night i have to credit my teammates they did n't let me say that , johnson said i wanted to say it a few times i think it was the one where i shot a little bank shot i thought it was in , and it rolled out i just had to give it a smile knowing that so much is on me , i take that as a challenge each and every night , not just to score the ball but to make plays when i'm not doing that , it disrupts the team the rest of arizona s players had seemed to struggle just as much as johnson with center kaleb tarczewski in foul trouble and the aztecs pounding the boards and limiting arizona s transition opportunities , san diego state had an early 8point lead but two freshmen kept the wildcats afloat aaron gordon did nothing to hinder his soaring draft stock , with 15 points , 6 rebounds , 2 assists and 2 blocks in 39 minutes his performance might have been expected , but rondae hollisjefferson s was not he came off the bench to contribute 15 points and 6 rebounds it was barely enough to withstand the aztecs , who got a sterling performance from thames he scored 25 points and had an enormous influence on the game with his defense and the way he directed the aztecs' offense you 've got to give them credit , thames said they 're a great defensive team , and they just did a few more things than we did what hurts the most is that we played so hard and fell short arizona might have thought it took the aztecs' best shot when it beat them , 6960 , at rowdy viejas arena in midnovember in the four days leading to the rematch , san diego state coaches gave their players two points of emphasis being strong on the boards and limiting turnovers so the wildcats would not be able to get out and run , as they did in trouncing gonzaga on sunday if we do n't do that , we already saw what s going to happen , thames said the aztecs took the fight to arizona immediately , crashing the boards and picking up full court with mantoman defense they had also brought thousands of fans to back them arizona usually feels as if it has a homecourt advantage for tournament games , but it was a different atmosphere thursday night it felt like a home game for both teams , said san diego state forward winston shepard , who had 11 points by the time the game was three minutes old , san diego state had five offensive rebounds and skyler spencer swatted gordon s layup attempt out of bounds a tone had been set if the wildcats planned to seize control when they returned from the locker room after halftime , thames assured them it would not be easy he hit a pullup jumper to boost the aztecs' lead to 3428 and orchestrated a ball screen so tarczewski had to switch onto him thames drove , put on the brakes and used a pump fake to make tarczewski leave his feet thames jumped into him , drawing tarczewski s fourth foul with 18 52 to play thames also fooled gordon into leaving his feet in the final seconds , earning three free throws but the wildcats leaned on their defense , and san diego state , which had struggled to score at times this season , had trouble down the stretch after j j o'brien s layup with 8 19 left gave the aztecs a 4946 lead , they did not make another field goal until dwayne polee ii s 3pointer with 1 16 left by then , the aztecs trailed by 5 johnson had recovered , and so had arizona it took tremendous toughness and resolve , said arizona coach sean miller , whose team gave up 18 offensive rebounds we overcame nick not scoring , kaleb in foul trouble , the beginning of the game , giving up that many shots that , to me , was the story of the game us finding a way , being toughminded and almost willing our way to the finish line

the list of those caught up in the global surveillance net cast by the national security agency and its overseas partners , from social media users to foreign heads of state , now includes another entry american lawyers a topsecret document , obtained by the former nsa contractor edward j snowden , shows that an american law firm was monitored while representing a foreign government in trade disputes with the united states the disclosure offers a rare glimpse of a specific instance in which americans were ensnared by the eavesdroppers , and is of particular interest because lawyers in the united states with clients overseas have expressed growing concern that their confidential communications could be compromised by such surveillance the government of indonesia had retained the law firm for help in trade talks , according to the february 2013 document it reports that the nsa s australian counterpart , the , notified the agency that it was conducting surveillance of the talks , including communications between indonesian officials and the american law firm , and offered to share the information the australians told officials at an nsa liaison office in canberra , australia , that information covered by attorneyclient privilege may be included in the intelligence gathering , according to the document , a monthly bulletin from the canberra office the law firm was not identified , but mayer brown , a chicagobased firm with a global practice , was then advising the indonesian government on trade issues on behalf of the australians , the liaison officials asked the nsa general counsel s office for guidance about the spying the bulletin notes only that the counsel s office provided clear guidance and that the australian agency has been able to continue to cover the talks , providing highly useful intelligence for interested us customers the nsa declined to answer questions about the reported surveillance , including whether information involving the american law firm was shared with united states trade officials or negotiators duane layton , a mayer brown lawyer involved in the trade talks , said he did not have any evidence that he or his firm had been under scrutiny by australian or american intelligence agencies i always wonder if someone is listening , because you would have to be an idiot not to wonder in this day and age , he said in an interview but i 've never really thought i was being spied on most attorneyclient conversations do not get special protections under american law from nsa eavesdropping amid growing concerns about surveillance and hacking , the american bar association in 2012 revised its ethics rules to explicitly require to protect confidential information from unauthorized disclosure to outsiders last year , the to a 2008 law allowing warrantless wiretapping that was brought in part by lawyers with foreign clients they believed were likely targets of nsa monitoring the lawyers contended that the law raised risks that required them to take costly measures , like traveling overseas to meet clients , to protect sensitive communications but the supreme court dismissed their fears as speculative the nsa is prohibited from targeting americans , including businesses , law firms and other organizations based in the united states , for surveillance without warrants , and intelligence officials have repeatedly said the nsa does not use the spy services of its partners in the socalled five eyes alliance australia , britain , canada and new zealand to skirt the law still , the nsa can intercept the communications of americans if they are in contact with a foreign intelligence target abroad , such as indonesian officials the nsa is then required to follow socalled to protect their privacy , such as deleting the identity of americans or information that is not deemed necessary to understand or assess the foreign intelligence , before sharing it with other agencies an nsa spokeswoman said the agency s office of the general counsel was consulted when issues of potential attorneyclient privilege arose and could recommend steps to protect such information such steps could include requesting that collection or reporting by a foreign partner be limited , that intelligence reports be written so as to limit the inclusion of privileged material and to exclude us identities , and that dissemination of such reports be limited and subject to appropriate warnings or restrictions on their use , said vanee m vines , the spokeswoman the australian government declined to comment about the surveillance in a statement , the australian defense force public affairs office said that in gathering information to support australia s national interests , its intelligence agencies adhered strictly to their legal obligations , including when they engaged with foreign counterpartsseveral newly disclosed documents provide details of the , which share facilities and highly sensitive intelligence , including efforts to break encryption and collect phone call data in indonesia both nations have trade and security interests in indonesia , where islamic terrorist groups that threaten the west have bases the 2013 nsa bulletin did not identify which trade case was being monitored by australian intelligence , but indonesia has been embroiled in several disputes with the united states in recent years , an indonesian export the indonesian government has protested to the world trade organization a united states ban on their sale , arguing that similar menthol cigarettes under american antismoking laws the trade organization , ruling that the united states prohibition violated international trade laws , to determine potential remedies for indonesia another dispute involved indonesia s exports of shrimp , which the united states claimed were being sold at belowmarket prices the indonesian government retained mayer brown to help in the cases concerning cigarettes and shrimp , said ni made ayu marthini , attach for trade and industry at the indonesian embassy in washington she said no american law firm had been formally retained yet to help in a third case , involving horticultural and animal products mr layton , a lawyer in the washington office of mayer brown , said that since 2010 he had led a team from the firm in the clove cigarette dispute he said matthew mcconkey , another lawyer in the firm s washington office , had taken the lead on the shrimp issue until the united states dropped its claims in august both cases were underway a year ago when the australians reported that their surveillance included an american law firm mr layton said that if his emails and calls with indonesian officials had been monitored , the spies would have been bored none of this stuff is very sexy , he said it s just run of the mill he and the other mayer brown lawyers do most of their work on the trade issues from washington , he said they also make occasional trips to jakarta , indonesia s capital , and geneva , where the world trade organization is based mr layton said most of his communications with officials in jakarta had been done through email , while he also talked by phone with officials at the indonesian embassy in washington the nsa s protections for attorneyclient conversations are narrowly crafted , said stephen gillers , an expert on legal ethics at new york university s school of law the agency is barred from sharing with prosecutors intercepted attorneyclient communications involving someone under indictment in the united states , according to previously disclosed nsa rules but the agency may still use or share the information for intelligence purposes andrew m perlman , a suffolk university law professor who specializes in legal ethics and technology issues , said the growth of surveillance was troubling for lawyers he helped create the bar association s ethics code revisions that require lawyers to try to avoid being overheard by eavesdroppers you run out of options very quickly to communicate with someone overseas , he said given the difficulty of finding anything that is 100 percent secure , lawyers are in a difficult spot to ensure that all of the information remains in confidence in addition to its work on trade issues with the united states , mr layton said , mayer brown was representing indonesia in a dispute with australia he said indonesia had been arguing that australia s requirements for plain packaging for tobacco products under its antismoking rules were excessive even though the indonesian issues were relatively modest for the united states about 40 million in annual trade is related to the clove cigarette dispute and 1 billion annually to shrimp the australian surveillance of talks underscores the extent to which the nsa and its close partners engage in economic espionage in justifying the agency s sweeping powers , the obama administration often emphasizes the nsa s role in fighting terrorism and cyberattacks , but disclosures in recent months from the documents leaked by mr snowden show the agency routinely spies on trade negotiations , communications of economic officials in other countries and  american intelligence officials do not deny that they collect economic information from overseas , but argue that they do not engage in industrial espionage by sharing that information with american businesses china , for example , is often accused of stealing business secrets from western corporations and passing them to chinese corporations the nsa trade document headlined susloc \( special us liaison office canberra \) facilitates sensitive dsd reporting on trade talks does not say which interested us customers besides the nsa might have received intelligence on the trade dispute other documents obtained from mr snowden reveal that the nsa shares reports from its surveillance widely among civilian agencies a 2004 nsa document , for example , describes how the agency s intelligence gathering was critical to the agriculture department in international trade negotiations the usda is involved in trade operations to protect and secure a large segment of the us economy , that document states top agency officials often rely on sigint short for the signals intelligence that the nsa eavesdropping collects to support their negotiations the australians reported another instance to the nsa in addition to the one with the american law firm in which their spying involved an american , according to the february 2013 document they were conducting surveillance on a target who turned out to be an american working for the united states government in afghanistan , the document said it offered no details about what happened after the nsa learned of the incident , and the agency declined to respond to questions about it in a statement , ms vines , the agency spokeswoman , said nsa works with a number of partners in meeting its foreignintelligence mission goals , and those operations comply with us law and with the applicable laws under which those partners operate a key part of the protections that apply to both us persons and citizens of other countries is the mandate that information be in support of a valid foreignintelligence requirement , and comply with us attorney generalapproved procedures to protect privacy rights the documents show that the nsa and the australians jointly run a large signals intelligence facility in alice springs , australia , with half the personnel from the american agency the nsa and its australian counterpart have also cooperated on efforts to defeat encryption a 2003 memo describes how nsa personnel sought to mentor the australians while they tried to break the encryption used by the armed forces of nearby papua new guinea most of the collaboration between the nsa and the australian eavesdropping service is focused on asia , with china and indonesia receiving special attention australian intelligence has focused heavily on indonesia since the the attack , which killed 202 people , including 88 australians , in a resort area popular with australians , was blamed on the southeast asian islamist group jemaah islamiyah the americans and the australians secretly share broad access to the indonesian telecommunications system , the documents show the nsa has given the australians access to bulk call data from , an indonesian telecommunications provider , according to a 2012 agency document that includes data on indonesian government officials in various ministries , the document states the australians have obtained nearly 18 million encrypted master keys , which are used to protect private communications , from the telkomsel mobile telephone network in indonesia , and developed a way to decrypt almost all of them , according to a 2013 nsa document
the idea of putting a mindaltering drug in the drinking water is the stuff of scifi , terrorist plots and totalitarian governments considering the outcry that occurred when putting fluoride in the water was first proposed , one can only imagine the furor that would ensue if such a thing were ever suggested the debate , however , is moot it s a done deal mother nature has already put a psychotropic drug in the drinking water , and that drug is lithium although this fact has been largely ignored for over half a century , it appears to have important medical implications lithium is a naturally occurring element , not a molecule like most medications , and it is present in the united states , depending on the geographic area , at concentrations that can range widely , from undetectable to around 170 milligrams per liter this amount is less than a thousandth of the minimum daily dose given for disorders and for that does n't respond to although it seems strange that the microscopic amounts of lithium found in groundwater could have any substantial medical impact , the more scientists look for such effects , the more they seem to discover evidence is slowly accumulating that relatively tiny doses of lithium can have beneficial effects they appear to decrease suicide rates significantly and may even promote brain health and improve mood yet despite the studies demonstrating the benefits of relatively high natural lithium levels present in the drinking water of certain communities , few seem to be aware of its potential intermittently , stories appear in the scientific journals and media , but they seem to have little traction in the medical community or with the general public when i recently attended a psychopharmacology course in which these lithium studies were reviewed , virtually none of the psychiatrists present had been aware of them the scientific story of lithium s role in and health began unfolding in the 1970s studies at that time found that animals that consumed diets with minimal lithium had higher mortality rates , as well as abnormalities of reproduction and behavior researchers began to ask whether low levels of lithium might correlate with poor behavioral outcomes in humans in 1990 , a study was published looking at 27 texas counties with a variety of lithium levels in their water the authors discovered that people whose water had the least amount of lithium had significantly greater levels of suicide , homicide and rape than the people whose water had the higher levels of lithium the group whose water had the highest lithium level had nearly 40 percent fewer suicides than that with the lowest lithium level almost 20 years later , a japanese study that looked at 18 municipalities with more than a million inhabitants over a fiveyear period confirmed the earlier study s finding suicide rates were inversely correlated with the lithium content in the local water supply more recently , there have been corroborating studies in greece and austria not all the research has come to the same conclusion there was , for example , a negative study in england , although that is tough to assess because the amount of lithium in that location was much lower than that found in the other countries studied a recent review of epidemiological studies of lithium in drinking water reported that 9 out of 11 studies found an association between higher levels of lithium in local water and beneficial clinical , behavioral , legal and medical outcomes trying to make sense of their results , the authors of the japanese study speculated that lithium exposure , even in these tiny amounts , might actually be neuroprotective or even enhance the growth of neurons other studies have supported their speculation lithium appears to promote the health , growth and resilience of neurons , reducing stressinduced damage one study found that at the higher therapeutic doses used to treat mood disorders , brain scans of bipolar patients treated with lithium actually had increased areas of gray matter \( neurons \) in their brains , compared with bipolar patients who had not been on lithium and with normal controls the authors speculated that lithium might protect the brain , perhaps promoting neuronal growth in the clinical practice of psychiatry , there has been a related finding patients with mood disorders have been shown to have rates of higher than those of the general population a danish population study of more than a million subjects discovered that those who purchased lithium only once \( presumably people in whom a significant mood disorder had already been diagnosed \) had an increased rate of dementia compared with those never exposed to lithium after taking two or more prescriptions , however , the rate of dementia decreased and remained at those low levels the authors concluded that , continued lithium treatment was associated with reduction of the rate of dementia to the same level as that for the general population dr nassir ghaemi , a professor of psychiatry at tufts university school of medicine and one of the most active and informed proponents of lithium in the medical community , notes lithium is , by far , the most proven drug to keep neurons alive , in animals and in humans , consistently and with many replicated studies and , he added , if lithium prevents dementia , then we may have overlooked a very simple means of preventing a major public health problem when the data from the japanese study was reanalyzed in a second publication , the authors concluded that those people with higher levels of lithium in their water supply had lower levels of allcause mortality why have these findings been so little discussed in the medical , psychiatric and public health communities \? one could make a case that lithium is the cinderella of psychotropic medications , neglected and ill used reported by an australian psychiatrist , john cade , in 1949 to be an effective treatment for bipolar disorder \( it was approved as a drug by the food and drug administration in 1970 \) its efficacy in mood disorders and suicide prevention has been documented as well as or better than virtually any other psychotropic medication but it retains a grim and undeserved reputation , perhaps because it was originally associated in the public mind with serious mental illness and because , like many medications , lithium can have serious side effects if not monitored properly as a psychiatrist , i can tell you that because of its stigma , lithium as a medication is a hard sell to patients with serious mood disorders who could clearly benefit from treatment but there are undoubtedly other reasons for its neglect pharmaceutical companies have nothing to gain from this cheap , ubiquitous element dr peter d kramer , the author of listening to and a clinical professor of psychiatry at brown university , wonders whether there has n't been enough research done on lowdose lithium because the mainstream medical establishment distrusts lowdose supplements as somehow ineffective or like homeopathy and the alternativemedicine crowd shun it because though it s a salt found in groundwater lithium already has an identity as a powerful , marketed medication for mental illness lithium has been known for its curative powers for centuries , if not millenniums lithia springs , ga , for example , with its natural lithiumenriched water , appears to have been an ancient native american sacred site by the late 19th century lithia springs was a famous health destination visited by mark twain and presidents grover cleveland , william howard taft , william mckinley and theodore roosevelt lithium drinks were in huge demand for their reputed healthgiving properties , so much so that the element was added to commercial drinks 7up was originally called biblabel lithiated lemonlime soda and contained lithium citrate right up until 1950 in fact , it s been suggested that the 7 in 7up refers to the atomic mass of the lithium \( maybe the up referred to mood \? \) even beer made with lithia water was available by the 1940s , physicians began to give patients with heart disease lithium chloride as a substitute for regular salt , sodium chloride the high , unregulated doses in this vulnerable population had toxic and even lethal effects soon lithium was removed from beverages and other products , and its reputation never recovered today lithium is little discussed despite the huge public appetite for health information nor is it much advertised or even available scanning the shelves at a local chain store pharmacy , i discovered that standard did not contain lithium and the nutritional supplement section of the store had no products containing lithium lithium was available only in the relatively highdose medication form that requires a prescription from a physician online , however , there are lithium products available including , amazingly enough , the original lithia spring water some scientists have , in fact , proposed that lithium be recognized as an essential trace element nutrient who knows what the impact on our society would be if microdose lithium were again part of our standard nutritional fare \? what if it were added back to soft drinks or popular vitamin brands or even put into the water supply \? the research to date strongly suggests that suicide levels would be reduced , and even perhaps other violent acts and maybe the dementia rate would decline we do n't know because the research has n't been done for the public health issue of suicide prevention alone , it seems imperative that such studies be conducted in 2011 , suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in the united states research on a simple element like lithium that has been around as a medication for over half a century and as a drink for millenniums may not seem like a high priority , but it should be

chicago the roman catholic archdiocese here released thousands of internal documents on thursday that detailed decades of sexual abuse by its priests , a disclosure timed just days before the retirement of the current archbishop the files , some of which show past church leaders permitting clergy accused of abuse to continue working , describe complaints against 36 priests , many of whom are now dead and none of whom remain in active ministry nearly all of the alleged abuse occurred decades ago , though in several cases the accusers waited years to come forward cardinal francis e george , the archdiocese of chicago s current leader , had promised to make the documents public that pledge became more urgent when pope francis accepted the cardinal s retirement and appointed blase cupich , currently the bishop of spokane , wash , to replace him later this month the priests whose personnel files were posted online thursday have long been publicly identified by the chicago archdiocese as having credible complaints of sexual misconduct against them in a statement , david clohessy , the director of the survivors network of those abused by priests , criticized the archdiocese for not releasing the documents earlier the roughly 15 , 000 pages published thursday included graphic descriptions of abuse and , in some cases , evidence of a lessthanswift response from church leaders in the case of the rev john w calicott , parishioners objected when the priest was temporarily removed from ministry in the 1990s over abuse allegations concerning acts in the 1970s the priest s support from his congregation and his contention that he should be forgiven for longago acts were at the time but the letters and petitions released thursday show the intensity of the pushback , including some concerned about the impact of father calicott s case on africanamerican catholics , because he and many of his parishioners were black cardinal joseph bernardin , then the archbishop , reinstated father calicott , with restrictions his successor , cardinal george , removed him from ministry documents related to 30 other chicagoarea priests accused of sexual abuse were released in january those papers were examined by both the archdiocese and the law firm of jeff anderson , who has represented numerous victims of clergy abuse mr anderson did not examine the most recent files in advance , and said he viewed thursday s release with a great deal of suspicion and skepticism because of what he considered a lack of outside scrutiny but archdiocese officials said thursday s disclosure represented a desire to speak openly about past wrongdoing as we said in january , we are committed to transparency with the people we serve , cardinal george said , adding , child abuse is a crime and a sin
newark in 1995 , the new jersey state department of education took control of newark s schools , disbanding the local board and appointing its own superintendent i had just then become a teacher in newark the express intent of the takeover was to intervene temporarily to improve the quality of our schools , increase the achievement of students and better manage the system s finances since the state was on the receiving end of a 1994 state supreme court ruling that the underfunding of public schools in urban districts was unconstitutional , the timing seemed suspicious , to say the least it felt as if we were being annexed nearly 20 years later , it is clear that the state has failed on all counts local control must be returned to newark s public schools immediately over the years , the courtordered remedies for newark s schools were eroded or ignored a 6 billion schools construction program never materialized instead , thanks to state control , newark has become a laboratory for experiments in topdown reforms successive statemandated initiatives came and went occasionally , there were useful ideas that yielded results for example , in lower grades when resources were focused on early childhood learning but when there was no dramatic breakthrough , programs were withdrawn , and some new plan hatched over time , the cycle hurt teachers' morale and bred cynicism among parents during state control of newark s schools , a lack of consultation and consent has been a persistent problem reports show at least one neighborhood school was shut down and the real estate sold off others were changed to charter schools without a vote a clear violation of  you might think that mark zuckerberg s 100 million donation in 2010 to kickstart a foundation for newark schools would have been a game changer but little funding went directly to newark s schools instead , the first 13 million was wasted on a poorly conducted community outreach campaign then another 100 million , including funds from zuckerberg , went to a program for teacher merit pay principals were given the power to reinterview teachers for their jobs and in some cases hire new teachers but the rejected teachers joined a pool of floating staff members in the rubber room downtown , until reassigned to other schools or bought out so even as newark teachers worked without a contract , the state went on a hiring and cashincentive spree there was not enough accountability or transparency about the spending we only know this much thanks to demands filed by community groups under new jersey s open public records act the state s maladministration of newark s public schools continues to this day when superintendent cami anderson s renew schools reform plan ran into difficulties because of its lack of public consultation , foundation dollars went to a communityengagement program yet the latest iteration , the one newark plan , has only plunged the system into more chaos consider the reports i 've received of barringer high school \( formerly newark high school \) three weeks into the school year , students still did not have schedules students who had just arrived in this country and did not speak english sat for days in the school library without placement or instruction seniors were placed in classes they had already taken , missing the requirements they 'd need to graduate even the school lunch system broke down , with students served bread and cheese in lieu of hot meals things are no better for parents under one newark s universal enrollment scheme , a secret algorithm determined what school was the best fit for each child often , this ended up placing each child in a family in a different school , none of which was the neighborhood school the parents chose the superintendent even had to devise a new for the unpopular one newark plan to cap it all , last year the school system operated with a deficit of  gov chris christie likes to say that he is of what happens in newark s public schools what that means is that he and his appointees now own the failure of the state s policies advocates of both traditional and charter schools , parent groups , ministers , student organizations and local elected officials have called on new jersey to relinquish its hold over our schools the real issues that reform should address are ensuring that every 3 or 4yearold child is enrolled in a structured learning environment , and that all our teachers get staff development and training we must be more effective at sharing best practices and keeping our class sizes manageable if necessary , we should put more than one teacher in the classroom , especially for students from kindergarten to third grade we also need to fix additional problems like a historically segregated curriculum , which offers stimulating choices in wealthy suburbs but only the most basic courses to our innercity children and we must break the cycle of low expectations that some educators have of the children they teach , merely prescribing repeat classes if students do n't pass the first step in a transition to local control of newark s schools is a shortterm transfer of authority to the mayor i would quickly appoint a new superintendent once basic functions were restored to the district , we would move as soon as possible to return control to an elected school board with full powers it is clear that we cannot rely on the good faith of the state to respond expeditiously federal intervention appears our only recourse i have written to the justice department s office of civil rights in support of the that parents , students , advocates and educators in our city have brought , requesting that the federal government intercede the right of newark s citizens to equitable , highquality public education demands the return of local , democratic control
boston one of the most scrutinized games of catch may take place at yankee stadium on monday , a fiveminute exercise that could help determine the outcome of the ' season , as well as the prospects of their 2015 campaign if the rookie starter masahiro tanaka feels well enough , he could play a short game of catch to test his injured elbow provided there is no pain , he would most likely do the same thing a couple of days later and steadily increase his workload until he is back in pitching form sometime in september if the pain returns , tanaka will go back to the doctor and could opt to have surgery that would force him to miss about 12 months but the first big test , if tanaka and the yankees so decide , will come monday catch or no catch , yankees manager joe girardi said those are about the two options but a simple game of catch is not always so simple michael pineda had to halt his rehabilitation process from a muscle injury in his upper back , near his right shoulder , when he felt pain while playing catch this summer pineda , however , has finally made it back up on a mound , and on sunday he threw 58 pitches for class aaa scranton wilkesbarre pineda reported no problems after pitching three and a third scoreless innings he could be back with the yankees in 15 days tanaka s path is less certain he last pitched on july 8 in cleveland , after which he reported pain in his elbow he had a magnetic resonance imaging test , which revealed a small tear in his ulnar collateral ligament , and he was evaluated by three specialists he could have opted for surgery then , but all three doctors recommended a more conservative approach because of the size of the tear he was given a plateletrich plasma injection july 14 and was told to rest for three weeks those three weeks end monday on friday , tanaka visited dr christopher ahmad , the yankees team physician , and was cleared to play catch girardi said that tanaka told him he felt good but none of that matters much until tanaka picks up a ball and throws it for the first time since the tear was revealed we 'll see tomorrow what everyone wants to do with him , girardi said sunday before the yankees faced the boston red sox at fenway park as we said , three weeks was the mark he feels good , so we 'll see what we do even if tanaka \( 124 , 251 earned run average \) reports no pain , he will still have to take a slow , measured route back , one that , even if each step went perfectly , would not put him in the majors again until september by then the yankees could be out of postseason contention , in which case it might not make sense to risk tanaka s returning this season the yankees went into sunday s game with a 5653 record , five and a half games behind the baltimore orioles in the american league east , and two behind toronto for the al s second wild card while the yankees wait to see whether tanaka will be able to play catch , girardi was pleased to get the report on pineda like tanaka , pineda was also pitching well when he was injured he was 22 with a 183 era in four starts before he was shut down after his april 23 start girardi said pineda threw the ball well sunday , according to his reports , and showed no signs that he was protecting the shoulder or his back the plan is for pineda to start two more minor league rehabilitation games before rejoining the yankees pineda and tanaka , both 25 , gave the yankees hope that they could form the top of their rotation for years to come while pineda showed only glimpses , tanaka seemed to demonstrate that his pitches could translate into consistent success in a season that has frustrated yankees fans , tanaka had been the best revelation he started the season with an 111 record and 199 era but in his last four starts he was 13 with a 425 era he said he never felt discomfort until his final start over all , he has 135 strikeouts in 1291 3 innings , and the yankees are 135 in his starts the yankees , who have suffered from a weak offense most of the season , will get a stern test this week they will face the last three american league cy young award winners when the detroit tigers visit yankee stadium for a fourgame series starting monday max scherzer , who won the award last year , will start monday against brandon mccarthy david price , the 2012 recipient , who was acquired from the tampa bay rays on thursday , pitches tuesday against hiroki kuroda , followed by justin verlander \( 2011 \) against chris capuano on wednesday rick porcello will face shane greene in the series finale
north carolina regulators said monday that five power plants owned by duke energy have been cited for violating water pollution laws , three days after announcing a similar action against duke s plant in eden , nc , where 39 , 000 tons of coal ash fouled the dan river last month the citations , which charge duke with failing to obtain stormwater permits under federal law , could lead to fines of 25 , 000 per day for each of the six plants the enforcement actions by the state s department of environment and natural resources came after weeks of public outrage about the spill but according to documents in recent court proceedings , regulators within the agency have tried for several years to force duke to bring its plants into compliance , only to be frustrated time and again over the last year and a half , we repeatedly asked for a status and direction on these , and we have been given none , an environmental engineer in the department wrote to colleagues in september , referring to efforts to require stormwater permits current and former employees of the environmental agency have said that under the administration of gov pat mccrory , a republican , and the republicancontrolled legislature , regulators were told to play down enforcement of pollution laws in favor of spurring economic activity and jobs last year , after environmental groups said they would sue duke over pollution from its coal ash ponds at power plants , the environmental agency stepped in and struck a deal with the utility that included a fine and agreement to monitor the coal ash ponds statewide critics said the deal was overly favorable to duke , the former longtime employer of mr mccrory since the , which left a sludge of coal ash for 70 miles downstream , the agency said it reviewed all 14 of duke s power plants statewide and found that six had not applied for stormwater permits , which are required to protect public waterways from contaminated runoff from industrial plants the pollution that entered the dan river occurred when a 48inch stormwater pipe that ran under a pond used to store coal ash ruptured and allowed the slurry of ash and water to flow out internal emails and other records from the agency , which it turned over to environmental activists as part of a legal discovery process , show that regulators knew about the six duke plants without permits as long ago as 2009 that year , an environmental engineer in the stormwater permitting unit prepared a list of power plants without proper permits and suggested that inspectors needed to follow up to see which had pipes draining into waterways all six of the plants cited by the agency since friday were on the list besides dan river , they are the belews creek steam station in rockingham county , cliffside steam station in rutherford county , lee steam electric plant in wayne county , roxboro steam electric power plant in person county and sutton steam electric plant in new hanover county last september , another engineer , bethany georgoulias , wrote to colleagues about the history of the agency s efforts to issue permits in early 2011 , she wrote in an email , george everett , duke s director of environmental and legislative affairs , met with regulators to discuss the issue further meetings were held in 2012 but there was no resolution ms georgoulias wrote that engineers asked for 18 months why there were no permits they received no answers from superiors we stopped asking , she wrote federal prosecutors have subpoenaed about 20 current and former environmental agency employees , as well as duke officials , to appear on march 18 before a grand jury looking into the dan river spill a spokeswoman for the environmental agency said that if there was footdragging in the agency over regulating the utility , it would be investigated the documents show that duke wanted the environmental agency to issue a general landfill permit for its coal ash ponds around the state , a less stringent permit than required for a coal ash pit they did n't qualify for that , said bridget munger , the spokeswoman our staff was getting pushback a spokesman for duke , based in charlotte , nc , said the company would respond to the state about the violations and declined further comment frank holleman , a senior lawyer with the , lamented that the state was only now cracking down on the utility rather than last summer or earlier when it was aware of deficiencies at the dan river plant if they had cited them then for not having the most basic permit for this stormwater pipe , he said , would that not have caused either denr or duke to inspect the pipe and see if it was rotting \?
one by one , they came off the bench late in the first quarter at barclays center , building on ' early lead and waking up the crowd with their play not the allstar guard joe johnson , or paul pierce , or kevin garnett these were the substitutes this was the depth the nets were supposed to have but did not for the first 45 games or so of the season on sunday , at least , they were flipping up alleyoops throughout the second and fourth quarters of the nets' 9381 win over the new orleans pelicans it was not the first time this season that the nets had a full roster \( minus center brook lopez , who is out for the season \) it was not the first time the starters seemed to take a back seat to the reserves but the combination of health and depth synchronized so nicely sunday that the starters , well , they had good seats to a good show the nets' starters were outscored , 5934 , by their backups the first time in franchise history that none of the starters scored in double figures , according to the elias sports bureau in the locker room after the game , only two of the five johnson and shaun livingston stayed to speak with reporters in other words , they let the bench guys do most of the playing and the talking we have to continue to get better as a unit , as a bench , point guard jason terry said they 're going to need us , especially down the stretch there s going to be some games where we 're going to be called upon to make shots , get stops , just make an impact on the game the previous two home games , before friday s loss at detroit , included embarrassing performances by the bench , terry said pierce noted as much a week ago when he stated matteroffactly after monday s win against philadelphia that our bench has to play better terry agreed we were disappointed , he said what changed sunday was not a matter of tactical adjustments it was better execution we 're put in the game to execute , run our sets , play defense and get stops , terry said i thought tonight we did an excellent job of that the nets did seem to have more players than they knew what to do with they answered the pelicans' youth with , well , youth or at least the one pair of youthful legs the nets' roster has that would be the rookie center mason plumlee , who hopped his way through the second quarter as if he had been downing espresso shots on the bench plumlee scored 14 points , with five rimrattling dunks , and had seven rebounds and two blocks in his first 16 minutes he finished with a seasonhigh 22 points and matched his season best in rebounds with 13 the crowd fed off his energy new orleans did not seem to know how to put a body on him i think i was doing the same thing i 've been doing they just did n't guard the rim as well , plumlee said , adding that his teammates terry and alan anderson drew two off their screenandroll and found me at the rim with mirza teletovic who finished the game with 13 points and 11 rebounds and terry playing well , the nets' firsthalf lead grew to 27 there seemed no reason to put the starters back in so coach elected to leave most of them out , sending deron williams back in for the final 68 seconds of the opening half the pelicans' 28 points were the fewest by a nets opponent in a first half since 2005 they executed , and i think they gave the starters a big lift , kidd said when the nets' starters returned to start the third quarter , new orleans went on a 2410 run , cutting its deficit to single digits the pelicans scored more points in the third quarter \( 32 \) than they had in the first half but williams s runner in the lane at the buzzer kept the nets ahead by 11 back came the reserves in the fourth , and instead of another letdown , they kept new orleans from creeping back in teletovic kept shooting terry kept passing plumlee kept leaping we 're going to need our bench , livingston said we need everybody it ca n't just be the bench , or just the starters , or just some of the main players it s got to be everybody rebounds nets center brook lopez addressed reporters at halftime sunday for the first time since having seasonending surgery to repair the fifth metatarsal of his right foot jan 4 the operation was his third on that area of the foot since 2011 , but lopez remained resolute about returning by the start of next season i'm not scared at all , he said the procedure , called a metatarsal osteotomy , involved repositioning another bone in the foot in an effort to prevent reinjury a route considered riskier but with potentially higher rewards lopez said he had already been sized for different shoes
carson , calif when the united states goes to the world cup this summer , a familiar question will greet jurgen klinsmann , just as it has the coaches who have preceded him where will the goals come from \? the united states has scored 14 goals in the last four world cups , a stretch of 15 games , and for all the forward steps that soccer has made in this country , the scoring options do not look much brighter not with jozy altidore sitting on the bench at sunderland , clint dempsey trying to regain his form on loan at fulham and age perhaps turning landon donovan into a role player so , as the united states gears up for brazil , there may be , as usual , room on the roster for someone who can put the ball in the back of the net on saturday , chris wondolowski made his case by scoring the goals that gave the united states a 20 victory against south korea before a capacity crowd of 27 , 000 the game was the culmination of a fourweek camp that included a 12day stint in brazil , where coaches , players and staff members were familiarized with the hotels , practice fields and stadiums they will be visiting in june it did not include european or mexican leaguebased players whose club teams are in season , so it was a chance for major league soccer players to make the most of an extended look from klinsmann there s not too many opportunities left before the world cup , defender michael parkhurst said friday before the team s final practice you do n't get three to four weeks in front of jurgen too often nobody took better advantage than wondolowski , who scored eight goals in nine appearances if there are questions about whether he can score against world cup competition his goals have come against guatemala , belize , cuba and a south korean squad whose best players were in europe his opportunism is beyond reproach his first goal came in the fourth minute , when donovan neatly sprang graham zusi down the right flank his cross was met with a leftfooted volley by brad davis , whose shot was saved by south korean goalkeeper jung sungryong but the ball popped right to wondolowski , who headed it home the other , in the 60th minute , came via a ricocheted pass from zusi to donovan that instead landed at wondolowski s feet his first touch beat jung to the near post if you 're committed , if you 're hungry and you show it every time , the coach sees that , klinsmann said of wondolowski wondolowski said it was too early to be thinking about brazil you ca n't play the numbers game , he said you hope for a callup and when you get one , you try to make the most of it you let your work do the talking the opportunity that wondolowski seized might have gone to mike magee , a 29yearold journeyman who blossomed last season when he scored 21 goals and was chosen the most valuable player of mls but magee , in his first national team camp , was struck by food poisoning , according to us soccer officials , and did not suit up stylistically , there was little that south korea might have done to prepare the united states for qualities it will see in group play in brazil ghana s strength and athleticism , portugal s skill and flair , and germany s toughness and tactical awareness the two green center backs , omar gonzalez and matt besler , who mirrored the united states' resurgence during qualifying by emerging as a stalwart tandem , were less than impressive their defending was solid , as it had been throughout qualifying , but klinsmann said friday that there would be a different standard in brazil than there was against concacaf foes defending will be not just winning balls , but also doing something with them you ca n't make passing mistakes in the defensive area because the transition is going to happen so quickly on those teams we 're going to face , you 're pretty much done , klinsmann said too often , though , besler and gonzalez seemed to run out of ideas and gonzalez s spotty passing led to several turnovers the most

many members of the new york police department are furious at mayor bill de blasio and , by extension , the city that elected him they have expressed this anger with a solidarity tantrum , repeatedly turning their backs to show their collective contempt but now they seem to have taken their bitterness to a new and dangerous level by walking off the job the on tuesday reported , and city officials confirmed , that officers are essentially abandoning enforcement of lowlevel offenses according to data the post cited for the week starting dec 22 two days after two officers were shot and killed on a brooklyn street traffic citations had fallen by 94 percent over the same period last year , summonses for offenses like public drinking and urination were down 94 percent , parking violations were down 92 percent , and drug arrests by the organized crime control bureau were down 84 percent the data cover only a week , and the reasons for the plunge are not entirely clear but it is so steep and sudden as to suggest a dangerous , deplorable escalation of the police confrontation with the de blasio administration even considering the heightened tensions surrounding the officers' deaths and pending labor negotiations the patrolmen s benevolent association has no contract , and its leader , patrick lynch , has been the most strident in attacking mr de blasio , calling him a bloody accomplice to the officers' murder this action is repugnant and inexcusable it amounts to a public act of extortion by the police and for what \? let s review the actions that mr de blasio s harshest critics say have driven the police to such extremes 1 he campaigned on ending the unconstitutional use of stopandfrisk tactics , which victimized hundreds of thousands of innocent young black and latino men 2 he called for creating an inspector general for the department and ending racial profiling 3 after eric garner , an unarmed black man , was killed by a swarm of cops on staten island , he convened a meeting with the police commissioner , william bratton , and the rev al sharpton , giving mr sharpton greater prominence than police defenders thought he should have had because mr sharpton is a firebrand with an unsavory past 4 he after the garner killing that he had told his biracial son , dante , to take special care in encounters with the police 5 he generally condoned the peaceful protests for police reform while condemning those who incited or committed violence and cited a tagline of the movement black lives matter the list of grievances adds up to very little , unless you look at it through the magnifying lens of resentment fomented by union bosses and rightwing commentators the falling murder rate , the increased resources for the department , the end of quotabased policing , which the police union despised , the mayor s commitment to brokenwindows policing none of that matters , because many cops have latched on to the narrative that they are hated , with the mayor orchestrating the hate it s a false narrative mr de blasio was elected by a wide margin on a promise to reform the policing excesses that were found unconstitutional by a federal court he hired a proven reformer , mr bratton , who had achieved with the los angeles police department what needs doing in new york the furor that has gripped the city since the garner killing has been a complicated mess but what new yorkers expect of the police department is simple 1 do n't violate the constitution 2 do n't kill unarmed people to that we can add 3 do your jobs the police are sworn public servants , and refusing to work violates their oath to serve and protect mr bratton should hold his commanders and supervisors responsible , and turn this insubordination around mr de blasio has a responsibility to lead the city out of this impasse , and to his credit has avoided inflaming the situation with hasty or hostile words but it s the police department that needs to police itself rankandfile officers deserve a department they can be proud of , not the insular , defiant , toxically politicized constituency that mr lynch seems to want to lead
tampa , fla after giving catcher brian mccann a fiveyear , 85 million contract , the gave him something else an ipad included on it were videos of every pitcher on the yankees' staff , highlighting two good outings and two bad ones it has become part of the tools of the trade for a catcher mask , chest protector , shin guards , ipad it s really helpful , mccann said that s the great thing about technology he added , i 've watched a ton of film it is part of the 30yearold mccann s steep learning curve this spring after he spent the first nine seasons of his career with the atlanta braves , where he was a named an allstar seven times and won five silver slugger awards players like to say that baseball is the same everywhere , but mccann is adjusting not only to a new team with the yankees but also to a different league it is why the yankees are having him catch more this spring than they normally would with a veteran and why they are closely managing his schedule mccann was set to play in the legends series the yankees' two splitsquad games in panama against the miami marlins but a day before the team departed , manager joe girardi thought it was better to have mccann remain in tampa girardi wanted mccann to have more time to catch masahiro tanaka on sunday and hiroki kuroda on monday and even david phelps , whom mccann caught in friday s 73 loss to the minnesota twins all of it has made mccann s spring training longer and busier than it has been in years i'm catching quite a bit because i need to see these guys , he said i'm going to start catching backtoback games i 've done it once , and i'm going to do it again by the end of spring , i 'll probably catch three games in a row , which , in spring training , you usually do n't do i need to see everybody multiple times i have to , i need to it s a big deal to see them it is one thing to see the yankees' pitchers up close on an ipad , but quite another to see them from 60 feet 6 inches even though i 've watched a lot of film , mccann said , there is no replacing actually catching guys in realgame situations mccann s work has not gone unnoticed not by the yankees and certainly not by the pitchers i already feel comfortable pitching to him , said ivan nova , who is penciled in to be the yankees' fourth starter the way he calls a game , calls pitches , he does n't let you get out of what you need to do he s real smooth behind the plate he does a nice job of getting me to throw low he gives me a nice target that almost forces me to go low and if i'm too low , in the dirt , i know he s going to block it nova recalled the first time he pitched to mccann this spring and how impressed he was that mccann was already able to home in on the intricacies of his mechanics , which speaks to all the ipad video mccann has studied the first time i pitched to him , he saw something i was doing wrong , nova said when you have a guy who knows you , and knows the game like he does , it gives you confidence i know if he s calling for a pitch , he s calling it for a reason the presence he has here , it s like he s always been here c c sabathia spoke the same way about mccann he talked about how , in his first outing with mccann behind the plate , mccann was able to communicate details about mechanics that were off he talks to you , sabathia said , and i'm a guy who likes that i like the communication in addition to watching video of his pitchers , mccann also uses his ipad to study american league hitters , particularly those in the al east he looks not only for the obvious , but also for less noticeable tendencies , like guys who swing early , guys who do n't he has also absorbed data about his staff s pickoff moves , determining in advance what he will need to be cognizant of in steal situations mccann s work ethic has always been tireless , and his attention to detail with pitching staffs is well known none of it was a surprise to the yankees nova said i was thinking in the offseason , if we get a catcher , i want it to be mccann if he s available , i would like to sign that guy and once the yankees signed him , they gave him an ipad so he could get right to work inside pitch , who is competing for the fifth starter slot , gave up five hits and two runs , including a home run , over four innings phelps struggled with his command , which accounted for the 75 pitches he had to throw shortstop left friday s game as a precaution after he was kicked in the leg by minnesota s , who was sliding into second on a twoout force play colabello s foot caught nunez in the thigh it looked like he did n't realize it was two outs , said , the thirdbase coach , who is managing the splitsquad club in tampa while the rest of the team is in panama , who is returning from tommy john surgery , had another rough outing , allowing two hits , two walks and four earned runs in only a third of an inning he faced five batters it looked like he was scattered a bit and that he gave up some soft hits , thomson said to me , i'm just glad he s out there infielder was a late scratch with a sore hip he was hurt when he chased a foul ball into the stands thursday , vying for a bullpen role , threw one and twothirds innings of nohit ball , striking out two betances has pitched eight scoreless innings this spring , striking out seven and yielding only two hits
zurich for a while , it seemed , the tide had turned against the tradition of secrecy in zurich , the pristine alpine city that is a hub of global banking switzerland joined 60 nations in intended to unmask wealthy clients the american authorities have charged scores of swiss bankers and financial advisers with facilitating tax evasion and this month , after a carefully brokered deal , swiss banks are expected to hand over hundreds more names of their employees to the united states justice department in return for forgoing prosecutions of the banks themselves but the impression of change is misleading , regulators and members of the insular banking fraternity here say the reality , they say , remains closer to business as usual even as the swiss authorities have nodded at cooperation with frustrated governments abroad , at home laws on the books since 1934 make violating client confidentiality a crime and require bankers to guard secrecy like priests or lawyers bankers who cooperate with foreign officials and violate their duty of absolute silence , as it is known here , potentially face home raids , prison , fines for secrecy violations and industrial espionage , and the ostracism of colleagues and friends if anything , a backlash is building to protect the vaunted traditions of secrecy that undergird an essential pillar of the swiss economy the rightwing swiss people s party says it has gathered 80 percent of the 100 , 000 signatures required for a voter referendum in coming months to enshrine corporate secrecy in the constitution , warning against the insidious effect of foreign demands for tax information last week , pierre condamingerbier , a former banker , faced a swiss prosecutor on accusations of violating professional secrecy in connection with leaking information to the french authorities that information forced the resignation last year of a french budget minister who had a secret , undeclared swiss account at a time when his government was cracking down on tax evasion the result is that the bankers caught in a vise of competing legal forces are damned if they help either side in the meantime , those being pressured to reveal their secrets or those of their clients to american and other foreign authorities investigating tax evasion and other crimes are maintaining their code of silence for those bankers whose roles have brought legal charges abroad or the threat of them , that means avoiding extradition by staying within switzerland , living life in legal and personal limbo if you blow the whistle you are socially and financially dead , said , who ran the caribbean operations for the swiss bank julius baer until 2002 and has been under investigation for nine years for disclosing secret client information from a cayman islands outpost to the tax authorities in switzerland and abroad you face the threat here of going to prison your banking career is ruined you will never find a job the situation is particularly galling to bankers most at the midlevel who say they are being pressured to take the fall for more powerful superiors in an industry that still jealously guards itself by closing its ranks describing a life of secretive techniques worthy of james bond \( who quipped in a 1999 film , if you ca n't trust a swiss banker , then what s the world come to \? \) , bankers who were interviewed said that one of the practices under most intensive criminal investigation the clandestine recruitment of clients in the united states was not only known to their bosses , but was also part of a business model the bankers roamed the west and east coasts of the united states with company instructions to recruit rich clients on a luxury circuit of fivestar hotels , art exhibitions and tennis matches their bonuses , they said , depended on the business they cultivated and protected one veteran banker , who declined to be identified for fear he could be prosecuted in switzerland for secrecy violations , said every employee who worked with american clients followed strict security instructions he said the bankers carried special laptop computers formatted so that information could be wiped out instantly with a few keystrokes , and portable printers to avoid leaving traces elsewhere they avoided staying in the same luxury hotels , switching if anybody recognized them or called them by name he said he cut the name of the bank off receipts customers called from pay phones , using code names he said he carried separate paper lists , one with code numbers and one with corresponding names those names did not surface on bank records because they were shielded in a maze of offshore trusts and foundations , he said the real value of swiss bankers to the american authorities , he said , is that the bankers know the identities of the clients , since they had met with them at highend events like art basel in miami beach and golf tournaments it was all done for so many years , the banker said everybody knew i remember a party a few years ago with other bankers and i said , you know we all have one foot in prison' everybody laughed maybe that s why we were all paid so much while such tales might seem to come from the heyday of swiss banking , the culture continues , bankers , regulators and other experts say strictly nothing has fundamentally changed , said jean ziegler , a swiss sociologist and author the big issue in these banks is that violating secrecy is considered treachery swiss banks manage more than 6 trillion in assets , more than half of it from abroad and a figure that has remained relatively stable even through the economic crisis and pressures from governments abroad for greater transparency of depositors , according to daniela fluckiger , a spokeswoman for the trade group , the  to date , the united states justice department has charged more than 35 swiss bankers and 25 financial advisers with misconduct for facilitating tax evasion six have been convicted or pleaded guilty , the former head of ubs s global wealthmanagement business , awaits trial under house arrest in central new jersey with a global positioning device to track him the others live essentially marooned in their own country some bankers who are under scrutiny say their own personal banks have refused mortgages or canceled personal accounts because of concerns about their reputations being tarnished one woke up to a dawn raid when his computer and telephone were seized now employees are bracing as 100 or more swiss banks are expected to turn over more than 1 , 000 names and information to the united states , according to the , a trade group the justice department said those names would be used to investigate americans who evaded taxes along with the banks , bankers and advisers we are going to look very carefully that employees do n't have to pay for the strategies of their bosses , said denise chervet , a spokeswoman for the association it s unbelievable now that some of the top executives claim they did n't know to many bankers , mr elmer s case is instructive now unemployed , he has been imprisoned in the past for more than 200 days and sometimes held in solitary confinement as part of continuing investigations for secrecy violations even though some of those violations involved turning information over to the swiss tax authorities mr elmer and his former bank have sparred over private detectives who trailed his family , reaching a financial settlement for his daughter in 2011 , according to legal documents a bank spokesman for julius baer , which is also under investigation in the united states for aiding tax evasion , declined to discuss mr elmer s case in the last few years , mr elmer watched former colleagues face similar stark choices about whether to break the code of absolute silence none of them , he said , have cracked they do have the power to destroy your life , mr elmer said
a campaign aiming to deter a mass protest by those who favor a more direct election of hong kong s top leader collected 380 , 000 signatures in its first two days that puts it on a path to challenge the more than 700 , 000 votes of support the occupy central with love and peace movement received in an unofficial referendum last month robert chow , a spokesman for the new campaign , called the alliance for peace and democracy , said that turnout since the signature collection began on saturday had been overwhelming and that this would be a chance for hong kong s silent majority to speak up against occupy central , which has threatened to stage a sitin protest in the central financial district if procedures to elect the next leader of the semiautonomous chinese territory are not revised to grant the public greater say over who can run if we have 800 , 000 people , they would know that we beat them , mr chow , a former radio host and journalist , said in an interview on sunday i think the silent majority rightly feels that their voices have been ignored by the mainstream media and so when there s a chance for them to come out , they couldn t wait monday night , mr chow said that the monthlong campaign would not release updated numbers for the signatures until friday the emerging rivalry between the two groups reflects the divisions in public opinion over how hong kong s leader , the chief executive , should be chosen in the next election , in 2017 , and how far political activism should go while mr chow and his followers accept beijing s wish to limit the choice of candidates through a nominating committee , a band of political parties known as the pandemocrats and many younger residents have advocated granting the public the power to nominate candidates last month , more than 700 , 000 people onetenth of the city s population voted in the informal referendum commissioned by occupy central for proposals that would allow the general electorate to nominate candidates leung chunying , the chief executive elected by 689 votes in a 1 , 200member committee , said none of these proposals complied with the basic law , the region s miniconstitution echoing mr leung s view , mr chow argued that the public nomination method advocated by occupy central violates the basic law and that the activists are taking hong kong hostage an immediate cause of concern , he said , is the possible consequence of their threatened blockade of the central district he predicted a catastrophic disruption of traffic and emergency services in the event of a blockade , as depicted in a dramatic video his team released last month titled they can kill this city if you look around the world , democracy is great , but if it s a democracy without peace , what do you have \? mr chow said chan kinman , a sociology lecturer at the chinese university of hong kong and one of occupy central s founders , said mr chow s fears were exaggerated we ve made it very clear that although we would blockade traffic in central , we would reserve roads for emergency vehicles , mr chan said and the blockade s duration would determine the disruption the government could end it with a better election reform proposal and the police could arrest us we won t resist arrest the occupy central activists vow of nonviolence was bolstered by a sitin in central on july 12 although the participants ignored police warnings to vacate the area they were eventually carried away there were no reports of violence between the protesters and the police alex chow , a leader of the university student coalition federation of students , who was among the 511 people arrested on july 2 , said that the antioccupy central campaign was wrong to equate their activism with violence still , regina ip , the former security chief of hong kong and a legislator , has said she is worried that an occupy central sitin could escalate , and recalled a recent protest where opponents of a controversial development bill charged the legislative council building critics of the occupy central movement also say that a sitin would damage hong kong s economy by hurting relations with beijing last month , hsbc reduced hong kong stocks rating to underweight on concerns that occupy central could sour relations with china and may hurt the economy kenneth wong , 28 , who works for an advertising firm , predicted that hong kong residents increasing defiance of beijing would cost the city favorable policies from the central government , allowing hong kong s status as a financial center to be eclipsed by shanghai meanwhile , questions have been raised as to whether the number of signatures being collected now can be compared to the number of votes cast in the occupy central referendum in mr chow s antioccupy campaign , any person , including children and nonhong kong residents , is permitted to sign at more than 400 locations across hong kong through aug 17 the statement they sign says i oppose violence i oppose occupy central i support peace for hong kong i support democracy for hong kong on aug 2 , the campaign will also begin accepting signatures online while onsite volunteers check that the name and first figures of participants hong kong id code match what is written on the signature form , there is no mechanism to prevent people from signing in multiple locations by contrast , the occupy central referendum , which was conducted by a pollster at the university of hong kong , required a unique local mobile phone number for each vote and asked that only local residents over the age of 18 vote the conclusion of the signature campaign in midaugust coincides with when china s top legislative body , the standing committee of the national people s congress , is expected to draw up its own blueprint for procedures to elect the next chief executive

women run just a quarter of the biggest art museums in the united states and canada , and they earn about a third less than their male counterparts , according to by the association of art museum directors , a professional organization the group examined salary data on the 217 members it had last year through the prism of gender , for the first time the report noted strides made by women at small and midsize museums , with budgets under 15 million , often university or contemporaryart institutions here , women have basically achieved parity , holding nearly half of the directorships and earning just about the same as men but the gap is glaring at big institutions , those with budgets over 15 million only 24 percent are led by women , and they make 29 percent less than their male peers and just five of the 33 most prominent art museums those with budgets greater than 20 million have women at the helm there is a difference if a woman is running one of these big museums , said elizabeth easton , director of the , a training program in new york that has helped place nine women in directorships , but none at the country s most influential museums those directors are the most loud and authoritative voices it sets the tone she added everyone just claps their hands and says that it s getting better but with boards full of men and search committees gravitating to men , it s not going to get better christine anagnos , director of the association and one of four authors of the report , pointed to a trend of highprofile appointments of men at major museums , replacing female directors , including in philadelphia , dallas and newark that trend could change , with the cleveland museum of art searching for a new director with the announcement last week by malcolm rogers that he was retiring from the , as soon as a successor is found and with the directors of the national gallery in washington and the brooklyn museum being over 65 but experts debate not only whether women will get those plum jobs , but also whether they will pursue them is it that women are not being offered those jobs , or they 're choosing not to take those jobs \? asked lisa phillips , director of the new museum in new york , who initiated the idea for the study written in partnership with the national center for arts research , , called the gender gap in museum directorships , explores the factors contributing to the gulf at the top and frames the findings within the debate provoked by sheryl sandberg s book lean in and annemarie slaughter s 2012 article in the atlantic combining large and small institutions , the report found that an average of 42 percent of the association s museum directors were women that is certainly a different picture from 25 years ago , when only 14 percent of museums in the association were run by women , and a slight improvement from 38 percent five years ago on average , however , women who run art institutions earned 21 percent less than their male counterparts in 2013 a bigger difference than the 18 percent overall median pay split between the sexes reported by the federal  the report , which incorporated observations from interviews with six executive search recruiters , considered reasons for the gap , including the ratio of men to women on museum boards , which hire directors while the recruiters agreed that boards were no longer allmale clubs women now outnumber men , 59 to 30 , on the board of the museum of fine arts , houston , for instance gender ratios remain uneven at the metropolitan museum of art , the male voting members still outnumber female ones , 23 to 10 at the national gallery , the board has seven men and two women but ms phillips is skeptical about how much gender composition on a board is a factor in hiring we all have biases , she said there are many subtle forms of discrimination and selfcensorship that are culturally ingrained kimerly rorschach , a finalist in 2011 to direct the houston museum , was hired in 2012 to lead the seattle art museum , which has a 23 million budget she made the leap from director of the nasher museum of art at duke university , whose budget is under 5 million besides ms rorschach , the other four women leading art museum with budgets of over 20 million are at the royal ontario museum , at the corning museum of glass , at the montreal museum of fine arts and at the minneapolis institute of arts seattle had an experience of a very successful woman director , and gender was n't an issue for them , she said , referring to a predecessor , mimi gates in some of these searches , i think boards can be more focused on outward appearances or the job the person held before than whether they 're really bringing the right skills to the job charles wright , the chairman of the seattle museum board , which has 39 men and 35 women , said of ms rorschach s compensation we 're paying what we perceive as top dollar for our current director , and she negotiated well for it maybe men historically have had a more inflated sense of themselves and have negotiated harder for compensation than women have the skill set for the route up is different from the skill set to be an effective leader , said kathryn kolbert , director of the at barnard college , which was not involved with the gender gap study many of the skills that women bring are collaboration , working well with boards , she explained but women do worse on the visioning factor than men sarah james , of , an executive recruiter , worked with the metropolitan museum , the guggenheim and the museum of fine arts , houston , in their last director searches resulting in the hiring of three men she said that while women often focused in interviews on how they were great managers , male candidates tended to lead with their ideas and are very comfortable saying this is what we could do together professional training programs have helped many women move into directorships at midsize museums olga viso , who participated in the getty leadership institute in 2004 , is now in her second directorship , at the walker art center in minneapolis , after leading the hirshhorn in washington since 2008 , the center for curatorial leadership has helped 13 curators become directors , including nine women but , of the 13 , it was a man , gary tinterow , a curator for 28 years at the metropolitan museum , who landed the biggest directorship , , with an operating budget of 52 million kathy halbreich , a former director of the walker , questions whether many women actually want to run the big institutions walker was the institution i wanted to lead , said ms halbreich , who chose not to pursue another directorship after her 16year tenure there , and focuses on curatorial initiatives as associate director of the museum of modern art she pointed to three directors and friends ann philbin of the hammer museum in los angeles , thelma golden of the studio museum in harlem , and ms phillips of the new museum and said , each i know has been approached by bigger institutions , and out of a great sense of mission and selfawareness has decided that where they are is where they 're happy ms james , the recruiter , said she had a difficult time getting women interested in the guggenheim director s job in 2008 , which called for managing its institutions around the globe we heard from them that it seemed like an empire , she said \( the job went to richard armstrong , former director of the carnegie museum of art \) but ms phillips , looking across the whole field , now has her doubts about whether women should reject major leadership positions as they open up when you see the absence of women , she said , it makes you wonder whether it s something that we really need to do , regardless of whether we want to do it
john duddy , a former middleweight boxer , leaned against a moving truck parked in front of a residential highrise along central park west this is one of the most beautiful buildings in the city , said duddy , his sleepy blue eyes brightening on a recent afternoon i really love it around here duddy , 35 , was not far from madison square garden , where he fought , and won , nine times in recent years , his fan base bolstered by a loyal legion from his native ireland although duddy achieved a good measure of fame , thrilling crowds with a willingness to exchange big punches in the middle of the ring , he said he was financially mishandled for most of his eightyear career and did not reap the monetary reward he thought he deserved boxing is a tough business , he said , his face partly hidden behind a short beard that is as thick as his brogue duddy then began lugging someone else s belongings into the highrise , as he is now employed by a moving company based in the bronx things are a little different for me these days , but i still have to put bread on the table , said duddy , who is married and rents an apartment in the middle village section of queens with his wife , grainne , who is a hostess at a nearby bar now i'm doing some honest work that helps pay the bills and does n't involve me getting beat up , said duddy , laughing as he carefully pushed a handcart stacked with boxes into a freight elevator obviously , i'm not financially set for life , so moving is something i can do until the next best thing comes along the next best thing appears to be an that is slowly taking off duddy worked on the set of last year s a comedy about aging fighters starring robert de niro and sylvester stallone to polish boxingrelated routines with de niro he and de niro formed what duddy called a bit of a friendship and a great rapport in the six weeks they worked together duddy said that de niro later placed a call on his behalf to cast him in a film about the boxer roberto duran , hands of stone , which stars de niro as duran s former trainer , ray arcel duddy , who plays the fighter ken buchanan , filmed scenes in los angeles and in duran s native panama the movie is scheduled for release next year being involved in a project like that was one of the greatest experiences of my life , said duddy , who is 5foot11 and has maintained his fighting weight , 160 pounds in one scene , we were filming a news conference , when it finally hit me i'm standing there thinking , oh my god , i'm shooting a scene with robert de niro' known as the derry destroyer , a homage to his hometown in ireland , or simply as ireland s john duddy , he retired from boxing in january 2011 of 29 victories \( 18 knockouts \) and 2 losses one of the highlights of duddy s career came at the garden in september 2006 , when he defeated the highly regarded luis yori boy campas by in a savage 12round melee , a bout that will be shown thursday at 8 and 10 pm on msg network though duddy earned the fairly insignificant international boxing association middleweight title that night , he had become the people s champion i was very fortunate that new yorkers took me under their wing , he said there are so many workingclass people in this city , and i was a workingclass fighter that s why we connected in november 2008 , when duddy was widely considered the most prominent irish boxer in the world , he parted ways with irish ropes , the company that represented him duddy said i never knew how much money my fights generated , or how much money was coming in or going out i was always kept in the dark i was definitely mishandled , kind of like a horse led by a carrot from one fight to the next , always being told that my next fight would bring in more money i trusted with my heart and kept fighting with my heart , but your heart can only take you so far in that business after a while , you have to open your eyes and start thinking on your feet asked how much money he had earned in boxing , and how much money he thought he had been shortchanged , duddy smiled and politely said , that s none of your business but duddy acknowledged that he was involved in an unusual business arrangement that created what he considered a conflict of interest he was guided by two brothers eddie mcloughlin , who founded and controlled irish ropes , was duddy s promoter tony mcloughlin was duddy s manager when reached by phone to discuss duddy s dealings with irish ropes , tony mcloughlin said , i do n't want to talk about it , and hung up several contact numbers for eddie mcloughlin were disconnected , and he could not be reached for comment duddy eventually turned to a new manager , craig hamilton , who contended that duddy had been cheated out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by irish ropes hamilton said , this was lifechanging money that certainly would have afforded john some different choices in life they eventually settled a lawsuit out of court duddy s final five professional bouts were fought under hamilton , who accused irish ropes , now defunct , of not giving john his fair share of the money he had earned in the ring he was mishandled in terms of what he was receiving financially , hamilton said it was egregious john had no real representation because his manager was the brother of the promoter , and you do n't have to be a harvard graduate to understand how that is a conflict of interest these guys were making deals and whacking up money , and it cost john a lot of dough jim borzell , who was the director of boxing for irish ropes , called hamilton s assertions pure nonsense duddy was getting bad advice from the guys at the end of the bar and decided he was being ripped off , borzell said that was n't the case borzell said that duddy had , in the end , chosen the perfect second career for himself wherever he went , women crowded three deep around john duddy , borzell said the kid has moviestar good looks and a ton of charisma i think he has a real future in show business duddy has done some theatrical work in recent years shortly after he retired from the ring , he played the title role in kid shamrock , a 2011 off broadway production based on the life of irish bobby cassidy , a former worldranked boxer more recently , duddy in a 2013 bon jovi video , because we can i 've fallen in love with the whole notion of being involved with the cast and crew and the light technicians and the stunt guys and the director , duddy said it s a wonderful feeling , and much different than the feeling i had in boxing , where i was totally alone in the ring on a movie set , you have this whole family around you duddy unloaded the boxes and returned to the moving truck he checked his cellphone for messages , always hoping for a call about another potential acting job once in a while , when i'm working around town , i get recognized by a sanitation man or a police officer or someone else who was a fan of mine , duddy said it s wonderful to know that some people have n't forgotten what i did in the ring and hopefully , one day , they 'll also remember me for what i accomplished on the stage and on screen
the israeli ground offensive in gaza is nothing short of criminal and in contravention of international law and human rights once again the death toll is shaping up to be roughly 25 palestinians to 1 israeli this makes a mockery of the old refrain israel has a right to defend itself , which sadly continues to be the official line of the american and canadian governments the firing of unguided hamas rockets into israel may be an irritant , but 99 percent of these rockets fall harmlessly in the desert or are shot down by an antimissile system this is hardly an excuse to kill hundreds of innocent palestinians if israel wants the hamas rockets to stop , all it needs to do is stop bulldozing palestinian homes and get serious about a palestinian state until then , american financial support for israel must stop , and the canadian government likewise must desist from lending moral support to israel s actions  re who s right and wrong in middle east \? \( july 21 \) nicholas kristof ignores the fundamental dissymmetry between hamas and israel hamas is openly committed to violently destroying israel , whereas israel has submitted multiple peace proposals to the palestinian authority , each of which was rejected despite their provisions for a palestinian state in seeking to realize its goal , hamas overtly targets israeli civilians and uses its own civilians as human shields in contrast , israel does more than any other nation in a war situation to minimize the other side s civilian casualties nonetheless , many palestinians , not only those connected to hamas , publicly celebrate the murder of jews in israel there is widespread , public outpouring of israeli sympathy for the tragic deaths of palestinian civilians there may indeed be farreaching similarities between israelis and palestinians , but peaceful coexistence can only be achieved by addressing the dissymmetry manifested by hamas and its followers israel has no parallel for them by omitting this essential point , mr kristof offers no constructive or realistic solution to israelis or palestinians  prime minister benjamin netanyahu would certainly reject any moral equivalence between the behavior of hamas and of his own government that hamas s rocket attacks do not distinguish between military and civilian targets is criminal but what defines the moral difference between palestinians and the jews of israel is that israelis have a state of their own , while palestinians have lived without rights under israel s military occupation that has lasted nearly half a century during israel s war of independence when the jews of palestine were fighting for a state of their own , they too targeted civilian areas and committed atrocities against palestinian civilians in order to encourage the exodus of 700 , 000 arabs from their homes , as documented by benny morris , israel s leading historian on the war \( in his book righteous victims \) , and by ari shavit \( in my promised land \) both israeli authors seek to justify those crimes by arguing that there would not have been a jewish state without them why would that argument not serve to justify hamas s crimes as well \? mr netanyahu is fond of declaring that the difference between us and them is that israelis do not celebrate the deeds of terrorists apparently he is not aware that israelis not only have named streets for the heads of jewish terrorist groups \( the irgun and the stern gang \) , but elected them menachem begin and yitzhak shamir as heads of state the writer is president of the us middle east project and a former head of the american jewish congress  re leading through great loss \( july 18 \) nicholas kristof s comparison of the situation in israel and gaza to that of spain and the basque region , and england and northern ireland , is way off the mark neither the basque separatists nor the irish republican army ever questioned the right of spain or england to exist , nor the right of their citizens to live in their respective countries neither group was trying to push all the citizens of the country that ruled them into the sea they only wanted to push them out of their territory hamas , by contrast , does not recognize israel s right to exist , period as to israel s response to hamas , it is proportional to the number of missiles launched against us whether these missile attacks are successful or not is not the point they are not mere firecrackers they have the potential to wreak havoc , and only israel s investment in the iron dome antimissile system has prevented them from causing much harm so far israel has been concentrating on destroying tunnels that cross the border and missile stockpiles i consider that a proportional response as in any war , sometimes people are hurt or killed israel has nothing to apologize for  it is a credit to israel s moral stature that it is doing everything it can to limit the killings of innocent civilians in gaza by warning them multiple times in advance , even at risk to israeli citizens , a concept completely foreign to the many countries criticizing israel right now  please report about the civilian bomb shelters in gaza wait , there are none instead , hamas uses its citizens as human shields for munitions and to increase israeli casualties for the media if it were somalia or sudan , would the media not report this with moral outrage \?
season 2 , episode 12 , the revolution will not be televised oh how i wish that it would rain , rain , rain on bill the finale of this second season restores dr william masters s control over nearly everything in his orbit , putting his research and his own sex life back on track the question for many viewers , i suspect , is whether the show s lengthy exposition of bill s character flaws have strained our interest in the historical story line of the sex pioneers masters and johnson , or whether the strong performances by michael sheen as dr masters and lizzy caplan as virginia johnson will lure us back next year when we began this season , bill was still standing on virginia s doorstep in a downpour , acknowledging how much he needed her and throughout these 12 episodes , we ve been mucked up in his failures , as he broke rule after rule in one hospital after another , always running to virginia for comfort and approbation his inability to achieve some academic breakthrough and acclaim translated into his own sexual impotence we ve been left at the finale with romantic , emotional moments tugging at us bill curled up in virginia s arms , the two embracing , bill broken down emotionally for only virginia to see in this episode , the word trust is used repeatedly by bill and others unfortunately for virginia , the abiding trust she has placed in bill , from one job to another , becomes , at the close of this season , her downfall as a mother it s an incredibly wrenching development for virginia on to the recap  tv troubles if you recall , in last week s episode bill was extremely uncomfortable with the cbs interview he had initiated by hiring the public relations expert shep tally \( adam arkin \) and his irritation with the final , sanitized version continued into this week and was echoed by lester linden \( kevin christy \) , who mocked the censorship that prohibited even a single utterance of the word sex using the term physical dysfunction instead of sexual dysfunction could well describe gout or amputation , lester quips \( lester , the documentary filmmaker for masters and johnson , rivaled betty , played by annaleigh ashford , as the comedic element on the show in these last episodes \) both virginia and shep try to assuage bill s reluctance with airing the interview , pleading with him to consider the importance of simply getting their work out there to millions of american households cbs is very pleased no one else has a story like it , shep says it s a scoop shep reveals that bill s rival in the research field of male impotence , dr joseph kaufmann of ucla , will publish a book , man and sex , in just two months it s imperative to get ahead of that , shep says once you ve marked your territory , the next guy to come along often looks like yesterday s news , he adds later , bill frets to virginia that their research is nowhere near publication our work is in a fragile and delicate state , he reminds her virginia jokingly wonders aloud if he s referring to their work or to the fact that they have just realized they may have cured his impotence , by slowly becoming more intimate over a period of three weeks \( admittedly , i m not a sex therapist , but the notion that a 21day cure to impotence through escalations of touching however powerful virginia s healing efforts may be does seem a bit flimsy as a breakthrough technique for external research \) the competition , though , poses a problem , virginia insists if his book happens to catch the public s fancy , she warns , they will be cut out of the public discussion entirely mother , interrupted meanwhile , virginia is battling her exhusband , george johnson \( mather zickel \) , who she and we can sarcastically exclaim has suddenly found fatherhood as his calling after all her years of single parenthood , virginia learns that she s about to be exposed as an unfit mother , and in a courtroom , no less she stupidly believed that george would be satisfied with his sixweek trek through europe with their children , tessa and henry still , there s an offscreen influence afoot george s wife of six months , audrey , who apparently has become a hit with the children neither of us is particularly great parent material , gin , george tells her audrey is don t our kids deserve to have one parent who puts them first \? virginia consults a divorce lawyer , herb spleeb \( jack laufer \) , who delivers a great line new wives are like francium , the most unstable of elements , he says , noting that he once dabbled in chemistry when he believed there was order in the universe now he gets contracts signed , something virginia failed to do when her marriage to george ended over martinis , george threatens virginia with public humiliation if a custody suit goes to trial at work , she watches people fornicating and she s also having an affair with her boss \( the time period reflects a different perspective , he reminds her , when courts were biased against fathers long before kramer vs kramer , i d add so he has to prove that virginia is an unfit mother \) the strange alliance on a park bench , bill s wife , libby \( caitlin fitzgerald \) , and virginia discuss her predicament in friendly ways that , well , would puzzle anyone , given what we know about how they share bill virginia wonders if she should quit work , to show the judge her commitment to her children libby , on the other hand , who has played the quintessential motherathome with two children , now questions her role , or perhaps more apt , her history of defining herself through her children although she adores her children , libby says , when i think that they may be all that there is for me , it s not enough she adds , they cannot be the only thing , just them and only them , or i will die , if not literally then at least startled , virginia asks if something has happened , but libby doesn t let on about her new affair what really matters , she asks virginia , in thinking about their kids \? they re safe \? i don t know , that they re happy and they know , they know that they re loved , virginia replies maybe that s the key , to let go of some ideal , to live the life that you have , not the life that you thought you would have , libby acknowledges as much to herself as to virginia to finally accept what is what that is remains unsaid the scene leaves them both staring outward , shaking their heads libby s awakening last week s lovely coupling of libby and robert \( jocko sims \) on her kitchen floor did indeed leave quite a few of us flummoxed what were her intentions \? why is she acting so out of character , rebelling if you will , in ways that are so dangerously crossing racial and marital boundaries \? this week , she oddly shows up at 2 am at robert s door upon his return from atlanta , where the rev dr martin luther king jr has been arrested where is bill \? who is at home with the children \? somehow i can t fathom this bold move on libby s part as plausible once again , who is this woman we re watching evolve \? in so many different ways , with many characters , this show keeps asking us to take leaps of faith , to use a term repeatedly expressed this week and i do want to praise libby s growth as a character she should get credit for finding a work outlet through the civil rights office of the congress of racial equality \( core \) and for managing therapeutic work around bill s horrible neglect of her and the children once again robert acts as their conscience , citing the reckless nature of last week s sex he wants it to stop , he apologizes , suggesting that he may have acted that way because it was so dangerous , to connect with a woman so outside my world libby , dressed underneath her coat in the skimpiest nightgown we ve never seen her wear before , won t stand for his apologies she wants him to want her later , when they are spooning in his bed , and he tells her again they have to stop , libby persists and explains what she has learned about herself upon meeting robert and yes , gives us a big reveal i know that my husband has been having an affair for years , and i used to just pretend that it wasn t happening , she says i focused on my children but in meeting robert , she realized what she truly wanted i know i want to feel so one mystery solved libby knew about bill s affair with virginia is that her motivation in seeking out robert \? it would seem so , definitely misery in motherhood meanwhile , virginia scrambles to stave off the damage to her reputation that would occur if she winds up in court bill finds her staring at their bulletin board filled with case notes , and intends to talk to her about dr kaufmann s manuscript and the show but she s frozen , waiting for her lawyer as a mother , he wanted to make it a matter of public record , the prurient nature of our work , and the hours i spend here , the hours i spend with you , virginia tells bill meaning we would have two debuts , one on cbs , the two us being introduced to the country as groundbreaking pioneers , while at the same time , a judge in some court would be presenting us to the world as sleazy , amoral slut peddlers george s lawyer had also been inquiring at their hotel about their comings and goings bill discerns from her tearful disclosure that she s given up her children but she assures him that it s temporary , that once their interview airs , she ll get them back she can show the court that my part is respectable and legitimate i can use the sterling reputation of cbs to get the kids back if only she knew how deceitful her partner was , and is the master of manipulation bill manages to scuttle the cbs broadcast interview with him and virginia at first , we re not privy to how the segment was canceled bill had surreptitiously obtained a galley of the book man and sex , by his rival , dr kaufmann , and tells betty , the office aide , that there s not much data there betty asks if the book is akin to summer reading , while bill likens it to their cbs film , light on science our work will leave dr kaufmann in the dust , bill boasts shep shows up with a news clip of dr kaufmann on a competing network , which announces his groundbreaking work in uncharted territory the news stuns virginia lester jokes that at least in this news clip , the word sex is used three times in a fourminute story , unlike their own cbs interview and then shep delivers the harsh blow one that will punish virginia most that cbs has killed the masters and johnson segment as if that news isn t difficult enough to swallow , it turns out that dr kaufmann has a partner none other than dr ethan haas , virginia s former boyfriend oh , and he lobs a salvo at virginia through the camera s transom and there s also room to explore the role of women and their interactions with men running from the room , virginia sobs , crying out to bill i gave my kids up for that \? for nothing \? and she wonders if she s to blame , because of ethan s alliance with dr kaufmann completely at ease about the cancellation , bill claims the interview wouldn t have changed anything what matters , he says as he holds her , is that they get back to work well , was that for him to decide alone \? bill s role in all this is another big reveal , when dr barton scully \( his mentor , played by beau bridges \) reappears it turns out that bill has been calling him to get a hold of dr kaufmann s book and bart was the intermediary who engineered the scoop by the competing network , helping bill to kill the cbs story when bill seems less than happy with the outcome , he startles bart by disclosing that he didn t know virginia was in the middle of a custody dispute and that he didn t tell her what he was doing bart doesn t believe bill when he says that if he could take all his actions back , he would bill , he says , blackmailed him into allowing him to do his research back at maternity hospital doing everything on bill s terms only , bart says , it s hell on the people around you and no picnic for you either , as far as i can tell i never meant to hurt virginia , bill replies no , you never do , bart answers at the close of the episode , everyone is watching the presidential inauguration of john f kennedy in january 1961 , with clips of his speech playing over some scenes virginia and bill sit side by side in lab coats , imploring lester and his girlfriend , barbara sanderson \( betsy brandt \) , to trust them with a new approach , another method to try to help them their failures in the past don t have to be the end of the story notes and questions the remarkable displays of bill s hubris , virginia s loss and libby s progression meant that i left out a lot of wild , fun scenes among other characters the movie dates between lester and barbara shone so brightly , often providing amusement including their twin pajama sets once they decided to sleep together in lester s bed \( and yes , lester glimpses one of her breasts through an open bathroom door while she changes \) she liked pillow talk with doris day and rock hudson , while he preferred the art film l avventura for its portrayal of a messy , complicated couple is that the series asking us , as well , what we prefer when watching entertainment about couples \? one other observation above lester s bed is the movie poster starring humphrey bogart in sirocco , a 1950s tale of syrian rebels contemporary message here \? as for flo packer \( artemis pebdani \) and dr austin langham \( teddy sears \) , well , dr langham gets a comeuppance flo brags about having coveted seats to the kennedy inaugural her family owns the prominent midwestern packer hardware company and dr langham begs to be her date but he can t explain why nato was formed , which she explains is the ticket to intellectual entry for her family after all , she prepares for family gettogethers by reading the new york times cover to cover for a week as if she were studying for a test \( i know , cheeky plug for my employer , but i didn t write the line ! \) her family , she says , would take one look at you and say wow , he really is blond flo closes with austin , please , women pay a lot of money for that color in a hair salon so , thanks for reading every week and i do wonder if any of our readers feel satisfied by this season s conclusion were you as troubled as i was by bill s deceptions \? or did virginia s often absent presence as a mother leave her vulnerable to such a dire result \? and did you suspect , as many of us did , that libby was on to bill and virginia s affair \? and if so , why do you think she never confronted either of them \? i do wonder when betty will get a life again , don t you \?

it s not a lot , cameron , 28 , said for me it s one of the things where i'm representing my family , my town , my name , and , most importantly , the united states you are representing your country and trying to prove that americans can play compared with the past decade , the number of americans earning consistent minutes in top european leagues is at a low point there are none in spain s la liga or italy s serie a and in germany s bundesliga , only fabian johnson and timothy chandler \( now injured \) have seen the field regularly this year after jermaine jones left schalke in january for besiktas in turkey in the premier league , the list of players has dwindled to a select few , with only cameron , striker jozy altidore and goalkeepers tim howard and brad guzan playing on a weekly basis cameron is aware of his status as part of the limited american presence in europe , as well as how quickly things can change during the last offseason , stoke city replaced its defenseoriented coach , tony pulis , with mark hughes his first season has been marked with inconsistency stoke sits in 12th place in where it is just six points from relegation but only one from a top10 finish cameron remains bullish about the team s chances , and he insisted that this year has been an adjustment to a new style of play that will serve the club better over the long run he noted that the club had shown glimpses of its potential with wins over chelsea and manchester united , and he said he was not worried about relegation and confident that the club could achieve its preseason goal of finishing in the top 10 cameron has at times been reluctant to talk about his versatility and his preferred position it is a difficult topic for him , because he rose to prominence on the united states national team in central defense but was shifted to right back at stoke by pulis the move helped his club career but made it tougher for him to earn minutes for united states coach jurgen klinsmann cameron said he was felt a lot more comfortable about the topic , in part because he enjoys the way he is asked to play the right back position he thinks his best position is still either in central defense or in a central midfield role , but that having the freedom to attack under hughes has made him enjoy the right back role more than ever i'm feeling more comfortable because it s better football it s not just kick and run , cameron said now you 're more confident because you 're getting the ball at your feet i want to create and make things happen i'm playing in one of the best leagues in the world , he added the best players in the world are playing here in the premier league that s good for my confidence i feel like i am here for a reason , because i'm a good enough player to play in this league and be a consistent starter every week hughes has praised cameron s versatility , and he recently acknowledged that cameron is a big part of his plans geoff s done really well , hughes said at a recent news conference i think he s shown everybody that he s an accomplished footballer first and foremost , and he has the ability to play in different positions obviously he s played mostly for me in fullback positions he s done that very , very well and he s a part of our attacking threat with his ability to join in high up the field you can move geoff around and you know you 're not going to lessen the ability of people in other positions because geoff can make an impact wherever you pick him with the world cup approaching , cameron s success at stoke has come at a good time for the u s cameron was named to the roster for wednesday s exhibition against ukraine in cyprus , which will be the team s final game including its european players before the world cup camp opens in may in brazil , cameron and the united states team will face a difficult firstround group that includes ghana , portugal and germany but cameron , like klinsmann , said he liked his team s chances i think we 've proven ourselves over the last few years what we can do , and i think we 've gotten better and better every year , cameron said to do that , we have the mindset that we 're not fearful of any team that s my mindset at the end of the day , he added , i think we 'll be one of the teams going to the second round
when woody allen received a few weeks ago , there was a lively debate about whether it was appropriate to honor a man who is an artistic giant but also was accused years ago of child molestation allen s defenders correctly note that he denies the allegations , has never been convicted and should be presumed innocent people weighed in on all sides , but one person who has n't been heard out is dylan farrow , 28 , the writer and artist whom allen was accused of molesting dylan , allen s adopted daughter who is now married and living in florida under a different name , tells me that she has been traumatized for more than two decades by what took place last year , she was belatedly diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder she says that when she heard of the golden globe award being given to allen she curled up in a ball on her bed , crying hysterically with everyone else commenting , she decided to weigh in as well \( full disclosure i am a friend of her mother , mia , , and that s how dylan got in touch with me \) she has written a letter that , i reached out to allen several days ago , and he declined to comment on the record dylan writes a firestorm erupted in 1992 over allegations described as inappropriate touching in fact , what dylan recounts is far worse , a sexual assault she was 7 years old there were charges and countercharges a panel of psychiatrists sided with allen ,  that there was enough evidence for a criminal case against allen but that he was dropping criminal proceedings to spare dylan look , none of us can be certain what happened the standard to send someone to prison is guilt beyond a reasonable doubt , but should n't the standard to honor someone be that they are unimpeachably , well , honorable \? yet the golden globes sided with allen , in effect accusing dylan either of lying or of not mattering that s the message that celebrities in film , music and sports too often send to abuse victims i know it s he said , she said , ' dylan told me but , to me , it s black and white , because i was there i asked her why she s speaking out now she said she wants to set the record straight and give courage to victims i was thinking , if i do n't speak out , i 'll regret it on my death bed these are extremely tough issues , and certainty is n't available but hundreds of thousands of boys and girls are abused each year , and they deserve support and sensitivity when evidence is ambiguous , do we really need to leap to our feet and lionize an alleged molester \? but i want to leave you with a sense of dylan s resolve she declares that s something for all of us , even those who are n't stars , to reflect on
palo alto , calif in response to russian support for ukrainian rebels , and in coordination with european leaders , president obama has instituted the most comprehensive set of economic sanctions ever against russian officials and companies europe is considering alternate energy policies to reduce russia s economic leverage nato is reenergized and moral , unified condemnation of russia s actions has damaged russia s international reputation in time , these steps will be likely to make russian officials , business leaders and citizens question the strategy of their president , vladimir v putin , in ukraine in the short run , however , mr putin is unlikely to change his mind these steps alone will only make him more defiant those who hope such pressure will end the war in ukraine will be disappointed instead , while maintaining pressure on mr putin , the west also needs to get serious about strengthening ukraine so far , ukrainians have done more to thwart mr putin than any action by outside powers before toppling president viktor f yanukovych in february , ukrainian protests stopped him from joining the eurasian economic union , mr putin s most important foreign policy project ukrainian outrage over mr putin s annexation of crimea has consolidated ukraine s national identity , and it now looks to the west for prosperity and security and recent ukrainian military victories have undermined mr putin s plans in eastern ukraine western support for ukraine is substantial , but more could be done most immediately , the west should provide the ukrainian military with as much intelligence as possible , both to help its fighters protect themselves and to help them avoid killing civilians nothing hurts ukraine s campaign for sovereignty and unification more than civilian casualties if requested , the west also should provide ukraine with nonlethal assistance , like body armor and night vision goggles the west also needs to counter russia s propaganda with its own information offensive moscow has framed its mission in ukraine as a defensive struggle against ukrainian nazis and western imperialism in response , the west should disseminate accurate information about russian actions and western motivations , not only by providing more resources to traditional channels like voice of america , but also by supporting new sources of reporting , like blogs and online news outlets the west can likewise do more to help the kiev government win hearts and minds in eastern ukraine it should encourage kiev to reduce civilian casualties through safer humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to flee the war zone in addition , the west could send more humanitarian assistance through the ukrainian government , to aid refugees the west should also convene an international donors conference to create a donbass development fund for reconstruction in eastern ukraine after the war the mere creation of such a fund would help change the negative image of the west in the region , as would new scholarships and internship programs and the west must continue to support economic and political reforms in ukraine president petro o poroshenko has emphasized that russian aggression cannot be used as an excuse to delay things like budget restructuring and efforts to improve government transparency but he and his government need more financial and technical assistance from western governments , international institutions and nongovernmental organizations ensuring maximum participation and a free vote in the next parliamentary election must be a top priority none of these actions require mr putin s participation to be effective and i deliberately used the term the west to make clear that these initiatives could be pursued by a variety of institutions the american and european governments , collectively or alone , as well as foundations , nongovernmental organizations and private citizens nonwestern actors who value international norms should engage as well finally , western leaders must continue to encourage kiev to engage with legitimate representatives \( not the russian mercenaries \) of eastern ukraine to craft a plan for reconciliation the components of such a plan are clear some decentralization of political authority , stronger guarantees for the use of the russian language and perhaps the introduction of international monitors to help local communities feel more secure kiev s credible commitment to a postwar plan now , instead of waiting until the fighting is over , could help to isolate and split the insurgents even if complete military victory is achievable , the kiev government must realize that the benefits of some negotiation process with the local population outweigh the costs of ruling the region as occupiers how it wins the war will determine how lasting the peace will be mr putin could end this war now in a speech on national television , he could praise the socalled rebels for securing greater autonomy for eastern ukraine and then ask them to stop fighting , and for the russian citizens to come home this path to peace is quick , but unlikely in its absence , the west s best option is to redouble its support for a sovereign , prosperous and democratic ukraine
augusta , ga tiger woods is missing from this year s masters , and so are all the people we once expected to replace him rory mcilroy , often called woods s heir apparent , was an afterthought saturday who bolted from the grounds of augusta national golf club before the leaders had pulled into the parking lot to begin the third round phil mickelson , woods s longesttenured rival , is home in san diego after two plodding rounds adam scott , the defending masters champion , whose swing resembles the old tiger s , disappeared from the leader board saturday after bogeying three of his first five holes sergio garc a , who as a young lad was supposed to nip at an aging tiger s heels , did not make the cut but maybe we have had it all wrong about who will supplant woods as the world s best golfer maybe it will not be a golfer born in the 1970s or 1980s maybe we should be thinking younger it could be someone who listens to the talk of woods s onetime dominance and rolls his eyes the way he does when his grandfather talks about elvis maybe the golfer who displaces woods one day will be so young he will call him mr woods , because that s how he refers to all his golfing elders on the pga tour which means almost everyone maybe it will be someone like jordan spieth , born in the summer of 1993 and now tied for the thirdround lead of the masters anointing spieth as the next anything in golf is premature at best and abject folly at worst he has one very long masters sunday to survive , and that is a crucible that may leave him wobbly and far from the top 10 we have seen it many times , most recently with mcilroy , the thirdround leader in 2011 who finished tied for 15th but even if spieth fails , there is something about his attitude this week that sets him apart and may reflect his generation of golfers , who never saw woods become a phenomenon because he was already the world s greatest golfer by the time they were in second grade woods is not from another generation to them he is from another era they say lots of young professional golfers have learned to no longer fear woods spieth and his brethren probably never knew they were supposed to fear woods in the first place spieth has been the test case of the 1990s pro golfer this week at augusta national , and so far , he has been calm and unruffled he is a masters rookie with none of the wonder his watch words are patience and respect he talked about lessons he had been taught this week by mr crenshaw and mr nicklaus asked how he determines whether to call someone mister , spieth said he accorded that respect to anyone who was older tied with the 35yearold bubba watson after three rounds , spieth on sunday will be paired with watson in the final round you cannot really call someone named bubba anything other than bubba , can you \? spieth can it will be mr watson , he said saturday evening just because it will mess with him at 20 , spieth has already done things woods did not do at that age when woods came to the masters as a 20yearold , he did not make the cut , and still everyone was impressed with his game what are we to make of spieth , who outplayed the field on the back nine saturday with two birdies , a bogey and six pars \? all around him , others were faltering spieth , who is staying in augusta with his parents , knows he will be nervous sunday that s what i want to be , he said i was nervous today it s what i wanted to feel to get me ready for tomorrow spieth , child of the 1990s , said he had not played a video game in years this week , he has turned off his phone he has not watched sports on television during saturday s round , he did not look at the leader boards on the golf course until the final couple of holes they were irrelevant he is playing to a different beat , and it is not one borne in the tiger era jordan spieth is an example of the most modern athlete he is focused on the process he has a plan i'm going to take a lot of confidence out of today because the plan was to get into contention , he said as the sun went down in augusta and it was n't about getting in contention for the result i wanted to do it to see how i can perform on a sunday and so that s still yet to come spieth was composed and relaxed as he explained himself , elucidating his goals and thoughts as if he were talking to a bunch of dorm buddies in a college lounge instead of a roomful of international news media members tomorrow is about seeing how i can control my game and emotions out on the golf course against guys that have won here recently , spieth continued so they have been in the position , and i have n't it does n't necessarily mean , i do n't think , that they have an advantage in any way i think that i'm very confident in the way things are going the likelihood may be that he will not win history suggests he will stumble , maybe even fall apart but he is a 20yearold playing in his first masters , and he did not look scared in this year when the masters is being held without woods for the first time since 1994 , the best likelihood is that spieth or others born in the 1990s are coming to make their permanent mark on golf spieth is just the advance guard
tokyo moved closer to reviving part of its moribund nuclear power industry on friday , as a regional government agreed to restart two reactors at a plant that is among a dozen nationwide waiting to be switched back on following the fukushima disaster three and a half years ago the decision by the authorities in kagoshima prefecture , on the southern island of kyushu , cleared an important obstacle to restarting the reactors , which were by japan s new nuclear regulatory agency in september but have been awaiting the goahead from politicians japan s 48 operable commercial reactors have been caught in a seesawing debate over safety since the triple meltdown at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station in march 2011 , and none are currently producing power the two reactors in kagoshima , at the sendai nuclear power plant , would be the first to be brought back online under safety standards introduced last year a restart at sendai would smooth the way for others around the country electric utilities are seeking safety certifications for 20 reactors at 13 plants , less than half the number that were in operation before fukushima others are considered too old to upgrade , or are too close to the disaster zone , in the country s northeast , to be politically acceptable tens of thousands of fukushima residents remain unable to return home the nuclear debate has been notable for confusion over who , ultimately , must make the decision about whether to turn reactors back on delays have multiplied as a result after the regulatory agency certified the sendai reactors , many analysts said they could be back online in a month now the prognosis is for early next year in kagoshima , politicians have mostly been sympathetic to the industry , as have leaders in many other areas with nuclear plants these areas are often relatively poor and depend on the jobs and subsidies that come with them the national government , led by prime minister shinzo abe , is also openly pronuclear yet with the public still anxious about safety , leaders at all levels have sought to shift the final say elsewhere japanese law does not give any one elected body outright control over nuclear plants , which are operated by private companies this is an important decision and a big step toward restarting the power plant , said yoichi miyazawa , the industry ministe he had flown to kagoshima earlier this week to meet with prefectural leaders and press the case for allowing sendai s operations to resume kagoshima s governor , yuichiro ito , said he had no choice but to endorse resuming operations at the sendai plant , since the prefectural assembly had voted in favor of a restart resolution earlier friday the resolution had been submitted by private citizens groups , led by local businesses the assembly , for its part , was harshly critical of mr abe s government for what it called a lack of leadership on the issue the prime minister has not made a forceful case to the public for bringing plants back online , assembly members believe , instead deferring to local politicians , who lack the expertise and resources to verify the plants' safety on their own the national government s involvement in the restart process has been inadequate , and has left local authorities with a large and difficult burden , the assembly said in its resolution sendai s restart could still be delayed by court challenges dozens of lawsuits have been filed against power companies that want to turn plants back on , though most that have reached the decision stage have been rejected by judges in an exception in may , antinuclear groups won an injunction against a plant in western japan , though its owner is appealing the ruling suits have been filed by antinuclear activists as well as the local authorities in areas that are close to nuclear plants opposition in such neighboring areas is particularly strong they could be exposed to radiation or evacuation orders during a serious accident , yet they do not receive the subsidies and other economic benefits that go to towns that host nuclear plants
donetsk , ukraine the new ukrainian government struck the separatists in this eastern province with a major military offensive on monday , battling them over an important provincial airport in ground fighting that lasted for hours the rebels were left scattered and shaken , just one day after a successful national election they had tried to disrupt the airport battle was the first time the ukrainian military had moved so aggressively against the separatists , who took over government buildings in two eastern provinces in march , after weeks of lowgrade military maneuvers meant to stop their spread to other areas there was no immediate indication that the ukrainian military s operations extended any further than the strategically important airport and surrounding area experts said that while the military s attack might have put the separatists on the defensive , it was unlikely to stop their power as fighting lasted into a rainy evening , the military claimed to have evicted the separatists from the airport , and had cordoned off the area with roadblocks but the sporadic sounds of weapons fire could still be heard , and it was not clear that government soldiers were in full control the airport remained closed , and some local news outlets reported that it was burning i do n't see this ending anytime soon , said a political science professor who specializes in ukraine at tufts university in boston the ukrainian government is saying , this is where we draw the line its ability to retake the airport , she said , does n't dramatically change things even so , the routing of the rebels from the airport changed the optics of the situation here in favor of the ukrainian military , which had suffered setbacks for weeks , and had been seen by many ukrainians as ineffectual fighter jets screamed and automatic gunfire popped for hours in and around the airport , with ground battles against separatists spilling outside its tall black gate thick black smoke dotted the sky and helicopters flew just above the trees , shaking small houses and blowing the grasses in their garden plots the rebel seizure of the airport early monday suggested a new escalation by the militants who in recent days have appeared to lose the political support of the kremlin , at least publicly on friday , president vladimir v putin of russia suggested that he would respect the results of sunday s election , in which petro o poroshenko , a ukrainian billionaire who knows mr putin , was elected in a landslide many here say separatist leaders had grown confident after months of swaggering across the provinces with virtually no pushback from central authorities the fractious groups are not directly under mr putin s control , and the kremlin has denied that its military is involved in the conflict here but support can come in many forms , and it is far from clear that mr putin has any intention of giving up what appears to be a useful geopolitical lever violence and instability in ukraine s east that has left the west flustered what putin wants is for ukraine to be weak , said , a political scientist at the university of toronto who specializes in ukraine and has lived in donetsk just because he gives verbal support for the new ukrainian government does not mean that he will stop trying to foment unrest in the east by issuing statements of support , mr putin gets to look like a statesman , and blame whatever problems emerge on the new government , professor way said he has created a frankenstein that he cannot control , and may not even want to , he said many in ukraine had feared that mr putin sought the eastern regions themselves , and was putting troops in position to potentially seize them in the same way he did crimea , the southern peninsula on the black sea that russia , setting off a major international confrontation but a subtler maneuver is now emerging , and many experts believe that the most desirable result for mr putin would be for the troubled areas to devolve into breakaway status , similar to south ossetia within georgia and transnistria within moldova , a possibility that ordinary citizens are already talking about it s a mess , it s anarchy , said yevgeny kaplenko , a retired welder , who stood near his small brick house and yard planted with roses near the airport , as gunfire popped this is going to be a second transnistria that s what awaits us that outcome would be considered poisonous by many ukrainians , and would likely have far more serious repercussions for the world , given ukraine s enormous size , severe economic problems and geopolitically strategic location in the heart of europe putin does n't want to take these regions and foot the bill for all these old industries , professor shevel said he would rather there be instability , which makes ukraine less attractive to europe and makes it easier to extract concessions from the government the day s events started shortly after 3 am , when dozens of armed men from the donetsk people s republic showed up at the airport and demanded that all ukrainian military and security personnel leave , the airport s press service said the ukrainian military later issued an ultimatum for the men to leave and began to attack , shortly after 1 pm , when they defied the eviction order a military spokesman said the operation included fighter jets as well as several helicopters , which transported ukrainian soldiers prorussia militiamen took up positions behind trees close to the entrance , near a metro supermarket one of them , shot in the leg , was evacuated in a new audi , its license plate obscured with tape fighters fired a rocket toward the airport , then retreated , under sniper fire , to an area where a friendly resident agreed to drive some of them in his blue car the rebels seemed shaken by the forcefulness of the military response at the donetsk government headquarters , nervous separatists briefed journalists i am forced to appeal directly to vladimir vladimirovich putin for any possible aid , said denis pushilin , the speaker of the selfproclaimed donetsk people s republic when asked what kind of aid military or economic he said , any late monday night , a ukrainian military spokesman , alexei dmitrashkovsky , said by telephone that the army had established full control over the airport and that several of the militant leaders had requested safe passage , including one known by the nickname , abver , described as a russian passport holder that claim could not be corroborated after midnight , kalinin hospital s deputy head doctor , andrey sokoleyvich , said the facility had received five people with shrapnel and bullet wounds late monday evening , a social media account run by the rebels issued a call for doctors to come urgently to several city hospitals at the city s main trauma hospital , a woman wearing a flak jacket with a medical cross and carrying a holstered pistol said curtly that the wounded , who she claimed numbered fewer than 10 , had been taken to other hospitals earlier , as evening fell , a crowd of rebel sympathizers gathered outside the occupied government headquarters and some demanded that weapons be given to ordinary citizens , reflecting a growing siege mentality yaroslav krakov , 33 , said that every time he went to the rebels to demand a gun he was told none were left we have no one else , he said russia does not need us , that much is obvious we are nothing to kiev anymore we only have pushilin and ourselves
london facebook said on friday that it had blocked users in pakistan from access to the pages of a popular pakistani rock band and several leftwing political pages , drawing sharp criticism from freespeech activists who accused the american company of caving in to government censors members of the band , laal , whose members have frequently spoken out against the taliban , confirmed that their facebook page , which had over 400 , 000 likes , had been blocked following an outcry on social media and inquiries by reporters to the pakistani government and to facebook , the government reversed itself and facebook restored access to laal s page but advocates said late on friday that at least six other facebook pages that promoted progressive debate in pakistan and that had been blocked during the week remained inaccessible facebook claims to be in favor of free speech , and talks about protecting political expression , but they are not , said shahzad ahmad of the group bytes for all pakistan , which campaigns for internet freedom and has gone to court several times seeking to lift government restrictions in pakistan for the sake of their own profits and business , they are caving in to anything the government demands a spokeswoman for facebook in london said the company s policy was to adhere to local laws , and that it blocked the pages after receiving an official request from the pakistan telecommunications authority , which regulates internet content in pakistan while we never remove this type of content from the site entirely , like most internet services , we may restrict people from accessing it in the countries where it is determined to be illegal , the spokeswoman said , adding that questions about why specific pages were blocked were best addressed to the authorities who issue these orders the spokeswoman declined to be named , citing company policy facebook was banned entirely in pakistan for several months in 2010 , during a controversy over a page that encouraged people to draw cartoons of the prophet muhammad the company says it regularly weeds out pages that promote hate or extremism according to a report published on its website , facebook restricted access to 162 pieces of content in pakistan between july and december 2013 , and many more in some other countries , including india , where it restricted access to more than 4 , 700 pages in the same period but activists said on friday that the latest blocks in pakistan affected pages that spoke out against extremism , while several extremist pages in the country were left untouched this is ridiculous , said taimur rahman , the lead singer of laal , speaking before the ban on his group s page was lifted none of our content could be construed as antistate or antireligious , in any shape or form the facebook actions come at a time when freedom of speech is under increasing pressure in pakistan extremists have been bringing criminal accusations of blasphemy against journalists , and the army has been cracking down on criticism of itself in the media the government media regulator of the country s most popular news channel , geo news , on friday and fined it 104 , 000 , on accusations that geo news had defamed the military s interservices intelligence spy agency ale natiq , 31 , the administrator of the urdulanguage page roshni pakistan , speculated that the military was behind the blocking of the page this week we 're not antistate or antireligion , mr natiq said but we 've been very vocal on the baluchistan issue , which is sensitive to the military , so that might have done it several activists questioned why facebook had not blocked other pakistani pages that incite sectarian violence , religious extremism or hatred against minorities as examples , they pointed to pages , a notorious sectarian group that has supported attacks on shiites the sectarian militant group and , where a violent standoff between extremists and government forces in 2007 left over 100 people dead , and where a recently opened library is named for osama bin laden these protaliban pages are spewing hatred , and we are the people they shut down , said mr rahman , the singer it s insanity facebook officials say that they resist censorship as much as possible , but their leverage is limited in countries like pakistan where the government with little public debate
washington shortly after announced the resignation of defense secretary at the white house on monday , he walked over to a meeting of his entire national security council staff , where he told the embattled group that they were critical to an ambitious foreign policy agenda the timing was a coincidence , but it seemed an unmistakable sign that mr hagel s departure does not portend a broader internal shakeup if anything , it may represent the final triumph of a white housecentric approach to national security mr obama does not appear likely to replace his national security adviser , , who skirmished with mr hagel over syria policy and others nor is he mulling a change in his chief of staff , , who has exerted heavy influence over foreign policy , at times acting almost as a shadow national security adviser with his core team intact , and with none of the candidates to succeed mr hagel likely to show the independence of mr obama s first defense secretary , robert m gates , the white house seems likely to keep a tight leash on foreign policy for the remainder of mr obama s presidency the multiple challenges facing mr obama s national security team were emphasized not just by mr hagel s departure but also by the failure of american negotiators in vienna to strike a nuclear deal with iran while experts said the sevenmonth extension agreed to for the talks was an acceptable fallback that will preserve the chance for eventual success , it suggested how hard it would be to secure a deal that mr obama and his aides have long hoped would be a legacy achievement the iran talks , however , have strengthened the standing of another crucial member of mr obama s war council , secretary of state mr kerry will play a central role in trying to negotiate an iran deal , officials said in recent weeks , as rumors of a staff shakeup circulated , white house officials emphasized the president s confidence in mr kerry , even as they were more guarded about mr hagel still , even in diplomacy , the white house will continue to keep close tabs mr obama , officials say , is relying heavily on mr mcdonough , ms rice and other longtime aides like benjamin j rhodes , the deputy national security adviser the white house was in constant contact with mr kerry in recent days , officials said , as he and other foreign ministers worked out the sevenmonth extension with iran the president recently nominated one of his top aides , antony j blinken , as deputy secretary of state , passing over mr kerry s preferred candidate , wendy r sherman mr kerry had argued that ms sherman , the department s no 3 official and the lead , daytoday negotiator on the iran talks , deserved the promotion but mr obama went with mr blinken , who serves as ms rice s principal deputy on the national security council some critics say a genuine shakeup would have included ms rice , whose sharp manner has alienated members of the council staff and complicated the internal policy process but mr obama , aides say , is intensely loyal to her and sensitive to the fact that she was tripped up by the benghazi episode , when her statements on sunday talk shows , based on erroneous information , helped cost her a shot at being secretary of state while congressional aides have questioned mr mcdonough s personal involvement in negotiating over redactions in a senate report on the cia s detention and interrogation policies after the sept 11 terrorist attacks , there is no evidence it troubles mr obama not only does the hagel ouster not address the internal problems in the white house , but it s also essentially a denial that the problem goes deeper , said david rothkopf , an expert on the national security council who just published a book , national insecurity fissures between mr hagel and the white house first became apparent in late october when he wrote a memo to ms rice sharply criticizing the administration s policy in syria the policy , he said , failed to link the tactical campaign against the islamic state to the broader strategic question of what do about president bashar alassad as a result , mr hagel wrote , the united states was struggling to sign up allies like turkey and even france for the campaign he also predicted a difficult situation when syrian rebels trained and equipped by the united states came under fire from mr assad s forces administration officials insist that mr hagel did not advocate this position in internal debates , and indeed , was more reticent on american engagement in syria than other officials , including mr kerry and the united nations ambassador , samantha power mr hagel s problems , these officials said , were not rooted in white house micromanagement but in his own discomfort with the nature of the job the memo on syria policy , some note , surfaced around the time that mr hagel began discussing his future with the president mr obama , who had appeared on his heels for months in foreign policy , got a lift from his recent weeklong trip to asia , where he made deals on and trade with china he also delivered a warning to myanmar to stay on the reform track , and extolled the american economic recovery at the group of 20 meeting in australia white house officials credit mr kerry with conceiving the climate change agreement after a trip to beijing in february he pushed the idea when he hosted china s senior foreignpolicy official , yang jiechi , during a visit to his hometown , boston the president might at times be overwhelmed by kerry s enthusiasm , said martin s indyk , director of the foreign policy program at brookings , who worked with mr kerry to try to broker an israelipalestinian peace deal , but his unflagging energy , his passionate conviction , and his unusual willingness to take risks stand in contrast to hagel s more laid back approach and make him a valued member of the team but mr obama s remarks to the close to 400 staff members of the security council underscore that they will remain at the heart of his efforts to manage the world s crises and recapture momentum in foreign policy , in what white house officials refer to as the fourth quarter of his presidency the president s message was that there s a very full inbox , but that we have the ability to chart our own course , and make our own agenda , even with all this incoming , said a senior official , who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the meeting
will ferrell s wife is swedish aubrey plaza once dated a swedish exchange student patrick duffy is a big star in sweden because of dallas illeana douglas appears in easy to assemble , a web series for ikea , the swedish homefurnishings company gene simmons likes swedish women but none of that would have mattered much if amy poehler hadn t had a brother who lived in sweden ms poehler s fun and famous friends are sprinkled like so much stardust throughout welcome to sweden , the new nbc sitcom starting thursday night that was inspired by the decision of her younger sibling , greg , to abandon a legal career in new york and move to scandinavia for love in the television version , he plays bruce evans , a celebrity money manager whose clients are so aggrieved by his move that they track him down a framework that allowed the poehlers to summon their swedishconnected nearest and dearest for cameos now that the series has been renewed for a second season in its namesake country , where it s already hit , we re kind of like trying to coerce all the famous swedes , said ms poehler , one of the show s executive producers and occasional stars we re hoping that eventually the skarsgards will let down their skarsgard and come join us in a recent phone interview from long island , where she was filming a movie with tina \( fey , for those living in an alternate universe \) , ms poehler spoke about funny genes , cultural quirks and how she is not that woman on the screen these are excerpts from their conversation so it seems that you re not the only funny poehler yeah , greg has always been really funny in our family you had to earn your place at the dinner table and be witty and able to take some goodnatured teasing and i knew that he always wanted to be a creative person his life s path took him to different places but i m excited he gets to do that now because he s really happy but he s not only writing , he s acting surely that must have been a surprise well , they had this thing in high school called moot court , where they would debate fake cases and greg was really into getting in front of everybody and performing i remember being very impressed he was very quick and smartbrained and had a real facility with language and with numbers but i also knew that he had that other side what made you think his story would appeal to viewers in both sweden and the united states \? the heart of the show is a love story my brother and his real wife , charlotta , met in new york , and my brother moved to sweden out of love so the premise reflects his reallife experience it s kind of a combination of a fishoutofwater story and very specific stuff you d find in sweden and the idea of picking up your whole life for somebody else do the show s zanier swedes have a basis in reality \? the interesting , eccentric swedish people who make up the show are not really based , i think my brother would say , on his inlaws but there is a specific culture shock that happens americans know maybe three big , general broad strokes about sweden , but not so much the interesting intelligence and dark side and light side we were both excited to have fun with it comedically what did you know about sweden before making the show \? my thenhusband , will arnett , and i were toastmasters at greg s wedding , which is kind of an important job you have to run the evening and give speeches , and it was a fun , quick cultural lesson in how swedes express themselves we certainly didn t want the show to be , look at how crazy swedish people are and a lot of the comedy comes from greg s inability to synthesize , his inflexibility and stuff but there are things that are so specific to sweden , that are so strange for the person who s never seen them before , that i felt it was really ripe for comedy how does his wife feel about their private life being turned into comedic fodder \? laughs well , you ll have to ask her but she s amazing charlotta is awesome i mean , swedish women are just badass sweden continues to be voted over and over again one of the best countries in the world to live in if you re a woman you have relatively equal pay , you have a year paid maternity leave , you have free health care , you have free day care , there s so much opportunity so swedish women are very , very intelligent , empowered , together and there s not so much emphasis on marriage swedes have a word for when you re with somebody and have kids but aren t married we don t even have that word as americans but swedes are like , oh absolutely , it makes perfect sense that we would have that word nobody really sweats it you re used to being the big sister but are you really as nasty to your little brother as your character is to bruce in the show \? my character is not based on me she s an awful celebrity person who s not very supportive i would like to think that s not the case the show is divided between english and swedish and is heavy on the subtitles are you worried that perhaps americans may find the required reading a little too challenging \? no , i think people are more and more used to that now but it s also a great comedic device in that the swedes get to talk about greg in front of him , and we get to play around with what people understand and what they don t understand the subtitles are a small price to pay for all the fun you get out of all that
the internet has grown up it is no longer just about providing information but about fundamental changes in the way we go about our daily lives enormous amounts of commerce that have long been subject to regulation and policing in the brickandmortar world are now moving online this means big changes in the marketplace , even though many of the fundamental goods and services remain the same regulators are left struggling to keep up and the companies involved want to keep it that way amazingly , many of these companies claim that the fact that their goods and services are provided online somehow makes them immune from regulation this is n't smart , or sustainable just because a company has an app instead of a storefront does n't mean consumer protection laws do n't apply the cold shoulder that regulators like me get from selfproclaimed cyberlibertarians deprives us of powerful partners in protecting the public interest online while this may shield companies in the short run , authorities will ultimately be forced to use the blunt tools of traditional law enforcement cooperation is a better path take airbnb , a san franciscobased company now valued at close to 10 billion that enables users in 192 countries to turn their homes into hotel rooms in 2010 , the state of new york passed a law confirming that shortstay rentals were generally illegal in apartment buildings , and for good reason the longstanding distinction between hotels and apartment buildings protects the rights of building residents who did n't choose to live 10 feet away from a parade of strangers the law also protects tourists who are usually unfamiliar with the rooms and buildings where they are sleeping by imposing stiffer fire safety and building codes on hotels airbnb hosts rent out apartments every day in violation of this law some of these are large , commercial enterprises with dozens of apartments truly illegal hotels the most straightforward solution would be for airbnb to simply prevent illegal transactions but when my office reached out to airbnb , the company rejected the idea of selfpolicing out of hand and refused to provide data that would give us a handle on the scope of the problem with my hope of working in partnership with airbnb dashed , we were forced to subpoena the company for information , a step that airbnb has attempted to quash in court on monday , just 24 hours before a key court date , airbnb announced it had removed some 2 , 000 new yorkbased listings from the site , suggesting that our concerns are not misplaced but none of this promotes confidence in the site by users , their neighbors or the regulators whose job it is to protect the public another example is uber , a company valued at more than 3 billion that has revolutionized the oldfashioned act of standing in the street to hail a cab uber has been an agent for change in an industry that has long been controlled by small groups of taxi owners the regulations and bureaucracies that protect these entrenched incumbents do not , by and large , serve the public interest but uber may also have run afoul of new york state laws against price gouging , which do serve the public interest in the last year , in bad weather , uber charged new yorkers as much as eight times the company s base price we are investigating whether this is prohibited by the same laws under which i 've sued gas stations that gouged motorists during uber makes some persuasive arguments for its pricing model , but the ability to pay truly exorbitant prices should n't determine someone s ability to get critical goods and services when they 're in short supply in an emergency i'm hopeful that the company will collaborate with us to address the problem thoughtfully this kind of cooperation can work last year my office discovered that the consumer review website yelp was being flooded by companies hired to fraudulently inflate rankings for clients and hurt those clients' competitors rather than taking a kneejerk antiregulatory stand , yelp , a publicly traded company , decided to cooperate with law enforcement on a yearlong undercover investigation that resulted in against 19 of these companies this furthered the public interest , but also burnished yelp s reputation for reliability cyberlibertarians argue that regulators often lack the tools or knowhow to provide smart enforcement they are not entirely wrong but that does n't mean that regulation is unnecessary nor does it excuse those same critics for refusing to work with the government agencies that must develop those tools regulators should not be deterred and , as a practical matter , they ca n't and wo n't be we are now living in an online world , one that offers great promise but is also becoming one of the primary crime scenes of the 21st century major service providers cannot be allowed to treat it as a digital wild west the only question is how long it will take for these cybercowboys to realize that working with the sheriffs is both good business and the right thing to do
one early morning in late april , the trainer alan sherman rested his arms on the rail as he watched one of his horses gallop at los alamitos race course in california the call to the post played , but the sound did not come from a bugle it came from sherman s cellphone sherman s phone rings a lot lately with each victory by california chrome he has won six in a row , including the and the come more calls , more requests for interviews , more inquiries about his superstar horse before chrome began this run , sherman s father , art , was the face of their operation art sherman was an exercise rider for swaps , the winner of the 1955 derby , but he never trained a horse that reached the sport s biggest stage now it is alan sherman , his father s assistant trainer , who stayed with california chrome as he traveled from kentucky to maryland and , finally , to new york , where on june 7 , he will try to become the 12th winner and the first since affirmed in 1978 he is the most underrated person in the barn , willie delgado , chrome s exercise rider , said of sherman he s actually the one who is handson , doing most of the work i hope it s no time soon in terms of his dad retiring , but when he does decide to retire , i'm pretty sure that alan will do excellent he knows what he s doing sherman hardly ever leaves california chrome s side he leads him to and from the racetrack , whether he is working out in the morning or running in a big race after the preakness , sherman was so overwhelmed that he planted a big kiss on california chrome s nose he acknowledged that the horse had moved him to tears too many times to count i'm not trying to get my face in front of the camera or anything like that , sherman , 45 , said i just get so excited and i just love that horse it s been so much fun he has made a few sacrifices , including clean clothes , to remain with chrome sherman visited a dry cleaner twice in baltimore and headed to one as soon as he arrived in new york his lucky suit was full of mud after the preakness , but he did not want his father to bring him another sherman s daughter , brianne , is eight months pregnant , adding to his stress level but sherman said he would stay with chrome even if his grandchild arrived early she s been around racing her whole life , sherman said of his daughter , and she knows what this means to us , and she would n't want me to miss it art sherman , 77 , was a jockey for 21 years before he became a trainer his son lasted three years as a rider i spent weekends at the barn growing up , said alan sherman , who also fishes and hunts i just loved horses i thought my whole life , i would be a jockey forever but i ate my way out of that job his father added jokingly , he did n't miss too many breakfasts , that s for sure but sherman made the most out of his riding career while it lasted he rode at california s top racetracks , working for successful trainers like charlie whittingham and his father in 969 races from 1986 to 1989 , he compiled 80 wins , 79 seconds and 81 thirds , earning 1 , 109 , 691 everybody i worked for , i always watched how they trained their horses , said sherman , who knew that he wanted to follow his father into training someday he became his father s assistant in 1991 , and as the years have passed , sherman has taken on a bigger role from wednesday to sunday , art bunks with alan in a fivebedroom house near los alamitos on sunday , art drives home to spend time with his wife , faye , at their new house in a 55andolder community in rancho bernardo , calif the elder sherman s older son , steve , 50 , has his own training operation in northern california he was not a jockey in fact , he wanted to work in law enforcement but after high school graduation , he went to work for his father to save money and never left the family business i had preferred they go to college and did something else , but they did n't , said faye , who worked at the bay meadows racetrack s gift shop for 30 years so i just accepted it and went on , you know at the racetrack , art taught his sons the most important thing about training keep the horses happy feed them well , take care of them well , and in turn , they 'll usually run well for you , steve said he got me looking at their legs , put them on a good feed program and make sure that they 're taken care of art also taught them the importance of conformation \( physical structure \) and developing an eye for a good horse he said being a jockey was invaluable the word is that exjocks do n't make good trainers , art said i do n't know how they can really say that i go to sales and look at conformation different than a lot of people i think of how i would like the horse to travel i like a horse that drops his head i like a horse that runs with its head down because all the runners i was ever on had that habit of running like that i look for hind quarters , a good shoulder , a good , strong walk i just look at horses that i would have liked to have ridden if i had the chance in the shermans' racing office at los alamitos , family photographs line the walls father and sons in the paddock and in the winner s circle , as jockeys and trainers after california chrome romped in the derby , art remembered to give credit where it was due he called alan his backbone and thanked both sons it s a family affair , he said they got my back they do a lot of the hard work for me now they look to see that everything is done perfect they 're both great horsemen , and i give them a lot of credit i feel really proud of them hours after the preakness , alan was still at the barn , smiling broadly with a beer in hand as he cleaned up after the commotion he was proud of the horse , proud of his team and especially proud of his father normally , alan said , his father is a bit more guarded with his emotions but not lately he s not one to come up and give you a big hug and a kiss and say , oh you 're doing a wonderful job' and this and that , alan said of his father but i know he appreciates it my mom s having the time of her life , too she ca n't hold back the tears actually , none of us can
clayton , mo the forensic pathologist hired by the family of michael brown testified before a st louis county grand jury on thursday , an indication that the proceedings might be nearing their final stages , the family s lawyers said the lawyers said they believed that grand jurors had asked to hear from the pathologist , dr michael m baden , during a process that the family and its supporters have criticized as lacking the transparency needed to engender confidence in the system mr brown , 18 , who was black , was shot and killed three months ago by darren wilson , a white police officer , in nearby ferguson mr brown was unarmed , and some witnesses said he had his arms up in surrender at the time the shooting incited days of sometimes violent protest the grand jury is expected to decide soon whether to indict officer wilson the brown family lawyers , benjamin crump and anthony d gray , would not go into the details of dr baden s testimony but they did disclose that the pathologist had reclassified a wound to mr brown s chest as an entry wound the significance of that change was unclear , and the lawyers declined to elaborate speaking to reporters in front of the county justice center here , mr gray said that regardless of whether the grand jury decides to indict mr wilson , the brown family wanted to reiterate gov jay nixon s denouncement of violence , looting and rioting in the name of michael brown we want to encourage all of those that support the justice for mike brown to remain vigilant , yet peaceful , calm and dignified as we await and after we receive the announcement of the grand jury decision , mr gray added but the lawyers went farther than the governor , also admonishing law enforcement officers to allow protesters to exercise their rights history is clear , mr gray said prior to many uncivilized reactions by demonstrators , they were simply exercising their first amendment right , during which time they became victims of assault rifles being pointed in their face , being manhandled , being tear gassed , hit by rubber bullets , falsely arrested law enforcement should have been equally condemned by the governor for this conduct at the same time he was admonishing the demonstrators in a news conference this week , governor nixon said he would mobilize all the law enforcement officers necessary to keep the peace , including the national guard it remains unclear when the grand jury will reach its decision the jurors have been hearing evidence for months robert p mcculloch , the st louis county prosecutor , has said he expected a decision by mid to late november meanwhile , many people in the st louis area have been on edge , fearing that the grand jury decision could reignite violence mr mcculloch has said that prosecutors were presenting all of the evidence to the grand jury when dr baden released his initial autopsy in august , he said that mr brown had been shot at least six times , with none of the shots appearing to be from very close range news reports of the autopsy performed by the st louis county medical examiner said that mr brown had a wound on his thumb that could have come during an encounter with officer wilson at his car regardless of what evidence is placed before the grand jury , mr gray said , the fact that it was being done behind closed doors was problematic what we 're missing would be how that information was presented , he said what emphasis was placed on what piece of evidence
phoenix steven norton , recovering from a severe stroke , says he is renewing the health plan he got this year through the affordable care act exchange he will pay more in 2015 501 a month including his federal subsidy , up from 485 but for him , continuity matters more than price , so he has not logged on to healthcaregov to search for alternatives if it s working , why try to fix it \? said mr norton , 51 nancy allman , a retiree outside tucson , sees things differently ms allman , 64 , said she was surprised to learn her exchange plan would cost 235 a month next year after her subsidy , up from 158 overwhelmed by her choices on healthcaregov , she called the customer service line and received help finding a plan from a different insurer that will cost only 77 a month the plan has a smaller network of providers , but it includes her primary care doctor , and she is in good health it was like a nobrainer to switch , she said across the nation , millions of people who bought insurance through the exchange in this inaugural year of coverage under the must decide by monday whether to switch plans for 2015 if they want a new plan starting jan 1 if they do nothing , most of the 67 million people who remained enrolled as of last month will automatically be reenrolled in their current plans or similar ones more often than not , the premiums for those in the most popular plans will increase , according to a new york times analysis of data from the mckinsey center for us health system reform the obama administration is urging them to shop around , and with good reason many can find a better deal or at least keep their costs steady that is especially true in states like arizona , where the competition is robust , new insurers have entered the marketplace , and the price for the cheapest plans in many areas has dropped at the same time , the availability of less expensive benchmark plans means that the federal subsidies that help many lowerincome arizonans pay their premiums will go down , because subsidies are pegged to those plans that means customers who stay in more expensive plans will have to pay a larger share of the price another potential problem is that subsidy recipients will receive the same amount in 2015 as they did in 2014 unless they ask for a recalculation that means some people could be required to pay back part of their subsidy at tax time despite those issues , the data so far suggests that many healthcaregov customers are keeping what they have and not even windowshopping as of dec 5 , only about 720 , 000 customers had returned to the federal exchange serving 37 states to reenroll or switch plans , according to the department of health and human services here in arizona , insurance agents and enrollment counselors last week reported a steady stream of customers seeking advice but the demand has not yet been huge , they said , indicating that many enrollees may be succumbing to inertia , are willing to pay more to their keep their networks and level of coverage , or are unaware that they have a choice about 120 , 000 residents of arizona signed up for exchange plans this year , according to federal data i'm concerned about the confused , said kathleen oestreich , the chief executive of meritus , a new insurer , which , after dropping its rates by 23 percent on average , is offering many of the lowerpriced plans here for 2015 that natural inclination to simply not change because it s too much effort how will it affect the population of lowincome people in particular \? shanna goldenberg of phoenix , who works two jobs and pays 160 a month for her exchange plan , said she had no idea if her premium was going up but ms goldenberg , 27 , said she would probably let her plan be automatically renewed , because the enrollment process last year was so confusing i'm the kind of girl who just sticks with what s easy , she said in an email but in a later note , ms goldenberg said she had discovered her plan would not be offered next year , adding i guess now i have to shop around again if only i can figure it out this time mr norton , of scottsdale , ariz , did call healthcaregov on thursday for a recalculation of his subsidy it will drop by 30 , he learned , and his portion of the premium will grow to 385 from 338 ms oestreich said those who were researching their options seemed fairly savvy about insurance that is a big change from last year , she said , when many healthcaregov customers seemed baffled by the enrollment process and the policies they were buying they are calling with specific questions and looking for specific products , she said in many cases , they 're buying up a little bit going to a little bit bigger network because they 've understood the value of that in other states , too , enrollment groups said that people shopping around were asking smart questions brenda cardenas , an enrollment counselor in phoenix who helped dozens of families sign up for coverage last year , said that only about 15 had sought her help with the renewal process as of last week most people are picking new plans , often ones with smaller networks of doctors and hospitals , to avoid paying more , she said for many , the switch will require finding new doctors , but ms cardenas said nobody had complained so far for a lot of our consumers , this is the first year they 've had health coverage , she said for them , switching to a new provider is n't a big deal yet in one case , ms cardenas said , a couple learned the amount of their subsidy would drop by 66 because of the availability of new lowercost plans that influence the calculation they decided to switch from a plan with a large network of providers and no deductible to a meritus plan with a smaller network and a 1 , 000 deductible by doing so , she said , they will spend almost 200 less a month health net signed up 65 percent of exchange enrollees here this year , but its rates are rising by an average of 12 percent , a company spokeswoman said altogether , 11 insurers are selling on the exchange here for 2015 , up from eight leslie mcgee , an acupuncturist in tucson , also found a better deal when she went to healthcaregov and updated her personal information her income has dropped , so she will qualify for a subsidy in 2015 after receiving none this year the premium on her current plan is increasing by 17 percent , so she is switching to a different insurer and will save 100 a month ms mcgee , 60 , will have higher outofpocket costs if she goes to the doctor , but she is that she will need only preventive care , which is free michelle steinberg , 54 , of phoenix , is avoiding a 23 percent increase by switching to a less expensive plan that will not cover as much of her medical costs her premiums will still increase 13 percent , to 450 a month , but she said she was satisfied with her new choice , which has a lower deductible i'm not averse to switching companies , said ms steinberg , who is moving from health net to united healthcare the big question is whether people who have not yet shopped around will flock to the online exchanges by monday in a lastminute crush and whether those who do not will later regret it they can switch until feb 15 , when open enrollment ends , but their new coverage will not begin until february or march if they wait past monday in maitland , fla , rebecca pando , 60 , said that she was happy to do the painstaking research to find a new plan her insurer , florida blue , is replacing her plan with one that has a substantially higher deductible 5 , 000 compared with 1 , 300 ms pando found a new plan from united healthcare that will cost 400 a month in premiums , about 50 less than what she paid this year including her subsidy it has a 4 , 000 deductible , she said , but a better choice of doctors it s pretty timeconsuming and you get a little crazy , ms pando said of the shopandcompare process but it certainly is better than not being able to buy insurance
a cloud was cast over the great tradition of kenyan distance running friday when rita jeptoo , winner of the boston and chicago marathons the past two years , tested positive for a banned substance , international officials said jeptoo , 33 , who has won boston three times and chicago twice , is by far the most prominent kenyan runner to have failed a doping test she had a positive test on an a sample for an unnamed banned substance , according to the world marathon majors , which represents the world s six most prominent marathons but under antidoping rules , a second sample of the same test must come back positive for her to be found guilty of a doping violation by the international association of athletics federations , track and field s international governing body jeptoo is the second highprofile female marathon runner to be entangled in a doping scandal this year in april , liliya shobukhova of russia , who has the secondfastest women s marathon time , received a twoyear ban after abnormalities were found in her biological markers that are used to detect evidence of doping along with neighboring ethiopia , kenya has developed the world s richest tradition in distance running in recent years , though , the sport has grown more complicated there , characterized by wondrous achievement and undermined by evidence of doping as money and interest have bloomed and technology has grown more sophisticated in september , dennis kimetto of kenya ran 2 hours 2 minutes 57 seconds at the berlin marathon , making him the first person to run 262 miles faster than 2 03 and his victory spurred further debate about  but then an antidoping task force last month criticized kenya s track and field federation for what it said were lax efforts to catch athletes using banned substances more than 30 athletes have tested positive for banned substances in recent years , a report by the task force said pharmacies , clinics and athletes' representatives have assisted in the procurement of prohibited drugs , it said the bloodboosting drug epo , which enhances oxygencarrying capacity , was one substance mentioned in the report officials with the world antidoping agency , who expressed frustration with efforts in kenya , about the country s efforts to combat the use of prohibited substances on sunday , after the , jeptoo was to receive a check for 500 , 000 for winning the world marathon majors , a prize for the top male and female runners for performances at races in tokyo , boston , london , berlin , chicago and new york in a twoyear cycle that  the stakes are so high , said george hirsch , chairman of the board of new york road runners , which organizes the city s marathon , speaking in general about the temptation to use banned substances in a country such as kenya it s far more money than almost anybody in that country could earn in a lifetime any formal sanctions against jeptoo would be levied by the iaaf , which has not yet announced a doping violation or any potential ban the world marathon majors has joined the iaaf in helping to provide more outofcompetition testing , considered the only reliable way to catch those using banned substances nick bitel , general counsel of the marathon group , said friday , cheats need to understand that they are not welcome in our sport and that they will be caught although jeptoo was not competing in sunday s race , the news of her positive test was a distraction for the final major marathon of the year many elite runners heard about jeptoo s positive doping test on their way to , or at , a scheduled news conference friday morning instead of talking about his attempt to become the first man to win three new york city marathons in a row since alberto salazar in 1982 , geoffrey mutai , another kenyan standout , was confronted with questions about how often he had been drugtested and whether he thought he was running on a level playing field for years , it has been said that many kenyan distance runners refuse to take even an aspirin for a headache and some international experts cautioned against painting all kenyans with a brush of skepticism i do n't know that you can extrapolate or make any general findings or conclusions until we know the circumstances , bitel said yet the number of positive tests in kenya has risen sharply in recent years , which could reflect increased testing as much as growing drug use jeptoo is the third runner to test positive among one of kenya s most successful training groups , which has federico rosa as its manager and claudio beradelli as its coach rosa and beradelli , who are from italy , denied any involvement in doping the rosa group , founded by federico rosa s father , gabriele , a highly respected marathon coach , has produced such top stars as paul tergat , a former worldrecord holder in the marathon , and sammy wanjiru , the 2008 olympic champion but the training group and by extension , kenyan distance running has come under increased examination mathew kisorio , a former member of the group , received a twoyear ban in 2012 and later told the german television network ard that doping was not rare in kenya i went with it because everyone told me i was n't the only one and none of the others got caught for doping , he said i know that a lot of medical substances are used , which are injected

kabul , afghanistan four men with pistols opened fire inside the luxurious serena hotel complex in central kabul on thursday night , killing nine people before being gunned down and sowing panic in an exclusive enclave frequented by foreign officials , prominent afghans and an array of development workers , officials and witnesses said the afghan interior ministry said the attackers entered the hotel saying they were going to eat in one of the complex s restaurants officials said the attackers managed to smuggle pistols past security checkpoints and then hid in a bathroom , eventually springing out and opening fire on hotel guests and guards although the ministry initially said that two people were wounded , early on friday the authorities said that nine people had been killed four of the dead were foreigners and the other five afghans among the afghans were two children and two women , the authorities added a spokesman for the taliban , zabiullah mujahid , said the insurgents were responsible but the twitter feed for the national directorate of security , the afghan intelligence service , reported that the battle had been sparked by a conflict between armed guests , and the police forces appeared to be staying noncommittal witnesses inside the serena said that a festive evening of afghan new year celebrations was interrupted around 9 pm , when they began hearing gunshots around the complex s packed restaurants frightened guests holed up in their rooms , or found shelter in safety bunkers around the complex the police quickly put up a heavy cordon around the hotel , which is in central kabul and within a mile of the presidential palace the serena has long been a popular destination for wealthy or prominent visitors to kabul hotel rooms can cost upward of 300 a night , with prices soaring during times of high demand ahead of the presidential elections on april 5 , rooms at the serena were fully booked through the coming weeks even before , concerns about security in kabul had prompted the united nations to move some of its staff behind the hotel s high walls , which are guarded around the clock by dozens of security guards armed with assault weapons the hotel has also been subjected to repeated attacks by the taliban , who more recently have threatened a heavy surge of assaults to disrupt the elections with its expatriate clientele and general ambience of luxury , including a heated swimming pool and fullservice spa , the hotel offers an obviously attractive target for militants , and recent security reports rated the serena among the highestrisk locales in the city early on thursday , the taliban claimed another major attack after a series of coordinated strikes in the city of jalalabad left at least 10 police officers dead , including the district police chief the assault , which also left 14 police officers wounded , began around 5 am when a car loaded with explosives sped through the gate to the police compound six bombers stormed the facility after the initial blast , waging a threehour gun battle within the compound , according to fazal ahmad sherzad , the police chief of nangarhar province , of which jalalabad , one of the country s largest and most economically vibrant cities , is the capital attack helicopters from the americanled international coalition could be seen circling the area after the assault government officials said that two of the attackers were killed before they could detonate their explosives , but that the others managed to do so within the police compound , which is near the provincial governor s palace as well as other government offices and a united nations facility such attacks on our security forces will not weaken our morale , said attullah lodin , the governor of nangarhar i assure you that we continue to fight the enemies we will do our utmost efforts to prevent such attacks from happening in the future a facility operated by the staterun radio television afghanistan was also attacked , but initial reports indicated that because of the early hour only one civilian was killed another deadly assault this week , in faryab province , killed 18 civilians , underscoring the taliban s threats to disrupt the country officials there said the bombing had been meant to discourage public participation in the election also on thursday , the afghan government continued a string of prisoner releases that have strained relations with the natoled military coalition officials said they released 55 more detainees because there was not enough evidence to hold them the coalition , though , had identified the men as being among a larger number of dangerous detainees with insurgent ties in a statement circulated shortly after the government s announcement , the coalition characterized the release as something that could jeopardize the gains made over the last decade in stability and opportunity for the afghan people last month , held in the former american prison at bagram even repeated threats that such releases would endanger american aid to afghanistan have had little effect on president hamid karzai s insistence on full afghan sovereignty over detainees , or on his promise to slowly dismantle the former bagram prison , which he has referred to as a talibanmaking factory of the 55 detainees set free on thursday , 39 had been brought to bagram by british forces in helmand province , one of the most intensely contested regions of the war though there was tension evident in the international coalition statement on the releases , the british response was notably less fraught although we do n't agree with the decision to release them , ultimately these decisions are for the afghans to make , said maj tim james , a media officer at the british embassy in kabul the differing responses may be at least in part because the british have said that none of those released men have , to their knowledge , been responsible for british deaths the americans , who want the prisoners to be tried in afghan courts , said that a number of those released have coalition and afghan blood on their hands
two weeks after one of the most memorable drafts , there is continued debate about the requirement that players have at least one year of posthighschool experience before entering the league as a former nba player , coach and general manager , i think it is clear that two years of prenba experience would be better for the players and better for our game the players would be more mature , better equipped to contribute on the court and adapt to life off it the drafts would be better , with teams having additional opportunities to evaluate talent and make more informed decisions about important picks the college game would be healthier , with some of the world s most gifted young players spending another year on campus and giving their fans another chance to watch them chase a national championship as a former fouryear college athlete , i can also speak firsthand about the benefits of prenba experience early in my career , i would have been lost without the skill development and physical maturity i gained while attending ucla without those things , it s possible i would not have lasted 13 years in the nba even after my retirement as an athlete , the lessons i learned in college , on and off the court , have proved invaluable , and my college coaches have become lifelong mentors the league has been wrestling with the question of posthighschool eligibility for a long time in 1971 , the future nba allstar to challenge the requirement that there be four years between the time a player left high school and when he could enter the nba haywood prevailed and opened the nba s door for generations of underclassmen yet even haywood recently wrote that players would benefit from an additional year in college recognizing the need for players to have more time to develop physically and emotionally before confronting the rigors of the nba , he said that the nba s proposed change requiring two years of posthighschool experience , rather than one , before a player could enter the league would be for the good of the game at all levels to support their argument , critics of the eligibility rule often cite the successful nba careers of a few exceptional high school players and hold them up as universal paragons conveniently unmentioned are the 18yearold draft picks whose names have been largely forgotten because they were not prepared to handle the challenges of playing professional basketball further overlooked is the damage to teams , their fans , the league and the players caused by these failed career attempts the agent arn tellem recently called for eliminating the eligibility rule \( turn oneanddone into noneanddone , june 29 \) while adopting tellem s view could be an improvement for agents who routinely recruit players at the high school level and earlier , it would not serve the best interests of the game over all critics also fail to acknowledge that eligibility standards or entry rules , including experience requirements and the consideration of intangible qualities like maturity and judgment , are common today across many industries , not just professional basketball and while opponents of expanding the nba rule often point to the less restrictive eligibility rules of leagues like major league baseball , they often ignore that football players must be three years removed from high school to be eligible for the nfl at most , the existence of these different approaches supports the commonsense view that a league s eligibility rules should be specific to the context of that sport for the nba , the debate is not about whether it is possible for players one year removed from high school to be successful professionals the real question is whether requiring players to acquire more basketball and life skills before entering the nba would improve the game there is no doubt in my mind that it would some have expressed concern about the career earnings potential of players who enter the nba one year later , but the reality is that players who choose to stay in school remain in an enviable financial position the college sophomores drafted in the top 30 between 2000 and 2005 , for example , have earned an average of 65 million per player over the course of their careers \( based on contracts to date \) as haywood noted , even those high school players destined for professional success could benefit from additional prenba experience the former duke star jabari parker , the milwaukee bucks' firstround pick last month , crystallized the issue in this year in high school i used to watch highlights of myself in my living room , parker was quoted as saying he added watching film with coach is very different it s intense i came to duke for experiences like this a second year of this kind of development would benefit players and our game even more as part of our commitment to developing talent , we created the nba development league , which has become established as an elite training ground onethird of players on nba rosters at the end of last season had dleague experience last month , five former dleaguers captured an nba championship with the san antonio spurs , and for the first time , a dleague player \( p j hairston \) was selected in the first round of the draft the development league is working , and while it is not a replacement for college , it is a strong alternative for those who choose a different path the nba s primary interest is the quality of the game changing the eligibility rule would come with no shortterm financial benefit for the league and zero financial impact on player salaries the nba and the players have already agreed to split revenue evenly and to give the players their share as a guaranteed sum if there is a financial upside in a new eligibility rule , it comes from better positioning players for success time spent developing their skills after high school , before entering the nba , is a great boon to both the players and the league if one more year can help athletes make better life and career decisions , the nba is happy to wait
it s been a year since citi bike started in new york city , and the program has been a tremendous success , with annual members and trips to date or , if you prefer , in citi bike s first year , the program has and is in urgent need of tens of millions of dollars both are true , so take your pick the story of bike share in new york city has been one of contradiction and antagonism , even before its inception 10 to ride a bike \? that s for rich people ! a bike share station in front of my building \? how is the doorman supposed to hail me a cab \? by the time the program was ready to roll , the calamitous prognostications came pellmell this town s too tough for bike share ! the streets would run red with the blood of hapless tourists and the helmetless ! all 6 , 000 bikes would be stolen by america s most industrious bike thieves ! none of these predictions came to pass in our egotistic frenzy , we had forgotten a few things , such as that the average person can ride a bike just fine , tourists are n't as hapless as we think they are and bike thieves are n't interested in stealing big , clunky bikes equipped with gps trackers we had assumed a kind of new york exceptionalism , when similar bike share programs were already running successfully in paris , london and washington instead , the program proved immediately popular after just one month of operation , the system had over half a million trips , with 50 , 000 annual members and 128 million miles citi bike use may have dipped during the winter \( a harsh one \) , but so does car use you may have noticed that half the cars on your block remained buried until the spring thaw , their owners enjoying free storage on some of the most expensive real estate in the world there was , however , one expectation that the world s most heavily scrutinized bike share system failed to meet economic selfsufficiency as robust as the program s user numbers were , it turned out that offering cheap annual memberships \( 95 \) and relatively costly 24hour passes \( 995 \) was not the best pricing structure to underwrite the system initially , giving regular users more favorable rates supported the city s claim that citi bike was a system by new yorkers for new yorkers now some say the system needs to look to tourists and shortterm users for profitability but was the goal of selfsufficiency ever reasonable \? there is no form of public transportation that does not benefit from some sort of subsidy new york city transit , metro north and the long island rail road cover less than half of their expenses with rider fares the rest of their funding comes from taxes , toll revenues and state and local subsidies the city even subsidizes ferry service from the rockaways and bay ridge , brooklyn , to pier 11 in manhattan this ferry well over 3 million to date , and it than 1 , 000 riders per day the only day the citi bike system had riders was feb 13 , when almost 10 inches of snow fell on the city yet citi bike was supposed to be different our tax dollars were not paying for it instead , it would be sustained by an optimistic projection of subscription revenues and corporate sponsorship a sort of bloombergian perpetual motion machine other bike share programs run differently capital bikeshare in washington is by a grant from the united states department of transportation , as well as other regional subsidies v lib' in paris by jcdecaux , an advertising company , in exchange for control of some 1 , 600 billboards space it sells to clients in london , the system is sponsored by barclays bank , but also looks to transport for london as well as local councils to help fund its expansion , which ultimately  granted , only the fact that new yorkers were n't ostensibly paying for citi bike allowed it to overcome ingrained cultural resistance mayor bill de blasio that he will not give city funds to citi bike this is a shame sure , citi bike is not indispensable after all , this is not the subway we 're talking about yet it s difficult at this point to imagine new york city without it and we should n't have to it s a fantastic amenity and a convenience to many thousands of people , from the tourist to the workaday commuter heading from grand central to an office and where would the new york media be without paparazzi shots of leonardo dicaprio on the sidewalk \? perhaps most important , bike share is an integral part of a change in street design that has had a palliative effect on new york city streets , and making them safer for all of us no matter how we travel it s an essential part of the urban ecosystem , like bivalves helping to clean a polluted waterway as citi bike enters its second year , it does so having passed both the safety test and the popularity test now it faces its biggest and most important test , which is whether we 'll forgive it for being unprofitable and poorly managed in the past , and commit to maintaining and improving it for the future even if , ultimately , it should prove necessary to use city funds when our auto industry sputtered , it got a bailout when our banking system , citibank included , was on the brink of collapse , it got a bailout citi bike is minuscule compared with the auto industry , or the banking industry or even the rest of the transit system , but its tiny size belies the positive effects it s already had on the city if we can find a way to keep bike share running in new york city , then it , too , will have officially become american
algiers israel said on thursday that it would not go through with an already delayed release of palestinian prisoners and was considering further sanctions against the palestinians as the threat to the peace talks deepened further despite secretary of state john kerry s concerted efforts to keep the process alive the talks have spiraled into an impasse as each side accuses the other of bad faith and places impediments in the way of a resolution the israeli decision came after , a move jerusalem deemed an unacceptable violation of the americanbrokered terms for the talks that began in july but the palestinians say they took that step only after the israelis failed to meet the deadline for releasing the prisoners worried that the process was in danger of collapsing , mr kerry publicly appealed to the leaders to lead and not let the atmosphere deteriorate further president mahmoud abbas of the palestinian authority had pledged not to seek membership in international bodies for the nine months allotted for the negotiations , in return for the release by israel in four groups of 104 longserving palestinian prisoners , many of them convicted of murder but israel sought to condition the release of the final batch on an extension of the negotiations beyond the current deadline of april 29 and though the palestinians blamed israel for delaying the fourth release beyond a latemarch deadline and precipitating the current crisis , israel is now accusing the palestinians of having foreclosed the planned release with their move people involved in the negotiations said tzipi livni , the israeli government s chief negotiator , told her palestinian counterparts during an intense overnight meeting convened by martin indyk , mr kerry s envoy , that the palestinians had acted even though they knew the israeli government was making a genuine , coordinated effort to arrange the prisoners' release ms livni called on the palestinians to withdraw their applications and return to the negotiating table , according to people with knowledge of the threeway meeting , arguing that unilateral steps would not advance the negotiations or the palestinians' cause \( none of those briefed on , or involved in , the meetings would speak publicly because mr kerry had asked them to preserve the secrecy of the discussions \) but the palestinians seemed to think they had the upper hand for the first time the palestinians have something to use against israel if it does not abide by agreements , and we made use of it , a palestinian official close to the negotiations said thursday we will not withdraw the applications they stand maan , an independent palestinian news agency , published what it said were new , stringent conditions set by palestinian negotiators for any extension of the talks beyond april 29 they include a written commitment from prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel that he recognizes the 1967 lines as the basis for the borders of a palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital , and the release of an additional 1 , 200 prisoners terms the israelis would almost certainly reject the details of the maan report could not immediately be confirmed but yasser abed rabbo , a senior palestinian official , told agence francepresse , israel has a habit of evading agreements and conventions it has signed he added that is why conditions for future negotiations must change radically an israeli official said jerusalem was considering further practical steps against the palestinians in the past , israel has applied sanctions like withholding the transfer of tax revenues that it collects on behalf of the palestinian authority rami g khouri , a palestinian journalist and the director of a publicpolicy institute at the american university of beirut , said that after months in which an american mandate for secrecy around the talks had largely held , the fight leapt into the public sphere you have some posturing going on , which is just another form of negotiating they 're negotiating in public now rather than in private , mr khouri said each side is trying to curry favor with public opinion so if things collapse , they can blame the other side he added maybe they 'll both get scared about the consequences of the collapse of the talks and come back i suppose it s a day at a time mr kerry , who began the day in algiers and then flew to rabat , morocco , was not informed by israeli officials that the prisoner release had been canceled but remained engaged in intense efforts to rescue the talks we will continue to , no matter what , to try to facilitate the capacity of people to be able to make peace , he said in algiers but he emphasized that it was mr netanyahu and mr abbas who held ultimate responsibility in the end , my friends , as all of you know , you can push , you can nudge , but the parties themselves have to make fundamental decisions and compromises , the leaders have to lead , and they have to be able to see a moment when it is there , mr kerry said he said it would be a tragedy if the two sides never grappled with the issues at the core of the conflict because of a dispute over conditions to extend the talks a fight over process how to get into a negotiation should not stop you from getting into that negotiation , he said as mr kerry was making the rounds in algiers , he stopped by the american embassy , where he made one of his two calls on thursday to mr netanyahu afterward , mr kerry spoke to the embassy s personnel and dependents , who had been waiting a considerable time to greet him i am really sorry that we got delayed , he told the group i had a phone call , and it was one of those calls where you ca n't get the other person to realize the call is over after his plane landed in morocco , mr kerry spoke with mr abbas from the aircraft
carnegie hall s imminent festival , , promises to be one of the most lavish in its rich history a threeweek citywide celebration with more than 50 events , anchored by five programs from the and two concert operas from that orchestra s parent company , the , at carnegie a broad representation of viennese music from the 18th to the 21st centuries will range from strauss family waltzes and other froth to those cathartically harrowing operas richard strauss s salome and alban berg s wozzeck the festival officially begins on friday with the 59th viennese opera ball in new york , at the waldorfastoria but not everything will be festive and celebratory vienna has , after all , also been a city of nightmares at times , and the bleaker aspects of its history will be examined in some detail during the festival on feb 24 even before the first concert , with franz welserm st conducting the vienna philharmonic in an edifying program of beethoven s ninth symphony and schoenberg s friede auf erden \( peace on earth \) on feb 25 the will begin a symposium on vienna s history and legacy of the last 150 years at the paley center for media in the first panel , vienna , 1860 to 1914 creativity , culture , science and politics , speakers including mr welserm st will discuss topics including the roots of societal breakdown if that does n't start the fur flying , the second panel , on feb 27 , should how did the cultured , creative society of vienna lose its moral compass \? presenting the vienna philharmonic as the prime specimen , and with , a violinist and president of the selfgoverning orchestra , as one of the speakers , the panel will inevitably reach to a deeper , more universal issue the moral responsibility of artists and artistic institutions both to their time and to history the philharmonic s behavior and that of individual members during the nazi era was , by any accounting , execrable but the orchestra has taken significant steps in the last quartercentury , and especially since mr hellsberg took over in 1997 , to own up to that past and acknowledge its complicity with the nazis , to honor those hurt or killed through the actions or inactions of an earlier generation of players and to devote itself to social good and the cause of international peace has it done enough \? no , not even close , say some , led by the greens , the leftliberal political party in austria , which keeps close and skeptical watch on the philharmonic s occasionally faltering steps to escape the shadow of its past and for some those whose families were involved in the purging of jews from the orchestra in 1938 , perhaps it never could do enough others , like daniel barenboim , who conducted the orchestra s new year s concerts in december and january , assert that the orchestra is on the right track admitting responsibility is always a good thing , mr barenboim said in an interview , and the philharmonic has done that it s not just the vienna philharmonic and austria that have horrors in their past one has to decide how responsible one holds people whose ancestors did this , that or the other joel bell , the founding chairman of the chumir foundation and the organizer of the carnegie symposium , agrees and supports mr hellsberg s initiatives led by clemens , the philharmonic has taken all the very good steps , mr bell said he enumerated three the orchestra has laid out the facts , a necessary first step , on its website it has mounted commemorations , tugging at the heartstrings to help people remember and to teach , as with a 2000 at a former concentration camp in mauthausen , austria and it has shown a willingness to participate in dialogue , as in the symposium but it is also true that the philharmonic s hand has been forced somewhat in the laying out of facts early last year , word of an incident involving baldur von schirach made the rounds in the news media and on the internet , with considerable help from the greens schirach among other things , the governor of vienna from 1940 to 1945 , and partly responsible for the deportation of tens of thousands of jews to nazi extermination camps in germanoccupied poland was one of many \( possibly including hitler , or such at least was the intent \) presented with rings or medals of honor by the orchestra in 1942 , to commemorate its centenary schirach lost his ring during his 20year imprisonment in spandau for war crimes , seemingly to a souvenirhunting american soldier schirach s son richard revealed in a book published in 2004 that an emissary of the orchestra had presented his father with a copy of the ring after his release from prison , a fact that gained wide circulation only a year or so ago in response to the public outcry , the orchestra commissioned three historians familiar with the terrain to undertake a quick but thorough study of the orchestra s activities during the nazi era they on the ensemble s website on march 10 , just before the 75th anniversary of the austrian anschluss the ring , it was determined , had been delivered to schirach in 1966 or 1967 by helmut wobisch , a trumpeter in the orchestra with a deep nazi past as a member of the ss , wobisch spied on and denounced colleagues he was ousted from the philharmonic after the war but returned in 1947 , became its manager in 1953 and played in it until 1968 mr hellsberg , who became the orchestra s first archivist in 1979 and published a lavishly produced history of the ensemble , demokratie der k nige \( democracy of kings \) , in 1992 , argues that wobisch was acting entirely on his own initiative , not on behalf of the orchestra , though his reinstatement and promotion within the ranks suggest that he cannot have been too far out of step with communal sentiment in any case , last october , the philharmonic members , at their annual meeting , voted to revoke the awards to schirach and five other officials , a symbolic gesture obviously , but a meaningful one the historians also pulled together a lot of other information , much of which had appeared in mr hellsberg s book and elsewhere , if never in so comprehensive and exhaustive a fashion the assertion of the lead historian , oliver rathkolb , for example , that in 1942 about 49 percent of active vienna philharmonic musicians were members of the nazi party came as no surprise mr hellsberg had the number at 42 percent by the end of the war , 47 percent if affiliated organizations were included mr rathkolb also took up other topics , like the festive concerts of strauss waltzes and the like begun on dec 31 , 1939 , and jan 1 , 1941 , though not called new year s concerts until 1946 and how they played into the nazi regime s propagandabyeducation strategy the bulk of the historians' report consists of bernadette mayrhofer s sobering accounts of the fates of 16 jewish musicians 13 who were expelled from the orchestra soon after the anschluss and three who had already retired nine , including the venerable concertmaster arnold ros , fled into exile five were deported and murdered in concentration camps and two died in deprivation in vienna , one awaiting deportation , the other having been evicted from his apartment and otherwise traumatized the third historian , fritz tr mpi , reported on historical and structural matters , including a kind of indirect politicization that took place in the climate of austrofascism and a gradual integration into nazi cultural policy musically , this integration brought an increased presence of works by bruckner , wagner and the strauss family the repeatedly increased enrollment of the philharmonic in the topos of the music city vienna' since 1938 , mr tr mpi concludes , served to establish the consolidation of nazi rule in vienna so why is all of this still dragging on as a lively issue \? for us and for germany and europe , mr rathkolb said in an interview , national socialism is still hot history it will take another generation or two to become cold history world war i for us is cold history yet as he made clear in his book the paradoxical republic austria , 19452005 , one outcome of world war i remained problematic for austrian identity the shrinking of the austrohungarian empire , 50 million inhabitants strong , to a ministate of seven million , yearning for anschluss with a democratically organized german reich and later the weimar republic an enfeebled austria entered looking for salvation in all the wrong places , now in union with nazi germany , and emerged from it in denial , seeing itself as hitler s first victim mr rathkolb quotes an unidentified german politician on the austrians in 1952 , instead of acknowledging their share of responsibility , they want to be coddled like a bullied child in contrast to the growing awareness and acknowledgment of heinous crimes that eventually took hold in germany , the climate of denial remained pervasive in austria until the late 1980s , when , in mr rathkolb s words , this repression of memory collapsed under the impetus of reassessment of the holocaust in the us and thereafter in europe , too the final blow to the victim doctrine may have been the election of kurt waldheim as president of austria in 1986 , after it had become widely known that he had lied about his complicity in nazi war crimes suddenly , there was an appetite to know more about perpetrators and bystanders , mr rathkolb said it took the younger generation to make the first step , he added now we 're on second and third steps each year another chapter opened mr hellsberg suggested an additional reason for the continuing trickle of revelations specific to the vienna philharmonic and its parent , the vienna state opera at the end of the '80s , archives had not yet opened up , archives of the state that was prehistoric time , before the internet now they have opened , step by step the greens are having none of that the recent revelations , they say , have been too little , too late now they have done more or less what everyone knew , said hannes metzler , a historian and a spokesman for the party there is little new research , he added , or provenance research on the orchestra s extensive holdings of instruments and artifacts , some of them undoubtedly of suspicious heritage mr hellsberg remains steadfast on his course in some ways , we represent austria , he said we have more obligations than just to do the job we also have moral obligations we are aware that it is important that our complete history be displayed , ups and downs , not just the nazi period if you wish to join the argument , you can look for mr hellsberg at the paley center on feb 27 he will be the one with an arm in a sling ,

lumberton , nc the most memorable moment of the trial that put henry mccollum and leon brown behind bars for three decades for a hideous 1983 rape and murder was a display of brilliant courtroom theatrics district attorney joe freeman britt of robeson county , who stood 6foot6 and came to be known as america s deadliest da , asked jurors to try to hold their breath for five minutes the time it took the 11yearold victim to choke to death , after her killer stuffed her panties down her throat with a stick to get a small sense of the horror she experienced the jury came back with two of the more than 40 death penalty convictions mr britt won over almost two decades those two convictions were obtained on the basis of inconsistent , soon recanted , confessions from two mentally impaired teenagers who said they had been coerced to sign statements written by interrogators , and testimony by an informer who previously did not implicate the two they were overturned last week , and mr mccollum and mr brown were exonerated and set free their release concluded a judicial horror story in which the two men were sent to death row though no physical evidence linked them to the murder at the same time , a serial sex offender who lived less than 100 yards from the crime scene and who , a few weeks after that murder , would kill a teenage girl nearby in strikingly similar circumstances was never pursued as a suspect but if the case was finally closed , the episode reopened ugly memories of what critics say was a merciless criminal justice system that ran roughshod over helpless people for decades in this poor , sprawling , racially volatile county sometime known as the great state of robeson at the heart of that is the legacy of joe freeman britt , who earned a spot in guinness world records and a 60 minutes profile for his prowess in sending people to death row \( only two were eventually executed the most infamous was velma barfield , 52 , who died from lethal injection in 1984 for killing her fianc by poisoning his beer \) and whereas mr britt , now 79 and retired , once dominated this county and won headlines for convictions , now some on both sides of the courtroom see a different tale the current district attorney , johnson britt , whose grandfather was first cousin to joe freeman britt s father , suggested that his predecessor could be tyrannical he is a bully , and that s the way he ran this office , he said people were afraid of him lawyers were afraid of him they were intimidated by his tactics and he did n't mind doing it that way he added you treat people with dignity , and you can get a whole lot more done that way than you can by trying to run over people and that s part of his legacy , that he ran over people in a subsequent interview , joe freeman britt made it clear that johnson britt was not his kind of prosecutor , either well , let s say , if i was a bully , he is a pussy how about that \? the elder mr britt said i think johnson britt has been hanging around too much with the wine and cheese crowd of last week s ruling , which was spurred by a north carolina innocence inquiry commission investigation and supported by the younger mr britt , he added i thought the da just threw up his hands and capitulated , and the judge did n't have any choice but to do what he did no question about it , absolutely they are guilty no one ever accused joe freeman britt of being a soft touch , particularly in the era when mr mccollum and mr brown were tried bisected by interstate 95 , the main artery between florida and new york , robeson county saw the drug trade come to fill part of the vacuum after textiles vanished and tobacco faded even today , robeson has the state s highest violent crime rate over the years , another element has been a threeway racial split white , black and american indian and complaints from the latter two groups of discrimination by whites who held power despite being a numerical minority flash points included protests over the killing in 1986 of an unarmed drug suspect by a deputy sheriff a son of the sheriff at the time and what many saw as a hasty , incomplete investigation that found no wrongdoing two years later , american indian activists took 19 hostages at the local newspaper to protest discrimination and corruption in the criminal justice system nonetheless , the mccollum and brown case seems destined to become the signature one of joe freeman britt s tenure and to critics , especially the current district attorney , it was remarkable what was overlooked any pursuit of roscoe artis as a suspect mr artis , who had already served prison time and committed violent sexual assaults , lived next to the soybean field in tiny red springs , where the victim was discovered investigators found a cigarette there which , at trial in 1984 , joe freeman britt implied belonged to one of the killers in fact , recent tests found that the cigarette had mr artis s dna , setting off the process that led to the release of mr mccollum and mr brown mr artis confessed to and was found guilty of raping and killing another teenage girl in similar circumstances four weeks after and a short distance from the murder mr mccollum and mr brown were charged with he remains in prison there is no sign that investigators or prosecutors pursued the theory that he might have killed both girls what are the chances of this similar , if not same , crime occurring in this small town , and there not being a connection \? said johnson britt how could they not make this connection \? the same prosecutor handled both trials , 90 days apart i'm still dismayed also distressing , he said , were violations of the brady rule requiring that exculpatory information be handed over to the defense three days before trial , the red springs police sought to test a beer can found at the scene for fingerprints of mr artis and l p sinclair , listing both as suspects the can had two fingerprints , one from the victim , another from neither mr mccollum nor mr brown but mysteriously , tests for the other two men never were performed none of that was shared with defense lawyers , johnson britt said nor was the information that mr sinclair , the informer who said mr mccollum had admitted killing the girl , had previously said he did not know anything about the murder , and a liedetector test indicated he was telling the truth another concern the red springs police insisted for years that they no longer had any physical evidence but this summer , innocence commission officials discovered evidence at the police station that included hair samples from the scene no dna from the newly found evidence matched mr mccollum s or mr brown s kenneth j rose , a lawyer for mr mccollum and senior staff attorney of the in durham , said the confessions that constituted almost the entire case were false an investigator knowledgeable about the crime scene and the autopsy attended mr mccollum s interrogation , contaminating a session at which investigators fed his client details , mr rose contends taken at face value , he added , the statement from mr mccollum purports to show a mentally impaired defendant somehow with precise recall of many crime scene details , including the brand and number of beer cans , and brand of cigarettes smoked by other perpetrators who , the confession states , were also involved \( two supposed coconspirators were quickly found to have credible alibis \) it s just astounding that people given so much power over other people s lives , and who can totally destroy people s lives , are so unwilling to consider facts , said mr rose , who intends to petition the governor for an innocence pardon \( at mr mccollum s 1991 retrial , one interrogator testified that details of the confession did not come from the police another of the investigators on the case , kenneth sealey , now the robeson county sheriff , did not return a phone call seeking comment \) johnson britt says there is no indication the police had informed joe freeman britt about mr sinclair s polygraph results or the aborted fingerprint testing the elder mr britt said he did not remember either piece of evidence , nor could he recall any investigator suggesting a connection between the murders he also said he could not understand why much faith is put in dna evidence , saying mr artis could have dropped the cigarette in the field at a time unrelated to the murder \( at trial , he told jurors that , lo and behold , butts at the scene were newports , which he implied were smoked by the other supposed perpetrators described in one of the confessions \) nor is he swayed by the argument that the defendants with iq s in the 60s and 50s were too impaired to appreciate the confessions written by investigators that they signed when we tried those cases , every time they would bring in shrinks to talk about how retarded they were , he said it went on and on and on , blahblahblah he chafes , too , at critics who say he pursued verdicts for personal glory i'm not proud of the number of death penalty cases i 've done , he said , calling them a necessary pursuit woody bowen , a lumberton lawyer who worked for joe freeman britt for a dozen years , called the mccollum and brown incarcerations an unspeakable tragedy but he said his former boss was fair and ethical albeit , stern and would not have withheld evidence or used coerced confessions he was disliked , but it was mostly by lawyers who did n't like getting whupped , mr bowen said angus thompson , the public defender here since the 1980s , had a different recollection withholding information was common back then they did n't give a darn about brady , he said there is another book , other than the guinness book of world records , that we all have to face , mr thompson added one of the most dreadful words in the capital case , when a person is convicted and sentenced and put to death , and the judge imposes that death sentence , and i 've heard it said many times , is , god have mercy on your soul he s in your custody , bailiff' i hope god has mercy on joe freeman britt s soul

in a 1988 film of his goldberg variations , shot on a rainy day in east charleston , vt , the choreographer steve paxton spears a pile of hay with a pitchfork , shovels it into a wheelbarrow and then , as if continuing with his yard work , starts to dance it s a flailing , stumbling dance twisting and swerving , intercepting itself at odd junctures but also intensely focused , each moment both a necessity and a surprise speaking by phone recently from that same vermont farm , where he has lived since 1972 , mr paxton , 75 , explained that goldberg , a series of improvisations to bach that he performed from 1986 to 1992 , essentially had no structure , no rules except for the most general one , he clarified to do it differently every time through sunday , dia art foundation honors that improvisatory spirit with four pieces spanning the past 50 years of mr paxton s career tailored to the cavernous , sunlit galleries at dia beacon in beacon , ny , the program which comprises flat \( 1964 \) , smiling \( 1967 \) , bound \( 1982 \) and the beast \( 2010 \) is the latest in dia s surveys of pioneering postmodern choreographers including yvonne rainer and trisha brown it s part 2 of what began last year at dia chelsea with the lauded new york premiere of \( 2004 \) by mr paxton and his longtime collaborator lisa nelson devised with the curator kelly kivland , selected works is not , in mr paxton s eyes , a retrospective as he wrote in an email most of what i 've done is n't reproducible retrospective' suggests more stability than i allowed my work to have if there s anything unchanging in that body of work , it may be this attraction to change , to examining what he calls the unique flow of each moment \( a phrase that , in practice , has none of the triteness it has on paper \) an enlightened mischief has animated his career from his experiments in the 1960s with everyday movement \( walking , sitting \) to his development in the '70s of , the multiperson , weightsharing dancesport that took on a life of its own around the world to his investigations , beginning in the '80s , of the spine and muscles of the back look at him he s like nijinsky , the choreographer cathy weis said recently at her soho loft , revisiting the goldberg footage she had compiled last spring for a danspace project gala honoring mr paxton this was the same gala where ms rainer who , like mr paxton , was a founding member of the iconoclastic judson dance theater and the improvisation collective grand union deemed him judy hussietaylor , the executive director of danspace , called him the greatest philosopherchoreographer of our time such pronouncements , while entirely fitting , can also seem at odds with mr paxton s resolutely unassuming nature , a dryness that back in the day , according to the choreographer , earned him the nickname mr neutral he has a kind of enigmatic quality that i think has attracted people to him over the years , ms stark smith said , noting his love for wordplays and mind plays and for upending conventional notions of what dance is supposed to be in the early days of contact improvisation , people did n't even know if it was dance or not , she said it looked a little bit like this , a little bit like that it was like wrestling or jitterbugging or surfing there was just no way of defining it contact improvisation , which owed much to mr paxton s training in gymnastics and martial arts , is one realm not represented in selected works , though it may be his most widespread innovation in 1986 , after more than a decade of instigating , practicing and teaching the form , he took a step back it was keeping me overly busy , he said this was one element that i 'd found in my dance path , but the path was more important than any individual element so i tried to get back onto my path one discovery on that path has been a nearly stationary but wildly alive solo based on , mr paxton s method , created over the past 18 years , for exploring the dark side of the body he is still dancing , if not as vigorously as before a concussion in his mid60s left him with a sense that stillness was my friend , he said i never really have regained my interest in throwing my body around in space asked whether dancing gets better with age , he replied i consider my 50s the best time of all dancing was full , options were vast , and i felt my brain had adjusted to the aims i had for movement the beast is the one work he will perform in beacon for the rest , some more indeterminate than others , he has enlisted the performers k j holmes , polly motley and , a slovenian dancer who , fascinated by goldberg variations , began performing his own interpretations in 2010 if mr paxton seems to keep a low profile , that might be because he s been out of the country the attention to his influence has really been in europe , not so much here , ms kivland said that s one reason why we wanted to present this program at home and abroad , younger generations of choreographers ca n't help but romanticize mr paxton and the era he helped to define he acknowledges that he and his judson colleagues broke new ground but resists idealizing it we did n't mean to rupture anything , he said we were just doing what we thought was appropriate work
hundreds of thousands of syrians have no access to medical supplies because the warring sides in the country s civil war are blocking humanitarian relief , according to an advance copy of a report from the united nations secretary general the syrian government refused to let united nations workers deliver medicine to douma , a suburb of the capital , damascus , in late march , and in early april injectable medicines were prevented from being delivered to another town , the report said children remained beyond the reach of health workers administering polio vaccines , it said , and two new cases were confirmed in april the report is part of the united nations' second 30day assessment of how the syrian government and rebels fighting to overthrow it have complied with a ordering them to allow humanitarian aid to enter besieged towns the report calls the denial of medical aid arbitrary and unjustified , and a clear violation of international humanitarian law , and says 216 , 015 people lack access to medical supplies that have been blocked from entering towns or removed from convoys it does not say by whom , but offers examples that point to government forces medicines are routinely denied to those who need them , including tens of thousands of women , children , and elderly , said the report , which was obtained by the new york times on thursday the security council must take action to deal with these flagrant violations of the basic principles of international law indeed , the ball is now squarely in the security council s court two months ago , several western powers on the council threatened to take firm action if the warring parties in syria failed to comply with the legally binding resolution , which was passed feb 22 a month ago , after the first 30day assessment , many of them said privately that they would wait for the second report the council is scheduled to discuss the second assessment next week the chances of persuading syria s staunch ally , russia , to take any punitive action are slim as one of five permanent members of the council , russia has veto power over any action over all , the report said , united nations agencies delivered slightly more food during the period covered , march 22 to april 21 , than they did during the previous 30 days , and reached some previously sealedoff areas , including deir alzour still , only 13 percent of 262 besieged areas were reached , it says , and 93 million people over all are in need of aid inside syria the report also documented continued aerial bombardments by government forces , including on a grain silo citing satellite imagery obtained by human rights watch , it reported that an average of 20 shells and missiles fell every day in eastern aleppo , a major city in the north , between midmarch and midapril it chronicles cases in which a trickle of food aid is allowed to go through , but is then shut down by fighting or bureaucratic obstacles the report singles out extremist groups fighting the government , in particular the islamic state of iraq and syria , which was blockading a town called ar raqqah the united nations said it also received unconfirmed reports of attacks on homes and churches after a strike on latakia , on the turkeysyria border , by the nusra front , another extremist group aid workers undertook heroic efforts to reach people trapped behind front lines , the report said in eastern aleppo , during a fourhour ceasefire , relief workers from the united nations refugee agency and the syrian arab red crescent walked across a mined onemile stretch of noman s land with loaded pushcarts the red crescent reported that on april 19 , four privately contracted trucks carrying food were bombed and its two drivers killed two of its volunteers were injured in a car bomb in homs on april 9 twentyfive united nations staff members remain in detention , the report said two months since the adoption of the resolution , none of the parties to the conflict have adhered to the demands of the council , the report said bluntly civilians are not being protected the security situation is deteriorating and humanitarian access to those most in need is not improving
i m going to do a final round here , since answering reader questions turns out to be easier than figuring out where malaysia flight 370 ended up or how to evict vladimir putin from the crimea as before , these been edited slightly for length , and the full versions are available from the link on each questioners name and as before , my thanks to everyone who offered questions , and my apologies for only answering a selection of the many that were posed  q i have to say that i don t agree with you a lot what do you think should be done \( or not done , if you deny climate change science \) about climate change \? it seems like the only way to prevent ourselves from passing the point of no return is to have a massive government intervention in the economy to me , it is clear that the free market isn t cutting it when it comes to climate change but you re a reasonable \( someone who thinks out his or her argument \) conservative how do we fight climate change \? a mostly by hoping for technological breakthroughs , and looking for ways prizes , research funding , removing distortions in energy markets to speed them it s completely plausible , as you suggest , that climate change will turn out to be an externality that market forces alone can t solve the difficulty is that the most direct forms of government intervention \( co2 regulation , carbon taxation , the various capandtrade regimes \) probably aren t going to work either , because they require a level of global political cooperation and economic selfsacrifice that the slowmotion pace \( from our perspective , not nature s \) of ecological change is extremely unlikely to inspire at best , you might be able to get some movement on capandtrade in us politics if the economy roared for a sustained stretch \( it s not a coincidence that the last period of bipartisan enthusiasm peaked with the bushera economy \) but even then the finished legislative product would probably be a costly kludge , with even more inefficiences than europe s nonetooeffective attempt at carbon markets , and a minimal impact on the underlying problem and then we still wouldn t be close to figuring out how to deal with the heart of the problem , which is the \( completely understandable \) aversion to selfsacrificial regulation in developing countries around to the world , which has helped scuttle every attempt at a global climate change regime or at least that s my sense of the state of play at the moment innovation is our best hope , adaptation and mitigation our most likely future , and we should hope that the recent , muchdebated slowdown in the pace of warming continues without kidding ourselves that it somehow proves that no problem exists but as i mentioned in an earlier round of questions , i try not to be too doctrinaire about policy areas where other writers have a much stronger handle on the material , and so i d recommend reading elsewhere for the reasonable skepticism about liberalism s existing climate change agenda it sounds like you might be looking for a couple of suggestions in short form , the comments from tyler cowen and larry summers \( one libertarian and the other neoliberal but neither any kind of climate change denier \) in this symposium both strike me as plausible reads on the problem in longerform , the work of jim manzi \( from the centerright \) and ted nordhaus and michael shellenberger \( from the centerleft \) is worth dipping into extensively as well and then you can seek out their many liberal critics in turn they aren t hard to find  q given the damaging impasse in our culture and politics , and with it the pressing need for someone to move off their viewpoint , what is the bedrock principle ie gun control , abortion , freedom of speech , climate change , gay marriage , etc that you would bend or break on to help foment a healthier discourse in our nation \? it is the hardest question that i ask myself thanks for being vulnerable a i think bend and break are very different things really , i d be willing to bend on most issues , in part because that s just a necessary part of democratic politics , and also because on a lot of issues my views are based \( or at least i d like to think so ! \) on costbenefit analysis as well as ideology , so imagining compromise isn t that difficult i d be willing to accept a slightly larger government in exchange for a lighter regulatory footprint and very different spending priorities i d accept the kind of carbon tax that i just expressed skepticism about if it were part of a tax reform that included the kind of work and familyfriendly tax cuts i support i m open to modest gun control measures where their effectiveness can be demonstrated \( here s some interesting recent evidence on the progun control side \) i d be willing to endure a socialist dictatorship if i were allowed to cowrite the next season of true detective you get the idea breaking , though , implies just giving up on a principle or idea entirely , which is a lot harder to do that s part of why the culture wars , where important principles are clearly at stake , burn so hot despite wellmeaning \( or not so wellmeaning \) attempts to push them to the back of the political stove not that compromise is impossible on these issues as someone who s an antiabortion absolutist as a philosophical matter , for instance , i don t disdain realism and compromise on the issue , and indeed i think the prolife movement has been resilient in an oftenhostile political landscape precisely because it hasn t made the perfect the enemy of the good but the culture war does present cases \( and this is true for both sides \) where conceding on the principle is morally problematic or worse , even when the politics are hopeless , and where the term break is an appropriate description of what giving up would mean and while comity is valuable , i wouldn t want to endorse such breakage in most cases indeed , i think that ruling certain issues off the table can create a price of entry into political debate that a principled citizen shouldn t be expected to accept q why do you think george w bush turned out to be such a bad president \? i ve heard a lot of character personality explanations over the years \( he s stupid etc \) but do you think there might be a structural reason why the gop nominated him , or how his presidency functioned that might explain it \? or is it basically just his fault after all \? a i could give an answer as long and complicated as his presidency , but a short answer might be useful because he and his team believed \( along with a lot of people \) that saddam hussein had a significant wmd program , because they \( along with a lot of people \) overestimated our ability to pacify iraq and build up democratic institutions in that country , and because they made specific choices during the occupation \( for which they bear full responsibility \) that made a bad situation that much worse this kind of iraq war determinism , which i ve elaborated on and defended in the past , is obviously incomplete as a story of the bush presidency s problems but it has advantages over a lot of the grand theories that get spun about those eight years , in which bush s failure is alleged \( by liberals \) to prove the impossibility of conservative governance , or alleged \( by conservatives \) to demonstrate that any attempt to govern from the centerright is doomed to be a budgetbusting failure i have lots of problems with bush s policy choices overall , but i don t think they vindicate either caricature instead , a lot of what went wrong seems highly contingent , some of what seemed to go wrong wasn t actually so disastrous \( harriet miers is the answer to a trivia question , medicare part d s implementation turned out fine , etc \) , and some of what went right \( or at least what could have been much , much worse \) was connected to some of the same personal characteristics that are often cited as the qualities that doomed his presidency to failure so i m just hesitant about scripting an entire conclusive narrative around bush the man or bushism the ideological vision i think it s better to just evaluate his specific policy choices on a case by case basis , and there it seems to me that what happened in iraq looms so large \( and shaped every subsequent choice so dramatically \) that it will be the central evaluative issue for future historians of his presidency , period q why do conservatives object to directly increasing the minimum wage by making employers pay for it , while they are ok with indirectly increasing the minimum wage by making taxpayers foot the bill through the eitc \? if i don t shop at walmart because i don t think it pays enough , i certainly don t want to subsidize walmart s profits with my tax dollars a not all conservatives are proeitc , but on behalf of those of us who favor its existence and potential expansion , i d offer this answer because we prefer a transparent welfare state that supplements market income after the fact to a hidden welfare state that interferes with market forces more directly it may well be , as you suggest , that walmart could afford to pay its workers more though the underlying issues are , well , complicated , and there s a pretty good case that walmart s low prices benefit the working class but conservatives would say , following hayek , that even if you feel certain that walmart is run by greedheads who are just lining their own pockets , the government is extremely illequipped to judge that kind of question and for that reason and others , if you re trying to maximize growth , employment and entrepreneurship overall , it s much wiser to leave it to the market to decide the prevailing wage then if we , as a society , think that market forces and economic efficiency are leaving too many people behind , and some kind of wage threshold makes sense as a matter of distributive justice well , then , we can create one , as programs like the eitc effectively do but we should recognize that what we re doing is straightforward redistribution , and just redistribute transparently instead of imposing what amounts to a tax on lowwage employers and calling it a living wage \( and this is especially true in an era of mass unemployment , when we want lowwage employers to feel comfortable hiring as many people as possible \) the issue , again , is not that you re necessarily wrong to judge walmart s wage decisions harshly it s that there just isn t some kind of perfect moralitypluseconomics mechanism for policymakers to use to figure out which businesses have selfish motives and which ones are paying the best wage that their business model enables them to afford so rather than imposing a single standard on an incredibly diverse landscape , it s better to do whatever redistribution you favor more directly , even when it sometimes seems to let bad actors off the hook q it s clear that , as a christian , you disagree with the new atheists about many things but you seem unaware about how out of touch your particular version of christianity is with the vast majority of those who claim to be christian why don t you write a blog post condemning the theology philosophy ethics of the christians with whom you obviously have little in common \? \( i think you ll discover that you have more in common with most irreligious people than you do with fellow christians \) a i m actually quite aware that many of my fellow believers don t share all of my opinions ! but i d make two points in defense of the subjects i take up on the blog and in the column , and then throw one point back at you first , i think it s a good idea for a writer to try to be useful to his audience , in the sense of provoking interesting arguments , and raising points his readers might not otherwise consider and my strong impression is that the times readership \( and i m including religious as well as secular subscribers \) does not need regular instruction about the intellectual problems with , say , premillennial dispensationalism or name it and claim it prosperity theology , and that it s a far better thing especially in an era when fundamentalism s political influence is waning rapidly for me to challenge and discuss ideas that actually have a strong purchase among the audience that reads my work not that the issues you raise are unimportant i think they re important enough to have devoted a lot of ink to them in my recent book on american christianity , where you can find extended critiques of figures like joel osteen and glenn beck , among others and maybe i m not getting the balance exactly right , and i should work more critiques of the fundamentalist strand of what i ve called bad religion into my semidaily writing but you have to choose your targets in this profession , and i think the prejudices of secularism are often a more appropriate target for my blogging and columnizing than the errors of fundamentalism \( though i do sometimes manage to critique both at once \) second , and in defense of my cobelievers i think there s a tendency among nonreligious readers to read philosophical defenses of religious belief \( in the vein of david bentley hart s the experience of god , to picked the mostdiscussed recent example \) , snort , and say well , that s all well and good , but that s not what most people in the pew believe ! which is sort of true , in the sense that most people aren t philosophers or theologians and don t base their beliefs on a careful reading of aquinas or maimonides \( though i wonder how many secular partisans of science ! could actually explain all or most of the theories they endorse \) but it s also sort of false , because many serious philosophers of religion \( hart , for instance , very much included \) don t see themselves as advancing theories that contradict the basic tenets of their respective faiths they see themselves as broadening , deepening , explaining and justifying those tenets , in ways that fulfill rather than contradict the assumptions of the typical believes \( or if they are contradicting them , they re often doing so a context that assumes the beliefs in question might be true , and are at the very least worth debating \) what s more , as hart points out in his book , it does ordinary believers a disservice to insist that they re all literalminded dunces who think god is a whitebearded guy sitting on a cloud somewhere due west of pluto certainly the average believer may have very little knowledge of the history of metaphysics or the technical language of philosophy , and might not be able to formulate propositions regarding the logic of divine transcendence with the practiced ease of some saturnine old jesuit in some midwestern catholic college s philosophy faculty nevertheless , if one asks that average believer certain question about what he or she understands god to be , the answers will often be in principle perfectly concordant with the more arcane formulate of the metaphysicians that god is spirit , incorporeal , not an object located somewhere in space , not subject to the limitations of time , not a product of cosmic nature , not simply some craftsman who creates by manipulating materials external to himself , not composed of parts , but rather residing in all things while remaining perfectly one , present to us in the depths of our own beings \( and so forth \) as a practical reality , the god of faith and the god of philosophers are in many crucial respects recognizably one and the same and by the same token , it s a mistake for secular readers to assume that the reasonable believers they encounter in , say , the pages of the times share all of their assumptions about what constitutes a reasonable belief to use your formulation , some philosophicallyminded believers may have more in common in some ways with some irreligious people than they do with some of their fellow christians but aquinas believed in the physical resurrection of jesus of nazareth so does david bentley hart so do i and that shared belief fixes a gulf between me and richard dawkins , and creates a commonality between me and \( for instance \) ken ham , that would be fruitless to deny and then as for the commonalities that i do have with many nonbelievers , dawkins included well , for my last point , i d just turn the issue around , and suggest that what we have in common is as much of a challenge to atheistic prejudices as to christian ones that is , to the extent that contemporary atheists are also idealistic liberals who believe in human rights and human reason \( which in many cases they seem to be ! \) , they are actually making their own metaphysical bets that have little or nothing to do with the scientific method or the latest in evolutionary theory or a rigorous devotion to pure materialistic empirics , and have more in common with the religious worldpicture than they admit this isn t just a matter of intellectual genealogy and the oftenunacknowledged debt modern liberalism still owes to western monotheism , or the potentials tensions and problems within a worldview that tries to be politically progressive while also embracing eliminative materialism it s a matter of the plain substance of a lot of contemporary secularliberal belief , and the place that essentially supernatural concepts from platonic forms to exnihilo physical laws to effectivereligious assumptions about the objective reality of human rights and moral values all the way down to arc of history views of human progress still occupy in the intellectual furnishing of welleducated modern minds even minds that insist that they rely exclusively on the scientific method , and that their religious critics are spaghettimonster worshiping obscurantists to be clear , i m not saying that embracing \( or admitting the possible existence of \) certain godconcepts requires one embrace theistic ideas , let alone christian ones i m just saying that these concepts , and others like them , create an enduring , effectively metaphysical common ground between believers and \( some \) atheists , and that contemporary atheism would profit greatly from acknowledging as much instead of pretending that its every premise and principle derives directly from laboratory investigation
