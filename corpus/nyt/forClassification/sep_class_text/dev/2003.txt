rusizi national park , burundi there is a large empty enclosure set up by the edge of the rusizi river here , one that the burundian authorities hope will one day lure tourists to this part of central africa it is ringed by a fence topped with barbed wire and has a giant pool inside if all goes according to plan , it will someday become the home of gustave , an enormous maneating crocodile that has for decades haunted the rusizi and the northern shores of lake tanganyika , where the river flows while shrouded in myth , gustave is no loch ness monster he lives and breathes and , most of all , devours but as might be expected with such an oversize beast , some of the tales about him are rather tall while the largest nile crocodiles typically measure something over 20 feet , gustave supposedly reaches 30 feet some people who have seen him claim he is 40 feet , teeth to tail locals describe how he has devoured fisherman after fisherman , swimmer after swimmer during one raid , legend has it , he chomped up more than a dozen people and still seemed hungry at the end of it all a crocodile expert with the new yorkbased wildlife conservation society , john thorbjarnarson , said it was common for people to exaggerate the size of a big crocodile a really big nile crocodile , which is probably what gustave is , would be about 17 feet , he said , but could appear much larger as for gustave s penchant for human flesh , mr thorbjarnarson is willing to give the locals the benefit of the doubt only two of the 23 species of crocodiles and alligators are maneating , he said , but the nile crocodile happens to be one of them still , he added , gustave might be blamed for deaths he had nothing to do with it s very easy to blame a crocodile for people who drown or go missing , he said all that said , gustave is indisputably the biggest crocodile that anybody around here has ever seen or heard of , and he is unquestionably dangerous but despite his ferocity , he is not by a long shot the greatest peril in burundi rebels ring the capital , regularly making deadly raids on the people there , and malarial mosquitoes buzz with a ferocity found few places else still , the locals here spend a considerable amount of time discussing gustave gustave is real , said patrice faye , 50 , a french environmentalist who has worked in burundi for more than 20 years i 've seen him i 've seen three different people in his jaws the only problem with the government financed plan to market gustave is that the crocodile is as crafty as he is aggressive gustave has eluded capture for years despite the best efforts of a team of experts mr faye , who is leading the effort to bring gustave in , stood along the riverbank recently , watching for signs of the animal eventually , he called out to gustave , but he got no response a local fisherman , jumaine mbankunguka , said he had seen the animal across the river the morning before , moving quickly and seeming to stretch on forever mr mbankunguka said he stood well back from the water , fearful of becoming another gustavian treat when you 're fishing , it comes and splashes you with water with its tail , mr mbankunguka said if you fall in , it kills you mr faye gave the crocodile his name some years back he says it has no special significance and speaks with admiration of the animal s smarts and strength with the backing of the burundian government , mr faye has tracked gustave for the last five years but trapping him has proved a challenge as daunting as the beast itself mr faye once put a live goat into a giant metal cage it took dozens of men to carry the contraption into the water but gustave merely hovered nearby , eyeing the spectacle mr faye has also tried nooses and a variety of other traps but inevitably these have snared other , smaller crocodiles gustave even turned up his nose at a dead cow mr faye has invited various television crews to burundi to watch his crocodile hunt while several have taken him up on his offer , none have yet gotten the prized images of mr faye hauling in the huge maneater during the last televised hunt last month , mr faye corralled a number of other crocodiles , but not gustave people think i'm crazy , said mr faye , who finances his crocodile hunting by dealing in exotic snakes and prefers to think of himself as eccentric whatever else he may be , mr faye is certainly focused after scanning the river recently , he trudged off unannounced through the brush to one of gustave s favorite sunning spots his hunt continues photo somewhere out there is gustave , a huge crocodile believed to have eaten dozens of people patrice faye , a french environmentalist who wants to capture gustave , discusses the crocodile with a fisherman \( photo by guillaume bonn galbecom , for the new york times \)
this nation s most venerable concert presenter , which has brought high musical culture to the american heartland for nearly 75 years , is in disarray , with canceled bookings and nonpayments and bounced checks to dozens of artists the resulting uproar is ravaging this institution , community concerts , already battered for years by changing tastes and by competition from television , recordings and a growing menu of other electronic entertainments there are serious questions about the company s ability to survive under a problemplagued new owner and to continue servicing subscription associations of music lovers from clearfield , pa , to redmond , ore next season , 20034 , is in shambles , some local organizers said oh , i did hundreds of them , said roberta peters , the coloratura soprano , recalling recitals for operastarved fans in the 1950 s and 60 s in small towns across america my god , they waited for this and lapped it up , she said they would n't let you off the stage to hear of the company s decline is just pathetic , she said it s the end of an era community concerts goes back to 1927 , when seven leading impresarios with ties to stars like ezio pinza and jascha heifetz and to the new york philharmonic , the philadelphia orchestra and the metropolitan opera , met at the elite lotos club in manhattan to fashion an audacious plan to export musical culture to the hinterlands with the added backing three years later of the columbia broadcasting system , the new entity , the community concerts corporation , was complete , and for much of its history it was as close to a cultural monopoly as the nation may ever have seen after seeding the country with hundreds of nonprofit audience associations made up of local subscribers , community concerts filled its bills with affiliated artists , whose performances it beamed out to radio listeners now that legacy is in tatters we do owe artists money , said the owner , brenda trawick , who bought community concerts in 1999 and relocated it last summer , with another of her companies , trawick artists management , to charlotte , nc , from manhattan she admitted to nonpayments and an error that led to bad checks , although she would not estimate how much they amounted to she said she was trying to recover from years of heavy losses and would make good to her clients the st louis postdispatch reported the artists' complaints last month the artists , including elisabeth von trapp of the family singers who inspired the sound of music , the van cliburn piano competition medalist antonio pompabaldi and numerous soloists , ensembles and dance troupes , said they were owed a combined total of 15 million or more some are particularly bitter that , knowing of the financial difficulties , ms trawick sent them on the road only to encounter uncovered expenses and missing paychecks i would never have sent them out if i felt it was not going to materialize , ms trawick said ms von trapp , a granddaughter of the family matriarch maria , said she was owed 59 , 000 it s become a downer for us , she said it s very disappointing not having them stick to their bargain some artists said that after they complained about overdue money , ms trawick retaliated by telling the concert associations the artists had canceled future bookings she denied doing that some local organizers , like bob ware of the community concert association in payson , ariz , where 870 subscribers pay 50 for a sixconcert package , have cut their ties to the company and are booking talent elsewhere we 've lost trust , said mr ware , a volunteer some artists have contacted the manhattan district attorney s office meanwhile the furor is playing out in civil lawsuits and barrages of email messages between the artists and ms trawick s office , many of which were made available to the new york times by the artists and some of the 320 local community concert associations have begun paying artists directly none of her excuses about rising costs , bad economy , etc , have stood up to scrutiny , another organizer , diane k mitchell of hemet , calif , wrote recently in an email to members of other concert associations the fees she was supposed to pay the artists were known well in advance and her expenses cannot possibly have amounted to more than the commissions she collected \( which , we have discovered to our dismay , were often as high as 50 percent \) at stake is a historic cultural network that at its peak after world war ii included about 1 , 200 nonprofit associations that drew many of the biggest names in music marian anderson , rosa ponselle , beverly sills , leontyne price , samuel ramey , the brothers four and the preservation hall jazz band in recent years the associations have been organizing 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 performances a season to audiences of several hundred to thousands the 1930 merger united william s paley s fledgling cbs with the concert

paterson , nj , march 5 the young man walked into the secondfloor offices of all services plus right at closing time , 4 pm , on a saturday he came like hundreds of others before him , to get a fake identification card for 35 but this customer was particularly impatient he was leaving the state , he said , and needed the id soon four days later , he became enraged when the id was not ready when he finally received it the next day , he demanded that mohamed elatriss , who runs all services , give back his photograph and application you face it , sometimes , from a customer , mr atriss said mr atriss said he did not think again about the visit until a few days after sept 11 , 2001 , when an fbi agent paid him a visit , explaining that the young man , khalid almidhar , and another to whom mr atriss had sold a fake id , abdulaziz alomari , had been among the 19 hijackers in the terror attacks since then , mr atriss , 46 , has had plenty of time to think about the matter he spent nearly six months in the passaic county jail while state prosecutors pressed charges related to the document sales and used secret evidence to raise his bail to 500 , 000 , a sum usually reserved for murder suspects prosecutors have kept the evidence sealed , and had argued that release of the information had the potential to jeopardize national security now he is a free man , of sorts after he pleaded to lesser charges as part of a plea agreement , a state superior court judge sentenced mr atriss on tuesday to five years' probation and a 15 , 000 fine the penalty is high for a falsedocuments case , but it could have been worse mr atriss had faced 10 years in prison if convicted of racketeering charges for selling simulated documents to the hijackers mr midhar was on the plane that hit the pentagon , mr alomari on one of the jets that struck the world trade center and hundreds of others i'm glad , obviously , that it s over , mr atriss said in an interview this week he said he had lost his house , had no money to speak of , and was stung that his name had been linked to the terror attacks , which he said he abhorred nobody wished for any human being to die the way it happened sept 11 , he said i want to emphasize that people do n't label me as a terrorist prosecutors began with the assumption that mr atriss presented a security threat , but that changed they say they hope he feels chastened by his punishment , and they add that mr atriss has cooperated with them in the case nevertheless , the evidence remains sealed the case against mr atriss has reverberated far beyond paterson it spotlighted a struggle between local and federal authorities in investigating terrorism , and prompted changes to the way new jersey issues search warrants it highlighted the use of secret evidence in nationalsecurity cases , and prompted the state legislature to consider longer maximum jail sentences for documentfraud cases but these days , mr atriss seems to have more mundane issues on his mind he is happy merely to sit at home , drink coffee and watch his favorite television program , the steve harvey show , a sitcom set in an urban high school he is trying to bring his wife , wessam , and three of his five children back from egypt , where he and the family were visiting last year when his business was raided mr atriss surrendered himself there and was arrested on his arrival at kennedy international airport a softspoken but solidly built man with graying hair and a beard , mr atriss grew up in alexandria , egypt he studied engineering in college but never completed his degree he came to the united states in 1980 , lived in jersey city for a year and managed a fastfood restaurant in manhattan called kansas burger along the way , he married a woman from indianapolis she died in a car crash in 1996 and raised a family mr atriss drove taxis in newark and opened a gas station in harrison and a dunkin' donuts store in parsippany but none of these businesses did particularly well , he said so in august 1999 , he rented an office in paterson at 152 market street , opposite city hall , and began his document business he says that he believed the operation was legitimate similar businesses flourish in communities with many immigrants , like paterson and elizabeth , he says i never had any idea that what i was doing was illegal , he said most of his customers were hispanic , he said , and he employed women who could speak spanish he devised a method to have people register as corporations so they could get car insurance and registration he sold hundreds of phony international drivers' licenses , which he said many of his customers have used in fighting traffic and parking tickets , for 135 each he sold mr midhar , the hijacker , a document labeled united states identification card , bearing the new jersey state seal in his interview , mr atriss became visibly upset when recalling the attention generated by the raid on his office by jerry speziale , the passaic county sheriff , with tv cameras and news reporters in tow he sighed heavily when recalling his days in prison , where , he said , he had spent many hours talking , thinking , crying sometimes he said that he nearly lost all hope when secret evidence was used against him in a november hearing at which his bail was raised to 500 , 000 from 250 , 000 but mr atriss s second lawyer , miles r feinstein , appealed the bail decision , and a new hearing was set before it was held , a plea agreement was reached steven brizek , a senior assistant prosecutor for passaic county , said people should not feel sorry for mr atriss after all , mr brizek said , mr atriss continued to sell illegal documents after sept 11 , and after he knew the risks he even opened a second business , in elizabeth judge marilyn c clark castigated mr atriss this week for what she called reckless and callous disregard for the safety of others in continuing to sell the documents he should have known that it was potentially inviting a disaster , she said in court , mr atriss and his lawyer did not dispute the point but afterward , mr atriss said that a paterson police officer and a member of the prosecutor s office had informed him that his business was above board mr brizek said , i do not know of any prosecutor who would express the opinion that what he was doing was legitimate mr atriss now lives with his son mohamed jr , 18 , and his daughter fatima , 19 , and her husband in union county he tried to return to his old house , he said , but the landlord refused to renew the lease because of skittishness about the raid mr atriss has started making plans to open a maintenance business or a cleaning service , he said as part of his probation he must remain in new jersey he said that he did not believe that he should be blamed for a role in the attacks i regret what happened , mr atriss said , but i do n't feel in any way responsible for it

key west , fla feb 26 not long after school lets out , the cool and elegant home of wayne larue smith and daniel skahen , on a shady street near the historic district here , is transformed by the boisterous whoops of two boys they exclaim at a bee on the porch , at the lime tree in the backyard , at the consequences of mixing dirt with water they jump in the pool and welcome a visitor s applause at each twisting fall and cannonball one is 5 , the other 6 one white , the other of mixed race they are bursting out of their skins with questions and energy mr smith , a 47yearold lawyer , and mr skahen , a 36yearold real estate broker , would like to adopt the boys , who have lived with them as foster children for about two years each but they are a gay couple and florida is the only state that forbids any adoption by a homosexual on tuesday , a federal appeals court in atlanta will hear their challenge to the law gay people are the only group categorically restricted from adopting children in florida even people who have abused drugs and alcohol or people who have a history of domestic violence may adopt under some circumstances state courts have upheld the law , with a state appeals court ruling in 1993 that the ban could be justified because homosexual parents are unlikely to be able to give heterosexual children sound dating advice but this is the first time a federal court has considered the ban the supreme court has said that states are required only to offer plausible rationales for laws that single out homosexuals florida officials have offered two judge james lawrence king of federal district court in miami rejected the first , that the law was a legitimate expression of public morality as it bears on the questions of what environments are best for children , and what groups of people are entitled to recognition as families the court , he wrote , cannot accept that moral disapproval of homosexuals or homosexuality serves a legitimate state interest but he accepted the second reason , that children are better off with married heterosexual couples children , the state s lawyers wrote , should be raised in homes with married mothers and fathers due to the stability provided by marriage and the contribution of male and female influences to childhood growth and development , including heterosexual modeling judge king accepted that and upheld the law he noted that the federal constitution is not a license for the courts to judge the wisdom , fairness or logic of legislative choices lynn dennis wardle , a law professor at brigham young university , said there was substantial justification for the law as a policy choice the gay couple involved in the florida case is on face value very appealing , mr wardle said i would still say that a mom and a dad would be better than those two men mr smith and mr skahen , who agreed to discuss their case on the condition that the boys not be named , say this ignores reality , as there is a shortage of interested married couples in florida , which has 3 , 500 children in foster care awaiting adoption if history is a guide , a quarter of them will be placed with single heterosexuals matthew coles , a lawyer with the american civil liberties union foundation , which represents the plaintiffs , said he would urge the appeals court to consider the plight of florida s children nobody was breaking down the doors to come in and take care of these kids , he said , referring to the two boys in key west these people have given these kids a childhood they never would have had if the state of florida had an ounce of decency , they would be trying to find more parents like them while the state has vigorously defended the adoption law , it also recently consented to a novel arrangement for the younger boy fashioned by a state judge here in december , the judge , sandra taylor , made mr smith and mr skahen the younger boy s permanent legal guardians she wrote that the men were model parents , that the boy is bonded and attached to them and is in a stable and nurturing environment he has progressed remarkably in school and is completely healthy , judge taylor wrote the boy , who is bighearted and talkative , learned something new at school not long ago , and he was eager to share it the other day standing with his right hand on his heart , he recited the pledge of allegiance , with grave seriousness then , for good measure , he sang the entirety of god bless america becoming his legal guardian , mr smith said , is a mysterious half loaf we have all of the responsibilities but none of the rights , he said he wondered , too , why the state would trust the couple with permanent legal custody of the boy but draw the line just short of adoption mr smith and mr skahen , who have been together for 11 years , have not told the boys that they have become the younger one s guardians , in part because the boys are too young to understand and in part because a quirk to the law appears to forbid a similar solution in the older boy s case and there is reason to think that he may be placed elsewhere any day now mr skahen said that when he booked a disney cruise for their family for june , he paid for trip insurance , just in case mr smith said their best hope for keeping their family intact was that the older boy was , like many of the children in foster care in florida , not quite what prospective parents were looking for nobody wants to adopt a 6yearold with developmental problems who is biracial , he said , bitterness tinged with hope he paused , because he had been too sweeping i do , he said photo daniel skahen , left , and wayne larue smith , a gay couple , with one of their two foster sons , whom they are in a court battle to

early in 1972 , george steinbrenner , a 41yearold cleveland native , thought that he and his partners had just become owners of the hometown indians we had a deal with jimmy stouffer , the elder of the stouffer children , steinbrenner recalled the other day , referring to the family that owned the indians we thought we had bought the indians and we were celebrating , and the next day we picked up the paper and saw that nick mileti had bought the team vernon stouffer was very close to my family but vernon made a deal with nick mileti because vernon stouffer was the owner , his deal counted , and so baseball history was written who knows what would have happened to steinbrenner had his deal been the one that counted \? would he have lasted longer than the five years mileti remained as the indians' owner \? would he , too , have succumbed to the dreary economics that for many years undermined the indians , a perennial loser \( 21 losing seasons in a 25year stretch \) \? no one knows what the outcome of a steinbrenner ownership of the indians would have been what we do know is that a year later steinbrenner and partners bought the yankees , and 30 years later , 30 years from last friday , to be exact , steinbrenner holds a unique place in major league baseball respect him or detest him , the 72yearold steinbrenner is the only owner from 1973 still on the job the other teams have had a total of 71 owners or ownership groups , and the yankees have had none put another way , in 30 years the other 29 teams , including six post1973 expansion teams , have had a combined 94 ownership groups , and the yankees have had one bud selig is the only active management person who preceded steinbrenner , and he is now the commissioner of baseball , no longer the milwaukee brewers' operating owner i 've had my ups and downs , i 've made a lot of mistakes , a few things i 've done right , steinbrenner said on the eve of the 30th anniversary of his purchase , a transaction , one of those 94 owners said , that rivals the purchase of manhattan from the indians about that purchase the price the steinbrenner group paid cbs has always been put at 10 million , but another figure , 88 million , has been cited why the discrepancy \? when we purchased the yankees , steinbrenner said , relating a piece of information that he either had never told or had been long forgotten , cbs owned a couple parking lots that the city had been trying to buy i sold the lots to the city for 12 million so the net for us was 88 when steinbrenner bought into major league baseball , he joined a group of men and one woman whose names were far better known than his , both for baseball and nonbaseball reasons among them were phil wrigley , walter o'malley , john fetzer , john galbreath , gussie busch , tom yawkey , charles bronfman , joan payson , gene autry , charles o finley and calvin griffith i was scared stiff at the first meeting i went to , steinbrenner related they said , 'you sit on this side this is where the american league sits' i look over and see the guy whose gum i had chewed since i was 5 years old walter o'malley said , 'the way we 're talking , mr steinbrenner is going to wonder why he ever got into this sport' but then o'malley , the imposing dodgers owner , made steinbrenner feel at home pointing to louis nippert of the cincinnati reds , o'malley said you see mr nippert sitting there \? he went to culver i'm a graduate of culver the bond was instant his fellow graduates of culver military academy in indiana would make the newcomer welcome steinbrenner agreed that his road would have been unpredictable had he bought the indians in 1972 nick mileti had a terrible time , he said cleveland was not new york i always remember the sinatra song , 'if you make it there , you can make it anywhere' that has a lot of meaning the rewards are tremendous on the upside steinbrenner has enjoyed the rewards in two different periods of his ownership , when he initially restored the yankees to championship status in the 70 s and in the current period of world series success , four championships in seven years however smart the decisions and judgments of the owner and his baseball people have been in those periods , they have been fueled by revenue that was available to the yankees but would not have been to the indians no cabletelevision outlet in cleveland has ever given the indians 4935 million over 12 years , as the yankees have earned that money was especially critical in the 90 s steinbrenner does not apologize for having had the revenue available to sign players like reggie jackson , rich gossage , dave winfield , david cone , mike mussina and jason giambi but in the last decade the yankees have moved beyond free agency they have built a minor league system that has further separated them from the masses marvin goldklang is in a unique position to understand the significance of both major league and minor league operations he has been a limited partner in the yankees' ownership since 1979 , and he owns minor league teams independent of the yankees
traveling with american troops in world war ii , the war correspondent ernie pyle brought home the horror in unadorned prose there is nothing left behind but the remains the lifeless debris , the sunshine and the flowers , and utter silence , he wrote from normandy in 1944 an amateur who wanders in this vacuum at the rear of a battle has a terrible sense of loneliness everything is dead the men , the machines , the animals and you alone are left alive pyle himself was killed in action and mourned as a hero combat journalism has changed since then , but so has warfare technology has significantly altered how wars are waged and for how long , the tools reporters use and how audiences receive the news edward r murrow , standing on rooftops in london watching german bombs fall , sent word pictures by radio today s television correspondents transmit live images now there are multitudes of channels , as well as the internet , barraging the home front with information and supposition , some of it reliable , some not but has this made war more comprehensible or less \? is the war correspondence any better \? listening to old murrow broadcasts is a reminder that war has always been a chaotic , confusing and dangerous story , seen by the reporter through a narrow lens murrow brought clarity to his listeners through intelligent assessment of what he saw a row of automobiles , with stretchers racked on the roof like skis , standing outside of bombed buildings , he said in 1940 , describing the bombing of london a man pinned under wreckage where a broken gas main sears his arms and face today s television broadcasts unfold not like narratives , edited for sense , context and continuity , but like animated cubist paintings with sound and multiple images appearing simultaneously back in the middle ages when i covered wars you had reflection time you were n't winging it , said morley safer of cbs s 60 minutes , who covered the israeliegyptian conflict in suez in 1956 and the vietnam war in the 1960 s now , suddenly you 're on , and you have to say something you can only describe what you can see in the very , very narrow field of vision that you have they have a hell of a lot more people covering these live wars than we had but we had time to check things out a keyhole view in all wars the field correspondents by necessity offer a keyhole view , its range determined by access and censorship pyle , like other correspondents in world war ii , was required to submit dispatches to military censors , while today s reporters are not \( although the reporters traveling with troops are subject to restrictions \) but the context of world war ii a global war with a moral imperative against a clear enemy , where the reporter and the soldier were both unlikely to question the rationale fell apart quickly in vietnam the conflict produced widespread dissent at home and changed the perspective and even the role of the war reporter skepticism replaced solidarity , and reporters made their reputations by digging out the contradictions of the war , not by making heroes out of the combatants in the iraq war , the pentagon s policy of assigning journalists to live with the troops , or embedding them , could be seen as carrying on the tradition of ernie pyle or as a method to manage the news and restore the sympathy between reporter and soldier the policy , some critics argue , is an effort by the pentagon to weaponize the press , to make it a cheerleader again for american soldiers and to demoralize an enemy with live pictures of american might civilian correspondents first began reporting on war during the crimean war , from 1853 to 1856 war reporters have been cheerleaders and mythmakers as well as provocateurs and skeptics , depending on how they use their positions as the public s main intermediary between official statements and what they see for themselves in world war ii , and the spanish civil war before it , war reporting became the stuff of legend and literature for writers like ernest hemingway and john steinbeck , as well as for journalists like murrow and pyle that tradition continued into vietnam , which became the proving ground for a generation of american writers being a war correspondent has been difficult and dangerous but also romantic , and romanticized michael herr , in dispatches , a book drawn from his vietnam reporting for esquire magazine , wrote of the press corps reporting on the war , it included young marrieds , all kinds of girl reporters , a lot of europeans , the ivyleagueinasia crowd , the danang bunch , the straights and the heads , formals and funkies , old hands \( many of whom were very young \) and even some tourists , people who wanted to go somewhere to screw around for a while and happened to choose the war a similar variety has gathered now the veterans of other wars , the gonzo adventurers and the geewhiz commentators who seem surprised to be seeing bombs explode it is too early to tell what kind of job they are doing but as in other wars , death is an occupational hazard four journalists have died two britons , an australian and , on thursday , michael kelly , the editoratlarge for the atlantic monthly and a columnist for the washington post he was a former reporter for the new york times shaping the news
wallkill , ny , aug 7 about nine years ago , a chestnut thoroughbred named creme de la fete was assigned a new groom , efrain silva he gave the horse antibiotics , scrubbed his mane and forelegs ,

take care of you , creme you watch' through a partnership with the thoroughbred retirement foundation , the nation s largest and oldest thoroughbredrescue operation , the prison has operated a work program for the past 18 years for inmates to care for the former champions , runnersup and perennial losers most of them no longer have practical economic value other than the 600 a meat buyer might pay before they come to a pasture in upstate new york to live out their years some of the horses had been discarded , left for dead in their stables before being rescued by the foundation and turned over to the program s director , jim tremper , and his 18inmate crew if we did n't get to them , they would be pet food or on someone s plate in europe , mr tremper said he said he had seen the thoroughbreds change the prisoners' lives as much as they changed the horses' especially the more violent guys , mr tremper said a lot of them have intimidated people with their size in their lives , and they seem to respect the power and strength of the animal it humbles many of them the program is less rehabilitation therapy than hard labor on many afternoons still , the inmates who care for the horses need to exhibit good behavior , usually for two years , and have three years or less before their earliest release date to be assigned to the program wallkill is their last or nexttolast place of incarceration before parole at wallkill , amid meadows strewn with clover and dandelion and the looming guard tower of the shawangunk correctional facility , an adjacent maximumsecurity prison , men who had never seen a horse now feed and wash quick call , a wellmannered saratoga favorite who won at least one race two hours north of wallkill every year from 1987 through 1990 in 86 starts , he won 16 races and earned 807 , 817 yo , quick got to be tired of all this fame , said lorenzo parker , tugging gently on the stud shank by which the horse is led we did reader s digest last week mr parker , who is serving time for an attempted robbery conviction , walked the horse toward a burbling hose on a humid , sticky afternoon , stroking quick call s chin if you never make a million in life , at least you can stand next to a million , he said promised road , the first horse rescued by the foundation in 1984 , is still at wallkill a gentle , regal bay at 27 years old klabin s gold , son of strike the gold and splendid launch , resides up the hill few horses represent the unseemly side of the industry more than he does klabin s gold was found 100 pounds underweight with three fractured legs in december in his stall at suffolk downs , a minor track in boston his hooves were so long that the horseshoes had imbedded themselves in the bottom of his feet when the farrier came to take the shoes off , he had to gradually work the foot back to a normal shape , said diana pikulski , executive director of the thoroughbred retirement foundation none of the prisoners knew of klabin s gold s past , just as the horse has no conception of the inmates' past neither of them care , mr tremper said klabin s gold had won the 1998 hirsch jacobs stakes at pimlico and ended up with career earnings of 346 , 179 in 55 starts , he won 11 times , finished second 13 times and finished third 7 times he last raced in march 2002 , finishing last of seven in a 6 , 250 claimer his story is like most of the horses here who stopped winning , placing or showing banker s jet , who earned close to 1 million , was found standing up to his knees in manure at a riding ranch in upstate new york before he was rescued and found a better life in a pasture of inmates concerns about the fate of retired thoroughbreds grew last month when it was reported that ferdinand , the 1986 kentucky derby and 1987 breeders' cup classic champion , was slaughtered last year in japan , where his carcass was most likely used for pet food exceller met a similar end he outran affirmed and seattle slew to win the 1978 jockey club gold cup , becoming the only horse to defeat two triple crown winners but after a failed breeding career , exceller was killed in 1997 and sold for horse meat in sweden
if , as some say , writing a book is like having a baby , then the architect peter eisenman might just feel as if he has been pregnant for 40 years now 71 , he first contemplated writing about the italian architect giuseppe terragni when he was just a graduate student decades passed when the project was all but ignored but through all those years , a book was quietly gestating this month , it entered the world , bearing the name giuseppe terragni transformations decompositions critiques many architects of mr eisenman s stature amuse themselves with profitable side projects like designing discount kitchenware or overseeing coffeetable showcases for their own work but there is nothing amusing about this project , nor is it likely to be profitable at 304 heavily diagramed pages , it is an obsessive work about an obscure rationalist architect , written in unforgivingly dense prose even its author describes it as exhausting reading , like root canal with a linebacker s chin and cropped white hair , mr eisenman today finds himself as busy as he s ever been his studio in manhattan s west 20 s is brimming with cardboard models of a football stadium he s building in phoenix and a vast city of culture complex that s planned for spain having waited until he was 50 to land his first major commission and accrued considerable debt along the way he s delighted to have so many buildings under way but he says that this book , in all its imposing inaccessibility , is perhaps his most important professional accomplishment i truly believe that the great heroes that create the history of architecture are people who take risks , mr eisenman said , and write to tell about it mr eisenman saw the work of giuseppe terragni for the first time while pursuing a doctorate at cambridge , england , in the early 1960 s he was , by his own description , a simple kid from new jersey , a savage i had been trained in america , where the architecture was primitive , he said i knew nothing what he lacked in expertise he made up for in confidence and charm , however , and in his first year at cambridge , he was given a master s course to teach after he somehow pulled it off , a professor gave him an encyclopedia of modern architecture as a gift it included two buildings , the casa del fascio \( 1936 \) and the casa giulianifrigerio \( 1943 \) , that terragni built in como , in northern italy the latter , in particular , struck him like divine inspiration it was just this beautiful , pristine white cube that had a certain aura , mr eisenman recalled it was n't cubist , it was n't modern it was between classical and something else he included an analysis of it in his phd dissertation the fact that the casa del fascio was , as the name suggests , built for mussolini s fascist government did not deter mr eisenman you can never say that anything is apolitical , but this work deserved to be situated outside the historical context , he said i should add that i see mussolini as separate from hitler , although certainly things did sour in italy terragni s life had cinematic sweep he was born in 1904 into a prominent family in como his brother was the fascist mayor , and his chief architectural patron was one of mussolini s mistresses but as terragni was just getting started in his career , world war ii intervened he was sent off to the russian front , where the italians collapsed near stalingrad in the chaotic retreat that ensued , terragni produced drawings of the suffering he witnessed , and then went mad he spent his last days roaming the streets of como , before dying at 39 mr eisenman uncovered all of this in the course of his early research , which included rummaging around in the attic of terragni s old studio none of it , however , found its way into the book instead of simply popularizing the work of an overlooked innovator , mr eisenman decided that he would use terragni s work as a way of organizing his own thinking about architecture real life conspired against that heady goal , however mr eisenman returned to the united states in 1963 and took a series of teaching jobs he got married , had children , got divorced he started a research institute in new york , ran it for years , then shut it he organized museum shows and wrote many articles , a number of them in the deeply theoretical root canal mode he became a master , he said , of starting everything and finishing nothing he worked on the terragni book fitfully , employing small armies to help him with the drawings , including a young architect named daniel libeskind in the late 1970 s , he commissioned the italian theorist manfredo tafuri to write an introduction publication seemed close but mr eisenman was easily distracted so much so that his early clients grew frustrated by his scattershot attention , and opportunities to build often slipped out of his grasp after establishing himself as one of the world s preeminent paper architects a designer whose work exists only in words and images he finally got a string of sizable commissions , including the heralded wexner center in columbus , ohio , which was completed in 1989 based on the controversial theory that art should be challenged by its environment rather than displayed neutrally , the museum secured for mr eisenman a place among the most highly regarded american architects
the folks who run the casinos in atlantic city are none too happy with governor mcgreevey , an avowed ally whose budget now seeks to dip into their relatively deep pockets if this is what we can expect from our friends , i ca n't wait to see what our enemies have in store , wallace r barr , the chief executive of park place , the city s biggest casino revenue producer , said this tax plan is a backalley mugging the governor wants to raise the tax on casino revenue to 10 percent from 8 percent and to add a tax on rooms , meals and services that are given away , mostly to high rollers a 7 percent hotel tax is also in the budget plan , but since atlantic city already has a hotel tax , it is not certain the new tax would apply there the governor s office contends these steps will raise 135 million to help cover the state s projected 5 billion budget deficit the casino association of new jersey , which represents the 11 local casinohotels , says the figure may well be 200 million mr barr is livid about the tax on freebies , saying that it unfairly singles out the casino industry maybe i overlooked it , he said in a statement , but i did n't see a recommendation for a tax on free drug samples from new jersey pharmaceutical companies or a plan to tax twoforone hamburgers pfizer and mcdonald s should watch out the day after the budget proposal was announced , the stocks of the six public companies that own atlantic city casinos plunged 500 million in value but a spokesman for the association said the casinos would probably report a 5 percent increase in revenue over last january in their next filing with the casino control commission robert strauss photo wallace r barr , chief of the park place casino , says let them tax hamburgers and drug samples
paterson gracias , familia ! that is how juan cartagena thanked the audience at passaic county community college here in paterson last weekend , where his band , segunda quimbamba , played for a puerto rican heritage month celebration it was natural for mr cartagena , who grew up in jersey city , to address the auditorium as family his group , one of about half a dozen in new jersey specializing in the traditional puerto rican genres known as bomba and plena , is full of his relatives and childhood friends many relatives of members of the group were also in the audience but at a segunda quimbamba performance , where audience participation of either singing or dancing is encouraged , it is easy to think of everyone as kin this wednesday at 8 pm , at grace church in jersey city , segunda quimbamba will be the host at new jersey s biggest annual bomba and plena event other groups from the state and beyond will perform to support g iro and maraca , the bomba and plena journal that mr cartagena publishes from the segunda quimbamba folkloric center , based on the first floor of his family s jersey city home tickets are 12 at the door new jersey s puerto rican population grew 26 percent between 1990 and 2000 , as new york city s puerto ricans drifted to the suburbs with the increasing numbers came the possibility of bigger audiences for traditional musical forms like plena and bomba , which , unlike salsa , have not been major commercial successes since the mid20th century but are staples of puerto rican celebrations both genres are drumbased descendants of west african music bomba is an older form it was performed by slaves in puerto rico possibly as early as the 17th century it is traditionally played on large barrelshaped drums called bombas , accompanied by a maraca and wooden sticks called cuas mr cartagena plays the bomba the lyrics to bomba songs are usually repetitive and trancelike , less important than the pulsating drums in its most distinctive , crowdpleasing characteristic , a female dancer swathed in a multilayered traditional dress challenges the lead drummer to follow her lead , turning the dancerfollowsmusic convention on its head plena developed later in urban and coastal areas in puerto rico the rhythm is different , as are the instruments panderetas , or tambourines without the cymbals congas and g iro , a scraping instrument made from a gourd plena lyrics are narrative , and the music is often called a singing newspaper , because long before 24hour cable networks , musicians passed news from town to town by plena plena remains the standard music of puerto rican protests today mr cartagena has played during protests in front of the white house and the united nations for most of the musicians in the new jersey groups , the music offers a connection to island roots for me personally , it kind of opened up the door to more conscious awareness of my cultural background , said miriam felix , a singer and dancer with segunda quimbamba ms felix , 43 , studied music in college but knew little of plena or bomba until she joined the group , she explained although a few new york and puerto rico plena and bomba groups have albums out , none of the new jersey groups make a profit it s all a shoestring and a prayer and some scotch tape , said mr cartagena , 47 , who has a day job as general counsel to the community service society in manhattan , a nonprofit group involved in antipoverty work the new jersey musicians say bomba and plena are not commercially viable these days in part because of their association with african roots bomba , because it s african , suffers , mr cartagena said anything that s african in puerto rico has two strikes against it both musical forms have been associated with santeria , the hybrid african and christian practice , and thus historically were discouraged by the catholic church although plena is not as obviously african , it suffers a similar fate , said carlos maldonado , leader of the newarkbased group plena dulce \( sweet plena \) it has always been pushed to the side , because it was black music , he said his bandmate , wil vega , noted that some people dislike plena because of its traditional use as protest music segunda quimbamba was formed about 10 years ago when mr cartagena , who had studied african percussion at dartmouth college , gathered together friends and family in jersey city to prepare plenas for parrandas , or christmas celebrations similar to caroling the informal group continued playing together it caught a break when roberto cepeda , a bronx resident who is from a famous bombaplaying family in puerto rico , agreed to join it and mentor the musicians son de plena of trenton , which will also appear at the jersey city event , was formed in 1999 by luis ortiz , who plays the pandereta and has a day job painting cars mr ortiz , 45 , grew up in puerto rico and boston he said that when he moved to trenton in the late 1980 s , he noticed the absence of plena music there , while back in boston , plena was everywhere , especially in the park near his home in the jamaica plain section of the city in trenton , he said , traditional puerto rican music meant j baro songs , played with string instruments his children suggested that he start his own group for plena son de plena s name is a play on words it means both sound of plena and they are of plena
perfect i'm not boomer on beer , brawls , backaches , and baseball by david wells with chris kreski illustrated 415 pages william morrow 2595 had david wells not cast doubt on his own credibility as an author by altering some of the statements that appeared in galleys of his new baseball memoir in the wake of a media storm , he pulled a charles i was misquoted barkley , telling reporters that he 'd failed to go through it with a finetooth comb readers of this 400pluspage book might well have wondered what all the fuss in yankee land was about the book has some salty things to say about wells s 16odd years in the big leagues , but they are profane , for the most part , in a goodhumored ozzy osbourne sort of way for that matter , they are buried beneath reams \( and reams \) of often numbing detail about this pitcher s peregrinations through the major leagues with half a dozen teams his struggles with back problems , elbow problems and gout problems and his taste for headbanging music , latenight partying and burgers and beer wells is up front about his likes and dislikes the former mets manager bobby valentine and the former reds owner marge schott , in particular , come in for slashing putdowns yet there s little in the rants and riffs in this book that the brash , bigmouthed boomer has n't said before in a 1999 playboy interview he was considerably more vitriolic about roger clemens \( for whom he was traded to the toronto blue jays in 1999 before returning to the bronx last year \) than he is in these pages and in a 2001 hbo interview he talked about being horribly hung over when he pitched his perfect game for the yankees in 1998 while the yankees fined wells 100 , 000 for tarnishing the team s image with the book , his love affair with the bronx bombers is actually a through line in the memoir playing for other teams , he says at one point , is like having a crush on cinderella , but dating her ugly stepsisters what s more , his supposed dissing of yankee teammates has been wildly overblown yes , he makes a lewd comment about the famous incident in which roger clemens beaned the mets star mike piazza , but he also praises clemens as easily the best righthander of our generation and his remarks about his teammate mike mussina that they do n't hang out a lot are in no way derogatory he puts mussina high on his dreamteam list of starters as for wells s comments about the widespread use of steroids in baseball , his estimates are lower than some recently made by others the former national league most valuable player ken caminiti told sports illustrated that he suspected that half of all major league players were using performanceenhancing drugs , while the former allstar jose canseco put the number as high as 85 percent in advance galleys of his book wells stated as of right now , i 'd estimate that somewhere between 25 and 40 percent of all major leaguers are juiced in the finished book , this figure has been downgraded to somewhere between 10 and 25 percent a reference to the amphetamine crowd has also been removed , as has a footnote about players' use of ritalin such changes suggest several possibilities , none of them good that wells failed to review material prepared by his collaborator before galleys were sent out under his byline that his taste for hyperbole \( honestly , i 'd be roommates with charles manson if he could pull an outside curve \) seeped into his memory cells or that he decided , post media uproar , to pull some of his punches of course wells has been called a loose cannon and loudmouth before in the age of the buttonedup , corporate athlete , boomer whom a former teammate , tino martinez , once affectionately described as being from mars has long been a favorite of new york s bleacher creatures and fodder for the tabloids there were lots of stories , reiterated in this book , about his unorthodox childhood his mom , attitude annie , ran with a hell s angels crowd , and the bikers would regularly show up at young david s little league games in southern california and long before he 'd joined the elite ranks of pitchers to throw a perfect game , wells was making headlines for his offthefield antics , from breaking his hand in a street brawl a month before he was supposed to report to yankees training camp in 1997 , to spending 35 , 000 for a cap that once belonged to his hero babe ruth , to mouthing off to the radio shock jock howard stern about the yankees' chances against the padres in the 1998 world series in these pages wells uses his colorful language to give the reader a lockerroom view of baseball , from the minor leagues and winter ball to the world series , in an era when big money and free agency have made the sport more peripatetic than ever as jim bouton did in his controversial 1970 book ball four , wells spends a lot of time talking about the sort of stuff that baseball mythologists would rather ignore , like groupies , drug use and practical jokes stuff that should come as less of a surprise in this day of reality television but like bouton , he also chronicles the dedication , physical grit and camaraderie that help sustain players in their short careers such passages , however , are scattered sparingly throughout a seemingly unedited book a big , fat mess of a book that tells you more than you ever wanted to know about the alsoran years of the toronto blue jays and the condition of wells s aching back , a book that would have sold a lot fewer copies without the controversy of the last few weeks photo

it is an annual fight , new york city s battle to find dollars to pay for its summer youth employment program each year , well before the season approaches , the department of employment sounds the alarm that money is scarce and that thousands of jobs will probably be in jeopardy but this year , the program appears to be up against more than just its usual fiscal troubles the program itself has become a problem , some city council leaders and youth employment groups say in an effort to adhere to mayor michael r bloomberg s demand that city agencies do more with less , the department of employment radically retooled the way it distributes grants to social services groups that hire the youths with a reduced budget of 55 million just more than a third of what the city budgeted for it last year it plans to employ only 5 , 600 teenagers and young adults this summer , compared with 36 , 000 last year but the way the department has revamped the program , which serves primarily poor youths , has drawn heavy criticism as part of the reorganization , the city was carved into eight regions , selecting one contractor for each area instead of the dozens used in the past groups competing for contracts this year were asked to take over administrative duties formerly handled by the department s staff and to pair up with at least two smaller organizations with which they would share financing under the program , teenagers are paid minimum wage for seven weeks and placed in jobs at public and nonprofit settings the agency s hope was that by pairing up contractors and shifting administrative work to them , the city would cut costs but still reach out to a cross section of children at a city council hearing on jan 31 , the city s employment commissioner , betty b wu , declined to address criticism about the overhauled bidding process , saying lawyers had forbidden her to speak about a process that was still under way but council officials and youth employment groups say the program s new bidding process pits entire neighborhoods against one another , threatening to alienate thousands of children who , while economically eligible , do not live in one of the areas in each region that have been designated highneed , ones in which at least 20 percent of the residents fall below the new york city poverty level seventy percent of the youths selected must live in the highneed areas it is galactically stupid the way doe has set this up , said lewis a fidler , a brooklyn councilman and chairman of the youth services committee it s as clear a plan for failure as i 've ever seen part of the problem , mr fidler said , is that bidders had only six weeks to form partnerships with other groups and submit proposals the department is currently reviewing 31 applications i represent southern brooklyn , he said and i know for a fact the chances that the orthodox jews , the asians and the haitians all found each other in a single successful bid are virtually nil yet under this process , only one of them might be selected to represent their region what happens when it s the asians and none of their partners are haitians or orthodox jews \? doe is going to wind up necessarily excluding entire neighborhoods and groups of kids from the summer youth program others say the formula the department used to determine how many jobs would be distributed to each borough has proved equally problematic they say that a child living in a family with income below the poverty level but not in a designated highneed area will have fewer chances of finding employment this is a disaster waiting to happen , said helen diane foster , a bronx councilwoman it s hard enough to find the money for these jobs now doe is pitting poor kids and against poor kids previously , the city conducted interviews for the program and handled the enrollment and application processing , while the contractors identified eligible applicants of the 5 , 600 jobs the department is currently proposing financing for , 1 , 242 are expected to be assigned to two brooklyn contractors 1 , 558 to two contractors in the bronx 948 to one manhattan contractor 655 to one queens contractor and 395 to one contractor in staten island an eighth contractor will be awarded 847 jobs that are to go to children throughout the city mr fidler , as the council s youth services committee chairman , has asked the department to abandon its reorganized program and to work with contractors that have been used in the past a department spokesman said it was considering the committee s recommendations if at the last minute the cavalry comes over the hill with something approaching reasonable funding , mr fidler said , and runnerup bidders are told in late june that they are now in , who could possibly believe they could do what s necessary to hire young people \? all of the changes have caused worry and frustration among youth employment groups florence limaldonado , assistant executive director for the chinese american planning council , submitted one of the 31 proposals under consideration she teamed up with 10 smaller groups , primarily africanamerican and hispanic ones , hoping to make her contract reach a variety of children and stand out even if i get a contract , i still have a problem , she said the money they want to give for administrative work , 300 per child , is not enough to cover the added work and share with subcontractors we do n't expect 100 percent funding when the city is having budget trouble , but this process is too complicated to make anyone happy kofi boateng , executive director of the national puerto rican forum in the tremont section of the bronx , said he found the process too frustrating even to apply in the past , his organization has relied on financing from the department to help employ about 300 teenagers each year it is too much of a cutthroat situation now , he said everyone is grandstanding , trying to muscle one another out because the plate is suddenly smaller and the hands trying to eat from it are many in the meantime , mr boateng said , he is doing the only thing he can we 're beginning to tell the children we 're sorry , that they might have to look elsewhere , he said what else can we do \?
united nations , march 7 with an americanled war on iraq appearing ever more likely , the united states and britain said today that they would urge the security council to vote next week on a new resolution that would give iraq until march 17 to disarm but france , russia and china , which hold veto power , swiftly dismissed the new proposal the new move to unite the world s deeply divided powers came after the chief united nations weapons inspectors bluntly if quietly contradicted some american and british assertions about iraqi violations and drew sharp rebuttals from secretary of state colin l powell and the british foreign minister , jack straw mohamed elbaradei , chief of the international atomic energy agency , said that a report which had earlier been identified as coming from british intelligence that iraq had tried to purchase uranium from niger was based on fake documents both dr elbaradei and hans blix said that under the threat of force , iraqi cooperation was increasing , though belatedly mr blix noted , one can hardly avoid the impression that after a period of somewhat reluctant cooperation , there has been an acceleration of initiatives from the iraqi side since the end of january to complete inspections properly even with a proactive iraqi attitude , he said , would not take years , nor weeks , but months with foreign ministers and the weapons inspectors converging in emotional debate on iraq for the third time in the past month , none of the six undecided countries on the 15nation security council tipped their hand as to how they might vote they pleaded instead for the five powers that dominate the body to find some way to find common ground excerpts , pages a89 ambassador john d negroponte of the united states said last night that a vote could come as early as tuesday even if the resolution fails to pass , he said , the united states believes it has ample legal authority to go to war under the previous resolutions the united states and britain remained unsure of collecting the nine votes they need for passage even of the amended resolution , said another council diplomat who supports it this evening , one dejected diplomat left the meeting shaking his head and saying , we are headed for a disaster , although he added he could not be sure which way the vote would go the french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , scornfully rejected the new resolution by imposing a deadline of only a few days , would we merely be seeking a pretext for war \? he asked as a permanent member of the security council , i will say it again france will not allow a resolution to pass that authorizes the automatic use of force the russian and chinese foreign ministers followed suit the assessment from the weapons inspectors took account of iraq s cooperation since nov 27 , when inspections in iraq resumed for the first time since 1998 , after the security council passed a unanimous resolution in addition to casting severe doubt on the reported iraqi attempt to buy uranium in niger , dr elbaradei said that there is no indication that iraq has attempted to import aluminum tubes for use in centrifuge enrichment of uranium into weaponsgrade material for months , american officials have cited iraq s importation of these tubes as evidence that mr hussein s scientists have been seeking to develop a nuclear capability mr blix reiterated that the destruction of 34 al samoud 2 missiles in the past week constitutes a substantial measure of disarmament indeed , the first since the middle of the 1990 s we are not watching the breaking of toothpicks in response , secretary of state colin l powell made a pointed reference to dr elbaradei s agency , the international atomic energy agency , saying , as we all know , in 1991 the iaea was just days away from determining that iraq did not have a nuclear program we soon found out otherwise turning to mr blix s assessment of iraq s recent moves , mr powell said , i do n't know if we should call these things 'initiatives' whatever they are , iraq s small steps are certainly not initiatives he added , i know these are not toothpicks , but real missiles , but the problem is , we do n't know how many missiles there are , how many toothpicks there are while the charged exchanges took place in and around the council chamber , and were beamed to television sets around the world , a united nations official elsewhere in the new york headquarters building reported that large sections of the fence on the kuwaitiraq border were being cut away local workmen under contract to the kuwaiti government told united nations officials that they had been instructed to finish cutting 35 entryways by march 15 earlier , united nations officials in kuwait encountered armed men in civilian clothes in the same area who identified themselves as united states marines and said they were testing communications gear at the council today , both mr powell and mr straw refused to be put on the defensive , as they were during the last public faceoff of foreign ministers on feb 14 mr straw , in particular , made a frontal assault on his french colleague , saying dominique also said the choice before us was disarmament by peace or disarmament by war dominique , that is a false choice
gulag a history by anne applebaum illustrated 677 pp new york doubleday 35 in the introduction to this important book , anne applebaum , a columnist for the washington post , ponders why the soviet and nazi regimes are treated so differently in the popular imagination young people who would never purchase nazi regalia think nothing of sporting tshirts emblazoned with the communist hammer and sickle yet , as applebaum shows , the soviet killing machine was certainly equal to its nazi counterpart wisely , she avoids wandering into the muck of comparing the two totalitarian terror apparatus to decide which was worse , but she argues that at a very deep level , the two systems are related ever since aleksandr solzhenitsyn published his magisterial threevolume history of the soviet concentrationcamp network , the gulag archipelago , in the early 1970 s , the grim details of life in what he called the soviet sewage system have been well known from arrest by the soviet secret police through interrogation , to deportation and hard labor , the lifeanddeath cycle of the gulag is a familiar story other witnesses , like varlam shalamov and evgeniya ginzburg , have also brilliantly described prisoners' constant struggle against hunger , cold and disease so a great deal of what applebaum writes about in gulag a history has been told before but that does not lessen her achievement when solzhenitsyn s volumes first appeared they had an enormous impact yet he soon fell from favor , dismissed by some as an anticommunist crank , by others as a nationalist antisemite as documents from the soviet archives have now shown , much of this defamation campaign was financed and encouraged by the kgb but the attacks had their effect a group of socalled revisionist historians , who dominated the study of the stalin years in the united states and britain during the 1980 s , waged a war against the portrayal of the soviet union by solzhenitsyn and other antisoviet memoirists instead of the slave empire , these historians stressed the country s rapid economic development and urbanization under stalin , which supposedly fostered widespread support for the regime none questioned the existence of the gulag rather , they minimized its place in soviet life and denied that the population as a whole was ever terrorized applebaum s book weighs in heavily in support of solzhenitsyn on almost every point , and her account is backed not only by a careful use of the vast memoir literature but also by a thorough mining of the longclosed soviet archives most important , she supports solzhenitsyn s central argument that the gulag was not some incidental stalinist accretion to lenin s visionary concept of socialism the cancer of police terror was embedded in the original dna of lenin s creation , an integral part of the soviet system , in applebaum s words under lenin , the first concentration camps were created the first mass executions were carried out he bequeathed to his successor a wellfunctioning police state applebaum estimates that from 1929 through 1953 the years of high stalinism more than 18 million people coursed through the camps , with a further six million being exiled to remote regions of the soviet union the vast majority of these people were guilty of nothing an orwellian logic underlay the whole enterprise as one police investigator explained to his victim we never arrest anyone who is not guilty and even if you were n't guilty , we ca n't release you , because then people would say that we are picking up innocent people particularly useful is applebaum s account of the camps during world war ii it was precisely at this time that the system reached its peak of lethality fully a quarter of the inmates perished during 1942 , but the appetite of the security forces was so insatiable that the gulag s population dropped less than 20 percent following the war , whole new categories of inmates flooded into the camps german pow s , anticommunists from the western borderlands or from the new soviet empire in eastern europe little known in the west , some 600 , 000 japanese troops fell into soviet hands , forced to labor for years after the cessation of hostilities only a fraction ever returned home stalin also punished with deportation entire nationalities chechens , ingush and crimean tatars notably ostensibly for collaboration with the nazis but , in fact , applebaum argues persuasively , to eliminate nationalist resistance to moscow one great difference distinguished the soviet and german systems there was no soviet equivalent of the death camps people sentenced to death in the soviet union were generally shot before entering the camp network applebaum estimates these victims at just under one million during the stalin years instead , soviet prisoners were expected to earn their keep by contributing to the creation of soviet socialism they mined gold , felled timber , dug canals or lay rails , most often in harsh areas to which free labor could never be enticed by the outbreak of war in 1941 , the gulag was the single largest employer in the world
buena , nj , july 24 when millie guzman heard a loud horn honk outside her house on route 40 tuesday night , she was a bit surprised to see a yellow school bus creeping by on a warm july evening she was even more surprised to see who was behind the wheel her 9yearold neighbor , who had just stolen the bus from a service garage and driven into town to show off his prize he wanted us to all get on , said millie , 13 , who lives just up the block from the boy he let go of the wheel , and was beeping and waving at us he could have killed somebody she was not the only one worried about the boy described by the police today as a very small 9yearold , about three and a half feet tall whom officers caught up with after he had taken a 10minute cruise down us route 40 and through the narrow streets of his neighborhood the boy , whom the police did not identify because of his age , has become a familiar figure in this rural south jersey borough , which the police say was a quiet place until he began borrowing wheels last week it was a 1991 ford taurus , which the boy drove out of an apartment complex parking lot and down the block before neighbors stopped him , the police said before that , they said , it was a riding lawnmower , which he took from a neighbor on bache street and drove down the middle of the road , dumping it in a grove of trees and then there are the 20 or more bicycles he has stolen , according to the borough police chief , who said the boy has had more than 70 runins with the law since moving to town about a year ago day work has taken on a whole new meaning , said the chief , douglas adams here in buena \( pronounced byoona \) , a typical day for the ninemember police force used to mean responding to a few traffic violations , a complaint about someone trying to pass a bad check or some disturbances at the local bar but since this boy moved to the eightsquaremile community , chief adams said , he has created a whole lot of usage of manhours everybody chuckles about it at first , he said of the bus episode but we 're just so thankful that nobody got hit , no property was damaged and none of our officers got hurt a halfdozen of the boy s neighbors said today that they had grown wary of him , having been victims or knowing someone who had connie rodriguez , who lives along the route where the boy drove on tuesday , said she was not home then but when told about the runaway bus , she immediately guessed who was in the driver s seat i ca n't believe what that boy s doing , she said he needs help if somebody does n't get to him pretty soon , he s going to do something drastic after his busdriving stint , the boy was taken to a juvenile detention center in egg harbor , but he was back at home by wednesday , the police said chief adams said that while the police have charged the boy with many crimes , the system never seems able to hold him the boy is in need of attention , supervision and counseling , or something bad is going to happen , the chief said he 'll steal something , and somebody s not going to care that he s 9 years old he 'll end up getting beaten up or worse today , a group of the boy s relatives who were unloading groceries from a van behind the twofamily house where the boy lives said they did not want to talk about him an elderly woman said , he s fine another woman shouted to a reporter , do n't come back here again a neighbor , cecelia bonner , who is an aide at an alternative school the boy attends , said he had always been respectful to her , but he s got problems chief adams said the boy had managed to drive the bus with some skill , maneuvering through narrow streets that school buses normally do not try to travel after the boy passed his family s house , the chief said , relatives gave chase on foot until the police stopped him on route 40 but if driving the bus was a challenge , taking it was easy school bus no 38 , along with 13 other buses from the buena regional school district , spends its downtime at battelini s garage on route 40 , where dom battelini said leaving the keys in the ignition had long been the routine for 50 years , we never took the keys out , mr battelini said if a bus breaks down , then somebody drives out and just picks up another one of course , now we do n't leave the keys in photo a boy from buena , nj , stole this buena regional school district bus on tuesday night and drove it down route 40 until the police stopped him \( david hunsinger for the new york times \) \( pg b5 \) map of new jersey highlighting buena a 9yearold took a school bus out for a drive on tuesday night \( pg b5 \)

some nonrevisionist history on oct 8 , 2002 , knight ridder newspapers reported on intelligence officials who charge that the administration squelches dissenting views , and that intelligence analysts are under intense pressure to produce reports supporting the white house s argument that saddam poses such an immediate threat to the united states that preemptive military action is necessary one official accused the administration of pressuring analysts to cook the intelligence books none of the dozen other officials the reporters spoke to disagreed the skepticism of these officials has been vindicated so have the concerns expressed before the war by military professionals like gen eric shinseki , the army chief of staff , about the resources required for postwar occupation but as the bad news comes in , those who promoted this war have responded with a concerted effort to smear the messengers issues of principle aside , the invasion of a country that had n't attacked us and did n't pose an imminent threat has seriously weakened our military position of the army s 33 combat brigades , 16 are in iraq this leaves us ill prepared to cope with genuine threats moreover , military experts say that with almost twothirds of its brigades deployed overseas , mainly in iraq , the army s readiness is eroding normal doctrine calls for only one brigade in three to be deployed abroad , while the other two retrain and refit and the war will have devastating effects on future recruiting by the reserves a widely circulated photo from iraq shows a sign in the windshield of a military truck that reads , one weekend a month , my ass to top it all off , our insistence on launching a war without un approval has deprived us of useful allies george bush claims to have a huge coalition , but only 7 percent of the coalition soldiers in iraq are nonamerican and administration pleas for more help are sounding increasingly plaintive how serious is the strain on our military \? the brookings institution military analyst michael o'hanlon , who describes our volunteer military as one of the best military institutions in human history , warns that the bush administration will risk destroying that accomplishment if they keep on the current path but instead of explaining what happened to the al qaeda link and the nuclear program , in the last few days a series of hawkish pundits have accused those who ask such questions of aiding the enemy here s frank gaffney jr in the national post somewhere , probably in iraq , saddam hussein is gloating he can only be gratified by the feeding frenzy of recriminations , secondguessing and political power plays signs of declining popular appreciation of the legitimacy and necessity of the efforts of america s armed forces will erode their morale similarly , the enemy will be encouraged well , if we 're going to talk about aiding the enemy by cooking intelligence to promote a war that was n't urgent , the administration has squandered our military strength this provides a lot of aid and comfort to osama bin laden who really did attack america and kim jong il who really is building nukes and while we 're on the subject of patriotism , let s talk about the affair of joseph wilson s wife mr wilson is the former ambassador who was sent to niger by the cia to investigate reports of attempted iraqi uranium purchases and who recently went public with his findings since then administration allies have sought to discredit him it s unpleasant stuff but here s the kicker both the columnist robert novak and time magazine say that administration officials told them that they believed that mr wilson had been chosen through the influence of his wife , whom they identified as a cia operative think about that if their characterization of mr wilson s wife is true \( he refuses to confirm or deny it \) , bush administration officials have exposed the identity of a covert operative that happens to be a criminal act it s also definitely unpatriotic so why would they do such a thing \? partly , perhaps , to punish mr wilson , but also to send a message and that should alarm us we 've just seen how politicized , cooked intelligence can damage our national interest yet the wilson affair suggests that the administration intends to continue pressuring analysts to tell it what it wants to hear
denver the task of raising a most unpleasant issue was undertaken outside a home on denver s east side , where a determined woman named luddie hicks raised seven children , all on her own micheal ray richardson was asked about the man who exited that house and his young life , beginning a pattern of paternal abandonment often hypothesized to be the sad social dynamic that sentenced him to a punishing drug hell a few years ago , the cable network tnt produced a documentary on richardson s sensational fall from pro basketball grace in the 1980 s and called it whatever happened to micheal ray \? now , sitting in the passenger seat of a friend s sport utility vehicle , steps from the brickface house at 1625 martin luther king boulevard , richardson was asked whatever happened to the man who might have steered him to an alternative life path \? whatever happened to his biological father , who went by the given name of billy jack \? richardson turned to face his questioner and said my father was living in texas until his mother died my brother went and brought him back here , to denver i see him now , once or twice a week to tell you the truth , it feels kind of strange my father , he was n't there , but he s still my dad he shrugged and added , it is what it is life can be what it is or what you make of it kicked out of the nba in 1986 , richardson was forced to become a citizen of the world and says he does n't regret a minute of it i felt freer being away than i ever felt here , he said it was a great experience , but i stopped playing in 2001 i thought it might be time to come home fifteen years after he left to salvage his career in europe and rebuild his life , richardson has returned to denver , to an nba payroll he has reunited with his father and his family , and benefited from a new surrogate daddy , the man who banished him from the nba house on feb 25 , 1986 i had only been commissioner a short time , and it was not an easy thing to do , david stern said by telephone from his office in new york , explaining why he helped richardson land a job last spring as the community ambassador for the denver nuggets here we were ending his career there were others who succumbed to the cocaine scourge , who violated the league s threestrikes drug policy and were sent away by stern roy tarpley chris washburn john drew none of them are on the commissioner s callback list the way richardson has been since 1997 , when he tapped stern on the shoulder in paris at a mcdonald s open game and thanked him for saving his life i was quite taken when he said that , stern said outlasting most of the players who dribbled on without him , richardson played ball in europe , away from nba excesses , until he was 46 then , in concert with stern , he began working nba clinics abroad back in denver for his sister s wedding last may , he contacted stern to say he might be interested in a job stern called kiki vandeweghe , who runs the nuggets kiki stepped up , stern said , though he did n't want to specify the financial arrangement , and he worried how national attention might affect what he called a fragile situation papa stern has enough problems in colorado , with training camps now open and kobe bryant due back next week for a preliminary hearing on the sexual assault charge against him contrary to the allegations in the bryant case and others that have recently plagued the nba , richardson never hurt anyone in the way he flagellated himself those of us who knew him as sugar during his meteoric flash across the new york new jersey sky remembered him in his absence as wildly talented , often endearing , sadly troubled searching for the grace of someone s good will men who recruited richardson in college and the pros were always promising to look after him but always had a way of falling out of his life , like billy jack a boy needs a father to teach him to be a man , but i take responsibility for what i did , richardson said i did it to myself after all he s been through , richardson looks and sounds remarkably the way he did when he was an allstar point guard , a kinetic force of nature , with a mischievous twinkle in his eye except for a slight midriff expansion , his body is still lean , his face unlined his sharply opinionated and often heartfelt or funny words , hindered by a painful speech impediment , still come in staccato bursts but beyond appearance , his life is nothing like anyone could have imagined it would be when he went away , many fearing to a place from which he would not return the picture of american linear success he is n't , but , as richardson asked , why dwell on alternative paths , on what might have been \? i could also have wound up like len bias and not be here , he said of the boston celtics' no 1 draft pick who died of cocaine use i think i'm better off than he is i 'll tell you , i can wake up every day and look at myself in the mirror and say 'i am happy i am blessed he has lived to be a grandfather but is also the father of two young children , who are temporarily still in france with his moroccan wife of five years , ilham he is the holder of an italian passport , and the owner of a home in france between cannes and nice he speaks fluent italian and he understands french his experiences include a year in israel and having to flee the croatian port city of split by speedboat during a bombing raid he might have been a hall of fame player instead of the curiosity he was monday afternoon at the small charter high school in his old east denver neighborhood , where he went on behalf of the nuggets the kids had never heard of him and , frankly , the young teachers had n't either seventeen years in sports may as well be 70 the kids know about kobe s problems , not those that richardson was n't about to bring up , sticking to the scripted message of stayinschool better his long , complicated story be told in the book he said was in the works , or from the memorabilia and the memories spread around his mother s home , which richardson and his friend and former manuel high school teammate sam combs visited after leaving the school years ago , richardson moved his mother out of 1625 martin luther king boulevard , but the new house was repossessed when the drugs took over his life now , her new townhouse in the suburb of aurora contains all the old trophies and photos , including those he is most eager to show off him with his children , those grown and still growing , and the one grandchild who , at 6 , is older than richardson s young son like billy jack , he has n't always been the best father but it is what it is , and he has a second chance when luddie hicks mentioned that her 72nd birthday was tomorrow , richardson told her , sorry , he was leaving today for france i love you , mom , but i got to go home , see my wife and kids , he said i 'll be back he leaned over to kiss her , and she smiled , knowing from experience that her micheal ray , for all his failures , all his foibles , does come back photo the former nba star micheal ray richardson giving advice to 16yearold shawn collins of skyland high school in denver \( photo by jamie schwaberow for the new york times \) \( pg d6 \)
washington , jan 18 a military hearing into the deaths of four canadians in an airstrike by two american pilots in afghanistan has focused attention on the military s longheld but littleknown practice of using drugs to keep its weary forces awake and alert or to help them sleep off the stress of combat amphetamines and tranquilizers go pills and nogo pills are considered useful tools for a modern american military that likes to fight at night , given its technological superiority in finding targets in the dark , and to an air force that must order its pilots to fly longer missions from fewer overseas bases scientists are researching ever more potent pills , including some that may keep combat forces alert for 40 hours or more , because the military says that fatigue can be deadly the 'go pill' is a tool of last resort , said maj gen dan leaf , the air force director of operational capability requirements it is an insurance policy when they 're in the air , there is no place to pull over it s a lifeordeath situation the decision to take a pill is made by the individual pilot in the air but lawyers for the pilots , majors harry schmidt and william umbach of the illinois air national guard , said that the men had felt compelled to take the amphetamine dexedrine or be scrubbed from their mission , and that the drug may have clouded their judgment on that clear night last april even though the case has brought new scrutiny of amphetamine use in the military , the defense s central argument is that the pilots should not be held responsible because they were not informed that ground fire they spotted near kandahar was a canadian military exercise the government argues that major schmidt ignored an order to hold his fire , and that major umbach , the lead pilot , failed to exercise good leadership amphetamines as a combat tool are not new military historians say they were dispensed to german and british forces in world war ii the american military gave amphetamines to pilots on transocean missions in the 1950 s and 1960 s , to air and ground combatants in vietnam , and to air force pilots in the persian gulf war asked to comment on the current case , scientists outside the military who research the use of amphetamines say it is impossible to know whether dexedrine muddled the pilots' thinking without knowing how tired they were at the time , whether they had been taking the drug for many days in a row , and how strongly their bodies responded to it the most important factor in whether their judgment was impaired , these specialists said , is not the use of amphetamines , but whether the pilots were sleepdeprived before the mission some people are more sensitive to amphetamines than others , said dr eric j nestler , a psychiatrist at the university of texas southwestern medical center at dallas even the same individual can differ in sensitivity from day to day , depending on their level of fatigue or stress so it s impossible to say what was going on in that plane with those pilots on that night studies conducted over the last 40 years suggest that low doses of amphetamines do not affect alertness , reaction time or decisionmaking ability in wellrested people the drugs do improve the mental performance of people who are fatigued researchers at columbia university s medical school , for example , have recently tested amphetamines on people undergoing abrupt changes in their sleep patterns the subjects were kept awake at night for one week , and switched back to a daytime schedule the next immediately after making such a shift , the subjects performed poorly on tests of cognitive ability and reaction time , said dr carl l hart , an assistant professor of neuroscience but when given 5 to 10milligram doses of amphetamines the size prescribed by air force flight surgeons the subjects performed as well as when they are rested in wellrested people , you do n't see the amphetamines cause much improvement , dr hart said but in people who are changing shifts , the drugs bring their performance back up to baseline air force officials say that amphetamines have never caused a flight accident the pill has never been found to cause or contribute to a mishap before , general leaf said but exhaustion is a constant concern on lengthy missions , officials said the air force conducted one study , air crew fatigue as a human factor in usaf class a mishaps a twentyyear review , that found that fatigue was a factor in 101 accidents from 1977 to 1997 current policy allows a flight surgeon to dispense go pills on sorties over 8 hours in a singlepilot fighter or 12 hours in a twopilot bomber , said betty anne mauger , spokeswoman for the air force surgeon general any unused pills must be returned by the pilots , and none are prescribed for helicopter pilots , who traditionally fly shorter missions , or for maintenance crews ms mauger said that sedatives nicknamed nogo pills are also prescribed , most often to help pilots adjust to a change in time zones or to sleep during the day in preparation for a night mission the sleeping pills sonata , ambien and restoril , are used by the air force
washington , june 30 the pentagon made public today a final set of reports on a cold war program that tested the vulnerability of american forces to unconventional attack , having identified 5 , 842 people who may have been exposed to chemical or biological agents the end of the inquiry was criticized on capitol hill and by a leading veterans' organization , whose leaders said they remained unconvinced that all the tests had been documented and all those potentially exposed had been identified the 10 test reports declassified today offered none of the revelations of earlier pentagon releases on the test program , in which deadly substances like vx and sarin had been sprayed on sailors , ships and even on american soil one new fact was the disclosure that military personnel used a substance called betapropriolactone to decontaminate naval vessels , structures and clothing studies of mice , rats , hamsters and guinea pigs now indicate that it may cause cancer , the pentagon said , although the findings are not definitive under the testing program , which was known as project 112 and project shad \( for shipboard hazard and defense \) , the military conducted 50 exercises out of 134 that had been planned , the pentagon said the names of those known to have participated in the tests have been provided to the department of veterans affairs , because they may be eligible for benefits if medical problems or disabilities can be linked to exposure this release concludes a significant effort on the part of many people in the department of defense to ensure important information was made available to service members and the department of veterans affairs , william winkenwerder jr , assistant secretary of defense for health affairs , said that effort reflects our individual and collective commitment to veterans and their families but seven members of congress wrote to defense secretary donald h rumsfeld on thursday stating that while they appreciate the determination to declassify information concerning known tests , any decision by the pentagon to discontinue its investigation would be premature and would put thousands of veterans at further risk an author of the letter , representative mike thompson , a california democrat , said today there are still a lot of unanswered questions , and a lot of new information is still coming out i think we do need a hearing , or at a minimum a briefing by the department of defense , to ask some of these questions , in particular why they think it is necessary to shut this down rick weidman , director of government relations for the vietnam veterans of america , said his organization had been contacted by retired military personnel who provided information that suggested additional tests were conducted and that other military units were involved beyond those described in the pentagon reports
when the golden state warriors raced up the court last night , they were usually far ahead of a lackadaisical knicks defense the warriors' procession of dunks was accompanied by loud boos for the knicks that came raining down from the stands at madison square garden on the court , antonio mcdyess , polite and respectful enough to fit in a 1950 s sitcom , cursed the lack of effort there was no slowing the warriors and no comeback was ever hinted at as the knicks succumbed , 10486 asked if there was a message delivered in the locker room afterward , mcdyess said we had a couple of guys step up , say a lot of stuff that s something we 've got to deal with between us i think half the time we did try to stop them , but they were running so fast , they were so far in front of us , it was just like they were playing a high school team we just did n't compete at all tonight it was definitely embarrassing for us this is the first time i played at home where the fans booed , and it s not a good feeling i'm mad , honestly i'm highly upset i 'd be on the court cursing , which i do n't normally do when you see teams rubbing it in your face like that , you kind of get upset , and that s what i was tonight it s not fun , definitely not fun the knicks had won their last two games after a disastrous road trip and a sixgame losing streak , but the good feelings faded as the warriors ran by and over the knicks , opening a 22point lead early in the fourth quarter the knicks never drew closer than 17 points down the stretch led by a highflying 26point effort by jason richardson , golden state spread the scoring and did it in spectacular fashion , outrunning , outjumping and outplaying the knicks the knicks held a 3127 lead after the first quarter , but they were outscored by 3017 in the second quarter and then went downhill from there the game was decided when the third quarter was played out like a highlight reel with the warriors taking a 9point halftime lead and stretching it to 19 mike dunleavy jr converted a 3point play by tossing up an overtheshoulder flip after being fouled he then threw down a dunk over dikembe mutombo on a fast break dunleavy then fed richardson for a windmill dunk on a twoonnone fast break on good teams i 've been on , we 've always had a nolayup rule , said keith van horn , who led the team with 16 points and 10 rebounds guys shooting a layup , you either block the shot or you do n't allow them to get it off , one or the other we let them get dunks , fouled them on dunks that s just something conscious that we as a team , we have to take away that has to do with competing as well allan houston said this is probably one of the most embarrassing losses since i 've been here it was as if we as a team just almost did n't want to be here unlike the two previous games when he sat on the bench for the entire fourth quarter and the knicks pulled out comefrombehind victories , van horn got into the final period last night but by then , it was garbage time the knicks did their damage early with mcdyess and van horn controlling the paint but the warriors went for speed rather than size and took the game over , rendering the fourth quarter moot two point guards who were on the knicks' offseason shopping list did the most damage nick van exel hit his first five field goal attempts and scored 12 firstquarter points he finished with 13 before calling it a night after just 23 minutes in the second quarter , the new york city product speedy claxton took over , finishing the first half with 10 points and 4 assists without a turnover the knicks pursued him as a free agent in the summer with the warriors' point guards controlling the action , golden state coach eric musselman opted to go small in the second period , sending out four guards to play alongside brian cardinal the knicks tried unsuccessfully to downsize to match up with the explosive unit and saw a 3734 lead evaporate in a 153 warriors run at halftime , the warriors led , 5748 , thanks to 37 points from the threesome of richardson , van exel and claxton we 've always have problems with that , knicks coach don chaney said we ca n't run with them , we ca n't stay with them on dribble penetration then we tried to match our smalls with theirs , and their smalls are more athletic than ours the players dismissed the talk of matchups and pointed instead simply to lack of effort it s disappointing , said mcdyess , who expressed similar sentiments on the road trip it s like a broken record coach keeps emphasizing how we need to compete , compete , compete and you go out there and do the same thing over and over you get two good wins and come out and perform like we did tonight , i mean , it s no explanation for the way we played tonight mcdyess said it was an embarrassing game to come out tonight and do n't do anything about it , we lost the game in the second quarter just let it go , he said it seemed like we just laid down

as the dean of discipline at middle school 202 in ozone park , queens , donna solomon has faced her share of frightening incidents in the last semester alone , she said , she took reports on a student who threw two punches at a security guard , a student who discharged a fire extinguisher , a student who took a box cutter to gym class and a student who knocked down a teacher and stepped on her back as he ran away she said she herself became a victim of unruliness when a student pushed her against a wall , bruising her shoulder of course , she abhors such behavior but what galls her more is her sense that safety at the school has worsened because unruly students are less likely than in the past to receive administrative suspensions , which require them to report for five days to a special academy at the school district office matthew bromme , the supervisor of community school district 27 , said punishments had been meted out in all these incidents , but acknowledged that none involved administrative suspension as a result , ms solomon said , discipline at ms 202 , where she has worked for 23 years , has eroded that , she said , has led veteran teachers who once routinely worked past retirement age to retire as soon as they can she is one of them i am retiring this june because it is so frustrating , said ms solomon , 54 years old they put all of these pressures on you in the classroom to teach , but when you have an unruly child and not just talking out , i mean students who prevent learning they do nothing to help you what affects the levying of administrative suspensions \? ms solomon notes that these punishments show up in statistical profiles of a school in the local press she also believes that william moore , the ms 202 principal , and other principals have been reluctant to crack down on serious misbehavior for fear that too many administrative suspensions will lead the department of education to lower the principals' scores on new official evaluations , the first of which were sent out to some principals two weeks ago mr moore referred all calls to other department officials , but mr bromme disagreed with ms solomon he said the number of such suspensions are down because the department set a new policy last year that called for students to receive lesser forms of suspension before being sent to the district office too many children were removed from their school under the old policy , he said mr bromme would not comment about the principal evaluations but a statement posted on the department web site states that principals are not downgraded on evaluations for the number of suspensions they give ron davis , a spokesman for the united federation of teachers , countered if you were to get principals to speak candidly , they would admit that an inordinate number of suspensions put them in a bad light this is their perception , and they react accordingly ms solomon put it another way i think you actually have to kill somebody to get a suspension she said she believed several other ms 202 teachers will retire for the same reason but ben tucker , the department s chief executive of school safety and planning , said none of the 12 teachers at ms 202 who are eligible for retirement in june have yet given notice to mr moore he added that the school s safety record is about average but another ms 202 teacher said she would retire in june because of the lack of discipline this used to be my home away from home , the teacher said but now there s nothing they can offer me to make me stay jim o'grady photo donna solomon senses rising school unruliness \( richard lee for the new york times \)
rye for isabel rose , life does not wholly hinge on the success of anything but love , the musical film she cowrote , produced and stars in if the film , which opened nov 14 at cinema 100 in greenburgh and at selected theaters in new york and los angeles fails and disappoints her , ms rose can concentrate instead on her new twobook publishing deal or she can busy herself with the talks that may make one of the books , the jap chronicles , a novel scheduled to be published by doubleday next fall , into a television series or she can focus on her budding career as a cabaret singer \( she will perform at joe s pub in manhattan tomorrow night at 9 30 \) or she can always return to writing songs for children \( she has already recorded one cd \) and then again , ms rose , 35 , might want to spend more time with her 2yearold daughter , lily but ms rose s ambition matches her creativity , and she is unlikely to let anything but love , which was filmed in part on the rambling grounds of the house she grew up in here , go quietly into indie heaven the film , which is being distributed in the united states by samuel goldwyn films , was made for under 1 million and was rejected by 24 film festivals before ms rose was named best up and coming actress at the san diego film festival last year in an interview before the film opened commercially , she vowed to focus on the palpable joy expressed by viewers at a series of private screenings , and ignore any unfavorable reviews in the film , ms rose sings standards like too close for comfort , i ca n't believe that you 're in love with me and the title tune reviewers praised her singing , while ranging from strongly enthusiastic to negative about the film itself the movie revolves around billie golden , an aspiring nightclub singer living in queens who infuses her world with technicolor fantasies that spring from the movie musicals of the 1950 s as played by ms rose , billie wears glamorous gowns to sing at a dreary bar , dresses like audrey hepburn in breakfast at tiffany s for a first date in presentday manhattan , and hears music in her head until things in her life start going very wrong ms rose wrote the film with robert cary , a former classmate at yale the movie , directed by mr cary , also features andrew mccarthy and eartha kitt , who makes a brief but pivotal appearance ms rose s red hair and wide smile match that of her film character but the impression of physical stature that the film gives her character is an illusion at 5foot4 , ms rose is slender rather than voluptuous like billie s idol , rita hayworth billie speaks softly in timeless phrases , while ms rose is more hardedged and awash in current vernacular i'm a single mother and completely modern , she said , perched on the white , flowered sofa in the living room of the sunlit house that she grew up in here in rye , which she calls her favorite place in the world she and lily live in tribeca ms rose and her husband separated a year ago her childhood room retains its carefully preserved mementos of a westchester day camp and a manhattan private school , and the den of the house is filled with rows of classic movies like high society , kiss me kate , funny face and pajama game the seeds of her passions are evident in this house every friday night we had shabbos dinner and then watched a movie on 16millimeter , ms rose recalled , saying that she was an anomaly in her family i never went to film school , but i grew up changing reels she grew up in a family that besides her parents susan and elihu rose \( she is an amateur pianist , he is a professor of military history at new york university \) includes two sisters , amy and abbi , none of whom pursues the arts professionally she attributes her perfect pitch , her talent for drawing and her theatrical flair to her late grandfather , samuel b rose , a painter whose work is on display throughout her parents' house ms rose began acting in school and camp plays , going on to major in both theater studies and american studies at yale , from which she graduated summa cum laude she had a bit part in the movie forrest gump , toured with the national company of six degrees of separation , and then quit acting 10 years ago she then earned a master of fine arts in fiction and literature from bennington college in 1997 after writing anything but love , she said she struggled with the idea of casting a wellknown actress in the part but decided that her own , unknown face , would be better this film is so stylized , she said , i knew it had to be made by someone who gets the style , and i was raised on it speaking by phone from california , meyer gottlieb , president of samuel goldwyn films , said he fell in love with the movie when he first saw it it reminded me of pictures i used to see as a kid , he said isabel reminds me a lot of june allyson , with her loving personality he said he expected people in their late 20 s and up to be drawn to the movie , with an audience composed of 60 percent female , 40 percent male ms rose said the film was a thankyou note to my parents for the movies she grew up watching i love the romance , the glamour and simplicity of those films , she said , noting that the old films were imbued with an elemental optimism i'm a complete optimist , she said so much so that she believes her film will succeed , even though other wellreviewed , audiencefriendly films have fallen by the wayside so why hers \? quicker than you can say my big fat greek wedding , she answers

nearly half the children in new york city s public elementary schools are overweight , and about one in four is obese , a city survey has found among hispanic children , the rate of obesity is 31 percent the figures indicate that the rising obesity among american children , well documented in surveys over four decades , is worse in new york city than in the country as a whole and they undercut the theory , promoted by some urban planners , that people who live in cities where walking is common are slimmer than those who dwell in places where a trip to the store or a movie is always made by car the survey of nearly 3 , 000 children from kindergarten through fifth grade , conducted in may by the department of health and mental hygiene and the department of education , showed that 43 percent weighed more than the recommended range , with 19 percent rated as overweight , and 24 percent as obese , as measured by factors including height , weight , age and sex the only comparable survey in new york , taken among third graders in 1996 , found that 20 percent were obese , but did not count the number who were merely overweight figures for the city as a whole would be somewhat different from those found in the new survey , because it did not take into account private school students , who constitute about onequarter of the city s schoolchildren health commissioner thomas r frieden said yesterday that the results were nothing less than a calamity in the making a future wave of heart disease , diabetes and a raft of other ailments what s changed is the increased sedentary lifestyle , the supersizing fastfood , video game culture , and it s leading to a real epidemic , he said in determining which children were overweight and which ones obese , the city used the system adopted by the federal centers for disease control and prevention and used in national surveys it uses body mass index and a complex set of sliding scales based on age , sex and percentiles established in the 1960 s body mass index is a weighttoheight ratio that has become a popular way to gauge weight for adults a rating of 25 or above , for both men and women , is considered overweight , and 30 or more is obese but using it for children is much trickier , because the target range advised by doctors varies widely by age and sex \( body mass index is calculated as weight in pounds multiplied by 703 , and then divided by the square of height in inches \) in 2000 , a survey found that 15 percent of elementary schoolchildren nationwide were obese , up from 4 percent in the 1960 s , and 30 percent were overweight health officials say the much higher rates in new york city are due largely to the city s higher proportion of black and hispanic children , but even that does not fully explain the difference in the city survey , the obesity rates are 14 percent for asians , 16 percent for whites , 23 percent for blacks , 31 percent for all hispanics and 36 percent for hispanic boys another recent city survey on diabetes , which is often related to excessive weight , found that among people under age 40 , hispanics were four times as likely as whites or asians to have the disease studies have indicated that obesity is rising faster among hispanics than among any other group public health experts attribute the higher incidence among hispanics to a variety of factors , including eating habits , physiology and , perhaps , a view imported from countries with high childhood mortality rates that a fatter child is a healthier child two weeks ago , in an acknowledgement of widespread obesity among city schoolchildren , the education department said it would reduce the fat content in cafeteria food and ban candy , soda and other sugary snacks from school vending machines , in favor of healthier foods dr frieden pleaded with parents to make changes in their children s diets , like cutting back on fast food , eliminating highsugar drinks and not giving whole milk to children over age 2 just as important , he said , is exercise we know changing diet s tough , but with physical activity , we know we can make a difference , he said walk briskly a half an hour a day take the stairs instead of the elevator make sure that play time is active none of this advice came as news to parents and children interviewed around the city yesterday , but they said that understanding the problem and winning the daily struggle against unhealthy lifestyles were two very different things karen covington , a 31yearold mother visiting tompkins square park with her child , said that for working parents in a cramped city , finding the time and the place for exercise can be difficult in the winter , when it s hard to get out and the kids are bouncing off the walls , it s easier for some parents to just put in a video , she said even at a popular spot for exercise , the pool at the hamilton fish recreation center on the lower east side , a number of children were overweight one boy , frank , who is 9 , said his favorite activities were sedentary reading and playing computer games many people lamented the popularity of fast food and prepared foods , high in fat and sugar , that are marketed directly to children amelia perez , 45 , arrived yesterday at the mcdonald s at 237th street and broadway in the bronx with her two granddaughters in tow , and acknowledged that the family worried about 9yearold amber s weight problem grandma lets them slide , she said of the children we go three times a week to mcdonald s for lunch still , she railed against parents who do the same some of the parents are too lazy to cook , she said i see this all the time they have food in the house , but the kids cry for french fries chart overweight children a

nashville the national football league needs to bite the bullet and make its officials fulltime employees the officials do a good job , but good is no longer good enough for the second weekend in a row , a crucial game was determined not by arms , legs and feet , but by an official s flag this was n't as blatant as last week s giants49ers game , but the call was significant enough the second round of the playoffs are off to a scintillating start last night , steve mcnair , playing with a mangled thumb , marched tennessee down the field in overtime a completed pass put the ball on the pittsburgh 13 for a 31yard fieldgoal attempt by joe nedney he missed , and pittsburgh exploded in celebration now the steelers had their shot not so fast there was a flag the official ruled dewayne washington ran into the kicker he did , but this was a judgment call the titans had another shot , nedney another chance at redemption he would kick from 26 yards this time he nailed it cannons went off , fans screamed and the steelers' season was over an enraged bill cowher , the steelers' coach , ran on the field to confront ron blum , the referee , and chad brown , the umpire , as they walked off the field cowher said his piece and ran off afterward , a livid cowher blasted the call for a game to be decided on a call like that is ludicrous , he said cowher would have totally gone off had he heard nedney s postgame comments someone asked nedney how hard he was hit he smiled and said , he got a pretty good hit on me , but i think when i'm done playing ball i might try acting unbelievable before the penalty on the field goal , the steelers called and were given a timeout just before the second attempt , they tried to call another timeout but were told they had none the players protested that before the overtime the referee had announced for all to hear that each team had three too late the ball was snapped , the kick good , game over jason gildon , a steelers linebacker , said i think it s another example of officials just not being at the top of their game it s the playoffs there is a lot at stake if anyone should be ready , then it should be them the players are going to show up and play but at the same time , they have be held to a standard as well as it turns out , tennessee is the better team and deserves to move on , but not like this you have to wonder who will be next officials are the only pegs in this multibilliondollar nfl enterprise who are not committed to what they do on a fulltime basis in a game of expanding rules and complexity , and accelerated speed , there is simply too much they do n't know and ca n't know on a parttime basis one moment from yesterday s game crystallizes what is becoming more noticeable holes in the officials' judgment and splitsecond knowledge of rules the titans had taken a 2820 lead in the third quarter and the titans' defense forced a punt derrick mason fielded it , was hit , spun , appeared to go down , but continued to the pittsburgh 30 cowher complained that mason s knee had touched the ground and wanted a review blum was n't sure of the rule and announced his uncertainty i do n't believe that s a challengeable play but i'm going to check , he said over the publicaddress system and to a national television audience stunning how could you not know \? blum checked with the replay crew guess what \? turns out the play could be challenged the steelers challenged , and it turned out mason s knee had touched instead of getting the ball on the steelers' 30 , the titans took over on the 44 the defense held , the teams exchanged punts and the steelers tied it early in the fourth quarter for me to have to have to explain to an official what s reviewable , that s wrong , cowher said fine me if you want that s the truth ever wonder what officials do on their real jobs \? let s take a look at the crew that worked last night s game blum is a professional golfer in his 18th year brown , the umpire , is the manager of an intramural sports club tony veteri , the head linesman , is an athletics director ron marinucci , the line judge , is a business executive jim saracino , the field judge , is a high school teacher john parry , the side judge , is a corporate pilot perry paganelli , the back judge , is a high school administrator the nfl is no longer in its infancy this was not the canton bulldogs playing the decatur staleys on a muddy field in 1920 the nfl is slick , smooth and global , the model of all other pro leagues but the owners cheat the game by being cheap with the officials this really is n't about money , but time they have to put in the same amount of time as everyone else players play full time coaches , eat , drink and sleep football general managers spend all their time trying to improve their teams and here you are not knowing what may be challenged and what may not while the titans and steelers are plotting , planning and scheming , ron blum is playing golf in two weeks , the nfl will play host to the super bowl can you imagine the game being determined by a blown call like the one last weekend in san francisco , or a judgment call like last night s \?

washington , march 22 the recent disclosure that reports claiming iraq tried to buy uranium from niger were based partly on forged documents has renewed complaints among analysts at the cia about the way intelligence related to iraq has been handled , several intelligence officials said analysts at the agency said they had felt pressured to make their intelligence reports on iraq conform to bush administration policies for months , a few cia analysts have privately expressed concerns to colleagues and congressional officials that they have faced pressure in writing intelligence reports to emphasize links between saddam hussein s government and al qaeda as the white house contended that links between mr hussein and al qaeda justified military action against iraq , these analysts complained that reports on iraq have attracted unusually intense scrutiny from senior policy makers within the bush administration a lot of analysts have been upset about the way the iraqal qaeda case has been handled , said one intelligence official familiar with the debate that debate was renewed after the disclosure two weeks ago by dr mohamed elbaradei , the head of the international atomic energy agency , that the claim that iraq sought to buy uranium from niger was based partly on forged documents the claim had been cited publicly by president bush the forgery heightened people s feelings that they were being embarrassed by the way iraqi intelligence has been handled , said one government official who has talked with cia analysts about the issue the forged documents were not created by the cia or any other united states government agency , and cia officials were always suspicious of the documents , american intelligence officials said but the information still ended up being used in public by mr bush intelligence officials said there was other information , which was deemed to be credible , that raised concerns about a possible uranium connection between niger and iraq several analysts have told colleagues they have become so frustrated that they have considered leaving the agency , according to government officials who have talked with the analysts several people have told me how distraught they have been about what has been going on , said one government official who said he had talked with several cia analysts none of the analysts are willing to talk directly to news organizations , the official said a senior official of the agency said no analysts had told cia management that they were resigning in protest over the handling of iraqi intelligence at the state department , by contrast , three foreign service officers have resigned in protest over mr bush s policies the official said some analysts had been frustrated that they had frequently been asked the same questions by officials from throughout the government about their intelligence reports concerning iraq many of these questions concern sourcing , the official said the official added that the analysts had not been pressured to change the substance of their reports as we have become an integral component informing the debate for policy makers , we have been asked a lot of questions , the senior cia official said i'm sure it does come across as a pressured environment for analysts i think there is a sense of being overworked , a sense among analysts that they have already answered the same questions but if you talk to analysts , they understand why people are asking , and why policy makers are n't accepting a report at face value another intelligence official said , however , that many veteran analysts were comparing the current climate at the agency to that of the early 1980 s , when some cia analysts complained that they were under pressure from the reagan administration to take a harder line on intelligence reports relating to the soviet union the official said the pressure had prompted the agency s analysts to become more circumspect in expressing their analytical views in the intelligence reports they produced on topics of very intense concern to the administration of the day , you become less of an analyst and more of a reports officer , the official said the distinction between an analyst and a reports officer is an important one within the cia a reports officer generally pulls together information in response to questions and specific requests for information an intelligence analyst analyzes the information in finished reports

in its early years , the small fleet of roving white ambulances with the rock emblazoned on the side was a small but crucial community ambulance service , helping to rescue swimmers and serving the elderly and highcrime communities in the rockaways but the rock volunteer ambulance corps became known as a bigtime responder , playing important rescue roles in major city emergencies like the world trade center attack and the crash of flight 587 in belle harbor two months later and in last week s blackout , the group rescued three elderly residents stranded in highrise apartments now the ambulance corps itself needs rescuing a cofounder of the group , the rev donald ventura , said yesterday that it did not have the money to pay its outstanding bills , including a 7 , 000 insurance payment due this week mr ventura said that since the group s creation in 1997 , it has been waiting for longpromised government aid , which has not arrived over the years , he said , the group has received plenty of plaques , news coverage and handshakes from politicians , but no one ever wants to open up their wallet , he said so the group has relied on church fundraisers and contributions from volunteers , for a total of roughly 380 , 000 over the years state officials recently promised his group 25 , 000 in assistance , he said , which has been held hostage to political bickering even if the company raises enough money , he said , it is a lengthy process to be reinstated by the insurance company people tell me our mistake was that we 've been doing this too cheap , mr ventura said if we asked for millions of dollars , they 'd think we were doing something important and the funding would go right through the group once had three ambulances and a rescue boat now it has one ambulance that will probably be taken off the road this week , he said there are 34 volunteer new york statecertified emergency medical technicians and a volunteer staff of 11 clergymen who help do counseling after sept 11 , we counseled families of more than 100 uniformed victims of 9 11 , mr ventura said , some for a whole year the local city councilman , joseph p addabbo jr , said that discretionary funds allocated to his council district had already been divided among other groups in these tough financial times , we have volunteer groups in every corner of the city that are suffering , he said it s a shame this group has a rocksolid record of serving the community they 're willing and able , but they ca n't run on nothing what they need to stay alive is nothing compared to the billions in the state budget , he said , but it s the difference between them existing and not existing mr ventura said he recruits volunteers from the edgemere , arverne and hammel housing projects in the rockaways after his free fourmonth program , often held on the rockaway boardwalk or in housing project courtyards , recruits would earn their emt certification , and in return , volunteer two days a month with the rock hundreds of his volunteers have gone on to emergency service jobs with new york city s fire and police departments and other public and private ambulance services , mr ventura said mr ventura , a green beret trained in search and rescue , worked as a medical service instructor for many city agencies and hospitals he became a minister at the battalion pentecostal assembly , a coalition of 14 far rockaway churches on sept 11 , 2001 , mr ventura sped to the twin towers from the rockaways in the group s rescue boat he and several other volunteers from the rock were among the few elite search and rescue personnel to be lowered far into the collapsed buildings early in the rescue effort at ground zero mr ventura said that one of his ambulances was crushed at ground zero and thousands of dollars in rescue equipment was lost , none of which was replaced or paid for we 've showed up for our share of major crises in this city , he said yesterday , staring at his fleet one ambulance now that we have our own crisis , who s showing up for us \? where are the politicians who came running when the news cameras would cover us \? photo the rev donald ventura , a green beret and pentecostal minister , leads an ambulance corps in the rockaways many of his volunteers have come from the edgemere , arverne and hammel housing projects \( photo by lucian m read for the new york times \)
houston , march 13 a senior structural engineer at the johnson space center here wrote in an email message to his managers during the flight of the shuttle columbia that he and other engineers saw big uncertainties about the extent of damage when debris hit it the engineer said nasa should beg other agencies for help in photographing the spacecraft in his message on jan 21 , the engineer , alan r rocha , offered suggestions on revising the reentry plans but mr rocha said that without the pictures , it would be impossible to know how to adjust the reentry the message , sent five days after the shuttle was launched on jan 16 , is the first internal nasa communication to show that engineers foresaw a need for different options for reentry and suggested discussing those alternatives senior nasa officials have said that they did not shift plans because they concluded that there was no threat of serious damage and that the standard reentry pattern was the best available the request from mr rocha , the chief engineer for the shuttle program in the structural engineering division of nasa , was apparently rejected , like similar requests for satellite imagery from at least one , and possibly two , other groups of engineers a central question in the investigation of the breakup on feb 1 is whether nasa and its contractors were aggressive enough in obtaining information about the damage from debris engineers suspect that debris hit the shuttle 81 seconds after liftoff and struck protective tiles on its underside or the reinforced carboncarbon composite on the front edge of the wing , although the role of debris remains uncertain in a report dated jan 23 , five engineers of boeing , a nasa contractor , said the debris had not caused lifethreatening damage senior nasa officials have said the boeing report dispelled any major doubts that they had about the risks posed by the damage nasa officials have said that based on the boeing report and also on their view that images from satellites or telescopes on the ground might not be clear enough to assess the damage , they decided not to request the aid of other agencies to obtain magnified images a senior investigator with the independent board that is looking into the crash cited mr rocha s email message today as evidence that top nasa managers might have failed to encourage a healthy exchange of ideas and intimidated those below them in the organization those at lower levels discuss among themselves but do not raise their concerns to those aggressive leaders who can act on their concerns , the senior investigator said if nasa had a robust safety culture , the investigator said , lowerranking engineers would have felt freer to be more emphatic about their concerns comments by a senior nasa official and email messages released under the freedom of information act have shown that three groups of nasa engineers were concerned about the damage and wanted nasa to ask other agencies for images of the craft in flight the investigators from the independent board studying the disaster will have to sort out what requests were made and when and where they were rejected a spokesman at the space center , kyle herring , said that no request for outside help had reached the mission managers but mr rocha wrote in his message , addressed to two superiors , that they were asking for two other managers and ron d dittemore , the top manager for the shuttle program , to seek outside help a senior nasa official said on wednesday that another engineer , lambert austin , had directly asked mr dittemore to request images from spy satellites engineers from nasa and its main contractor , the united space alliance , and boeing , began analyzing the damage potential of the debris soon after it was found on images of the launching in his message , mr rocha wrote that the engineers from nasa and the two contractors all agreed we will always have big uncertainties about the extent of damage but boeing had no uncertainty in its report , which said the damage would not threaten the mission mr herring said that the management team met to discuss the damage and that in a coupleofhour period of time on jan 22 , this was opened and closed he said that linda ham , the shuttle program integration manager , hearing talk that a request for outside help might be coming , polled the mission managers and that none said they were making such a request she conveyed this to mr dittemore , he said mr herring declined a reporter s request to speak to mr dittemore in the first few days after the feb 1 accident , when mr dittemore made extensive public statements about the disaster , he did not mention any dissension among his engineers on the possible effects of the liftoff debris a senior nasa official said today that top officials here denied mr rocha s imaging request , just as mr dittemore rejected a request by another group mr rocha and his colleagues were genuinely concerned about the extent of tile damage , the official said the official also said a separate group of mission control directors exchanged email messages with the same concerns about the tile damage and proposing to ask senior managers for magnified images the official , who had seen one of the messages , said he did not know what happened to the request mr rocha s email message said that whatever predictions engineers gave about the damage would have effects from acceptable to unacceptable to horrible , and with no way to reduce the uncertainty it would be hard , he wrote , to provide the operations department with advice on reentry he listed possible options for revising the reentry plans , writing in shorthand technical language two space experts not affiliated with nasa explained the options that mr rocha mentioned one was onorbit thermal conditioning , which means cooling the damaged area by rotating it to the shade before subjecting it to reentry heat the shuttle usually orbits with the bottom surface facing the stars charles eastlake , a professor of aerospace engineering at embry riddle aeronautical university in daytona beach , fla , who researched heat transfer for the apollo project , said parts of a spacecraft in the shade would be up to 250 degrees cooler than those in the sun if you 're going to heat something to right to the verge of breaking , professor eastlake said , then starting out 250 degrees cooler might be the little edge that would save it
to herald the arrival of song , the lowcost carrier from delta air lines that begins flying on tuesday , marketers mailed out harmonicas this week to writers covering the industry it is an instrument used to play the blues now would not seem to be the ideal time for the big airlines to start experiments like song analysts expect the industry to report total firstquarter losses of about 35 billion next week , approaching the 38 billion in losses the airlines reported for the fourth quarter of 2001 , after the sept 11 attacks the war with iraq is still winding down , and fears of the spread of a new respiratory illness are keeping travelers grounded but delta appears determined to compete with profitable lowcost rivals on the east coast , especially jetblue airways though song executives are reluctant to acknowledge it , industry experts say the new airline is aimed directly at the same leisure markets that jetblue has served with so much success in recent years song intends to do to jetblue what jetblue did to southwest airlines take an incredibly successful lowcost business model and add jazzy passenger amenities , like digitally streamed mp3 music , so that marketers can promote it as a hipper product history is not in tune with song s aspirations , though the industry is littered with failed attempts by the largest airlines to start lowcost carriers shuttle by united , continental lite , metrojet at us airways and even delta s own delta express , which will be shut once song is up and running for various reasons , none of these experiments were able to achieve the cost savings of southwest and its lowcost rivals it will be hard to measure song s bottomline success because large airlines generally do not break out financial results for their smaller subsidiaries few industry experts actually expect song to turn a profit anyway instead , analysts say that if song allows delta to redeploy its planes more efficiently , and if it nudges jetblue into focusing its expansion outside of delta s main markets , then it will have accomplished much the success of song will be evident on jetblue s future market selection , said jamie baker , an analyst at j p morgan chase we never viewed song as a serious attempt to put jetblue out of business rather , it s an attempt to get jetblue to choose markets for growth other than those important to delta mr baker said he expected a modest level of passenger defection from jetblue on routes where it will compete with song in fact , the two airlines will go head to head on tuesday , when song begins flying twice a day between kennedy international airport in new york and west palm beach , fla jetblue uses kennedy as its home base , and it typically runs seven flights a day between there and west palm beach , though the number fluctuates with demand song will add one boeing 757 to its fleet each week , pulling them from delta s main operation , until it has 36 in november to be used on 144 flights its initial expansion schedule places it in direct competition with other jetblue florida flights new yorkorlando , starting on may 10 , and new yorktampa , on may 24 song will also add new yorkatlanta flights on june 1 and service between boston and both west palm beach and tampa in may airtran airways , another profitable lowcost carrier , flies from new york and boston to its single hub in atlanta and serves many florida markets from that hub , which also happens to be delta s home base industry experts regarded the illfated delta express as delta s attempt to steal market share from airtran but delta executives dispute that characterization and disagree with the contention that song is a defensive measure against lowcost rivals our intent has never been to make this a jetblue or an airtran attack weapon , said john selvaggio , president of song we were in those markets for many years before jetblue ever existed we 've really looked at how many markets there are with high enough density for leisure traffic that can stand alone we do n't care who the competitor is in the market it is true that delta has long been flying between northeast cities and florida but when jetblue arrived on the scene in february 2000 , word of mouth spread quickly about its cheap fares , leather seats and live satellite television it forced delta to lower fares on the same routes , and jetblue has been the industry s biggest marketing success in recent memory song is banking on much the same strategy and hopes to attract travelers with even more options , including ones that will occasionally cost extra hot food and payperview television , for example it also counts among its selling points more legroom \( 33 inches between seats , compared with 32 for jetblue \) and a frequentflier program linked to delta s , which has 33 million members but song is slow in rolling out its extra amenities live television , for example , will not be available until next year , the company says , even though that feature was widely advertised when delta announced the start of song in january similar delays could undermine the airline s marketing efforts
miami , wednesday , oct 22 mike mussina had earned his freedom of choice there were two outs in the bottom of the seventh inning on tuesday night , with a runner on second base for the marlins , when the yankees' pitching coach , mel stottlemyre , came to the mound to see mussina juan pierre was coming up for florida , and stottlemyre gave mussina the choice should he pitch to pierre or walk him \? the answer would go a long way toward deciding game 3 of the world series most of the time , we make the decision for them , stottlemyre said but he was pitching real well pierre had two hits already the ondeck hitter , luis castillo , had looked utterly helpless against mussina s knuckle curve , striking out twice mussina decided to walk pierre intentionally to face castillo , who swung over an 02 curveball for strike three the yankees were out of the inning , the score was still tied , and mussina had executed his most important and final pitch the yankees took the lead in the top of the next inning , and all that was left to preserve in a raindelayed 61 victory at pro player stadium was the formality of mariano rivera s twoinning save rivera came through , as he has all month , and the yankees took a twogamestoone lead in the fourofsevengames series in doing so , they beat back the elements and the marlins' best pitcher , josh beckett mussina recognized how crucial that was it was a big win for us , mussina said they had their best guy going he pitched a great game , and we struggled with him for a long period beckett dominated eight hitters in the yankees' lineup his problem was derek jeter beckett gave up three hits , all to jeter , who doubled and scored in the fourth and seventh innings beckett is not easy , yankees manager joe torre said we watched him on tv , and our scouts could n't praise anybody any higher than they praise him but derek jeter i like to believe they 're all special , but i 've been watching this guy for eight years over and over again in october , jeter has come through it was jeter s double that began the gametying rally against boston s pedro mart nez in game 7 of the championship series , and his double down the rightfield line started the winning rally on tuesday the lefthanded jason giambi was coming up next , and though beckett had held lefthanded hitters to 3 hits in 48 atbats this postseason , marlins manager jack mckeon went to his rookie lefthander , dontrelle willis giambi walked , and willis gave up a twoout single to left field by hideki matsui jeter scored from third , giving the yankees a 21 lead and ensuring that rivera would come in matsui , who smashed a threerun homer to give the yankees their first runs in sunday s game 2 victory , had gotten another critical hit it s a compliment that everyone thinks i'm a biggame player , matsui said through an interpreter but what i focus on is , based on the situation , trying to do what s best for the team rivera retired the marlins' 345 hitters in the eighth , and the yankees exploded in the ninth aaron boone slugged a leadoff homer off chad fox , and alfonso soriano , who whiffed three times off beckett , drew a oneout walk braden looper came in and hit jeter , and with two outs , bernie williams blasted a pitch over the centerfield wall it was a threerun homer , pushing the yankees' lead to five runs , and it made williams the career leader in postseason homers \( 19 \) and runs batted in \( 65 \) it s very gratifying , and especially this year , having knee surgery and then trying to heal while playing at the same time , williams said but i think this team has been very good at putting personal goals aside for the benefit of the team , and i think this should be no different mussina had been 04 with a 498 earned run average in his last six postseason starts , but he won game 3 by working seven innings , allowing one run on seven hits and striking out nine his only walk was the intentional one to pierre in the seventh inning moose was moose , stottlemyre said he made good pitches all night and kept them off stride he mixed his pitches about as well as you could mix them roger clemens will start game 4 for the yankees , who would seem to have a decided advantage in the series beyond their 21 edge in games it was vital to the marlins that beckett win , because their other starters have been dreadful this postseason beckett entered the game with a 282 earned run average in his three starts the other marlins starters have an 823 era in their 10 beckett pitched like an ace for three innings , mixing curveballs and changeups with a fastball that reached 98 miles an hour he struck out the first two hitters , alfonso soriano and jeter , with 97mph heat then giambi popped out to third on the same pitch , ending the first my first atbat , i swung at a couple of pitches up in the zone , jeter said after that , i just tried to get them down his next chance came in the fourth , when he doubled to left for the yankees' first hit giambi worked a walk , and after williams popped out , beckett s 12 pitch bounced and hit matsui to load the bases facing jorge posada , beckett again got ahead , 12 but posada hit two fouls with two strikes , and resisted close pitches beckett s 22 pitch was just high , and marlins manager jack mckeon raised his arms by his side in the dugout , barking at the plate umpire , gary darling when beckett s 32 pitch came in low , mckeon spit out his sunflower seeds and started waving his arms again as darling pointed back to him , mckeon drew a line across the top of his jersey , seeming to tell darling that if the borderline high pitch is a ball , the borderline low pitch should be a strike the walk forced in jeter , who struck his familiar october pose arm cocked at his side , shaking his fist as he crossed the plate the score was tied , 11 , and the rain picked up in intensity no world series game had been delayed in progress since 1982 , but this was more than a passing south florida shower the delay lasted 39 minutes and the rain continued sporadically until the end of the game , when more than half the stands were empty after mussina struck out alex gonzalez and beckett in the fifth , he turned to the leftfield umpire , the crew chief , randy marsh , who soon waved his arms to call time stottlemyre said the yankees never really considered taking mussina out of the game , and mussina was not concerned i did n't feel too bad , he said it was n't awful it was a decent part of the game when it s a rain delay , you never know but i was n't really all that worried about it no worries mussina had none when he went after castillo , and the yankees have considerably fewer now they are two victories from a championship , and there are at least two games before beckett can pitch again photos florida s josh beckett gave up three hits to derek jeter but held the rest of the yankees hitless yankees catcher jorge posada tagged out

the 400 wealthiest taxpayers accounted for more than 1 percent of all the income in the united states in the year 2000 , more than double their share just eight years earlier , according to new data from the internal revenue service but their tax burden plummeted over the period the data , in a report that the irs released last night , shows that the average income of the 400 wealthiest taxpayers was almost 174 million in 2000 that was nearly quadruple the 468 million average in 1992 the minimum income to qualify for the list was 868 million in 2000 , more than triple the minimum income of 244 million of the 400 wealthiest taxpayers in 1992 while the sharp growth in incomes over that period coincided with the stock market bubble , other factors appear to account for much of the increase a cut in capital gains tax rates in 1997 to 20 percent from 28 percent encouraged longterm holders of assets , like privately owned businesses , to sell them , and big increases in executive compensation thrust corporate chiefs into the ranks of the nation s aristocracy this year s tax cut reduced the capital gains rate further , to 15 percent the data from 2000 is the latest available from the irs , but various government reports indicate that salaries , dividends and other forms of income have continued to rise since then , even as the stock market has fallen the top 400 reported 11 percent of all income earned in 2000 , up from 05 percent in 1992 their taxes grew at a much slower rate , from 1 percent of all taxes in 1992 to 16 percent in 2000 , when their tax bills averaged 386 million each those numbers can be read to show that the wealthiest , as a group , carried a disproportionate share of the overall tax burden 16 percent of all taxes , versus just 11 percent of all income evidence that all sides in the tax debate will be able to find ammunition in the data in 2000 , the top 400 on average paid 223 percent of their income in federal income tax , down from 264 percent in 1992 and a peak of 299 percent in 1995 two factors explain most of this decline , according to the irs reduced tax rates on longterm capital gains and bigger gifts to charity had president bush s latest tax cuts been in effect in 2000 , the average tax bill for the top 400 would have been about 304 million a savings of 83 million , or more than a fifth , according to an analysis of the irs data by the new york times that would have resulted in an average tax rate of 175 percent the rate actually paid by the top 400 in 2000 was about the same as that paid by a single person making 123 , 000 or a married couple with two children earning 226 , 000 , according to citizens for tax justice , a laborbacked group whose calculations are respected by a broad spectrum of tax experts the group favors higher taxes on the wealthy , and its director , robert s mcintyre , said yesterday that the irs data bolsters that viewpoint regardless of which party these 400 are in , these are the guys bush wants to help , even though they have so much money they do n't know what to do with it , he said how bush feels about the half of the population that does n't have much money is he got them a tax cut worth an average of 19 each william w beach , a tax expert at the heritage foundation , a conservative organization that favors lowering taxes for all americans , said that the top 400 taxpayers made the significant contribution to government revenue about one in every 64 of individual income tax paid cutting taxes , he said , will prompt the wealthy to invest more in the economy s growth detailed information about highincome americans has become increasingly important in setting tax policy , because the government relies on the top 13 million households for 374 percent of individual federal income tax revenue the half of americans who earned less than 27 , 682 in 2000 , paid less than 4 percent of income taxes all of the irs data is based on adjusted gross income , the figure reported on the last line on the front page of individual income tax returns interest earned on municipal bonds , which are exempt from tax , is not included over the nine years of tax returns that were examined for the new report , only a handful of taxpayers showed up in the top 400 every year , according to irs officials in all , about 2 , 200 taxpayers made the cut even once there were a few incomes of more than 1 billion a year in the group , but none as high as 10 billion the names of the wealthiest taxpayers are not disclosed in the report , which was prepared at the urging of joel slemrod , a university of michigan business school professor who serves on an irs advisory panel and is a leading authority on taxation of highincome americans the figures do not include the incomes of the many wealthy americans who use shelters to reduce their reported incomes below the level of the top 400 in 1999 and 2000 , for example , william t esrey then the chief executive of sprint , the telecommunications company earned more than 150 million in stock option profits , lofting him onto many lists of the bestpaid corporate managers that income might have put mr esrey in the irs s top 400 taxpayers but , as later came to light , mr esrey bought a tax shelter from ernst young , the accounting firm , designed to let him delay reporting the profits for tax purposes until the year 2030 sprint s board forced mr esrey to resign in march after he acknowledged that the shelter was the subject of an irs audit over the nine years reviewed in the new report , the incomes of the top 400 taxpayers increased at 15 times the rate of the bottom 90 percent of americans their average income rose 17 percent , to 27 , 000 , from 1992 to 2000 longterm capital gains accounted for 64 percent of the income of the top 400 in 2000 , nearly double the level in 1992 wages contributed 167 percent to the incomes of the top 400 in 2000 , down from 262 percent in 1992 , and dividends made up 28 percent a second report that the irs will make public today shows that the number of americans with high incomes who pay no taxes anywhere in the world has reached a record in 2000 , there were 2 , 022 americans with incomes of more than 200 , 000 who paid no income tax anywhere in the world , up from just 37 in 1977 , when the report was first issued chart the average income of the top 400

berkeley , calif in the ring his nickname was busy louie in the classroom , where he spends much more of his time these days , it is easy to see why confined by street clothes , his feints and jabs accompanied not by leather gloves but merely by a dwindling piece of chalk and a blackboard eraser , lo c wacquant , a professor of sociology at the university of california campus here , all but dances his way through a seminar on the criminal justice system twisting , turning , hopping , scribbling , he is in constant motion , demonstrating , for an oblivious audience of a halfdozen sleepdeprived graduate students , the fleetfooted agility that fueled his brief , abortive stint as a pugilist and nearly derailed his academic career a slight , excitable frenchman with a mop of curly brown hair , hyperactive eyebrows and a highpitched chortle of a laugh , mr wacquant , 43 , talks even faster than he moves , and with the same unflagging energy it s like drugs , he said of boxing s hold on him you have it in your veins weaning himself of the sport , which he took up as a means of gaining access to a poor black neighborhood on chicago s south side , has taken him the better part of a decade he stopped sparring in 1997 , and now , after years of delay , his analysis of his days in the ring is finally coming out in print mr wacquant \( pronounced vahkaahn \) calls body soul notebooks of an apprentice boxer , which will be published by oxford university press later this month \( a french edition appeared in 2001 \) , a sociologicalpugilistic bildungsroman and for an ethnographic study , it is a remarkably personal work in novelistic detail it recounts mr wacquant s improbable transformation from winded graduate student to busy louie , a 137pound junior welterweight who manages to pin his opponent on the ropes during the third round at the 1990 chicago golden gloves tournament \( though in a controversial decision by the judges , he ends up losing the match \) i rush at cooper and attack without letting up i'm taking a lot of punches but i'm dishing out some of my own in return and the wild shouts of my supporters give me an extra boost of energy we 're both running out of steam and getting tired three minutes in the ring is an eternity ! jab , jab , right , double jab , i really am busy at least i will have earned my ring name ! to finish the book was like closing that chapter of my life , mr wacquant said , explaining why it took so long to complete it was like burying busy louie of course , he is hardly the first intellectual to come under boxing s spell with body soul , he joins a long line of writers and philosophers from sartre and heidegger to arthur conan doyle , ernest hemingway , norman mailer , george plimpton and , the rare female exception , joyce carol oates who have tried to capture the brutal sport s allure on paper but mr wacquant has serious academic ambitions for the book as well it is intended not simply as a corrective to the romantic depictions that dominate the literary canon norman mailer compared two boxers going at it to a metaphysical discussion , he said incredulously but also as a scholarly manifesto a model for what ethnography , or field research , should look like in this endeavor , however , he may not get much sympathy from colleagues during the decade it has taken him to write the book , mr wacquant has acquired a reputation as one of his profession s fiercest critics in more than half a dozen articles and essays , several written in collaboration with his french mentor , the sociologist pierre bourdieu , he has subjected his field to withering rebuke among his charges sociologists ignore racism and the role of the state in creating ghettos they offer sanitized portraits of the urban poor instead of rigorous analysis of the reasons for their plight and , worse , their work ends up providing unwitting legitimacy to regressive policies on race and poverty he has also accused american scholars of cultural imperialism , of importing the peculiar national dynamics of race and racism to their studies of countries like brazil , where the concepts make little sense as mr wacquant put it last year in the american journal of sociology in a scathing review of three otherwise wellreceived urban ethnographies us sociology is now tied and party to the ongoing construction of the neoliberal state and its punitive management of the poor , on and off the street this grim view of government conduct is the subject of his next book , deadly symbiosis , due out in the spring , which argues that american ghettos and prisons have become a single interconnected system for segregating and controlling the poor and while his writings have earned him acclaim his honors include a macarthur foundation genius award they have angered many of his colleagues he s upset a lot of people , said william julius wilson , a university professor at harvard who has made extensive studies of chicago s ghettoes and been a central proponent of the view that racism is increasingly less significant in perpetuating urban poverty than are changes in the global economy and the local job market he said he had read several chapters of deadly symbiosis and found much in them brilliant however , he added , as with much of lo c s work , i'm afraid that many readers will focus on the polemical attacks on the urban poverty literature instead of the powerful and substantive theoretical arguments he makes
thomas o hicks is nothing if not an optimist the baseball team he owns , the texas rangers , finished dead last in the american league west in each of the last three seasons despite the skills of alex rodriguez , who won a 10year contract worth 252 million from mr hicks , the most ever paid to a professional athlete as mr hicks said recently , i'm feeling pretty good about the current season so it is with his main job , running hicks , muse , tate furst , a private investment firm that specializes in leveraged buyouts mr hicks is struggling to restore his and the firm s reputation after losing about 1 billion for his investors from minority stakes he took in six telecommunications and 13 internet companies at the peak of the 1990 s stock market bubble we got sucked up in the vortex of the new economy , mr hicks said in a recent interview that was hardly the firm s only misstep hicks , muse s joint purchase , with kohlberg kravis roberts company , of regal cinemas also ended disastrously regal filed for bankruptcy in september 2001 , costing the firm and its investors an additional 500 million and hicks , muse has risked 1 billion on media companies in argentina , which has been in a recession for four years then there is the viasystems group , an electronics equipment maker hicks , muse controls that filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last october still , a chastened mr hicks , who will turn 57 next month , says that he and his firm will restore its reputation now that he has refocused the firm on what it does best buying companies at reasonable prices and expanding them to increase profits what he calls his buy and build strategy the feeble economy is offering opportunities not seen in a decade , and many troubled companies are eager to discard parts of their businesses if only things were that simple all of the big names in leveraged buyouts from kohlberg kravis to thomas h lee partners are digging out from a pile of failed , or bankrupt , acquisitions and all have had a hard time realizing gains from their better investments , what with the weak market making it nearly impossible for them to take the businesses public or sell them to another company but many of these firms , too , are on the prowl for deals kohlberg kravis and the texas pacific group are looking at britain s safeway , which is on the block and diageo , the british liquor company , last month agreed to sell burger king to texas pacific , bain capital and goldman sachs capital partners most have plenty of money last summer , the blackstone group raised the largest buyout fund ever , 65 billion , beating thomas h lee , which had raised 61 billion in 2001 all told , buyout firms now have more than 100 billion in cash , according to morgan stanley riding a resurgence in the junk bond market , which provides some leverage , buyout firms announced 10 billion of acquisitions in the fourth quarter , the highest level since the fall of 2000 , according to standard poor s last summer s auction of the qwest directory business attracted as many as 10 buyout firms buyouts are back with a vengeance , said alan jones , who heads a group at morgan stanley catering to these firms there are suddenly lots of affordable things to buy that competition makes hicks , muse s task harder , though mr hicks argues that he is mostly pursuing midsize acquisitions that other firms care little about at the annual meeting with his investors last october , mr hicks declared his firm to be on track , on message and doing the kinds of deals that have delivered outstanding returns to our limited partners how \? with chances slim to none that mr hicks can pry profits out of his foray into argentina , he promises that he will not make any more investments in latin america until it stabilizes he will no longer take less than a controlling interest in a company , as he did in telecommunications and he will avoid technology and telecommunications companies altogether , despite potential bargains \( he remains optimistic about viasystems , which will emerge from bankruptcy this week \) instead , he intends to stick to three familiar industries food , manufacturing and media , including radio , television and cable set on this strategy , in fall 2001 mr hicks told investors in his firm s newest fund that he hoped to deliver net profit close to the 30 percent he had achieved with earlier funds that would be a sharp contrast with the prior fund , which is expected merely to break even , among the worst performances in the industry that goal is a tall order for mr hicks , a 6foot3 dallas native rival buyout firms are aiming for returns of 20 percent or less , according to consultants and competitors in fact , mr hicks recently told his investors that more modest returns were possible that is because times have decidedly changed banks are more cautious they want buyout firms to contribute close to 40 percent of the purchase price in cash , compared with less than 10 percent in the late 1980 s , the heyday of buyout firms in one of mr hicks s earliest deals , the acquisitions of dr pepper and sevenup in the 1980 s , he and his backers put up just 7 percent the return was more than 20 times their investment the less leverage a buyout includes , of course , the lower the ultimate returns to the investors
ronkonkoma when ed meyer began working at macarthur airport as an air traffic controller in 1986 , it never crossed his mind that his new work location could be hazardous to his health two years later , when the town of islip opened a 100acre compost facility adjacent to the airport , mr meyer developed what he said were skin and respiratory illnesses i remember running out of my office one october morning scared and gasping for air , mr meyer said my windpipe was closing up i kept saying , 'i ca n't breathe , i ca n't breathe' i thought i was going to die mr meyer , 54 , said he has been diagnosed with 15 different illnesses that he says are associated with the mold spores emitted by compost piles he has moved to a different building on airport property where he is surrounded by air filters , an ozone machine and three ultraviolet lights if i do n't turn on those machines within the first 15 minutes of getting to work , my ears will start ringing , i 'll break out in hives and i wo n't be able to breathe , mr meyer said he commutes to work from his merrick home in a honda filled with eyewatering fumes of chlorine bleach that mr meyer pours into the air conditioning unit to kill spores from the compost site despite all his precautions , mr meyer said his allergy symptoms begin to resurface in the 6th hour of his 10hour workdays only when i get out of the ronkonkoma area do i start getting back to normal , he said and if i take off for two weeks all my symptoms disappear that s why i call this the ronkonkoma disease according to a 1994 state department of health study , the islip compost piles emit a mold spore known as aspergillus fumigatus the report said exposure to the spores can cause allergic reactions and asthma as well as more serious and lifethreatening diseases among individuals whose immune systems are suppressed but the study said the allergies and respiratory symptoms reported by mr meyer and residents of ronkonkoma , just northeast of the compost heap , were not associated with the airborne mold spores the study s conclusions are widely doubted here i believe that there is a definite correlation between ed s reactions and that compost facility , said mr meyer s doctor , morton teich , an allergist and environmental medicine specialist i had tested the environment of the compost facility and found there to be significant amounts of mold in the air when he goes to work , he only gets worse many people have allergies and asthma , but in ed s case he is suffering from a lot more allergic reactions that i believe are caused from the air coming from the compost invasive aspergillosis , a disease associated with the mold spore , was cited in an autopsy report as the cause of death of harry dobin , who died in 1992 at age 25 after working for six years as a coffee vendor at the ronkonkoma train station , across the street from the compost site he began complaining of severe leg pains that none of the doctors could figure out , said frances dobin , mr dobin s widow , who lives in queens only after performing surgery on harry s leg and finding a footandahalf long vegetation growth did doctors figure out that he was suffering from aspergillosis mrs dobin s lawsuit against islip is currently awaiting a ruling by justice harry seidel of state supreme court in riverhead on the town s motion to dismiss in a court document , the town noted the state s finding that the compost heap did not pose a health threat and argued for a dismissal on the grounds that municipalities like islip are immune from negligence suits attacking its performance of a government function george pfluger , mrs dobin s attorney , said , it s a ludicrous argument to say they cannot be held responsible when they were the ones who designed , created , and operated the facility that caused harry to get fatally sick from the outset , the compost facility became a topic of controversy for nearby residents complaining of odors and debris in 1991 , some residents began complaining of allergies and respiratory problems that they attributed to the compost heaps we were able to get the attention of the town so they no longer ignored the odor problem and treated it with various agents , said assemblyman steve levy , whose district includes the compost piles and the adjacent neighborhood mr levy , who is now seeking the democratic nomination for county executive , said the goal was an enclosed composting facility if it is encapsulated , the aspergillus spore will not be exposed in the air for those who have weakened immune systems , he said but we 're not holding our breath , no pun intended most of the nearby residents live in ronkonkoma , which is in the town of brookhaven just over the border from islip but kelly sheridan , the town of brookhaven public information officer , said her town had not been notified that any problem exists the residents said they felt that the state department of health , the state department of environmental conservation and the federal environmental protection administration had dropped the ball a lot of these agencies do n't want to be seen as the one closing down what is a recycling facility , mr levy said but the whole purpose of recycling is to improve the environment and everyone s health they 're not doing any favors to anyone when this material is allowed to spew into the air but a dec spokesman , daniel j gilbert , said the department has a staff member who monitors that operation to readily address residents' concerns or complaints , and to ensure that the facility is operating under the guidelines that dec set a hotline for residents to make complaints has received only one phone call this year , mr gilbert said there were hundreds of calls made every month , but after 15 years of complaints falling on deaf ears , i'm tired of trying to get them to do something about it , as i am sure others are as well , said henry salmaggi , who gave up the fight against the facility after a decade after a while you just give up , and i guess that s what they were hoping for photos a compost facility in islip has led to complaints from henry f salmaggi , near

washington , april 19 nobody got it quite right the war in iraq , now in its final military stages after only a month of fighting , was neither as painful as its opponents predicted nor as painless as its proponents suggested saddam hussein was driven from power , at a quite substantial cost in american , british and especially iraqi lives and with still unknowable consequences for world and regional political stability many things that worried either the planners or the critics of the plan they produced did not materialize no retaliatory terrorist attacks were mounted in the united states , only a few of the oil wells on which any future iraqi prosperity must depend were set on fire and the long american supply lines snaking north from kuwait proved less vulnerable than feared it is still far too early , obviously , to draw many definitive lessons from the fighting too much remains unknown , not only about iraqi plans and operations but about such basics as the extent and nature of fighting that took place outside the range of embedded correspondents' vision clearly , despite the pentagon s heated denials , the campaign evolved differently than anticipated fedayeen and other paramilitary groups played a larger role , proved more difficult to combat and gave the allied forces some nasty surprises intelligence , as ever , was less than perfect but allied forces regrouped and regained the initiative remarkably quickly , thanks in large part to a new command flexibility , tied to to new technology that made possible the more rapid sharing of data gen richard b myers , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , termed such adaptability a key to the new american way of war air power played a major , perhaps decisive role in blunting iraq s ability to resist american air power achieved what it never quite managed in world war ii or vietnam , destroying much of a force that was said to include 2 , 200 tanks , 300 operational combat aircraft and 400 , 000 active troops the iraqi air force never entered the fray , for reasons yet to be fully explained loose ends abound in the story of this violent conflict in the fertile triangle that gave birth to western civilization 7 , 000 years ago mr hussein s fate remains an enigma was he killed in one of the bombing raids aimed at him and his family \? or was that really he , as shown on the tape played friday on abu dhabi television , cheered on by a baghdad crowd on april 9 , the very day the big statue came down \? has he escaped to syria \? what of the chemical , biological or radiological weapons , whose elimination was one of the justifications for the war cited by president bush \? none have been found yet , in a search that has become fairly widespread critics of american policy , especially in the arab world , have begun to taunt washington by suggesting that the united states will not find any unless it plants them itself postwar realities in iraq , in the middle east and in the wider world are just starting to be shaped baghdad remains a city of violent emotions and overwhelming needs the joy and relief that many there felt at the overthrow of a sadistic dictator gave way quickly to apprehension about american intentions at the huge abu hanafi mosque , packed with devout sunni and shiite muslims , a prayer leader bluntly told the capital s occupiers on friday you are the masters today but i warn you against thinking of staying get out before we kick you out yet of course the americans cannot leave anytime soon without permitting the city to descend again into the kind of chaos that gripped it in the first few days after it fell that is true even though the presence of american troops on the city s streets , however successfully they may restrain any triumphalist instincts , is bound to offend arabic pride , already battered by having lost yet another war resentment could eventually spawn a resistance effort by unconventional forces inside and outside iraq , just as the israeli invasion of lebanon in 1982 spawned the hezbollah movement if mr hussein or his sons are indeed alive , they could lead such an effort , and even suspicions that they are alive , kept in play by things like the abu dhabi tape , can foster political restlessness the bush administration hopes to bring in police officers and peacekeepers from other countries \( though not the united nations \) , and that could take off some of the edge for many arabs but first impressions will count for much , especially among young iraqis , a huge proportion of the population , who are weary of watching their contemporaries move ahead while they have stood still or slipped backward first impressions included the arrival of ahmad chalabi , an iraqi exile without much of a following in his country , at least to date he is the only politician who enjoys the visible support not only of the american armed forces but also a private militia , dressed in surplus americanstyle fatigues he has set himself up in the hunting club , an enclave in baghdad s luxurious mansur district , which is protected by american bradley fighting vehicles
to the editor while i appreciate neil genzlinger for adding guscioralish to the new jersey political lexicon \( column , march 30 \) , it was too bad readers were misinformed that i was somehow responsible for the legislation he chose to lampoon i was the original sponsor of none of the six bills he ridiculed moreover , one bill to require licenses for cosmetologists was withdrawn by its sponsors nearly a year ago as for the proposed ban on the feeding of black bears , i did not even support it when it was posted for a vote i would have preferred recognition for the real legislative issues i have championed over the year he could have mentioned that i am the original coprime sponsor of a bill that would ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as was recently done in new york he could have cited my prime sponsorship of legislation to establish california clean car standards in new jersey or he could have outlined the bill i wrote to streamline services for developmentally disabled people a measure that now awaits governor mcgreevey s signature into law it was disappointing that the column ridiculed worthy efforts to curtail the last vestiges of discrimination against native americans or punish irresponsible owners of pitbulls that cause bodily harm to other people one can always find amusement in legislator s intent , but in these instances it was sorely misdirected assemblyman reed gusciora princeton the writer , a democrat , represents the 15th district
bridgeport , conn , march 19 the conviction of mayor joseph p ganim on federal racketeering charges today may have ended the legal saga in this longbeleaguered city but in other ways the outcome has placed bridgeport in a new sort of limbo , with uncertainty mounting over the city s leadership in the coming days and months under state law , mr ganim would lose his mayoralty only upon both conviction and incarceration but today the judge freed him on bail and set a sentencing date of july 1 as residents of this polyglot , financially pinched city of 140 , 000 wrestled with their disappointment or disgust with the conviction , depending on their allegiances , the city council called on mr ganim to step aside there is now no doubt that the public trust has been violated , that public confidence in the mayor s capacity to lead and effectively govern this city has been destroyed , said the council president , john m fabrizi , who under the city charter would automatically become mayor when mr ganim resigns or is imprisoned as we , the city council , anticipate , mr fabrizi said , now is the time , for the benefit and the good of the city of bridgeport , for the mayor to resign his position immediately later , at an evening news conference , about 75 residents repeatedly shouted resign now and mr fabrizi said mr ganim had told him he would quit , but would not say when across this 19squaremile city , many people lashed out at mr ganim for months , they had heard testimony about the fancy gifts he had accepted as bribes , from custommade suits and crates of expensive french wine to diamond earrings for his wife , jennifer bridgeport s free now , said a visibly angry joe braca , who owns a dry cleaning business on east main street he took a lot of bread off the tables of bridgeport citizens we 've been used and abused in this city ron smith , a mortgage consultant for citibank and a bridgeport resident , never accepted the defense argument that associates of mr ganim had orchestrated the bribetaking scheme without his knowledge did he have on earmuffs and blindfolds \? he asked come on but others here seemed conflicted about mr ganim s felony conviction , which is certain to bring prison time those who know him , city employees , for example , kept talking about how sociable and caring he was as he navigated the warren of offices in city hall he was very friendly and would not turn his back on anyone , said jessica santiago , a clerk in the city s benefits office he was always coming in with a smile , saying 'good morning' i just wish that none of this had happened and he would go on being the mayor others pointed to the myriad improvements in bridgeport under his leadership the economic rebirth was marked by the development in just the last five years of new shopping centers , supermarkets , a home depot , a multiscreen cinema , a minorleague ballpark and a 10 , 000squarefoot arena sonja singletary , a cook who has lived in bridgeport for 30 years , praised mr ganim s efforts to rehabilitate her section of the city , the east end , which has a large africanamerican population he tore down a lot of abandoned houses and fixed sidewalks that had been broken for years , she said you feel safe and secure because we got police substations now i love the mayor even though he s guilty , he s in my prayers every night economic growth in the city started to stall in the last year or two business leaders say the mayor s troubles probably accelerated a downturn that would have come anyway , as the national economy faltered but some are worried that the cloud of corruption could hamper further redeveloment paul s timpanelli , president of the bridgeport regional business council , which serves as a chamber of commerce , said the city was almost bankrupt a decade ago , with no leadership , no economic development and no private investment what it did not lack , he said , was rampant crime and a very poor public image over the mayor s term of office , until recently , all that was beginning to change and change dramatically , he said unfortunately , the scandal has set us back whenever a city experiences the kind of scandal we 're experiencing , businesses always hesitate photo john m fabrizi , president of the bridgeport city council , called yesterday for the immediate resignation of mayor joseph p ganim , who was convicted on federal racketeering charges under the city charter , mr fabrizi will automatically succeed mr ganim if he quits or is imprisoned \( associated press \)

miami , june 19 when the mets saw that the yankees were rained out today , they could n't be blamed for hoping for the same here yet a steady , threehour afternoon rain slowed just in time for their series finale against the florida marlins to be played it turned out to be a sour development for the mets , as they lost , 51 , before 10 , 400 at pro player stadium the loss dropped the mets into last place in the national league east , a halfgame behind the marlins the mets might have benefited from a rainout for a couple of reasons first , it would have allowed them to leave town early for the return home in anticipation of their weekend series against the yankees at shea stadium second , it would have enabled them to bypass mike bacsik who entered the game with a 11 record but a 1038 earned run average in the pitching rotation bacsik faced the minimum number of batters through three innings , but then the marlins began teeing off against him the lefthander departed after giving up five runs , seven hits and two walks in four and twothirds innings the biggest blow was mike lowell s threerun homer , his 22nd of the season i threw him a notverygood changeup , bacsik said it was one pitch and unfortunately one pitch cost the ballgame juan pierre opened the fourth for florida with a single up the middle , stole second and was sacrificed to third by luis castillo pierre stayed there as ivan rodriguez bounced a single off ty wigginton s glove at third that brought up lowell the long ball hurt bacsik again in the fifth shortstop alex gonzalez connected on a 10 pitch his shot to leftcenter field was estimated at 444 feet and hit off the upperdeck facing where paul warfield s name is listed in the miami dolphins' ring of honor chad allen followed with a popfly double that barely eluded a lunging roberto alomar in short right field one out later , pierre caught center fielder tsuyoshi shinjo playing too shallow and shaded toward left his drive to center landed about 25 feet short of the fence and went for a triple , scoring allen manager art howe said bacsik pitched better than the results showed bacsik said he was not going to worry whether he would be demoted again if i get to stay , that s great , he said if i do n't , that s fine too it s out of my control meanwhile , the mets struggled against the lefthander tommy phelps , a 28yearold who has pitched in the minors for most of his career phelps allowed the mets three hits and two walks over seven shutout innings , striking out six he kept the ball low in the zone and kept us off balance all night , wigginton said only in phelps s final inning did he permit more than one base runner that was when jeromy burnitz singled with one out and went to second on vance wilson s walk but jason phillips struck out and shinjo bounced into an easy force play the mets finally broke through in the eighth , in part because of reliever michael tejera s error with one out , jose reyes , who went 0 for 4 , reached second when tejera threw away his infield roller alomar drove him in with a single to right with the loss , the mets finished their road trip at 64 yet the game will be forgotten quickly once the weekend begins in this season of disappointment , the yankees series might well serve as the mets' world series it will be a new experience for the lefthander tom glavine , the met with the most impressive r sum while with atlanta , glavine faced the yankees twice in world series games and four times during the regular season he is 01 in the world series starts , but 21 during the regular season , with a 251 era i 've been in some big rivalry games , said glavine , who is scheduled to pitch saturday , but none like the one coming up so far i have n't heard anything to suggest that it wo n't be a very big deal cliff floyd also will be a firsttimer in the series asked about the biggest rivalry he has participated in , the outfielder pointed to the marlins against tampa bay we played two series against them and the total attendance was like 25 , 000 , the former marlin said it meant nothing it was a joke but this should be really something tonight s game was hardly the momentumbuilder for the yankees series that howe envisioned but we 'll be ready on friday night , he said inside pitch the mets announced thursday that all gates at shea stadium would be open on friday two and a half hours before the yankees game normally only gate c is opened that early photos jeromy burnitz ducked out of the way of a high pitch by marlins starter tommy phelps in the third burnitz was 1 for 4 \( reuters \) \( pg d1 \) mike bacsik started for the mets and gave up all five runs before departing with two outs in the fifth \( associated press \) \( pg d3 \)
authorities investigating three shooting deaths last week at convenience stores in the charleston , wva , region said yesterday that they suspected that at least two victims were not randomly chosen and that their shootings might be related to drugs early fears that a random serial sniper was carrying out the shootings led agents from the federal bureau of investigation and the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms , including members of the washingtonarea sniper task force , to west virginia over the weekend sheriff dave tucker of kanawha county said investigators , including officers riding bicycles door to door , had developed some good , good solid leads that the second and third shootings were related to narcotics no suspect has been identified , and police officials said it was too early to speculate on motives we 've never had something like this here , this mindboggling , sheriff tucker said if you do have something that could be of that magnitude , you do n't wait till on down the line to bring in help the first killing was on aug 10 , when gary carrier jr , 44 , was shot in the head at a pay telephone near a gomart store here , the authorities said on thursday , jeanie patton , 31 , of campbells creek , was shot in the head , too , as she finished pumping gasoline at a speedway store in campbells creek about an hour later , okey meadows , 26 , also of campbells creek , was shot in the neck as he paid for milk at a security window at a gomart store in cedar grove , 14 miles southeast of charleston ballistics tests determined that ms patton and mr meadows were shot with the same weapon , atf agents said sheriff tucker said it was probably a 22caliber rifle tests on the bullet from the first shooting were incomplete the authorities said the area of the shootings on thursday was known for heavy drug trafficking , especially methamphetamine the charleston daily mail , citing county court records , reported that none of the victims had arrests on drug charges
environmental advocacy groups filed an ethics complaint yesterday against a judge who struck down a nationwide land conservation rule last month the groups say the judge , clarence a brimmer of federal district court in wyoming , had 400 , 000 to 11 million invested in the oil and gas industries , which stand to benefit from his ruling the judge s 2001 financial disclosure forms show that he held stock and royalty interests in 15 oil and gas companies , which account for about half the assets disclosed the forms , which put assets into ranges of values , showed that the judge held 50 , 000 to 500 , 000 in stock in each of bp , exxon mobil and chevron texaco he also received royalties from merit energy , quintana petroleum and marathon oil while the numbers are not current , given the fluctuation in the stock market , he had the holdings at the time he began to preside over the case a judge simply cannot rule in a case where he has a financial interest , said douglas t kendall , executive director of the community rights counsel , which filed the complaint along with citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington for a judge to do so in this important a case will severely undermine public confidence in the judicial branch the judge issued a statement yesterday saying my financial holdings include certain gas and oil companies none was a party to wyoming v us department of agriculture i also own some mineral interests , but am not aware of any that are located within a national forest during the more than two years this matter has been pending in my court there have been thousands of pages of documents filed and numerous hearings conducted the parties in the case have never raised any issue about the propriety of my involvement mr kendall said , the parties did not seek judge brimmer s recusal because they had no idea of his stock holdings judicial disclosure forms are very hard to obtain last month , judge brimmer struck down a rule that prohibited road building in areas that had neither been developed nor designated wilderness , commonly referred to as a roadless rule the rule , which was passed in the waning days of the clinton administration , affects about 30 percent of the nation s forest land judge brimmer called such rules a thinly veiled attempt to designate 'wilderness areas' he also wrote that the rules , which took two years to develop and pass , were a rush to give president clinton lasting notoriety in the annals of environmentalism the oil and gas industries , which had lobbied against the rules , said after the decision that it would open up billions of dollars worth of gas and oil in the west the roadless rule has been batted back and forth in the federal courts over the last two years in 2001 , an idaho court issued a ban against the rule , which was later overturned by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit , in california judge brimmer s decision is at odds with that ruling , and environmental advocacy groups have appealed it to the united states court of appeals for the 10th circuit
washington , jan 28 the monthlong ethics crisis at the united states olympic committee that has focused on lloyd ward , its chief executive , led several united states senators today to call for a drastic overhaul of the beleaguered organization s structure the changes are expected to come by revising the amateur sports act of 1978 they could shrink the 123member board of directors to fewer than 20 and sharply pare the 21person executive committee in addition , senator ben nighthorse campbell , republican of colorado , said at a senate commerce committee hearing today that he favored some form of federal regulation of the olympic committee for 20 years , i 've opposed federal oversight over usoc decisionmaking , he said the time has come now to reconsider that situation ward and marty mankamyer , the usoc president , have a fractious relationship , but today they encouraged congressional action to fix what they called flaws in the usoc governance and to streamline their organization this structure will not serve athletes or deliver on our mandate , ward said we have five directors for every staff member that s top heavy ward told the senators that he would resign if the usoc board and executive committee asked him to , and he suggested that mankamyer stand for a similar vote of confidence in a written statement that he did not deliver orally , he said i was offered the opportunity to walk away from all of this emotional turmoil with a very attractive financial settlement if i would simply go quietly i refused he declined to comment afterward , and mankamyer said she was unaware of such an offer turmoil inside the olympic committee is nothing new , but recently it has grown far noisier than usual its ethics committee found this month that ward had created the appearance of a conflict of interest in telling a staff member to provide help to a venture proposed by his brother and a childhood friend to supply backup power for the coming pan american games in august the olympic executive committee concurred with the finding , 183 , but its refusal to impose heavy sanctions on ward led to the resignations of brian derwin , a usoc board member patrick rodgers , its ethics officer and three members of the ethics committee ward s punishment , if any , is to be financial , in the reduction of his bonus ward reiterated today that he made an error in judgment but said his hands off help , through the staff member , to his brother s company s proposal , was done to benefit athletes , given his brother s knowledge of power shortages in the dominican republic , where the pan american games will be held the infighting at the committee has continued unabated last week seven top committee officials accused mankamyer of working to undermine ward and of interfering with the ethics investigation they demanded her resignation last week scandal seems to follow the usoc like dogs following a meat wagon , senator ron wyden , democrat of oregon , said campbell described the aftermath of the ethics investigation as an olympicsize food fight that fight continued at the witness table , when ward and rodgers , the former ethics officer , engaged in a testy debate over whether ward should have been more seriously penalized by the ethics committee and whether rodgers made unauthorized forays into the electronic calendar kept in ward s computer it was and remains clear to me that lloyd ward abused his position , rodgers said this is a case of it s everybody s fault but mr ward s rodgers was accused by the ethics committee of not providing ward with the requisite ethics counseling when he first learned of ward s use of a staff member to advance the proposal made by his brother s company rodgers said he had given ward counsel several times ward said he has his own reason to tell halftruths and innuendoes he is conducting his own personal vendetta the bickering between ward and rodgers , which occurred as mankamyer looked on , prompted senator john b breaux , democrat of louisiana , to provide occupational counsel i just hope none of you at the table have to work together in the future , he said the conduct of the ethics committee also came under scrutiny , including whether kenneth m duberstein , the panel s chairman , had a conflict of interest the duberstein group , his consulting concern , lobbies the senate on behalf of general motors , and ward is a member of gm s board i was generally aware around 2000 that mr ward had joined the board of general motors , duberstein said under questioning by senator john mccain , republican of arizona , chairman of the commerce committee we have no business with boards of directors he continued , at no time did it occur to me that the work of my firm would create a personal conflict he said a search of his email messages uncovered a usoc disclosure form which he cited as the only request to fill out the form but he never received it from his secretary had he filled it out , he said , he would not have listed the gmward connection as a conflict rodgers said , however , that the email was the last of several requests to duberstein , some of them in conversations , to disclose possible conflicts mccain said he was surprised that the ethics report offered no recommendations for a penalty and regretted the absence of the panel s counsel , fred fielding , whom he said he would subpoena for another hearing in a month or so duberstein said mankamyer did not want the panel to suggest potential punishment but mccain said , according to usoc regulations , you 're supposed to make recommendations he added , any time i ask for a report , i ask for recommendations photo lloyd ward , right , listening to marty mankamyer testify yesterday

letter s contents were unknown to scholars until now , one line was published in 1924 , in the first catalogue raisonn of van gogh s work scholars believe it is the only example of van gogh s writing a letter on the back of a drawing in the letter , van gogh tells theo of his attempt to persuade gauguin to work with him in arles gauguin s presence led to their tempestuous relationship and the

strengthen their holdings in the works of german artists with whom he has worked for more than 30 years the st louis art museum was high on his list because he knew it already had outstanding works by german artists from a bequest by morton d may , a department store heir they include paintings by emil nolde , ludwig kirchner and oskar kokoschka , along with 37 works by max beckmann most museums in america are interested in the single artist , not a certain time in art , mr werner said we did a lot of work to introduce this whole generation to the public , especially to see the relationship these german artists had to one another brent benjamin , director of the museum , said that it had slowly been adding to the may gift since receiving it in 1983 the may bequest was the inspiration , he said it also became a question of how st louis could distinguish itself from other mediumsize comprehensive museums in the nation as a result of the talks , the museum acquired 15 works by artists ranging from joseph beuys to sigmar polke , many of which mr werner had held for years from his own collection he has sent the museum three works , by mr polke , georg baselitz and a r penck , on

since connecticut began moving some of its convicts to outofstate prisons four years ago to ease overcrowding and save money , it has paid a steep price in lawsuit settlements and stinging criticism over two prisoners who came home in body bags the program has fared better in the last few years , and does better still in the budget lawmakers approved this week tucked into the fine print of the budget , which cleared the state senate last night , is a plan to quintuple the number of prisoners shipped to other states the democrats who control the legislature had been hostile to the transfers , which have moved nearly 500 inmates to virginia prisons but democratic leaders have agreed to let gov john g rowland , a republican , transfer another 2 , 000 of the state s 20 , 832 inmates in exchange for money for pilot projects that might reduce the prison population lawmakers are also hoping to reap an eventual 18 million a year in savings that could be used to blunt other spending cuts and tax increases , as well as to avoid the huge investments and political scuffles required to build new prisons but the steppedup transfer program which drew little notice amid the wrangling over other , higherprofile issues like state aid to local governments is drawing groans from many quarters that are just now hearing about it these include the unions that represent the state s corrections officers , who worry about lost jobs defense lawyers , who say the distance will make it hard for them to interact with clients community advocates , who say the millions of dollars spent out of state would be better applied to the local economy and families of inmates , who say the transfers cause them great hardship they and others accuse governor rowland of putting savings ahead of common sense some have even suggested he may be trying to help his former chief of staff , david o'leary mr o'leary , who left the governor s inner circle in 1997 , is now a 4 , 500amonth lobbyist for corrections corporation of america , a nashvillebased company that is one of the nation s biggest operators of forprofit prisons steve owen , a spokesman for the company , said it was interested in the contract to handle connecticut s overflow and had more than enough empty beds , though none are in the northeast it stinks , said tom sellas , a union lobbyist , calling the proposal another deal where rowland is going to take care of one of his old friends michele sullivan , the governor s spokeswoman , said that there has not been any contact by mr o'leary with the governor s office on this topic and that we do n't even know whom he specifically represents besides , she said , any selection would have to go out for bid mr o'leary described himself as a friend of the governor , but said it was totally untrue that mr rowland s interest in exporting prisoners had anything to do with cronyism many inmates' relatives , however , complain about the price they say they will pay they say the smartest thing the governor could do to combat crime would be to help inmates stay in touch with family and friends eventually , these prisoners will be released , and they wo n't have the support system they need , and they 'll end up back in prison , said anne mcnamara of stamford , whose son has been incarcerated in virginia for the last three years exporting prisoners is breaking the backs of the families of the prisoners connecticut began shipping out prisoners in late 1999 , joining at least 20 other states its agreement awarded virginia 11 million a year in exchange for housing 500 inmates at wallens ridge , a state prison it had just completed on a remote mountaintop in big stone gap from the start , governor rowland pushed to expand the program , but he met with opposition from democratic leaders in the general assembly , including representatives william r dyson and michael p lawlor they favored alternative ways of combating overcrowding , like making it harder to put people back in prison for technical violations of their parole , and argued that transfers should be a last resort the transfers to wallens ridge were also a fiasco because of harsh practices there within the first year of the program , two inmates died the first , david tracy , committed suicide within a few months of his release date the second , larry frazier , died after guards used a stun gun on him connecticut paid 750 , 000 last year to mr tracy s heirs and 11 million to mr frazier s to settle charges that both men had medical conditions that should have precluded their transfers by late 2001 , connecticut had ceased using that prison and begun shifting prisoners to the greensville correctional center in jarratt , va by most accounts , that prison has a much better track record , and connecticut s department of corrections fills the 500 beds there entirely with volunteers among the many draws cited by inmates who volunteered to go are the ability to smoke , enjoy soft drinks and spend more time outdoors as well as an abundance of female corrections officers the inmates like it there , said gerard a smyth , connecticut s chief public defender if greensville could absorb all 2 , 000 connecticut inmates to be moved under the expanded transfers , many say the program would be easier for its critics to swallow but virginia correction officials will not confirm that they have space the numbers in the new budget suggest that virginia is not the only option being considered for the 2 , 000 inmates an analysis by connecticut s office of policy and management shows that the state spends an average of 89 a day on each inmate it houses itself , and 68 on those it sends to virginia private prisons , it reports , charge only 58 a day so , to get the full 1825 million a year in savings that was built into the budget , connecticut would have to send at least 1 , 000 inmates to private prisons state officials say that while that may be what the budget numbers imply , they would be under no requirement to send inmates to private prisons when the time comes and would use beds that became available in places like greensville , given the chance some critics argue that connecticut would be better off investing money in programs that reduce recidivism for that reason , representatives dyson and lawlor said they agreed to drop their opposition to the transfers only when the governor promised 25 million this fiscal year and 5 million next to support a long list of proposals they have championed for years shelley stellmacher of waterbury , whose husband , russell , was sentenced last summer to 10 years in prison for robbing a drug dealer , says those investments will come as a comfort to inmates' families she said her husband put in for a transfer to greensville last fall when they were having marital problems and then regretted it once they made up taking off from work , she has visited him four times but because they both recently had surgery , the phone soon became their lifeline each 15minute collect call , the only kind inmates are typically allowed to make , cost her 10 so , she said , even though she works for sbc communications , her phone was disconnected when she was unable to pay the bill if 2 , 000 more families end up with similar problems , ms stellmacher said , her heart goes out to them think about what this does to the families left here in connecticut photo shelley stellmacher of waterbury , conn , has visited her husband , russell , four times since he was transferred last year from a prison in connecticut to the greensville correctional center in jarratt , va \( photo by george ruhe for the new york times \)
harir , iraq , march 27 hundreds of mudcaked american paratroopers dug a ring of foxholes and bunkers around an airstrip here in northern iraq today that will be used as a base for cargo planes carrying m1a1 abrams tanks , bradley fighting vehicles and american soldiers about 1 , 000 paratroopers landed at this airstrip in kurdishcontrolled iraq last night in advance of a possible northern front in the iraq war some cargo planes arrived during the night , but none landed here today though american military officials here declined to comment , kurdish officials said preparations for an attack in the north were under way this is the beginning , said hoshyer zubari , a senior kurdish official as passing kurdish motorists waved at them , soldiers from the 173rd airborne brigade worked through the day building defensive positions in fields around the rainsoaked airfield , which sits at the bottom of an alpine valley two large transport helicopters , a few new tents and two machinegun nests could be seen at the airstrip , but there were no signs of tanks or attack helicopters on wednesday , heavily armed kurdish soldiers sealed the area as the americans arrived kurdish officials who said they knew of the landing in advance questioned today why the americans had parachuted in instead of arriving by air transport a small mountain range separates the airfield from the nearest iraqi positions , about 25 miles away for the last several weeks , kurdish forces have been repairing , grading and guarding the airstrip , and they have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of american ground troops the kurds broke with baghdad in 1991 and have enjoyed selfrule under united states protection for the last decade today , kurdish soldiers continued to block almost all access to the americans , ordering cars that stopped in the area to move on paratroopers approached on the side of the road declined to answer questions but one special forces soldier told journalists that more forces were to follow and that american and kurdish soldiers would attack iraqi positions together special operations forces have been active in northern iraq for several months , but the numbers have increased sharply in the last week american jets delivered one of their heaviest bombardments to date tonight , dropping more than a halfdozen heavy bombs on iraqi positions near the frontline village of qushtapa , which sits roughly 30 miles north of the city of kirkuk this morning , they struck other iraqi positions near the village of kalak , near mosul bombs also struck the positions of ansar alislam , a militant islamic group that american and kurdish forces are expected to attack soon in a sign of the continuing buildup in that region south of here , four american cargo planes arrived last night at an airstrip outside sulaimaniya , the closest airfield to the site of the expected attack an estimated 650 ansar alislam militants control a small pocket of territory on the border with iran here , farther north , special operations soldiers appear to be laying the groundwork for a possible attack on iraqi forces around mosul kurdish officials confirmed that 50 to 100 american soldiers had already established a base in the akre district near mosul while soldiers in the south endure desert sandstorms and a potentially hostile population , northern iraq has a climate similar to that of the eastern united states , and kurds , who have suffered gas attacks and mass killings under saddam hussein , are expected to cheer the americans' arrival residents of akre reacted joyously to their presence it s very good , said sherwan amin , a 20yearold student i wish they had come earlier

jeff bagwell flipped hideki matsui s grounder to pitcher billy wagner covering at first , thus ending perhaps the strangest nohitter in major league baseball history the astros looked as if they did not quite know how to react when wagner pumped his fist after getting the final out in the 80 victory over the yankees last night at yankee stadium , second baseman jeff kent looked at him as if he were deranged , not realizing what had just happened all told , there were no hugs on the infield and no bench players charging out of the dugout just whom do you hug when six pitchers combine for a nohitter \? i kind of expected him to hug me , but he did n't , wagner said of bagwell it was kind of a weird situation after starter roy oswalt left the game after two pitches in the second inning with a groin injury , he handed the ball to peter munro , who went two and twothirds innings , followed by kirk sarloos for an inning and twothirds brad lidge , who was credited with victory , then took the ball for two innings , followed by octavio dotel for one , and then wagner with the exception of wagner , and perhaps dotel , none of the six are intimidating but for one night , they were simply unhittable you never expect to nohit a team , but occasionally it does happen , said astros manager jimy williams , who was a thirdbase coach for the atlanta braves in 1991 when kent mercker , alejandro pe a and mark wohlers combined to throw a nohitter one guy usually ends up going the nine innings or maybe two but six \? i ca n't recall that ever happening it never had williams said that the nohit bid had nothing to do with how he managed the game but bringing wagner , his ace closer , into an 80 game in the ninth inning suggests otherwise when history is being made at yankee stadium , everybody wants to be a part of that it was hard , but i'm very , very happy , dotel said i know i'm going to be in the baseball books for a long time because of this wagner said in cases like this , you just try to throw strikes and throw as hard as you can for a lot of us it was our first appearance here at yankee stadium , and to be a part of history here in this park is amazing

long for this world by michael byers 432 pp boston houghton mifflin company 24 michael byers s first novel might have been something more obvious and less ardent the cautionary tale of a geneticist risking his career for the sake of one patient instead , long for this world , set in late1990 s seattle , is a piercing scientific and familial romance exploring the privilege of what nadezhda mandelstam called ordinary heartbreaks , it offers some extraordinary ones too dr henry moss has the usual yearnings and fears for his wife , ilse , and his children , 14yearold darren , who takes after him physically and is also interested in science and science fiction , and 17yearold sandra , a straighta student and basketball star but he can count on having the time to work things out time is n't something that henry can give his young subjects , however suffering from hickman syndrome , they age rapidly and pathetically , their heads seeming to expand as their bodies waste away most people discovered there was such a thing as hickman only when their child began to look funny at the age of 2 or 3 hair turning gray and falling out weird folds around the eyes then it was arthritis at 10 , osteoporosis for the girls at 11 , straight into senility before hitting puberty , and death from heart failure or simple old age by 19 at the very latest basing this fictional condition on hutchinsongilford progeria syndrome , byers gracefully distills the necessary background in enzymes , nucleotides and gene sequences , and then does more these children lived and died , henry thinks , as a recognizable group , as though they had signed away the bulk of their genetic birthright in exchange for ownership of their one small mistake , a mistake their bodies cherished and preserved while he has found the gene that causes hickman , henry has no cure at hand , which makes his research increasingly painful and now his only local patient , william durbin , whom he has studied and loved for 12 years , is dying when henry s lab does the usual blood work on a new subject , giles benhamouda , and his family , the results are exhilarating giles s healthy older brother , thomas , has hickman too , yet none of its signs on the contrary , the 17yearold is so physically perfect \( his behavior is another matter \) that something must have neutralized the first flaw if they can isolate this anomaly , henry should be able to synthesize a treatment for other patients the smooth ceo of the biotech giant allied genomics claims that this breakthrough would be a sort of boutique item for us it s not cancer , henry it s hickman rather more profitably , such a product could be a fountain of youth for everyone else but if henry follows the proper protocols , any benefits will come years too late for william hospitalized or confined to his room \( 'my domain , ' he would say , sitting by the window and waving his arm stiffly at the view \) , he has lost little of his wit but grown increasingly wistful william knows that he looks like a creature from outer space , and he would n't mind being one either as it turns out , thomas is the alien among them , dehumanized by his invincibility what would you do first if you knew you would live to be a million years old \? henry wonders what would it matter what you did \? what would you care about \? nothing yourself there are many moments of quiet awareness and expectation in long for this world , but it is also a noisy novel of manners and money \( william advises henry to get out of the market soon \) until his discovery , henry had little exposure to the new seattle , a place of easy paper profits , but his wife sees it wherever she turns when ilse is around , byers is at his loosest , and it suits him an austrian orthopedist turned hospital administrator , ilse is desperate to do something of value she is also hilariously combustible , a liberal twisting in the conservative wind her debates with her complacent neighbor , jackie , the wife of a microsoft millionaire , crackle with attraction and repulsion at one point , this woman , who is busy ridding her house of all historical detail , explains how the company simply kept chucking money at her husband every time he wanted to leave now retired , even he knows he s a ghost of his corporate self tired of hearing jackie talk about his glory days , he calls out , i'm not dead , you know her chipper response \?

austin , tex george bush is more than two years gone from the texas statehouse , but his signature cando issue as a presidential candidate education showed increasing wear and tear as this year s legislative session ground to a close for one thing , his state , like others , had to relax the testing standards for the new federal no child left behind act to avoid failing youngsters wholesale and subjecting schools to federal penalties for another , the budget crunch of the less glamorous , more revenuestarved era of statehouse politicking that succeeded governor bush had plans afoot to cut such basics as textbook financing and to procrastinate once more on a revision of the state s outdated schoolaid formula but of all the products of the education hothouse that lent such bloom to the bush candidacy , none is looking more wilted than that beloved conservative stratagem called charter schools these are independent schools run at public expense as a nonpublic alternative to public schools in the closing legislative hours , the latest sorry wrinkle in the charter agenda was struck down a siphoning of public funds for computers to create virtual schools for students working in their homes but the charter school movement lives on , six years old and costing taxpayers 5 , 000 per pupil , with limited state oversight on how the money is spent the movement , with its ballyhooing of entrepreneurial alternatives to public schools , helped governor bush polish his image as an education innovator but the schools' shortcomings have become clearer since he left town , and the state s budget crunch clearly points to the unfairness of diverting shrinking public funds to private experimentation unsurprisingly , considering the deliberate reining in of state controls , some of the schools have become standouts not for academic excellence but for the sort of greed and gamesmanship more familiar to patronage politics nepotistic staffing , inflated attendance , false academic records , exorbitant salaries and employees with unchecked criminal backgrounds , according to investigators the head of one troubled charter school left town in the middle of the night and took all the furniture , stunning officials , who suddenly had to accommodate stranded students thrown back on the public system critics agree that there are good exceptions , but about 25 of the 200 charter schools created so far have gone under or have been closed for management abuses , with millions of dollars unaccounted for these scandals helped force the enactment of the first serious fiscal controls over charter schools two years ago but this year , proponents rebounded with virtual schools and other taxdepleting variations on the charter theme there were even calls to roll back the state controls as the new charter constituency put counterpressure on lawmakers if anything , more budget and educational accounting , not less , is needed early assessment tests are finding that public schools are outperforming charter schools by nearly a two to one margin this pits the charter movement against the other one of president bush s headlined cures for schoolhouse ills , his no child left behind mandate to raise standards by rigorous , early testing of students as that law takes effect , texas is among a number of states that have had to ease their own thirdgrade reading test standards to avoid failing thousands of students and subjecting hundreds of schools to federal penalties in the preliminary stage of the new law a conflict is thus becoming clear between the more demanding no child left behind act and the laissezfaire charter schools the no child act allows students in lowperforming schools the freedom to move to betterrated schools the initial application of this feature has rated 46 texas schools as lowperforming significantly , nearly twothirds of them are charter schools , created on the promise of improving on the public system nevertheless , the charter movement continues to be a serious rival for everscarcer public funds a charter school being planned here by the university of texas promises to be a worthy stateoftheart experiment , and taxpayers can be pretty well assured that in this case , nobody is likely to decamp with the desks in the dark of night but it will still divert 15 million a year here from more hardpressed and effective public schools at the same time , local governments are being forced to pick up the slack as this strapped state shifts more costs downward it is in texas that president bush s education ideas took flight , and gave the nation hope now , it is in texas where they 're coming home to roost if people see where we are now in this state , says state representative garnet coleman , a democrat , they 'll begin to understand where the nation is going

baghdad , iraq , dec 7 the way the exiles tell it , they are a gift to iraq , shining role models for the new state people look up to those of us coming from abroad , said mowaffak alrubaie , a member of the iraqi governing council who lived in london for nearly 25 years he added that the exiles bring culture and progress and advancement from the west , as well as democracy and respect for human rights half the governing council , and nearly all of the top political figures in iraq today , are former opposition leaders who lived abroad during most of saddam hussein s years in power with iraq moving toward a new political configuration , iraqis are debating whether these men are the nation s future or its past for the united states , it is an important question because successive administrations have built lasting , interdependent relationships with some of the iraqi exiles over two decades american officials acknowledge that a new homegrown iraqi leadership could be less predictable and , perhaps , less friendly today , most of the former opposition leaders appear intoxicated with their roles as interim leaders after decades in the political wilderness last month , jalal talabani , a longtime kurdish leader , served as president of the governing council the first time , his aides pointed out , that a kurd had been the nation s leader he set out on a tour of the region , and the day he returned he remarked , his voice reflecting the wonder of it all , who would have thought that a kurd could lead a delegation to turkey to improve relations with iraq \? mr talabani and other kurds in kurdishcontrolled northern iraq could not visit the rest of iraq under mr hussein s government , just as the exiles from abroad could not they and the exiles have their doubters and detractors , though most of the iraqi people are expecting their leaders to come from the parties who worked against the old regime from inside , said abdul latif almayah , a political scientist who is a director of the arab homeland studies center at al mustansiriya university in baghdad the exile leaders , he added , have been tested over the last months on the governing council and failed to achieve the things they talked about their star has dimmed in washington , too before the war , some bush administration officials , including paul d wolfowitz , the deputy defense secretary , advocated creating a provisional iraqi government made up entirely of iraqi exiles but in general , bush administration officials now say , enthusiasm for the exiles has diminished over the months of occupation , as they have proved less reliable allies than many american officials had supposed before the war ahmad chalabi , who had been a favorite among pentagon officials , is now out of favor among some because of his sharp public criticism of the bush administration when he visited washington in september , he was not granted a meeting with president bush there s certainly been an evolution in the role of the exiles , a senior administration official said in the beginning , people were looking to the exiles because everyone else was the great unknown now their prominence and authority has declined somewhat , because the veil has been lifted , and we 've found over six months of being in iraq that there are other people we know and have come to trust in truth , most of the leaders washington has come to know since the war were exiles , too , but they were not among those who curried favor in washington all of these former opposition leaders realize that under the selfgovernment plan they approved on nov 15 , they may have to win a popular election to remain in power most are already campaigning , though none of them are calling it that it s a bit early for campaigning , said hamid majeed mousa , leader of the iraqi communist party , which has a europeanstyle social democratic platform he lived in prague and kurdishcontrolled iraq for several decades though he said he was not campaigning , mr mousa acknowledged talking to people in different parts of the country we have visited struggling families , he added , with the general goal of making my party influential and important mahmoud othman , a kurdish leader on the governing council , said he had been on television and visited people in basra , najaf and other points in southern iraq where kurds had not been able to travel for many years , though he claimed no particular interest in continued national public office the same is generally true of mr talabani though politicians in most democratic countries do not acknowledge their ambitions until the time is right , it is hard to find a former exile leader who professes any interest in leading the country iyad alawi , for example , is a prominent exile leader who has had close relations with the cia and who has been vigorously working to establish a national political base since returning last spring still , he said things are so confused that i do n't want to be a part of it i think i will move to lebanon or someplace else in iraq but if they will not acknowledge their ambitions , nearly all the exile leaders are eager to describe their potential constituencies my tribe has 200 , 000 people in iraq and neighboring countries , said sheik ghazi ajil alyawar , a governing council member and tribal leader who lived in saudi arabia before the war my tribe is in nasiriya , mr rubaie said gesturing toward his bodyguards , he added , i 've got 16 blood relatives right over there while all the exiles believe that they could be elected to the transitional assembly to be chosen in june , they also realize it will be a greater reach to move up to the next stages the interim government , the government to be elected in 2005 or even the presidency or premiership without expressing immediate interest in any of that , many of the former exile leaders promote the things they have learned abroad living abroad gives us this amazing experience , learning how wonderful democracy is , mr mousa said they also said they had acquired an ability to compromise that seems alien to iraqi culture i call it the allornothing phenomenon , mr rubaie said compromise is a dirty word in arabic for iraqis everything is a statement of principle as sheik yawar put it people here speak from their heart and when you speak from your heart , you have a hard time hearing anyone else but for all the talk of their special qualifications , many of these former opposition leaders still betray a certain insecurity about their future the governing council decided last week that it would try to stay in power after the provisional government is formed in june , despite an earlier agreement to dissolve photos chart finding a way back home shown are four exile leaders who have been longtime allies of the united states and four others who , while they may have been known before , have risen to prominence since the fall of saddam hussein s government allies iyad alawi leader of the iraqi national accord , a collection of former baathists who fled the country during the 1990 s lived in london massoud barzani leader of kurdistan democratic party and the largest of two kurdishcontrolled enclaves lived in kurdish iraq ahmad chalabi leader of the iraqi national congress independent businessman lived in several countries over the last two decades jalal talabani leader of the patriotic union of kurdistan and the smaller of two kurdishcontrolled enclaves lived in kurdish iraq newcomers sheik

near camp patriot , kuwait , march 21 it took only minutes swooping silently out of the persian gulf night , navy seals seized two iraqi offshore oil terminals in bold raids that ended early this morning , overwhelming lightly armed iraqi guards and claiming a bloodless victory in the battle for iraq s vast oil empire the seals launched the operation from quiet , highspeed jet boats that whisked them from a secret base in kuwait to the terminals , about 25 miles from the iraqi shore the commandos used shotguns and crowbars to break through metal doors , surprising guards who appeared to be preparing for bed they faced no resistance and took more than 40 iraqi prisoners from the two sites when they saw our guns , they put their hands right up , said pat , a 36yearold seal who helped direct one of the raiding parties a small detachment of polish special operations forces assisted in the mission with its speed , stealth and precision , the operation exemplified the kind of unconventional warfare that has been embraced by secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld and is likely to play a prominent role in the war with iraq the terminals , southwest from the mouth of the shatt al arab , are the end points of iraq s sole pipeline into the persian gulf essentially milelong gas stations built on stilts , the terminals at their peak served four supertankers at a time , pumping more than two million barrels a day american officials had warned that saddam hussein might try to set the terminals ablaze or open their spigots onto the gulf , as he did during the persian gulf war in 1991 the five million barrels of crude oil released by iraq into gulf waters at that time blackened beaches for hundreds of miles and devastated marine habitats for years afterward our goal is to prevent an environmental disaster , said commodore robert harward , the commander of the san diegobased naval special warfare forces task group that coordinated the raid the leader of one of the seal teams said the iraqi guards had wired parts of the mina al bakr terminal with explosives but the effort seemed halfhearted , and most of the guards apparently disregarded orders to destroy the platform , he said i think they were actually relieved to have the place taken over , said the seal team leader , lieutenant wennen like most of the seals interviewed , he declined to use his full name the oil terminals clearly held nearly as much public relations value as military significance for the bush administration , which is trying to convince the islamic world and skeptical europeans that the united states intends to safeguard iraq s oil wealth for the good of the iraqi people the pentagon allowed a newspaper reporter and television crew to observe the navy special operations mission from a hightech command center aboard the valley forge , a ticonderogaclass missile cruiser five miles from the oil terminals but it prohibited release of the information for nearly 24 hours , arguing the need to preserve security for continuing operations at the front of a crowded control room lit by the green glow of radar terminals , a large screen showed realtime video images of the raids taken from an infrared camera in the nose of a uh60 sea hawk helicopter that hovered near the two oil platforms the raids began at 10 25 thursday night , with two speed boats pulling alongside mina al bakr , the main terminal , and disgorging a seal platoon each moments later , two similar boats landed at the second terminal , khawr al amaya , five miles to the north the seals wearing green jumpsuits and body armor packed with ammunition , their faces shrouded by black balaclavas could be seen in the grainy video wending up metal stairwells and across narrow causeways in search of iraqi guards hands up ! ' someone shouted inside the control room as the iraqis surrendered at 10 27 pm , causing the crowd of navy officers and radar operators to burst into applause to protect the seals , four mark5 jetpowered patrol boats , each armed with four twinbarreled 50caliber machine guns , were stationed around the oil terminals like sentries navy snipers were also placed inside helicopters overhead within hours of the seal landing , a detachment of marines accompanied by navy bomb experts arrived at the terminals to guard the prisoners and search for booby traps the seals found a cache of rocketpowered grenades , small arms , ammunition and explosives at mina al bakr during a tour of that terminal on friday morning , nearly two dozen iraqi prisoners could be seen lying on mattresses , their heads covered in grain sacks and hands bound behind them with white plastic cuffs half a dozen marines armed with m4 carbines stood guard the pentagon prohibited release of photographs of the prisoners navy officials said the prisoners would be interrogated and then sent to a more permanent detention center at an undisclosed location they said none of the prisoners had been wounded in the raid the seal platoons and navy special boat teams that took part in the raid came from a 700member task force based in kuwait that represents the largest assemblage in history of naval special warfare forces on foreign soil the large size of the navy special warfare contingent in the region today underscored the expanded role american special operations forces in general are playing in the new war against iraq in the first gulf war , special operations forces which also include the army s green berets , delta force and rangers , as well as air force units played supporting roles , like hunting for scud missiles or scouting bombing targets the seals set off explosions on the kuwaiti coast in a feinting operation intended to make iraqi forces believe that an amphibious invasion was under way this time , commando teams have been used earlier and more extensively , and will be playing a more central role in combat missions , military officials said shortly before launching time thursday night , lt jg jake heller , a 26yearold harvard graduate and the officer in charge of the special boat teams , tried to capture the gravity of the moment for his anxious crews we 're going to change the world tonight , he told the seamen as dusk fell on a kuwaiti pier and war loomed ahead let s do it right
the parent organization of the american stock exchange has decided to discuss a sale with more possible buyers including the members of the exchange because talks to sell it to a leveraged buyout firm have made no progress nasd , which now owns the exchange , is exploring other options after gtcr golder rauner informed us they are stepping back to reassess the agreement in principle to purchase the american stock exchange , said nancy condon , a spokeswoman for nasd one person involved in the talks said that nasd would prefer to sell the exchange to its members the traders who work on the exchange if the gtcr deal could not be completed that person added that nasd was willing to consider breaking up the amex and selling different product lines to different buyers gtcr has apparently not lost interest in the exchange but may have been taken aback by the speed of changes in the industry and by intensified criticism of the amex in several areas i talked to colin roche , a principal of gtcr , today , salvatore sodano , the chairman and chief executive of the amex , said in an interview he reconfirmed his interest in the amex a person close to gtcr said the firm was continuing to consider and evaluate the opportunity of investing in the amex the amex is a distant third among united states stock markets in terms of listings , behind both the new york stock exchange and the nasdaq stock market it now ranks third in volume in stock options as well , behind the international securities exchange and the chicago board options exchange but it is the leader in exchangetraded mutual funds , and its willingness to innovate with new products has been greater than that of other exchanges were the amex to be broken up , the three product lines might go to different purchasers the tentative agreement with gtcr , announced in june , called for the firm to invest 110 million in the amex none of that money would go to nasd , which would , however , be released from a commitment it made to invest more money in the exchange nasd in recent days has been pressing gtcr to sign a definitive agreement , but it was unwilling to do so , one person involved in the negotiations said robert glauber , the chairman of nasd , was eager to jumpstart the process and decided to move ahead with other possibilities the amex has faced a number of issues recently , including reports of generous pay to mr sodano , who received 44 million last year , consisting of a 1 million salary , a 14 million bonus and a 2 million retention bonus that had been negotiated in 1999 and was contingent on his staying at the exchange for three years nasd agreed to buy the amex in 1998 , when it was trying to build a market of markets and viewed the amex as a complement to the nasdaq stock market , which it already controlled but few synergies developed , and nasd has since changed strategy , seeking instead to be a selfregulatory organization that does not control stock markets it has sold stock in nasdaq and will separate from ownership completely if the securities and exchange commission agrees to allow nasdaq to register as an exchange , a process that has been delayed because nasdaq has resisted adopting some rules that other stock markets follow after nasd purchased the amex in 1999 , the exchange fought successfully to keep its own regulatory operation separate last week , however , people briefed on the negotiations said that the amex and nasd had reached an agreement in principle for nasd to take over those responsibilities yesterday , amex officials said there had been discussions of such a move at the board level of both companies but that no detailed proposals had been presented or accepted the regulatory status of the amex has been under pressure since the sec staff issued a scathing report in june that criticized the exchange s regulators for failing to enforce rules and allowing specialists to treat some customers better than others it also said some exchange officials had lied to the exchange they have been suspended , and an sec investigation is continuing
albany , july 11 an official at an upstate development company said today that the company had decided not to build the nation s largest mall and tourist center in syracuse but the official with company , pyramid management group , who spoke on the condition that he not be named , said the plan for the megamall would not be abandoned altogether the mall , known as destiny usa , a 22 billion behemoth of a shopping , tourism and entertainment complex , will be erected somewhere else within new york state or in the northeast united states , he said the decision has been made not to build this project in the city of syracuse , the pyramid company official said this is something that could easily be built outside of the city , in onondaga county , or any place else in the state or any other state the official said a public announcement had been planned for monday or tuesday to outline the official reasons for the decision , which he said was the result of a series of difficulties with the city s administration specifically , company executives have grown mistrustful of the city over a series of recent issues regarding the zoning of land to be developed , as well as agreements that govern how the project will go forward , company officials said today questions were swirling today after officials of the greater syracuse chamber of commerce told the poststandard , a syracuse newspaper , that the developer had told them in a meeting last week that the project was dead but matthew j driscoll , the mayor of syracuse , said today that he had not heard from the developer , robert j congel , one of the founders of the pyramid mall empire , about whether the project would go forward in the city he has not communicated to me that destiny is done , said mr driscoll , who said he was perplexed about why the company had not communicated its concerns earlier i stand ready , willing and able to help them move this vision forward in the past year , promoters of the mall have touted its square footage \( more than twice that of the empire state building \) its amenities \( 400 stores , 30 cafes and a 20screen movie complex \) and its promise to enrich the region \( a company consultant estimated that it would create as many as 122 , 000 jobs and 125 billion in economic activity \) the company says it has invested more than 100 million to date on legal , architectural and other costs but with the likelihood of finding private investors to underwrite the entire project in question , company executives lobbied extensively this spring in albany they tried to persuade lawmakers to guarantee that the company would continue to receive tax benefits of up to 600 million over 14 years that it is entitled to under the state s empire zone program , even if that program is later disbanded though no formal bill on the matter surfaced this session , company executives , gov george e pataki and the state s two top legislative leaders remained hopeful that a deal could be worked out , perhaps when the legislature reconvenes in a special session this fall both houses were working together to try to resolve this , charles r carrier , a spokesman for assembly speaker sheldon silver , said today , adding that mr silver had not been told that the deal was dead the speaker was always favorably impressed with the concept and what it might mean to the central new york region , he said but , on the other hand , there were a lot of difficulties in answering questions and putting together the details , and that s still where things stood when the session ended pyramid officials said they were encouraged by their experience in albany , though disappointed with the outcome what raised their ire , company officials said today , were a series of developments in syracuse they said that an effort to rezone a section at the southern end of onondaga lake as residential directly conflicted with the destiny usa project and with plans to build a 43story hotel on the site also , they said , an agreement that would dictate the relationship between the city and the company was approved by the syracuse industrial development agency before negotiations were finalized mayor driscoll rejected as false claims that any zoning changes would conflict with the project he said he had requested that a zoning vote be delayed until fall he said changes in the industrial development agency agreement had been sent to the company three days before the agreement was approved david cordeau , the president of the greater syracuse chamber of commerce , said he had met with mr congel this month he said it s not going to happen here , mr cordeau said still , mr cordeau said he spent much of today meeting with supporters of the project , trying to organize them to persuade the developers to stay in the area there s an army of people behind this project , he said none of us would be able to sleep if we did n't make one more run at this when asked if the decision to abandon the city of syracuse could change during the weekend , the pyramid official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said no this is an absolute , cutingranite decision , he said one thousand percent he added it will not be built within the city limits it will be built somewhere else several nearby states have been courting mr congel , the company official said if destiny usa is not built in the syracuse area , mr cordeau said , we will have missed the biggest opportunity we ever will have photo instead of being built on this site in syracuse , the 22 billion mall and tourist center known as destiny usa will go up elsewhere in the northeast , said an official with pyramid management group , the developer \( chris rank for the new york times \)

the bbc legends recording also offers lithe accounts of two overtures and the marche troyenne speaking of les troyens , my hunch is that sir colin davis probably prefers his later recording of this epic opera , from live performances in 2000 with the london symphony orchestra , to his 1969 version on philips with the orchestra and chorus of the royal opera house in london the newer performance is perhaps more mature and confident but i go with the earlier recording , which bristles with a younger man s fervor and offers the great tenor jon vickers at his heroic best as n e also essential is the soprano eleanor steber s 1954 account of les nuits d' t with dimitri mitropoulos conducting the columbia symphony there is a slightly tremulous quality to steber s voice in its high register but the tenderness , intelligence and directness of her singing will beguile you this work was not that well known at the time , so the performance also conveys a sense of discovery the masterworks heritage release from sony includes steber in three other berlioz orchestral songs as part of a generous and varied program leonard bernstein s 1961 recording of the fascinating sc ne lyrique la mort de cl op tre with the new york philharmonic presents an inspired conductor in his early 40 s working with one of his idols , the mezzosoprano jennie tourel , then 62 and , though vocally faded , still an incomparable artist the sony album includes bernstein s acclaimed recording of harold in italy with the fine violist william lincer finally , the oratorio l'enfance du christ captures spiritual innocence in gossamertextured music of quietly awesome beauty , qualities sensitively rendered in philippe herreweghe s recording with la chapelle royal and the collegium vocale why not give handel s messiah a break from its onerous duty as the requisite piece for the christmas season and let l'enfance du christ take over for a while \?

diplomats will at long last step aside and allow the nation s military to do what needs to be done i heard that something like one in four people say they do n't want to go to war till something happens , mr chamberlain , 36 , an electrician from douglasville , ga , said over lunch at a burger shop with two friends today , shaking his head at the thought personally , me , i think terrorist acts are going to happen anyways , if we have war or not still , he said he felt differently about this conflict with iraq than he did about the persion gulf war of 1991 it s a lot more scary this time , he said i'm not glad about it at all if there is any sense of relief in the shopping centers and workplaces of the nation on the eve of a potential war , it is mixed with little of the national cockiness that many recall accompanied the prelude to desert storm with the president setting a 48hour deadline for saddam hussein and his sons to leave power , there is little excitement at the chance to put newfangled american weapons to the test , few illusions about how costly a war could be in human life or mat riel or money the sooner we do it , the faster we do it , the better and safer the world will be , said rodolfo castillo , 40 , a fashion designer , as he watched the president s remarks on a flatscreen television above the black marble bar at le m ridien hotel in beverly hills , calif the uncertainty of what is going to happen is the worst part of it undaunted by the prospect of war , mr castillo had been spending the day readying the gown and accessories that will be worn by the singer anastacia at the academy awards ceremony on sunday night he had this to say about the president s performance tonight he made the case he was straight to the point he was coming from a position of power standing nearby , david siguaw , 36 , the hotel s director for sales and marketing and the grandson of a war veteran of world war i and ii , said , president bush pointed out quite clearly that the united nations did not live up to its responsibilities finally , we as the american people have direction , mr siguaw said after the speech he s announced directly to the american people a timeline of 48 hours but there are widespread fears that the bush administration has committed itself so thoroughly and irrevocably to war in iraq that it has left america s flanks across the world and even at home exposed to attack and there is concern that the government s willingness to go it nearly alone , at a dear price in international support , could prove fateful as far as supporting a war , i do , because i do think saddam hussein needs to get out of iraq , said alva starling , 27 , who is moving here from texas and was having lunch with a friend and fellow dentist , vanessa dowdy , of decatur , ga but i think americans would be more supportive of a war if the reasons were more clearcut why we 're going , dr starling added i think our focus is on iraq because of the president s vendetta against hussein , because of his father north korea has weapons of mass destruction that we know of , and we 're not doing anything about it iraq they have yet to be found , but we 're going in dr dowdy , 28 , then confided that her own anxieties were more personal i have cousins in the gulf , she said our one little cousin , they rushed him through boot camp i do n't feel the training they 're doing is sufficient he went in to be a mechanic , and he just went over to the front lines i think a draft would be a good thing right now on a day when the likelihood of war buoyed every major stock index , some adamant antiwar activists contemplated civil disobedience , world war ii veterans and selfdescribed aging liberals sounded equally hawkish , high school students cutting school in that timehonored observance of st patrick s day matteroffactly predicted iraqi retaliation on american soil , and parents and military dependents everywhere seemed not to know whether to exhale at last , or to begin holding their breath in earnest relatives of soldiers , not surprisingly , may be having the toughest time reconciling their conflicting emotions about the looming battle in bloomington , ind , linda reeves , 48 , a high school teacher who says she grew up in the 1960 s with a very pacifist nature and a deep skepticism of american military adventurism , says she now finds herself seeing a conflict through the eyes of her daughter tanya that would be specialist tanya stephans of the 300th military police brigade , whose reserve unit was activated in june , shipped to afghanistan and put to work guarding military detainees at bagram air base having a daughter volunteer to be in the military and suddenly having her sent somewhere , i had to do a lot of thinking and reevaluating , ms reeves said i think there is a time when we have to say , 'if we 're not willing to fight for this , then what are we willing to fight for \?

detroit , dec 8 many of the largest sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks , from the cadillac escalade to the toyota sequoia , will need to be redesigned to comply with the industry s new plan to make such vehicles less dangerous to people riding in cars a few companies , however , are already largely in compliance with the industry s voluntary plan to redesign the front ends of light trucks , specifically suv s and pickup trucks the ford motor company , for example , has redesigned even its largest suv s including the giant excursion and the lincoln navigator in such a way that they already meet the new requirement the 15 companies that agreed to the voluntary standards have until 2009 to put safer models on the road changes in vehicle design and equipment , which almost all automakers who do business in the united states agreed to last week , are aimed at addressing the safety ramifications of the growth in sales of light trucks , which account for more than half of the passenger vehicles sold in the united states each year the alterations could eventually save thousands of lives a year , according to projections made by the insurance institute for highway safety and endorsed by the automakers consumer groups say the industry is not going far enough fast enough , considering that it already knows what it needs to do they add that federal regulators should not abdicate their authority , because voluntary pacts are hard to enforce and make recalls more difficult to impose they never voluntarily agree to do anything that s a stretch , said r david pittle , a former regulator and the senior vice president for technical policy at consumers union , the publisher of consumer reports the fact that ford has already reconfigured its biggest vehicles to address the safety issues that inspired the new rules shows that the industry will not need new technologies to meet the voluntary goals the main goal is to make the bumpers and frame rails of light trucks overlap with at least half of the similar area on cars to do this , makers can lower their light trucks alternatively , they can install steel bars , known as blocker beams , underneath highriding trucks so the beams line up with car bumpers the other major change the industry agreed to last week equipping almost all vehicles , light trucks as well as cars , with side airbags is also not a technical stretch those devices are already standard on about a quarter of 2004 model vehicles and an option on another quarter honda is already in compliance with the frontend design requirements , but it does not make pickup trucks or the largest suv s auto executives and lobbyists say that equipping every vehicle with side airbags could cost about 300 each on the order of 5 billion at current production levels though many vehicles already have them this is a huge first step , said mitchel scherba , director for the structure and safety integration center at general motors we 've challenged ourselves pretty well here , he added only about 39 percent of gm s pickup trucks , large sport utility vehicles and large vans comply with the frontend design guidelines some , like the cadillac escalade , ride too far off the ground to comply with other makes and models , compliance depends on how a vehicle is configured most chevrolet suburbans do not comply , for example , but the heaviest versions with the most towing capacity do , because they ride lower mr pittle at consumers union said he thought much more needed to be done to address issues of compatibility , as the interaction between light trucks and cars is called , and said there needed to be regulatory certainty that manufacturers would live up to their promises congress set this agency up and gave it the authority , he said , referring to the national highway traffic safety administration it ought to be setting the standards it was after prodding from dr jeffrey w runge , the administrator of the traffic safety agency , that automakers agreed in february to work jointly on compatibility issues last week , the industry said it had agreed to take steps to reduce injury risks in headon and sideimpact accidents and had set a timetable for further research for sideimpact accidents , the automakers said they would start testing impact forces on crash test dummies' heads if their vehicles are to pass this test , automakers will be effectively forced to install , as standard equipment , side airbags that protect people s heads some only protect the chest area in 2000 , ford said it would lower the frame of the explorer and other big vehicles by a couple of inches to prevent them from riding over the bumpers of cars in highspeed , headon crashes the biggest fords the fseries super duty pickup truck and the excursion suv were among the first vehicles to have blocker beams installed today , the company said that only two of its vehicles did not comply with the frontend design requirements , the ford ranger pickup truck and the land rover discovery suv by comparison , none of the jeep vehicles made by the chrysler group currently complies , nor do the largest toyotas , including the land cruiser , sequoia and tundra and the lexus lx sport utility vehicle fifteen automakers from four nations signed on to make the changes to the vehicles they sell in the united states , an unprecedented global safety pact the companies include almost every wellknown brand sold in this country gm , ford , daimlerchrysler , toyota , honda , nissan , hyundai motor , kia motors , mazda , mitsubishi , volkswagen , bmw , suzuki , subaru and isuzu the lone holdout was porsche , whose spokesman said the company was not comfortable with steps that others in the industry had agreed to undertake beyond the design changes and safety measures recently announced industry engineers say that the automakers' biggest challenge is their timetable for future voluntary safety action , but it is not clear what that action will be , beyond research the industry said that within the next year it would come up with test procedures to measure how force was distributed across the front ends of vehicles , with an eye toward more sophisticated matching of vehicles within two years , the industry said it would develop test procedures aimed at measuring the stiffness of large vehicles and the structural integrity of small cars the aim is to make large vehicles less unyielding when they strike small vehicles these goals are considered much more complicated than the changes the automakers have agreed to we do n't want to just soften up the front end of trucks and suv s because there is some tradeoff in safety , said priya prasad , a safety expert at ford if we make it too soft , some selfprotection might be lost mr prasad s past research has shown that replacing light trucks with cars of the same mass would save 1 , 000 lives a year , though he said he thought that the recently announced changes could save even more dr runge , of the traffic safety agency , said the timeline for future action on measuring force and stiffness showed the industry was committed to progress this is faster than we could do it on our own , he said we 're working on it very hard and they 're working on it very hard photos ford excursion cadillac escalade hummer h2 \( pg c2 \) chart compliance scorecard some vehicles

your nov 2 headline who botched the occupation \? and accompanying article by david rieff echo a saturday evening post article of jan 26 , 1946 , entitled how we botched the german occupation in iraq today , terrorists and saddam loyalists are trying very hard but failing to derail what is being built iraq s political , economic and security institutions are being reconstituted iraqis are assuming responsibility for their own circumstances at a rapid rate this is an inevitably difficult process , after years of totalitarian rule but the vacuum left by the rapid defeat of that regime is being filled by new iraqis and new iraqi institutions i would stress that the planning in the united states government for postwar iraq was an interagency process , in which officials from the department of state , agency for international development , department of the treasury , cia , national security council staff , the joint chiefs of staff , department of defense , central command and others met daily at senior levels and in working groups beginning in the summer of 2002 in one section of the article , rieff quotes ambassador timothy carney , an orha member , who charges , there were scarcely any arabists in orha in the beginning we strongly disagree with this assertion having been in baghdad from the first day with orha , i can personally verify we had several arabists there likewise the staffing of our postwar operation on the ground in baghdad has been broadly inclusive and representative of all these agencies from the beginning the 16 senior officials staff members with ambassador bremer are from the department of state , coalition partners , other united states government agencies and privatesector volunteers none are from the department of defense indeed , ambassador bremer , his chief of staff and his two seniormost counselors are ambassadorialrank current or former state department officials with distinguished diplomatic credentials lawrence di rita acting assistant secretary of defense for public affairs washington
albany , july 18 for days , russell simmons had been telling everyone he could that he had struck a deal to revamp new york s mandatory jail sentences under the state s rockefellerera drug laws he mentioned it on ny 1 he told it to foreign journalists he briefed the rev al sharpton and anyone else who would listen that s what i do , mr simmons , the mogul , said last tuesday , with the confidence that had made him both successful and rich in the world of hiphop i'm a deal maker he claimed to have a bill , put together by gov george e pataki , that reflected a discussion with albany s leaders during a sevenhour meeting in june such a bill would mean that mr simmons had pulled off a real feat , cracking the code of legislative gridlock in albany mr simmons was neither so skilled , nor so fortunate an unwritten axiom of albany government is that the more possible or probable it appears that lawmakers will be able to resolve a public policy quandary , the less likely it is to happen in the state capital and its culture of power politics , an open issue is sometimes better than an outcome mr simmons s handshake with the governor meant little barring passage in the legislature , the socalled agreement was just 69 pages of paper instead of providing a compromise to change the laws that leading democrats and republicans agree are too harsh , it antagonized the assembly speaker , sheldon silver , who denounced it on wednesday , leaving any deal mr simmons thought he had in ruins it has not yet inspired the people of the state of new york to rise up en masse and demand change in how the courts sentence lowlevel drug offenders , as mr simmons has hoped it did not force mr silver to compromise from his previous stance of staunch opposition to predetermined sentences , as mr simmons had expected it , in fact , triggered an investigation of mr simmons and his colleagues by the state lobbying commission , with threats of fines hanging in the air and it turned many of mr simmons s own allies against him , exposing him to a new front of opposition on an issue he clearly feels strongly about and in which he has invested time and money longtime observers of albany politics were not surprised people who are new to the albany culture of negotiations are inexperienced at reading the political tea leaves and you have to be very careful in albany , in an environment where there is not a whole lot of trust , said blair horner , a veteran lobbyist for the new york public interest research group and until the i s are dotted and the t s are crossed , there is no deal mr simmons acknowledged his albany innocence if you position me as an optimistic , blind idiot , i would accept that , he said i always see a halffull glass , and i always end up with a full glass they say that is kind of like a brainwashing technique but washing your brain , in a spiritual context and in life , is not a bad thing i'm not really lost i really do live in reality for mr simmons , 45 , feelings on the subject grew out of insights from growing up in hollis , queens , when it was plagued by heroin addicts , pushers and killers many of his friends wound up in jail , or dead , and almost always the culprit was drugs , he said some of mr simmons s beliefs could be labeled conservative , like his belief that those who bring harm to poor communities deserve to be removed from those communities they kill each other over marijuana , he said that is a violent thing in our community so , a lot of times , these people who commit these violent crimes , most people in our community would want them off the street some could be labeled liberal , like his belief that those who go to jail for using drugs would be better served by drug treatment than jail time his older brother , daniel , pleaded guilty because of the rockefeller laws , and mr simmons said daniel salved his stint in jail with drugs , never getting rehabilitation until he was freed mr simmons s presence in the capitol was plagued with problems from the start there he was last month , in a room with mr pataki , mr silver and the senate majority leader , joseph l bruno it was phat farm street clothes versus brooks brothers suits the kid from queens held court with new york s power politicians mr silver , the gravelly voiced litigator from manhattan s lower east side mr bruno , the whitehaired former boxer from upstate farm country , and the republican governor , who is known to be socially liberal but tough on crime their bizarre encounter began on june 18 , about 6 pm , and ended after 1 the next morning though mr simmons said he believed they had struck a deal that night , it melted like a snow cone in the summer sun they had argued , downed oreo cookies and shunted other legislative matters aside as the session hurtled toward an unproductive close there was an immediate backlash lawmakers cried foul lobbyists were jealous a political neophyte should never get access like that , they said , particularly while jeffrion l aubry , a democratic assemblyman from queens , who had devoted much of his career to the issue , was forced to wait outside with reporters some of his onetime allies now vilify mr simmons

upton frank marotta stood beside the brookhaven national laboratory ambulance last week and summed up how rescuers feel about potential accidents at the lab involving radiation we talk about radiation as a nuisance , said mr marotta , the manager of emergency management at bnl we do n't have that level of radioactivity that creates a health effect for those people contaminated but the federal department of energy s inspector general said in a report released march 31 that there is a risk of serious accidents involving radiation exposure at bnl as work continues on the dismantling and removal of the lab s three deactivated nuclear reactors the report criticized the lab s preparedness to treat victims of a radiation accident and said it has violated several provisions of an order from the energy department that all its facilities formalize agreements with medical providers to handle victims of exposure to radioactive and hazardous materials the report said the lab failed to conduct yearly training sessions with its designated medical provider , stony brook university hospital , to coordinate a response to a radiation accident and to make annual updates of guidelines outlining the duties of the hospital and the lab in an emergency it also said the lab did not provide specialized equipment to the hospital the report said the lab s conduct suggested that the agreement was simply not treated as a priority bnl has 2 , 800 employees and about 4 , 000 visiting scientists working at the lab throughout the year in addition , as many as 75 contract workers are cleaning up and removing the reactors mr marotta confirmed that bnl had failed to hold yearly drills as defined in the agreement but drills were being held long before the formal agreement ordered by the energy department , hospital and bnl officials said we 've had a very close working relationship with stony brook for many years , mr marotta said when you have a close relationship , sometimes formality can lag brookhaven officials have reviewed and updated the agreement , taking heed of most of the recommendations in the report , said michael bebon , assistant director for facilities and operations at bnl but the revised agreement removes the original requirement that training drills be conducted at least once each year we will shoot for annual training drills , but what we thought was that we might have two in one year and none in a another year , mr marotta said stony brook people feel like they 're already trained and ready and they know they can come and ask us whenever they want for a drill bnl and stony brook hospital staff conducted drills in 2002 and 2003 as a direct result of the inspector s visit , he added the only year missing a training drill was 2001 during that year , when i spoke to people at stony brook in the emergency department and asked if they were interested in drilling with us , they said no , mr marotta said edward o'connell , a radiation control manager at stony brook hospital , said stony brook is well equipped to handle radiation and chemical exposure victims according to the inspector s report , an official of brookhaven science associates , the company that manages bnl , said the failure to implement the agreement with the hospital was not a concern because the lab had developed guidelines describing how emergencies will be handled the official explained that in the event of an emergency , two of brookhaven s trained radiological specialists would go with the ambulance to stony brook to provide expertise to stony brook s medical staff , the report stated the official further explained that the brookhaven radiation specialists are issued all of the emergency equipment necessary to treat the victims of radiation accidents and will bring the equipment with them to stony brook that equipment would be the contents of a suitcasesized metal box that bnl fire and rescue captain kenneth licata pulled out of the rescue truck at the lab it included two geiger counters , a hooded plastic suit , hard hat , gloves , rubber boots , a baseball cap and a length of rope we do n't have any exotic procedures available to us , mr marotta said at stony brook they 've had specialized training from the department of energy , but bnl training is internal robert alvarez , a former senior energy department policy adviser , said the procedure described in the report was inadequate this is not something that you just send papers back and forth about and you put it in a file cabinet , he said it requires specialized knowledge and techniques how do you deal with the possibility that the environment is contaminated \? how do you make sure the respondents are protected \? the laboratory , which opened in 1947 , has a history of leaking radioactive contaminants some contaminants found in the structures and surrounding soil and groundwater of the graphite research reactor , shut down in 1968 , include plutonium239 , which remains dangerous for thousands of years , radioactive strontium90 and cesium137 the reactor sat unused for 30 years while its underground sumps filled with irradiated rainwater until removal began in 2000 in recent years a radioactive tritium plume was discovered under the high flux beam reactor , which was shut down in 1999 and later deactivated the last reactor operating at the lab , the small medical reactor , was shut down in 2000 mr alvarez said the attitude among bnl officials was too lax it gets to this issue of formality and discipline , mr alvarez said they did n't have this with respect to the operations of the reactors and the inspector general is saying that they do n't have this with the emergency response to radiation accidents
monstrous regiment a novel of discworld by terry pratchett 353 pp new york harpercollins publishers 2495 many american readers first heard of terry pratchett when a s byatt used him to sex up , as some might say , her shorttempered dossier against j k rowling and the grownups who love her in an essay this past summer on the oped page of the new york times , after she got through slicing and dicing this sizable swath of humanity , byatt directed us instead toward writers who , she argued , have created far more magical explorations of good and evil susan cooper , alan garner and ursula k le guin byatt saved pratchett for last , pointing up his wit , his multifarious genius for strong parody and his amazing sentences while lamenting the fact that no one ever reviews him odd , since she herself has done so repeatedly and his book s dust jackets are n't lacking in quotations it is true , however , that this marvelously inventive english satirist has a lower profile in the united states than he might particularly since , as his publishers do n't mind mentioning , his fantasy novels have sold some 30 million copies worldwide could fantasy , too often a secondclass literary citizen , have something to do with this \? after all , nearly 30 of pratchett s novels for adults \( and a few more for children \) are set on discworld , a flat planet supported by four huge elephants who ride through the universe on the back of a 10 , 000milelong turtle on the disc , humans uneasily coexist with such minorities as werewolves , wizards , zombies , elves , dwarfs and trolls , not to mention witches , yetis , golems and dragons among the disc s landmarks are berwald where the undead thrive and werewolves can have all the badhair days they like and the ramtops , mountains full of deep valleys and unexpected crags and considerably more geography than they know what to do with pratchett s new novel , monstrous regiment , is set in tiny , backward , bellicose borogravia unfortunately for its inhabitants , borogravia s religion , embodied in the book of nuggan , has taken to accentuating the negative included among its burgeoning list of nonos are chocolate , cats , dwarfs , the color blue , babies , barking dogs and cheese the city of ankhmorpork remains discworld s most civilized destination , which is n't saying much here , in addition to the expected fraternal orders for tailors , say , or fools there are guilds for thieves and assassins \( pratchett is never one to leave a clich unturned in nightwatch , published last year , he lets us know that one killer s movements could be called catlike , except that he did not stop to spray urine up against things \) only the city watch , based in pseudopolis yard , keeps ankhmorpork under a modicum of control headed up by commander samuel vimes , this rackety squad includes a zombie who prides himself on embracing the opportunities of a life beyond the grave sergeant angua , a mostly vegetarian werewolf and captain carrot ironfoundersson , her 6foot6inch dwarf boyfriend \( he s adopted but very much identifies with his clan \) apart from sam vimes , who is increasingly called out on diplomatic sorties , the pratchett character who really gets around is death this 7foot skeleton speaks in all capitals , is keen on cats and has a mostly human granddaughter named susan and a horse named binky death also has a fairer sense of play than many in his dominion in reaper man \( 1991 \) , he tries to retire and pass as a farmworker \( the scythe does come in handy \) , but is appalled when he must slaughter a hen before her time he 'd never killed he 'd taken life , but only when it was finished with there was a difference between theft and stealing by finding pratchett , whose amazing maurice and his educated rodents \( 2001 \) won a carnegie medal , britain s most celebrated award for children s books , thinks that you can get more serious with kids but he has become increasingly so with adults his first discworld book , the color of magic \( 1983 \) , was a spoof of fantasies and featured scores of chatty characters with ridiculous names and outsize attributes everybody in this incidentpacked parody had something to say , including one magic sword that longed above all to be a plowshare i do n't know what that is , but it sounds like an existence with some point to it \( puns are to pratchett what daffodils were to wordsworth \) terry pratchett is difficult to review because you want to offer up your favorite scenes and allusions \( a raven named quoth a deliciously slowbuilding pastiche of bob woodward s first encounter with deep throat , only the ankhmorporkian whistleblower is a talking dog \) in monstrous regiment , vimes even does a variation on john f kennedy s ich bin ein berliner moment , assuring borogravia s best that he is a brogocia , a cherry pancake , instead of a fellow borogravian but before vimes has his diplomatic moment , monstrous regiment follows several young recruits who are forced to skip basic training and go straight to battle at the novel s center is a 17yearold girl intent on rescuing her older , simpler , soldier brother if polly perks has to pass as a man to succeed , so be it she s not bad with a sword and has been working on taking up more room than is absolutely necessary , though she has some inroads yet to make on swearing and spitting the only trouble is that she s not the only recruit with something to hide actually , since this is pratchett , there are many more obstacles , including a vicious corporal , an upperclass lieutenant who never should have left his desk job and a journalist who is a little too interested in exposing polly s unit and none of these guys are the official enemy as ever , pratchett revels in pricking pomp and assurance , but it is n't going too far to say that of late his real subject , like wilfred owen s , is the pity of war pratchett s approach may be less lyrical , but he can move from farce to sadness in seconds at one point , polly recalls a group of men on their way home from battle they kept their stinking coats buttoned tight , in lieu of bandages over whatever unspeakable mess lay beneath , and they had the smell of death about them the inn s regulars made space for them , and talked quietly , like people in a sacred place one of the

chicago , july 16 though he once opposed the idea , gov rod r blagojevich said he would sign a bill on thursday that would make illinois the first state to pass legislation requiring police to record their interrogations of homicide suspects another bill , with a sweeping set of measures intended to overhaul the state s death penalty system , is also awaiting his signature , and governor blagojevich , a democrat , said today that he supported , at least , many elements of it the willingness to rethink the system by which some prisoners end up on death row has changed since the days before george ryan , the republican who preceded mr blagojevich , pronounced the state s capital punishment system broken , declared a moratorium on executions , and then , before leaving office this year , granted clemency to all the condemned governor blagojevich , a former prosecutor , said his concerns about hampering the law enforcement community by requiring the police to tape interrogations had been overridden by the notion that tapes will provide clearer , more reliable evidence for the state s justice system even law enforcement officials , some of whom objected strenuously as recently as three years ago to the idea that interviews be recorded , have grown more muted as the politics have shifted here we 're not in favor of the mandatory provision , mark donahue , who leads the fraternal order of police in chicago , said of the recording bill this afternoon we would prefer that it be voluntary but we 're realists about all of this as well the law will require detectives to audio or videotape homicide suspects during interrogations that occur while the suspects are in custody the police in minnesota and alaska and some individual law enforcement agencies around the country already tape interviews with suspects , but illinois is the first state to pass legislation requiring taping , said thomas p sullivan , a chicago lawyer who helped lead a commission appointed by mr ryan to overhaul the state s death penalty system minnesota and alaska were required to do so by their state supreme courts this is good for everybody , said scott turow , a lawyer and an author who was a member of the commission , which included recording on a long list of suggestions for change supporters of taped interrogations say the process protects both police and defendants by creating a simple , clear record for juries and judges of who said what during an investigation the tapes , these supporters say , would resolve what has become a routine debate during criminal trials between the police , who testify that suspects confessed to crimes , and defendants , who testify that they did not confess , or at least that they did not do so voluntarily why should we assume that the police remember everything that happened \? asked yale kamisar , a law professor at the university of michigan and the university of san diego opponents of such a measure have argued that a recording requirement could prevent the police from carrying on interviews as they had before , or discourage suspects from speaking openly this afternoon , a spokesman for the chicago police said the department opposed the measure , but for financial reasons dave bayless , the spokesman , said that adding video equipment and training technicians would cost 3 million in chicago in the first year the bill requires that the provision be put into effect by two years from now amy klobuchar , a prosecutor for hennepin county , which includes minneapolis , said some authorities there initially worried about the idea none of the worries proved true , ms klobuchar said instead , it makes everyone clear about what happened governor blagojevich must decide on the related bill that would bar executions of mentally retarded people , give defendants more access to dna evidence and set up a test program for conducting police lineups i'm looking at it very closely , the governor said this afternoon of the broader bill , which , like the taping provision , was overwhelmingly supported by the democraticdominated legislature in springfield the odds are that most of that package is something that i 'll support even with the changes , governor blagojevich , who supports capital punishment , suggested he might not end the death penalty moratorium yet i would like to see the death penalty restored in illinois if i felt that the death penalty was foolproof in illinois , he said but that s the operative question morality requires that we not rush to lift the moratorium gary gauger , a farmer from mchenry county who was sent to illinois' death row for killing his parents in 1993 , only to be exonerated later , was convicted largely on what the police considered his confession , said rob warden , executive director of the center on wrongful convictions at northwestern university mr gauger , now 51 , said in an interview that he wished his words had been taped he said the investigators did not heed his requests to stop the interrogation , described to him damaging evidence that did not exist , and suggested he might have forgotten what he had done they got me thinking that i must have done it in a blackout , he said in my case , if a video had been on , they could have seen what had happened to me not only would the jury have acted differently , the police would have done things differently in the first place photo gov rod r blagojevich of illinois foresees a system improved \( associated press \)

benny carter , whose combination of highly developed talents as composer , arranger , bandleader and soloist on a variety of instruments was unmatched in the jazz world , died saturday at a hospital in los angeles he was 95 a versatile master benny carter s career was remarkable for both its length and its consistently high musical achievement , from his first recordings in the 1920 s to his youthfulsounding improvisations in the 1990 s his puretoned , impeccably phrased performances made him one of the two preeminent alto saxophonists in jazz , with johnny hodges , from the late 1920 s until the arrival of charlie parker in the mid1940 s he was also an accomplished soloist on trumpet and clarinet , and on occasion he played piano , trombone and both tenor and baritone saxophones he helped to lay the foundation for the swing era of the late 1930 s and early 40 s with arrangements he had written a decade earlier for his own big band and the orchestras of fletcher henderson and chick webb , as well as for benny goodman before goodman was acclaimed as the king of swing he later contributed arrangements and compositions to glenn miller and count basie from 1929 to 1946 , mr carter led big bands sparkling with young talent his band in the early 1930 s included the pianist teddy wilson , the saxophonist chu berry , the trombonist j c higginbotham and the drummer sid catlett a decade later , his contingent of future jazz stars included the trombonists j j johnson and al grey , the trumpeter miles davis and the drummer max roach his compositions included blues in my heart , when lights are low , blue star , lonesome nights , doozy and symphony in riffs beginning in the early 1940 s , he composed and orchestrated music for films , and from the late 50 s he also composed for television in 1962 , when mr carter was only 54 , the critic whitney balliett wrote in the new yorker that few of his contemporaries continue to play or arrange or compose as well as he does , and none of them plays as many instruments and arranges and composes with such aplomb carter , indeed , belongs to that select circle of purejazz musicians who tend to represent the best of their times , the piece continued his public fame did not always match his accomplishments , and his only major hit of the big band era was cowcow boogie , a novelty tune sung by ella mae morse however , early in his career his fellow musicians nicknamed him simply the king , and among them he was held in universally high regard the trumpeter doc cheatham recalled that we broke our backs to get into benny s band because musicians learned so much from performing with him sy oliver , whose brilliant arrangements gave the jimmie lunceford orchestra of the 1930 s and the tommy dorsey band of the 1940 s their distinctive cachet , said mr carter was the most complete professional musician i 've ever known and john hammond , the record producer who nurtured the careers of count basie , billie holiday and benny goodman , said mr carter was one of the great influences in american music , one of its unsung heroes mr carter was not widely known to the jazz public until his emergence , in his 70 s , as an acclaimed elder statesman his lack of public recognition was sometimes attributed to the fact that his bearing was reserved and dignified , that he was not a flamboyant showman moreover , as the drummer j c heard suggested , his music was a little too refined for the 1930 s and 40 s , when he was leading a big band bennett lester carter was born on aug 8 , 1907 , the youngest of three children and the only boy he was reared in a neighborhood called san juan hill , then one of the roughest areas in manhattan , near what is now lincoln center when he was a youngster , his musical idols were trumpeters his cousin theodore \( cuban \) bennett , who never recorded but whose advanced musical ideas were attested to by many musicians , and bubber miley , a star of duke ellington s orchestra in the late 1920 s who lived around the corner when he was 13 , he bought a trumpet at a pawnshop , but when he was unable to play it after a weekend of effort he traded it in for a saxophone by the time he was 15 , he was sitting in with bands in harlem he got his first fulltime job when he was 19 , with charlie johnson s band at smalls' paradise in harlem when he made his first records in 1928 , with the johnson band , the session included two of his own arrangements also in 1928 , he joined a band led by fletcher henderson s brother , horace , and shortly after , when the leader walked out during a tour , the abandoned musicians elected mr carter to replace him he was 21 years old for the next two decades , as his biographer , morroe berger , wrote , he was either leading a band or regretfully disbanding one while looking forward to organizing another one in 1935 , mr carter went to paris to join the willie lewis orchestra at the club chez florence he remained in europe for three years , playing mostly in france , denmark and the netherlands he also spent 10 months in england as an arranger for the british broadcasting corporation dance orchestra
hempstead , ny , aug 19 when new york had two football teams that actually played in new york , a fellow named weeb ewbank labeled their first meeting for the braggin' rights to new york imagine , an exhibition game that divided the city but the jets and the giants have not played a game in new york city since a preseason meeting in august 1976 in which the giants beat the jets , 1614 , at yankee stadium when they play for the 35th time in the preseason on saturday night , it will be at giants stadium in the meadowlands , of course , and none of their nine regularseason meetings they will face each other again on nov 2 have been played in new york city , either for a veteran like the jets' kevin mawae , this exhibition game is , simply , a pain it s a game nobody wants to play , mawae , a pro bowl center , said it s a preseason game it s meant for rookies that is blasphemous to those who actually saw significance in early jetsgiants meetings that very first braggin' rights affair took place at the yale bowl in new haven the summer after the jets won super bowl iii in 1969 as far as the giants were concerned , that huge upset of the baltimore colts was a fluke it was as if the jets had to win the exhibition game to validate their super bowl triumph , which they did , quite handily , 3714 ewbank , then the jets' coach and general manager , even used many of his starters on special teams to punctuate the importance of the game , ewbank made three of the original jets \( known as the titans back in 1960 \) don maynard , larry grantham and bill mathis honorary cocaptains rookies made the teams , it was said , on the basis of what they did against their socalled crosstown rivals a few weeks after that exhibition game , giants coach allie sherman was fired and so the jetsgiants rivalry was born the giants left yankee stadium during the 1973 regular season to begin an odyssey as they waited for giants stadium to be built in east rutherford , nj they played at yale they even played one season at shea stadium the jets , meanwhile , were never allowed to have preseason games at shea stadium because the mets did not want their grass field trampled so the only time in the last 30 years the teams played in new york was that game at yankee stadium in 1976 , when the yankees allowed the jets in for preseason play fastforward to lunchtime today , and a jets rookie linebacker from rupert , idaho , lance gibson , who was asked about the jets and the giants something like bragging rights , he suggested but where i'm from , we do n't know east coast football even vinny testaverde , who grew up in nearby elmont , with joe namath s picture hanging on his bedroom wall , admitted , this week we 'll all tell the media what a big game it is in fact , when asked about playing against the giants , testaverde said he had not faced them before but he had in the preseason he did not count it the first time it will mean something to me will be this year , he said , referring to the november game the jets' bronxborn offensive line coach , doug marrone , grew up , he said , all jets and all giants my first football memory was my dad taking me to the yale bowl to see a jets and giants exhibition game , he said marrone , who went to lehman high , said that the few jets fans in the bronx are younger people , many of them police officers and firefighters and they all go to what might be the only jets bar in the bronx alfie s , on east tremont , he said jets coach herman edwards concedes , sure , i 'll talk a little about the rivalry but he is more likely to talk up the opening regularseason game against washington in the days before the jets play the redskins and the jets' owner , woody johnson , who worked the sidelines at today s practice , said he would be calling the giants' owners before the game you know , leon hess was very fond of wellington mara , said johnson , who bought the team from the estate of hess , the jets' longtime owner mara is the giants' coowner the jets' and the giants' owners have always been on more than speaking terms , even when their players were not extra points the jets' president , jay cross , said that 10 percent of the 20 , 000 people who are being charged 50 to have their names on the waiting list for season tickets have sent in their money they have until sept 15 , cross said jets quarterback vinny testaverde may see action , finally , on saturday night he did not play last saturday against new orleans i'm not going to put him in with the second line , coach herman edwards said i do n't want his mother coming down on the field
put simply , the philippines got taken a charter member of the world trade organization in 1995 , the former american colony dutifully embraced globalization s freemarket gospel over the last decade , opening its economy to foreign trade and investment despite widespread worries about their ability to compete , filipinos bought the theory that their farmers' lack of good transportation and high technology would be balanced out by their cheap labor the government predicted that access to world markets would create a net gain of a halfmillion farming jobs a year , and improve the country s trade balance it did n't happen smallscale farmers across the philippine archipelago have discovered that their competitors in places like the united states or europe do not simply have better seeds , fertilizers and equipment their products are also often protected by high tariffs , or underwritten by massive farm subsidies that make them artificially cheap no matter how small a wage filipino workers are willing to accept , they cannot compete with agribusinesses afloat on billions of dollars in government welfare farmers in the united states get help every step of the way , says rudivico mamac , a very typical , and very poor , filipino sharecropper , whose 12yearold son is embarrassed that his family cannot afford to buy him a ballpoint pen or notebooks for school the same sad story repeats itself around the globe , as poor countries trying to pull themselves into the world market come up against the richest nations' insistence on stacking the deck for their own farmers president bush deserves credit for traveling to africa and trying to focus attention on that continent s plight but meanwhile , struggling african cotton farmers are forced to compete with products from affluent american agribusinesses whose rockbottom prices are made possible by as much as 3 billion in annual subsidies sugar producers in africa are stymied by the european union s insistence on subsidizing beet sugar production as part of a wasteful farmingwelfare program that gobbles up half its budget instead of making any gains , the philippines has lost hundreds of thousands of farming jobs since joining the wto its modest agricultural trade surpluses of the early 1990 s have turned into deficits filipinos , who like referring to their history as a spanish and american colony as three centuries in the convent followed by fifty years in hollywood , increasingly view the muchpromoted globalization as a new imperialism despair in the countryside feeds a number of potent antigovernment insurgencies leaders who hitched their political fortunes to faith in the free market have grown bitter they include fidel ramos , who was washington s staunch ally when he managed the philippines' economic opening as president in the mid1990 s now , mr ramos blames rich nations' unfair trade practices especially their hidden farm subsidies and other tricks for much of the suffering in the countryside given how long the world s economic powers have been trying to persuade the rest of the world to embrace a more open global economy , mr ramos said in an interview , he was taken aback by their unwillingness to level the competitive playing field poor countries cannot afford to be on the short end of this deal for long , he said people are in real need people are dying mr ramos s plea could have emanated from any number of countries in the developing world , home to 96 percent of the world s farmers it is a plea that needs to be heeded , before it is too late the united states , europe and japan funnel nearly a billion dollars a day to their farmers in taxpayer subsidies these farmers say they will not be able to stay in business if they are left at the mercy of wildly fluctuating prices and are forced to compete against people in places like the philippines , who are happy to work in the fields for a dollar a day so the federal government writes out checks to iowa corn farmers to supplement their income , and at times insures them against all sorts of risks assumed by any other business this allows american companies to then profitably dump grain on international markets for a fraction of what it cost to grow , courtesy of the taxpayer , often at a price less than the breakeven point for the impoverished thirdworld farmers if all else fails , wealthy nations simply throw up trade barriers to lock out foreign commodities the system is sold to the american taxpayer as a way of preserving the iconic family farm , which does face tough times and deserves plenty of empathy , but it in fact helps corporate agribusiness interests the most by rigging the global trade game against farmers in developing nations , europe , the united states and japan are essentially kicking aside the development ladder for some of the world s most desperate people this is morally depraved by our actions , we are harvesting poverty around the world hypocrisy compounds the outrage the united states and europe have mastered the art of forcing open poor nations' economies to imported industrial goods and services but they are slow to reciprocate when it comes to farming , where poorer nations can often manage , in a fair game , to compete globalization , it turns out , can be a oneway street
two new yorkarea bishops , thomas v daily of brooklyn and william murphy of long island , came in for a strong share of blame in a report issued yesterday by the massachusetts attorney general on the sexual abuse of children by priests in the boston archdiocese the report blames the bishops who were top aides to the boston cardinal before receiving their own dioceses for putting abusive priests and the roman catholic church s reputation ahead of the needs of abused children while the attorney general , thomas f reilly , said his office was unable to charge anyone with a crime , the conduct of its senior managers was undeniably wrong the report places ultimate responsibility for the scandal on the shoulders of cardinal bernard f law , the boston archbishop who resigned in december but it says that none of his senior aides advised him to take any of the steps that might have ended the systemic abuse of children the report details the roles of nine aides , beginning with bishop daily , who was the chief deputy to cardinal humberto medeiros from 1976 until his death in 1983 , and stayed on for a period the following year after cardinal law took over the report said bishop daily had failed to investigate thoroughly allegations of abuse , even when a priest was found to have lied in denying a charge he had a clear preference for keeping abusers in ministry by quietly moving them to new parishes instead of banishing them , it said the bishop also apparently felt that once caught , a molester priest would not abuse again accordingly , the report said , he failed to take any meaningful steps to limit abusive priests' contact with children in the future and like his fellow senior leaders in the archdiocese , bishop daily did not report abuses to the authorities , the report said the spokesman for bishop daily , frank derosa , said the bishop had had a chance only to glance through the report mr derosa said that the bishop s role in the report was small , and that the report referred to many events after his departure in 1984 given the understanding that people had about this issue at that time , 20 years ago , the bishop followed procedures that he believed were appropriate , mr derosa said in the past , bishop daily has expressed regret for his actions , even as the scandal has implicated a number of priests in brooklyn and queens , which are under his jurisdiction bishop murphy came in for somewhat milder treatment in the report his diocese of rockville centre , ny , came in for scathing criticism from a suffolk county grand jury in february he served as cardinal law s chief deputy from 1993 until 2001 the report said bishop murphy took some positive steps in handling child sexual abuse cases , including the establishing of a supervised residence program for abusive priests nevertheless , he oversaw the handling of many sexual abuse cases and continued to place a higher priority on preventing scandal and providing support to alleged abusers than on protecting children from sexual abuse , the report said making matters worse , the bishop saw sexual abuse as a pastoral problem and not a criminal one , it said the report also said bishop murphy helped assign a priest , the rev melvin surette , who was himself accused of sexually abusing children , to a position involving job placement for other abusive priests bishop murphy s office issued a statement yesterday outlining the many measures he said had been taken by the diocese of rockville centre to remove abusers and protect children bishop murphy is determined that issues raised in the massachusetts grand jury report never be repeated under his jurisdiction , the statement said it also referred to a long and detailed defense of his actions that the bishop published three weeks ago in the long island catholic , a diocesan newspaper there , bishop murphy wrote that another official was delegated to handle abuse cases directly the bishop said he had never personally reassigned an accused abuser to a pastoral position for a time , the delegate , a priest , had the exact same name william francis murphy bishop murphy said he was often confused with that priest he noted that he was the official to remove john geoghan , one of boston s most notorious abusive priests , from an administrative job he also defended his role in the surette matter bishop murphy said he approved a plan for father surette to set up a job placement service that proposal , to my memory , never materialized , he said bishop murphy said he had a routine role in overseeing the sexual abuse cases the administrative review of legal settlements he said his understanding at the time was that confidentiality in such cases was routine that approach was wrong , and i apologize that i went along with this , the bishop said photo bishop thomas v daily was a top aide to the boston cardinal \( bill cunningham the new york times \) \( pg b2 \)
the bloomberg administration yesterday picked apart a leadpaint abatement law proposed by the city council , saying it would give landlords too little time to eliminate hazards and might increase health risks to young children proponents say the legislation , called 101a , is among the toughest in the nation , and would mandate the removal of peeling paint in apartments with children by 2007 , prohibit dry scraping and sanding of the paint , and require owners of apartments built before 1960 to annually identify all children living in them but administration officials , while calling the bill greatly improved from an earlier version , unfurled a long list of criticisms during a hearing of the city council committee on housing and buildings the objections are only the latest hurdle faced by advocates of the legislation , whose passage took on a sense of urgency in july after a state appeals court overturned a lead abatement law the council had adopted in 1999 the new bill has been revised several times since being introduced this year , and only recently gained the support of gifford miller , the council speaker thomas r frieden , the commissioner of health and mental hygiene , testified yesterday that changing the law to cover children age 7 and older from age 6 ignores the fact that most lead poisoning occurs in children much younger the higher age limit would increase by 15 percent the number of children whose apartments need to be inspected , he said in addition , the law does not adequately distinguish between apartments with high and low risks of lead paint exposure , dr frieden said forcing removal or treatment of paint even in relatively safe buildings can expose children to hazards where none previously existed , and can inadvertently do more harm than good , he added the commissioner of housing preservation and development , jerilyn perine , sounded a similarly cautious note , saying council members needed to eliminate provisions of the bill she described as burdensome to landlords and costly to taxpayers increased inspection and recordkeeping requirements could raise her department s administrative costs per abatement case from about 4 , 000 to 10 , 000 , she said also , giving landlords 14 days to correct a lead hazard violation is not enough time , ms perine said , adding that her department s own experience eliminating lead paint suggested that these time frames simply cannot be met in boston , owners get 30 days just to hire contractors and another 60 days to do the corrective work , ms perine said in baltimore , owners have three , six , nine months or more to bring buildings into compliance despite the criticisms , ms perine and dr frieden took pains to say that they thought the revised 101a provided a workable foundation for a new lead abatement law they characterized their concerns as mostly technical , and surmountable speaker miller , who publicly backed the bill only recently after insisting on a number of changes , accentuated the positive yesterday he told reporters that the administration s qualified support was a step in the right direction it s a big step forward for the administration to come here and say that 101a forms the basis for a sound law , mr miller said that s a big shift in their position , and i'm pleased to hear that he said the council would consider the administration s suggestions for improving the bill , which would be voted on definitely before the end of the year
the metrostars missed on a penalty kick in the first half and allowed a rare twoonnone break in the second half that led to a goal they also played ineffectively in between , and the result was a 20 loss to dc united last night at giants stadium the defeat left the metrostars only a point ahead of united in the eastern conference of major league soccer with five games left for each team ben olsen scored the first goal and ronald cerritos the second for dc united , which lost goalkeeper nick rimando with a left knee injury in the 78th minute that ended a streak of 6 , 016 minutes of playing time , dating from 2001 the metrostars had an opportunity to tie the score in the 36th minute , after amado guevara was tripped in the penalty area by dema kovalenko but clint mathis s penalty kick barely reached the goal before it hit the left post and bounced away alex yannis
washington , may 22 new york state stands to receive at least 2 billion from an aid package that congressional leaders have put together to help states grapple with the worst fiscal crisis they have faced in decades , lawmakers announced today in all , the package calls for providing 20 billion to state governments over two years half the money is set aside to help them cover budget shortfalls the rest would reimburse them for rising medicaid costs the bailout money was part of a larger taxcut bill that house and senate leaders agreed to on wednesday night the money was included to win the minimum number of votes needed to get the politically charged tax cut , totaling 318 billion over 10 years , through a divided senate both new york senators , charles e schumer and hillary rodham clinton , have said they will not vote for the taxcut bill , arguing that it will do little to jumpstart the economy , as republicans contend but like other democrats , mr schumer and mrs clinton have argued for months that any taxcut package congress approves this year should also include money for states and localities struggling to close budget gaps the infusion of federal aid could not have come at a more opportune time for new york it is facing a financial crisis marked by anemic tax collections and the prolonged sluggishness on wall street george e pataki , the threeterm republican governor , proposed a budget plan in january that cut state aid to schools and sharply curbed the money the government now spends on health care to help close an 115 billion deficit but the state s two top legislative leaders , afraid that those cuts on core state services would foist huge property tax increases onto localities , drafted their own budget over the objections of the governor true to his word , mr pataki then vetoed the legislature s 928 billion budget but for the first time in two decades , the legislature then overrode mr pataki s vetoes of its spending plan in doing so , the lawmakers revived a budget that increases state taxes to restore billions of dollars in spending on schools , hospitals , nursing homes and localities fiscal purists said that both the legislature s and the governor s budget plans were flawed , mainly because each relied on 42 billion in borrowing to pay for daytoday operating costs , which would lead to deficits in later years under the plan announced today , new york will receive 14 billion from the 10 billion set aside to help states and localities cover additional medicaid costs the 14 billion will be divided between the state and local governments new york city stands to receive about 270 million of the 10 billion set aside for socalled fiscal relief , new york will get about 650 million but none of the money will go to cashstarved local governments , including new york city instead , the money will go directly to state officials in albany , who can decide whether to pass any money to local governments , according to lawmakers by contrast , a similar fiscal relief package approved by the senate last week would have given 6 billion to states and 4 billion to local governments new york city , in turn , would have received approximately 100 million under the senate plan , according to estimates provided by city lawmakers on capitol hill as the details of the bailout package were being negotiated today , lobbyists for new york city and other localities urged lawmakers on capitol hill to insert a provision guaranteeing that localities would get a share of the money designated for fiscal relief but as things now stand , it is unclear how much money , if any , albany will send to localities edward skyler , a spokesman for mayor michael r bloomberg , said the mayor was troubled that congress did not guarantee that some of that money would go to localities like new york city it s very disappointing that cities have been cut out of the aid package since municipalities like new york are bearing the brunt of the economic slowdown and have a lot less flexibility than states do to solve their fiscal problems , mr skyler said in separate interviews late this afternoon , mr schumer and mrs clinton urged lawmakers in albany to provide new york city and other local governments a substantial share of the money that washington provides the local governments are hurting as much as the state government and deserve these dollars , said mr schumer , who said localities should get at least half the money mrs clinton prepared a letter to the governor , urging him to give local governments their fair share of the funds she also noted that many local officials in new york have complained that albany has refused to release other forms of federal aid that were intended for local governments the money needs to get to local communities , she said but it is anyone s guess how the governor and the state legislature will respond , since the state faces its own financial troubles kevin quinn , a spokesman for the governor s budget office , said , we 're hopeful that these funds allow us to repair some of the damage that the state legislature s fiscally irresponsible budget caused and also provide aid to local governments that are facing their own fiscal challenges mr pataki and mr bloomberg have clashed over federal aid in april , mr pataki urged congress to change a funding formula that sought to give new york city 80 percent of any antiterrorism money that the federal government sent to new york state the governor wanted a larger share for the state , though he ultimately backed away from his demand after a storm of protests from city officials
they were billed as near wonder drugs , much safer and more effective in treating schizophrenia than anything that had come before for many years , it seemed that the excitement was fully warranted there were remarkable stories of recovery and the new generation of antipsychotic drugs , called atypicals , seemed to have few of the side effects commonly seen with high doses of older medications for psychosis the drugs appeared so successful that doctors began prescribing them for other things , not only for other psychotic illnesses , like manic depression , but also for alzheimer s , personality disorders and nonpsychotic depression , and for conduct disorder and severe aggression in children sales of the drugs soared more than 15 million prescriptions were written last year for the two leading drugs alone , zyprexa and risperdal , industry figures show but 14 years after the first of the drugs entered the market , researchers are questioning whether they are quite as miraculous or benign as originally advertised the first round of antipsychotics had such unpleasant side effects , like dry mouth , stiffness and trembling , that people often just stopped using them the atypicals are considered by many patients to be more tolerable , and many experts believe they are better than older drugs in treating some aspects of psychosis but studies suggest that their superiority is at best modest , specific to certain symptoms and variable from drug to drug also , there is increasing suspicion that they may cause serious side effects , notably diabetes , in some cases leading to death the issue of risks has become more pressing as the drugs are prescribed for children and for adults with milder conditions and the states , which pay enormous sums for the atypicals in caring for the severely mentally ill , are questioning whether the benefits of the new drugs are worth their costs the drugs , experts say , have now reached a turning point where benefits must be balanced by side effects and cost clinicians and investigators alike are taking a harder and closer look at areas in which the newer drugs are supposed to be better , said dr jeffrey a lieberman , a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the university of north carolina psychiatrists will debate the relative merits of older and newer antipsychotics in san francisco tomorrow in a symposium at the annual meetings of the american psychiatric association in other sessions , psychiatrists are presenting new data on the atypicals' safety how the debate resolves will be watched not only by the nearly five million americans who suffer from schizophrenia or manic depression and their families but by many millions of other people who have taken the drugs , and government officials the questions a new kind of drug for psychosis when a drug called clozaril entered the market in 1989 , it was hailed as a major breakthrough in the treatment of schizophrenia european researchers who had stumbled upon the drug years before described it as atypical because even at very high doses , it did not produce the stiffness , trembling and other parkinson slike symptoms commonly seen in patients taking older antipsychotics like haldol clozaril proved able to help some people with schizophrenia when all other drugs failed in some cases , longdisabled patients shed their apathy and depression , went back to school , made friends and engaged in work for the first time since falling ill but in a small percentage of people \( 07 percent , according to the prescribing information provided by novartis , which sells the drug \) , clozaril caused a lifethreatening blood disorder called agranulocytosis , and patients required regular blood tests to monitor for the side effect , adding to its expense over the last decade , a series of other atypical drugs , free from association with the blood disorder , have entered the market risperdal , the first such drug , from janssen pharmaceuticals , was approved by the food and drug administration in 1994 zyprexa , by eli lilly , won approval in 1996 the new drugs which also include seroquel , sold by astrazeneca pharmaceuticals , geodon , sold by pfizer , and most recently , abilify , sold by bristolmyers squibb have proved to be impressive moneymakers for the pharmaceutical industry it s probably the best growth market in the business , said richard t evans , a senior research analyst at sanford c bernstein national sales of antipsychotics reached 64 billion in 2002 , making them the fourthhighestselling class of drugs , behind cholesterollowering drugs , ulcer drugs and antidepressants , said ims health , a company that tracks drug sales according to ndchealth , another company that tracks the industry , in 2002 , more than 74 million prescriptions were written for zyprexa and more than 76 million for risperdal many doctors and patients prefer the drugs to the older medications bretta m , 34 , a brooklyn woman , for example , said that the zyprexa she takes is an improvement over haldol , an oldgeneration drug that she said made her feel like a zombie i'm less stiff , bretta m said i can concentrate more i'm more alert but the drugs have hardly proved to be a panacea , experts say , and some are more effective and less likely to cause the side effects of older medications than others
now the game begins for the superstar lawyers hired by the basketball legend now they become the money players we will not try this case in the press , pamela robillard mackey said with perry mason solemnity friday night but soon came a classic crossover , a show of staged sentiment timed strategically for sportscenter soon mackey s new client , kobe bryant , and the young wife he betrayed were center stage at the staples center , hands clasped , tears welling in the corner of bryant s eyes as he publicly and quite poetically professed his sorrow for committing adultery , while maintaining his innocence to a felony charge of sexual assault in edwards , colo appearing to gesture to the audience in the arena in which bryant has crafted his fame , he thanked everybody out there for their support , as if the attending you guys of the news media had been part of the script perhaps bryant , in a show of wisdom well beyond his 24 years 11 months , intuitively recognized that it was and would probably continue to be meanwhile , out in oklahoma , in a heartland setting not unlike the colorado mountain county from which the prosecution will have to find jurors impervious to the aforementioned promotional prowess , one viewer admitted to being moved except it was n't for kobe bryant , not by a long shot my heart goes out to this girl , alison jennings said of bryant s 19yearold accuser late friday night from oklahoma i know how hard it is to do this i know what it s like to suddenly realize that people do n't believe you , or do n't want to believe you , because they have been corrupted to think that the athletes they love are not capable of doing such a thing though she was speaking from experience , it should be noted that jennings never faced the kind of national spectacle that looms in the kobe bryant case , for which his accuser , i am told , has been advised to hire her own highpowered law team to defend against the mud surely to be slung the athletes jennings accused of gangraping her at a college party almost four years ago were football players at oklahoma state criminal charges were never filed against the players , two of whom now play in the nfl marcellus rivers of the giants and alvin porter of the baltimore ravens jennings later said that she , as a traumatized 22yearold student , had signed a waiver of prosecution after being told by the police that her story was not corroborated and that she did not have a case whatever happened on the night of nov 21 , 1999 , in stillwater , okla , jennings s life soon ground to a halt her grades plummeted she suffered from posttraumatic depression in almost four years of pursuing a spate of civil suits \( settlements were recently reached with rivers and porter \) , jennings and her family say the most devastating lesson of all has been how athletes are protected and how quickly a woman who accuses them can be vilified as a golddigging groupie trying to find fame in the fishbowl of university town , usa , college athletes can pack as powerful a punch as kobe bryant does on a global scale after filing her civil suits , jennings said , she dreaded even going to a grocery store she was made to feel like that girl who was trying to bring down the local franchise supporters of bryant decry the belief that his reputation is being tarnished by charges , not conviction but his accuser , far from anonymous , is widely known in edwards , the way jennings eventually was in stillwater and who would want to read about themselves in the newspaper and hear the awful things that people will say about them \? jennings said who in their right mind would want to put themselves in a position like this , where people are calling you a liar and believing the worst about you \? what are the odds , really , that someone would make this up \? far from evidence , that at least is a good question for those so quick to publicly hang their disbelief on bryant s muchhyped character presumption of innocence does not mean the accuser is prejudged to be lying , but that is the implicit message when basketball insiders like mark cuban , the dallas mavericks' owner , come out and say he is certain bryant will emerge from this mess as the good guy that is part of the rush to judgment for the athlete not against that makes such cases all the more daunting to proceed with even friday night , the television talking heads those who say they have known kobe since before he was this onename cottage industry were expressing shock that he could commit adultery , much less sexual assault is n't it amazing how depending on the athlete and his corporate connections , the perception of him can swing from one extreme to the other , from occupying a den of iniquity to ward cleaver s house \? the problem in charging an athlete is that it intensifies the rage and backlash factor so much more than the normal situation , tamara briongowens , one of the lawyers who represented jennings in her civil suits , said in a telephone interview from oklahoma city the athlete has fans they have easy access to the media they have a voice jennings , for her part , would , if given a chance , advise bryant s accuser not to listen to the voice in her head you think everyone is against you , she said you suddenly feel the magnitude of what you have gotten yourself involved in you feel depressed and scared and every time you turn on the television and see the player being interviewed , most of all , you feel like he has all the power and you have none
none of the founders of octagon research solutions had aspired to become entrepreneurs but on a chilly fall night in 1999 , two of them stumbled upon an idea so promising that they knew they had to give it a shot james walker , then an independent consultant to pharmaceutical companies , and kirk gallion , a consultant employed by accenture , were pulling an allnighter to redo an electronic application to the food and drug administration for a new drug from a pharmaceutical company the application , prepared by a technology vendor , was just awful , mr walker said after they spent half the night trying to fix it , a light bulb came on i turned to kirk and said , 'would n't this be easier if it was just done right the first time \? ' he recalled the two hammered out the idea for a company that would use technology to help speed up and simplify the approval process for new drugs because the fda was pressuring pharmaceutical companies to send applications electronically , and because the lifesciences field was booming , they figured that they were on to something a former executive at scheringplough , mr walker had a regulatory background , and mr gallion had technical skill to round out their expertise , they enlisted the help of mr walker s twin brother , neal , who was about to start a career as a dermatologist we felt like we had an unbeatable combination , james walker said they learned quickly that starting a company meant personal sacrifice neal walker and his wife , christy , spent many nights debating whether he should turn down lucrative offers to practice dermatology to join octagon as chief medical officer she was especially wary because she had just put her husband through medical school we felt like i was giving up quite a bit , neal walker said but they decided to take the risk james walker , the new company s chief executive , gave up living on his own and moved back in with his parents so he could pour all his money into the business and mr gallion , the chief technology officer , traded in his comfortable office space at accenture to work out of a coat closet in his twobedroom apartment my daughter was 2 , he said this was the only place where i could get some work done without her climbing all over me it was extremely cold in the winter and wicked hot in the spring he put up with it for six months , until octagon got an office in november 1999 , one month after it was started , the company got its first major client with homemade brochures and references from former colleagues , the founders gave a presentation to astrazeneca , the pharmaceutical company , and snagged a contract to help it with an fda application johnson johnson soon signed on , and other deals followed we had uncovered such a niche need that we really did n't have any competitors , james walker said in may 2000 , octagon moved into its first office , a small room atop a dunkin' donuts shop in king of prussia , pa , a philadelphia suburb space was not the only problem the office was infested with wasps you 'd just hear buzzing and then , all of a sudden , someone would run by , trying to escape a swarm , said mr gallion , now 31 though the business was growing , money was tight neal walker , now 33 , bought office furniture at a yard sale , and the partners met with clients in the doughnut shop slowly , the founders added to their staff , often by persuading a friend or former colleague to take a big salary cut in return for stock options and the adventure of joining a startup a typical application for fda approval of a new drug contains a staggering 300 , 000 pages of clinicalstudy results and other information companies send all that paper to the fda , then reformat it and send it to 100 or so other regulatory agencies in the united states and abroad by handling all this data electronically , octagon says , it can cut the compilation time in half they 've got an edge because they 're not just technologically savvy they actually have a full grasp of what the fda looks for , said mary alice raudenbush , vice president for regulatory affairs at endo pharmaceuticals , a chadds ford , pa , maker of pain medication the company hired octagon to help submit its first two applications in 2001 octagon helped us save thousands of trees , she added ms raudenbush said it probably would have taken her company two or three years to complete the process , instead of octagon s one she said the applications were currently under active review by the fda octagon now has 70 employees , an expanded headquarters in king of prussia and a second office in boston last december , it received 38 million in venture capital from a group of investors including the edison venture fund to help finance a product that will allow project managers at pharmaceutical companies to view the latest status of their electronic submissions it projects revenue of more than 5 million this year and close to 88 million in 2004 for all their success , the three founders sometimes worry about the future even when things are going right , i'm questioning myself and the business , neil walker said sometimes i think , 'how can a small fish accomplish such a large task \? ' mr gallion has become accustomed to tight space and long working hours he says he recently set up shop in a client s office in the company phone booth because there really was n't anywhere else for me to go and he has become accustomed to the frantic pace in those early days , you 're always thinking the workload is going to lighten one of these days , he said in truth , we all work just as hard as we did in the very beginning that s just the nature of having your own business photo kirk gallion , left , dr neal walker and james walker , principals of octagon research solutions \( photo by tim shaffer for the new york times \)
just what negro or black or africanamerican dance is and should be has been a subject of heated , lively discussion since at least as far back as the harlem renaissance in the 1920 s dancers have gone to africa \( pearl primus \) or the caribbean \( katherine dunham \) to redisover their roots in one way or another the 1960 s was a particularly fertile time for such searches and such selfdiscoveries , and those energies carried over into that aftershock decade , the 70 s chuck davis was very much part of that spirit , and in 1977 he founded the annual danceafrica celebration both as a search for roots and as a way to overcome competitiveness among black dance companies the idea , mr davis said over breakfast at the mercer hotel in soho , was to do a small festival to show people how we in america were carrying on the traditions each company was different , with different techniques the festival which mr davis has presented at the brooklyn academy of music for 26 years and still runs , as well as serving as allpurpose master of ceremonies is billed as america s largest festival of african and africanamerican dance it is certainly big and bustling , and by now a more ambitious undertaking than the first program that mr davis offered in 1977 , when he was still directing the chuck davis dance company in new york since 1983 he has headed the african american dance ensemble in durham , nc but he shuttles in and out of new york for planning sessions for danceafrica and for dance instruction in the city s schools this year s installment , from today through sunday , offers performances and films at the academy s opera house , bamcaf and bam rose cinemas \( related review , page 14 \) there is also the annual danceafrica bazaar in the adjacent parking lots , which draws more than 250 vendors over the entire memorial day weekend and attracts \( depending on the weather \) up to 20 , 000 people none of the invited companies this year actually come from africa they 're all part of the diaspora , which is very much part of danceafrica s mandate there are adult and teenage groups from haiti , philadelphia , chicago and new york any search for roots carries builtin problems is there , as some dance theoreticians have argued , an underlying movement vocabulary common to all of subsaharan africa \? if not , what part of africa is being explored \? what part of what countries \? \( there are some 60 tribes and languages in the ivory coast alone \) how pure are the traditions being explored , and how pure should they be \? to what extent have they been distorted or enlivened by international electronic media , modernity and a nascent desire on the part of african choreographers to express themselves beyond tradition expression that may be at variance with what the elders have ordained \? for the unflappably genial mr davis who is himself called by some an elder none of this poses a problem it s all part of the same rich stew , the same field for inspiration there is no tension between the two sides , he said benignly there ca n't be tension since the one is supporting the other for example , when i go to the gambia , we pass through the countryside to get to my hotel the dancers come , and there is always a big celebration the next morning i'm upcountry , my feet in the earth and the soil there i learn the dances for the different rituals , rites , what have you there i'm taught by the elders , i am ethnic the minute i leave and go back to the hotel and make my notes , i'm adapting and then , when i return home , i teach authentic traditions , but not ethnic , because it s not in the soil it s authentic , but it s theater today much of the dance in africa , at least in the big cities , is packaged for touristic export , like many of the leaping , impossibly cheerful , drumwhacking ensembles i saw in 1995 at a showcase for western producers in abidjan , in the ivory coast such people do n't understand that more is not better , sniffed mr davis beyond ritual molded for export , traditional dance has been , interestingly and insidiously , altered by african choreographers themselves they , too , are searching for their own roots , but they are also interested in selfexpression choreography in black africa goes back a long way in the 1930 s a dancer from sierra leone named asadata dafora made a splash in the united states , and more recently rose marie guiraud s company and school in abidjan attracted considerable attention outside west africa ms guiraud \( in 1988 \) and many other subsaharan choreographers indeed , choreographers from all over the world have benefited from the american dance festival s summer workshops thus in a very tangible way dancers of the diaspora , very much including those of the united states , are not only rediscovering their own roots but also helping dancers on the mother continent express themselves in a manner that may lead to the erosion or transformation of tradition it s not just influences from the diaspora that affect african choreographers and african tradition , mr davis said influences crowd in incessantly and unstoppably from beyond the narrow circle of the tribe or nation tradition is being maintained or recreated , he argued but you ca n't always do it the same way now , because we 're working with new material as examples he cited the impact of bollywood indian musicals in africa or a naming ceremony performed at danceafrica that took 20 minutes in gambia it began at 5 am and lasted all day as ms guiraud once explained to jennifer dunning in the new york times , killing a chicken is not necessary in the united states it seems that every black choreographer has to explore , subconsciously or usually very consciously , just how black he or she is in our era of tribal identity politics race seems inescapable but even as they look back to africa , africa itself is changing , becoming more like them it all recalls the mid60 s battles between acoustic folkies and electric rock 'n' rollers the folkies wanted pure tradition , the music of the people they did n't realize that what the people wanted was commercial rock 'n' roll , which thus became the true folk music in africa dance , like music , is mutating constantly thus any search for tradition , like danceafrica s , must guard against searching for something that is already nostalgic or , worse , moribund you ca n't stop a river , and insofar as african dance can be generalized , it is a huge river driving forward and overflowing any barriers erected to contain it fortunately mr davis seems well aware of the shifting ground on which he stands the world is being brought into the living room , he said the elders many of them are seeing now that it s a changing world exploring dance , in person and on film the danceafrica 2003 festival performances are at the brooklyn academy of music opera house , 30 lafayette avenue , at ashland place , fort greene , tonight at 7 30 tomorrow at 2 and 7 30 pm and sunday at 3 pm tickets 18 to 38 children 16 and under , 9 to 19 information \( 718 \) 6364100 the bamcin matek at the bam rose cinemas \( 30 lafayette avenue \) is showing danceafrica films through thursday tickets 10 7 for students \( mondays through thursdays except for holidays \) 6 for bam cinema club members , 65 and children under 12 bamcaf live at bamcaf \( 30 lafayette avenue \) is featuring the band source tomorrow at 10 pm no cover 10 food or drink minimum in the parking lots adjacent to the brooklyn academy , a danceafrica bazaar will be held tomorrow from noon to 10 pm sunday , noon to 8 pm and monday , noon to 7 pm free photo member of muntu dance theater of chicago , to perform in danceafrica at the brooklyn academy of music \( muntu dance theater of chicago \)
london while global attention is fixed on the francogerman attempt to wrest control of the resurrection of iraq from its usled liberators , practical elements in the arab world are moving to influence the nascent government we have put in place in baghdad in cairo today , the arab league considers whether to invite hoshyar zebari , the kurd recently appointed foreign minister by iraq s governing council , to provisionally occupy iraq s seat he is eager to make the threehour flight to regional legitimacy what s in it for arab dictators who want no part of a democratic experiment in their region \? apparently the recent exercise of us will and power has been taken to heart to accommodate reality , the arab nations are likely to play ball with postsaddam iraqis , expecting \( 1 \) to continue iraq in the opec cartel , \( 2 \) to ensure iraq s support of palestinians against israel and \( 3 \) to prevent export of antisunni zealotry if president bush abdicates control of iraq to the un soon , arabs may gain all that and more on my return to the lists after vacation , let me animadvert on the swelling chorus of handwringing failuremongers in britain , for example , the bbc was recently revealed to have sexed up a story that accused prime minister tony blair of having sexed up a prewar intelligence report about saddam s weaponry when the antiblair , antiwar bbc learned of its reporter s exaggeration , it refused to correct his inflammatory story lest it appear to be caving in to government pressure one board member claimed truth in reporting to be less important than an image of fearlessness some european media that had mistakenly warned of a long , highcasualty campaign , and were discomfited by the ease of our military victory , now claim vindication they cite the present lack of proof of massdestruction weapons , the lawlessness that followed saddam s emptying jails of all criminals , and continued sniping and bombing iraqis are shown on tv blaming american troops not baathistpaid terrorists for lack of electric power , lack of water and lack of protection \( though 11 , 000 elderly iraqis did not die from lack of care in the summer heat \) in what is called here the daily schadenfreude , the impression is being marketed that the rebuilding of iraq is a colossal flop that arabs are culturally incapable of selfgovernment that islamic fundamentalism will sweep away any western notions of individual dignity that while saddam was admittedly a bad guy , the hundreds of thousands of his victims who are missing are none of the west s concern , and that a cabal of neocon hawks manipulated president bush into war so goes the failuremongers' pitch their purpose , beyond justification of their decade of appeasement , is to cast as both ignoble and doomed this most necessary longterm counter to statesponsored and fanaticismdriven terror to wear down our will , they emphasize the likelihood that as long as we stay to rebuild , terrorists will shoot at our service members and relief workers and will sabotage power plants and oil fields as we return fire , inevitable pictures of bloodied innocents will be shown on home screens in the coming political campaigns , failuremongers in europe and at home will exploit reactions to these costs in blood and treasure they will beat the drums to abandon control to a feckless un bureaucracy george mcgovern s slogan of 1972 will be echoed by de villepin democrats and some panicky republicans come home , america how best to answer the merchants of dismay \? counseling patience is not enough staying the course needs no sexing up , as our british allies say , but does require the coalition s measurable accomplishment of steady iraqiization \( i seek a more pronounceable verb along with an indigenous iraqi army \) success will be sped by straight reporting of the big picture as well as the shocking picture pols and pundits are obliged to cover misjudgment and misfortune , but also to examine evidence of progress toward a peaceful , prosperous , pluralistic iraq led by the liberators , not the obstructionists failure may boast a thousand fashionable fathers in this summer of discontent , but for us realistic optimists if it succeeds , it leads
the kennedy assassination has been shoved back into cold storage for another decade twothirds of the population had not yet been born on nov 22 , 1963 , and so the 40th anniversary quickly gave way to the bulletins from neverland tv had struck up the usual medley of tarnished camelot , what if scenarios and where they were when they heard the news nostalgia all set to the wellworn forensic percussion of conspiracy , with its bullet trajectories and grassy knoll but even zapruder had lost its zing though i , too , remember where i was that friday afternoon in a junior high school in washington , dc i had trouble accessing the old wound and i wondered is this how people will react to the 9 11 anniversary 40 years from now \? even if the eight winning designs in the ground zero memorial competition did not amount to much more than generic hallmark sentiments on steroids , is there any eternal flame that could keep the memory of these cataclysms redhot in perpetuity \? just look at the fading hold of pearl harbor day \( today , in case you forgot \) but there is an answer to my question , and i was reminded of it the week after the assassination anniversary , by happenstance , in a theater in downtown new york i was unexpectedly plunged back into nov 22 , 1963 and inevitably back into sept 11 , 2001 by the power of an artist who has an innate grasp of his time that many of us , journalists and the memorial industry included , do not that artist is the playwright tony kushner , about whom you may well be sick of hearing by now , and about whom i had no intention of writing again so soon but tonight is the night millions of americans will encounter his work for the first time , when the first part of his epic angels in america flies across the country on television much as mary martin did in peter pan in an ancient day my guess is that mr kushner , like peter , will indirectly touch a raw nerve a 9 11 nerve and that his audience will soon be hungry for more now there is more mr kushner s extraordinary new show at the public theater , a musical called caroline , or change that is set in those waning weeks of 1963 here again mr kushner s subject is the anxiety of tumultuous change , the kind that traumatizes and disorients a nation at those times when a plague runs amok , terrorists attack or a president is shot i use the word musical loosely to describe the show mr kushner has written in collaboration with the composer jeanine tesori and the director george c wolfe it s sungthrough , like an opera , albeit one whose musical idiom runs a gamut from berry gordy to klezmer besides , the word musical these days conjures up a precinct of american pop culture that , with the possible exception of knott s berry farm , may be the least affected by our latest national trauma the prevailing fashion on broadway , even for its one show starring puppets \( avenue q \) , is candied camp , as set by musicals featuring either men in drag \( the producers , hairspray \) or gay protagonists \( taboo , the boy from oz \) or a bitchy variant on the wizard of oz \( wicked \) perhaps no one short of the author of angels in america could pull off the nixoninchina feat of bucking this cultural conformity the kennedy assassination occurs in the first act of caroline , or change , when two weary black maids in the gulf town of lake charles , la , learn the news tardily , while waiting for a bus in an inky , humid night the earth has bled , goes the lyric the president is dead those lines could not be more unadorned , but there is nothing simple about the sense of dread whipped up thereafter the song builds to an image of inchoate chaos an orphan ship of state , drifting , driverless and the music invokes some of the torrential quality of the hurricanebattered charleston of porgy and bess , with its grieving widow s dirge of my man s gone now as when the angel crashes into the aidsstricken prior walter s bedroom in angels , you feel that mixture of terror and rapture that arrives on those rare occasions in theater and in life when you genuinely do n't know what s going to happen next caroline , like angels , is about that sensation of history cracking open mr kushner tells about the collision of two americas seemingly as irreconcilable as the gay jewish new york and straight mormon utah of angels a jewish family in the south and the milieu of the maid , caroline \( the explosive tonya pinkins \) , who works in their basement , doing laundry in a starched white uniform the jewish family has a sad 8yearold child , noah \( harrison chad \) , who , having lost his mom to cancer , looks to his maid as mother and father and president of the united states rolled into one but the divorced caroline has four children of her own , including a rebellious teenage daughter \( anika noni rose \) and , offstage , a son in vietnam , wherever that is if you think you know where this is going to lead , you do n't , and you wo n't find out here this is not a blackandwhite play about blacks and whites it is certainly not hairspray , in which baltimore breaks out in a jamboree of racial brotherhood in 1962 , two years before george wallace took 43 percent of the vote in maryland s democratic primary mr kushner unleashes a conflict that literally involves change \( 20 in hanukkah gelt \) as well as both public and private grief , but he resolves nothing the enraged caroline and the everlessinnocent noah love and hate each other in turn , and our allegiances keep shifting , too mr kushner has his politics , certainly , but he does n't play favorites in his plays , instead shuffling the deck of liberal pieties before we can choose the obvious sides in angels , you will find , the single cruelest betrayal is committed by the character who is the exact demographic double of the author
tokyo , sept 22 a rap on the knuckles , it seems , can sometimes go a long way after finance ministers and central bankers from the group of 7 nations urged japan over the weekend to limit its role in foreign exchange markets , the yen rose to a 33month high in tokyo , the dollar fell as low as 11137 yen , nearly a 4yen move from friday though no country was singled out in the group s communiqu , the call for market mechanisms to determine exchange rates was a nonetoosubtle hint that the united states and europe are tiring of japan s repeated attempts to weaken its currency investors now suspect that japan and , to a lesser degree china , will have a harder time propping up the dollar to slow any rise in their currencies the pressure on japan comes at a crucial time for the industrialized world president bush , facing election next year , is eager to woo labor and industry , two groups that typically favor a weaker dollar trading partners that run surpluses with the united states have in the past been easy campaigntrail targets , and this time is no different mr bush , who plans to visit japan next month , will probably reinforce the group of 7 s message the japanese will have a tough time intervening before bush visits in october , said one financial markets analyst at a japanese bank until then , it s inevitable that the yen will keep rising europe must dig out of an even deeper hole than the united states while america s economy is expanding , those of france and germany are barely growing a rise in their exports would provide those countries a muchneeded lift but japan has its own concerns the country is pulling out of its third recession in a decade and wants to keep a lid on the yen s rise to help its exporters , the engine of the economy economies and their currencies , of course , often rise in tandem , and for japan now the fastestgrowing country in the group of 7 there is nothing too surprising about the yen s 76 percent rise since august yet japanese policy makers know that the country s manufacturers , including its biggest car and electronics makers , lose money on overseas earnings when the dollar slips below 115 yen though they are aware that the yen is poised to keep rising , japanese finance officials want to slow the process to give exporters time to adjust their finances and to dilute the impact on the economy if you get a sudden move , it will surprise a lot of people , said ryo hino , an economist at jp morgan securities , which expects the yen to hit 105 to the dollar by the end of japan s fiscal year in march 2004 realistically , they can only tap on the brakes they 're resigned to smoothing operations a stronger yen could also slow the rally in stocks because foreigners the biggest buyers of shares this year would have to pay more to buy japanese assets the yen s steep gains today sent the nikkei 225 tumbling 42 percent , its largest slide in two years the benchmark index finished at 10 , 475 despite the mounting pressure on japan to curtail its manipulation of the markets , the japanese will have a hard time resisting the temptation prime minister junichiro koizumi , emboldened by the economy s revival this year and his reelection saturday as head of the ruling liberal democratic party , will probably call nationwide elections in november the last thing he needs is for the nikkei to buckle because of a rising yen the economy could be hurt as well , though probably not enough to drive it back into recession a 10 percent rise in the yen shaves about half a percentage point off japan s economy over a twoyear period , according to hsbc securities the yen is up more than 7 percent just in the last month even before the markets opened today , toshihiko fukui , governor of the bank of japan , warned that japan will take appropriate actions to address excessive currency movements , so market participants need to be aware of that mr fukui should be taken at his word japan has already spent a record 9 trillion yen \( 80 billion \) this year intervening in foreign exchange markets , and japan can print yen indefinitely to finance its dollar purchases in a nod to its group of 7 partners , japan may wait until the dollar falls near 110 yen before leaping into the market again and that may not be far off japan s trade surplus continues to expand , growing a fasterthanexpected 23 percent in august compared with the previous year exports grew 64 percent , almost twice as fast as imports to keep the country s export machine humming , japanese policy makers will have no choice but to cap the yen s rise whenever possible if it were not for intervention , said marshall gittler , a currency strategist at deutsche bank in tokyo , the currency would appreciate until japanese exports were nearly shut down , which would destroy the nascent recovery
in new york city , to park is to suffer of all the small indignities that haunt the city dweller , none perhaps is quite so troublesome as looking for a spot with that in mind , consider the plight of the many thousands of drivers who live in coop city , a sprawling residential complex in the bronx one of its eight parking garages is already closed for repairs as of friday morning , five more will be shut down for repairs , and altogether nearly 7 , 000 people will be left without a place to put their cars oh , yes , it s a nightmare , said jay engelmayer , a spokesman for the riverbay corporation , which manages the complex trouble has been brewing for years , mr engelmayer said three years ago , he said , when riverbay was hired by coop city s board , the company brought in engineers who determined that all the parking garages would need to be repaired back then , he said , there was a plan to close one garage at a time and simply move the cars around but this winter , garage no 6 collapsed because of neglect and bad weather the engineers came back they issued a report last week that recommended that five of the eight garages be closed immediately , mr engelmayer said now , riverbay and the residents it represents are looking for quick solutions what they want to avoid is the ultimate parking horror show 6 , 700 cars and not a place for them to go to that end , they have reached out to public officials in the bronx , some of whom met yesterday with the city s transportation department the bronx officials essentially begged for help for example , they have asked transportation officials to switch the parallelparking spots along coop city boulevard and other major streets to angle parking they have also asked for help in suspending alternateside parking rules and meter regulations for the next few weeks furthermore , a plan is afoot to pave over some of the common green space that sits among coop city s 35 separate buildings the officials have sought help , as well , to persuade the owners of the nearby bay plaza shopping center to let coop city residents use some , or all , of its auxiliary lot , which has nearly 2 , 000 parking spots there is your basic scramble going on , mr engelmayer said even riverbay concedes that the parking problem is only one of many now looming last week , coop city s board stopped paying its mortgage , which is held by the state s housing finance agency , said bob liff , another spokesman for riverbay it simply had no money , he explained moreover , the residential complex has been threatened by a strike by members of the service union , local 32bj union representatives say they want a 14 percent raise , to bring salaries in line with what its workers make in other boroughs riverbay has said it already pays the workers in coop city what their peers earn at other buildings in the bronx why it has to come this and who is to blame depends on where you stand in the tangled politics of coop city some people blame the board , some riverbay of course , the board chose riverbay to run coop city , and the coop tenants chose the board to run themselves forget the chicken and the egg and which came first , said one tenant who spoke on condition that he not be named it does n't make a difference in this situation , both the chicken and the egg are out of luck photo acting on an engineers' report , coop city is closing six of its eight garages for repairs , leaving 6 , 700 residents without parking spots \( photo by librado romero the new york times \)
bruce j klatsky , chief executive of phillipsvan heusen , knew that running calvin klein would be a challenge eight months ago when he bought the company just how big the challenge might be emerged this week when phillips executives acknowledged that calvin klein had , in past years , lost 20 million to 25 million a year on the couture collection alone , and another 10 million to 15 million on its retail operations numbers previously known only to company insiders in addition , phillips said the company had spent about 50 million a year on overhead while those numbers may have scared off other potential suitors , to mr klatsky and his board , calvin klein was a golden name that just needed to be further mined phillips , a 14 billion company whose highestpriced item before the acquisition might have been a 100 pair of bass loafers , is aiming to succeed with calvin klein in the world of 3 , 000 watches and 5 , 000 chiffon evening dresses mr klatsky , who has already pushed the label into two new midrange sportswear lines , said he thought he could significantly cut costs while keeping intact mr klein s stable of 110 designers and increasing the advertising budget by about 5 percent design and marketing was the lifeblood of the brand , he said but everything else was on the table to be analyzed the first things to be analyzed were those expenses while designers often lose money on showcase couture collections , one investment banker close to both phillips and klein said yesterday that the klein numbers were substantially higher especially when compared with total sales than the figures for most bigname designers mr klatsky defined overhead this week as computers , warehouses , office equipment , and simply the way the business was run with a perfectionist s zeal they made thousands of samples , mr klatsky said on tuesday , and that costs a bloody fortune last week , emanuel chirico , phillips s chief financial officer , defined the charges as limousines and everything you could think of what else \? chefs and waiters and lots of security guards at the ready at the company s office in manhattan mr klatsky said that none of these expenses came as a surprise when we bought calvin klein , it was a private company , and , as such , barry and calvin were perfectly justified in running it the way they wanted to , private , whatever they were entrepreneurs building a wonderful business , mr klatsky said this week , adding do n't knock those two guys barry is barry schwartz , mr klein s business partner undaunted by the financial reports , phillips looked beyond the freespending and spotted several advantages first , there were the licensing revenues 120 million last year , on total retail sales of 33 billion of goods with the calvin klein name on them , but not made by calvin klein other companies , like the vf corporation and the jones apparel group , had hesitated and passed vf was in heavy negotiations , said one investment banker , but vf wanted both calvin klein and the calvin klein jeans and underwear licenses from warnaco , and they could n't put that together jones really wanted it , too , the banker continued , but jones was tied up with ralph lauren , and could n't take the chance mr lauren , he said , would never have allowed jones to buy his closest competitor arnold aronson , a former chief executive of saks , said that phillips , despite its lack of presence in the highend market , is a good fit with calvin klein bruce will squeeze all the value embedded in that name , and that s good business besides bass , phillips owns izod \( bought in 1996 for 35 million now with sales of 300 million a year \) , and holds licenses to make dkny , geoffrey beene , arrow and kenneth cole with the addition of the klein name , the price range at phillips has skyrocketed up to 9 , 700 for a oneofakind vase in the calvin klein home collection , and up to 5 , 000 for a tailored suit handbags sell for up to 3 , 000 , watches and eyeglasses up to 500 , and perfume for an average of 45 they needed very badly a prestige designer name to fill in what was a mainstream business , said mr aronson , who is now a managing director at kurt salmon , a retail management consulting firm with the calvin klein name , they can do it all good , better and best while mr klatsky said that eventually he might shepherd his new brand into shoes and an expanded jewelry line , he said he immediately felt there was a huge market for lowerprice men s and women s calvin klein sportswear he said the two new sportswear lines , destined for department stores from macy s to saks , could bring in a combined 1 billion a year in less than five years in its examination of the calvin klein records , phillips found that the klein company had been approached by vestimenta , the bluechip italian company that makes clothes , not only for its own label , but also for armani vestimenta was looking for a contract to make some of calvin klein s couture suits and dresses klein never got back to vestimenta
the slings and arrows preventing the new york philharmonic from holding its annual summer concert in van cortlandt park are not those of outrageous fortune but of the world archery championships still , some bronx residents are distressed that the weeklong sporting event has preempted what is arguably the borough s classical music highlight of the year in place of a concert by the full orchestra , the philharmonic s brass ensemble will perform at orchard beach on july 13 the orchestra is performing in the other four boroughs and on long island early next month free concerts in city parks have been a tradition since 1965 , and most years there was one such concert in each of the five boroughs last year some 20 , 000 people attended the concert in the bronx , said paul sawyer , executive director of the friends of van cortlandt park michael spierman , artistic director of the bronx opera company and a bedford park resident , described the makeup concert as just a consolation prize orchard beach is remote , he said you 're immediately drawing a line in terms of audience access he fears that many bronx residents will miss the event , since orchard beach , unlike van cortlandt , is not on a subway line an article in the riverdale press accused the city parks department of botching the bronx scheduling but eric latzky , a philharmonic spokesman , said the issue was more complicated the dates we are able to perform concerts in the parks vary from year to year , and depend on the many things we do in the summer , mr latzky said we approached each individual park with dates , and all the dates have to jibe in this case , they did not megan sheekey , a parks spokeswoman , said the philharmonic was offered alternative dates , but none worked it was a collaborative decision that orchard beach would be a suitable venue for their needs , she said for a borough that perceives itself as forever on the short end of the stick , the explanations felt unsatisfactory , although the full orchestra will not perform in staten island this summer either in a letter last week to mayor bloomberg , borough president adolfo carri n jr said , while i am certain that the substituted concert by the brass ensemble at orchard beach on july 13 will be wonderful , it is simply not the same mr sawyer of friends of van cortlandt park plans to attend the orchard beach concert but reluctantly and though he is pleased that van cortlandt will briefly become the world s archery epicenter , he noted that after five days of competition , the qualifying archers will head to the twoday finals in central park seth kugel photo a philharmonic concert in van cortlandt park \( toby wales \)
scientists have decoded the genome of the anthrax bacterium and found that it closely resembles that of a common soil bacterium the finding , published today in the journal nature , is expected to help scientists pinpoint the genetic machinery that makes anthrax so deadly and devise therapies against it the type of anthrax that was decoded is known as the ames strain , a particularly deadly form that has long been studied in biological weapons laboratories and was used in the anthrax mailings the genome was decoded by a team at the institute for genomic research in rockville , md , led by dr timothy d read the institute started to make the genome sequence available on its web site when decoding began in 1999 , and today published its analysis of the full genome and a comparison with a closely related soil bacterium , bacillus cereus the cereus genome was decoded by dr natalia ivanova and colleagues at integrated genomics in chicago the anthrax genome consists of a large , circular chromosome containing 5 , 227 , 293 units of dna these encode the information for 5 , 508 genes , dr read s team reports the bacterium also possesses two much smaller rings of dna , known as plasmids , one of which carries its three toxinmaking genes its cereus cousin has a similar main chromosome , but its plasmids lack the toxin genes that make anthrax so deadly the genetic repertoire of the anthrax and cereus bacteria includes genes that break down proteins but lacks many genes that metabolize sugars , a common source of energy for other bacteria this suggests that anthrax and cereus are specialized for consuming animal and plant proteins in the soil , dr read said the anthrax bacterium spends most of its time in the soil but has moved up the food chain from scavenger to killer by having acquired its plasmid with the three toxins though the plasmid seems to have been acquired recently , in evolutionary terms , it is not yet clear where it came from the ames strain was used in the anthrax mailings sent to the senate and news media offices in fall 2001 last year dr read s team analyzed an anthrax sample taken from robert stevens , a photo editor who died after contracting anthrax from a letter sent to the american media building in boca raton , fla the aim was to help the federal bureau of investigation determine which of several laboratories known to hold stocks of the ames strain was the source of the material though a few minor differences were found between the original ames strain and that used in the letter , it was not clear how helpful that discovery was in identifying the source stock but dr claire m fraser , the president of the institute for genomic research , said the institute was still working on the problem none of the parties involved believe that we are at a dead end , dr fraser said editors of several journals agreed this february to withhold publications that might give help to bioterrorists dr fraser said that she had held nothing back in publishing the anthrax genome and that no one had asked her to dr ronald atlas , president of the american society of microbiology and a leading advocate of the restraint policy , said his concern was with cookbook descriptions of how to make biological weapons and he had no wish to curb publication of fundamental knowledge like the sequence of the anthrax genome

elizabeth costello by j m coetzee 230 pages viking 2195 elizabeth costello roams the world from college to cruise ship , giving speeches and accepting awards as the literary celebrity at the fulcrum of j m coetzee s elizabeth costello , she is the kind of distinguished author who is more of a treasure in theory than in fact not her m tier , argumentation , thinks her son , john , a professor who shows up to shepherd her through part of her schedule on the academic circuit he thinks of her as a seal , an old , tired circus seal , mr coetzee writes with his own artful detachment as a child , john found it puzzling that a woman who wrote books for a living should always be so bad at telling bedtime stories as mr coetzee establishes through many acerbic asides , elizabeth is a literary celebrity in the most eyeglazing sense \( elizabeth costello proceeds to reflect on the transience of fame we skip ahead \) not even she herself is entirely interested in what she has to say but she is fierce in fending off the relichunters and the contumelists and the sentimental pilgrims who seem to want pieces of her and who define the fractious intellectual atmosphere in which this book unfolds even before mr coetzee won the nobel prize in literature this month , he evidently knew a thing or two about the irritations of literary fame and he seems to be writing this book from a vantage point close to home like louis begley , whose current shipwreck is about the perils of being a prizewinning author seduced by a young interviewer , mr coetzee treats a main character s eminence as a defining aspect of his fiction but there is a mirror effect in elizabeth costello , thanks to the way this brittle , ingenious notquitenovel has been cobbled together parts of elizabeth s philosophical theorizing were written and published individually as mr coetzee s own thoughts thus the book is a string of metaphysical pit stops , cleverly rendered if tenuously linked together each chapter is devoted to some theory of elizabeth s , to mr coetzee s affectionate mockery of the way she delivers and defends it \( she has an urge to raise her voice , wag a bony finger in his face \) , and then to a serious explication of her thinking from animal rights to evil , eros and humanism , elizabeth stubbornly defines herself as a writer while fraying nerves wherever she goes in his first work of fiction since disgrace , mr coetzee creates a formidable , even charismatic standin a writer so dedicated to her work that she suggests one of those large cats that pause as they eviscerate their victim and , across the tornopen belly , give you a cold yellow stare if she is not precisely lovable , elizabeth is still admirably fierce yet this book delves its way into her deepest doubts , culminating in a theatrical denouement teased out of elizabeth s own affinity for the kafkaesque she is ultimately forced to explain her own writerly principles , including this one i believe in what does not bother to believe in me in light of its diffuse and rarefied ambitions , elizabeth costello proves improbably inviting at the simple narrative level mr coetzee punctuates each episode with some glimpse behind elizabeth s sturdy armor and with her comically withering observations of those around her we have so much catching up to do ! exclaims a colleague , prompting elizabeth to think in his lexicon , it appears , catching up means talking about his own activities later in this chapter , entitled the novel in africa , she scorns this man s pretensions and inadequacies \( a fellow entertainer he may be a fellow writer he is not , not any longer \) and she questions the most basic import of his work \( african novelists may write about africa , about african experiences , but they seem to me to be glancing over their shoulder all the time they write , at the foreigners who will read them whether they like it or not , they have accepted the role of interpreter , interpreting africa to their readers \) she will momentarily allow herself to remember him as a former lover , too another chapter , also dealing with africa , brings elizabeth face to face with her sister , blanche , who is a nun , and establishes that stubbornness runs in this family now , in the few minutes left to me , i am going to tell you why i do not belong among you and have no message of comfort to bring to you , despite the generosity of the gesture you have extended to me , announces blanche , accepting an honor of her own she and elizabeth will soon lock horns about the nature of the christian tradition imported into africa by the roman catholic church try as she may , elizabeth cannot shake the effects of the book that made her reputation the house on eccles street , her distaff view \( now there s a phrase she would eviscerate ! \) of ulysses through the eyes of molly bloom it is , among other things , the source of an endless supply of stupid questions from interviewers , starting with what would you say your main message is \? for the purposes of elizabeth costello , her main message is that a writer is free to follow her imagination anywhere if i can think my way into the existence of a being who never existed , then i can think my way into the existence of a bat or a chimpanzee or an oyster , any being with whom i share the substrate of life by the same token , mr coetzee can inhabit the waning days of a woman of letters and join her in inviting reactions that are nothing if not polite a wonderful lecture , mrs costello , one college president tells her none too convincingly much food for thought we look forward to tomorrow s offering photo j m coetzee \( photo by jerry bauer viking \)
the united states , russia and europe should do far more to reduce the urgent and grave proliferation risks from their remaining stockpiles of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , concludes a new report endorsed by a consortium of influential private research centers specifically , the report concludes , the united states and its european allies must begin treating russia as a partner in such efforts rather than as a strategic charity case for its part , the report says , russia must become more open and remove obstacles to cooperation to prevent the world s most lethal arms and technology from spreading to rogue states and terrorist groups the fourvolume report was conceived as one of the most comprehensive public assessments of a decade of american and allied efforts to help russia secure its strategic arms stockpiles and to reduce the dangers posed by its cold war legacies of vast unconventional arms stockpiles and personnel the threeyear study , protecting against the spread of nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons , has been endorsed by a group of 15 research organizations in the united states , europe , russia and japan it was financed by the carnegie corporation of new york and the nuclear threat initiative , the washington foundation started by ted turner and sam nunn , a former democratic senator from georgia the first volume was written by robert j einhorn and michele a flournoy , former senior clinton administration arms control and defense specialists now at the center for strategic and international studies in washington it is to be released today in london at a conference about efforts to secure and reduce stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction a copy was provided to the new york times in advance at a summit meeting in canada last june , the major industrial powers and russia the group of 8 agreed to spend 20 billion over the next 10 years to help russia reduce the threat posed by its stockpiles the report notes that given the danger that these materials might be acquired by rogue states of terrorists , these nations should consider 20 billion a floor rather than a ceiling it also recommends that nations may wish to waive debt payments in exchange for additional spending by russia on such projects the study highlights progress made with a 7 billion investment in these efforts by the united states , much of it under cooperative threat reduction programs started by legislation in the early 1990 s sponsored by senator richard g lugar of indiana , now foreign relations committee chairman , and mr nunn in the past decade , the report notes , nuclear materials have been removed from ukraine , kazakhstan and belarus the world s largest anthrax production facility at stepnogorsk , kazakhstan , was dismantled the first prototype chemical weapons destruction plant in russia is ready to operate , and more than 50 , 000 scientists who once worked in nuclear , biological and chemical weapons facilities have received aid despite such steps , the report asserts that more ambitious measures are needed the study found , for instance , that basic security upgrades had been completed at facilities containing only 46 percent of the approximately 603 metric tons of russia s weaponsusable nuclear materials identified by the united states department of energy virtually none of russia s plutonium and less than oneseventh of its highly enriched uranium has been rendered unusable for nuclear weapons , the report says the same is true for the united states , it says the report emphasizes the continuing threat posed by russia s biological stockpiles , about 20 major former soviet facilities and at least two dozen smaller institutions thousands of weapons scientists and workers are still unemployed or underemployed , the report says , and susceptible to lucrative offers of work from countries that could have secret germ weapons programs many bush administration officials say russia should not benefit from american assistance , given its reluctance to open facilities suspected of illicit arms research officials have also protested russian aid to iran s nuclear program but the report concludes that helping russia secure and eliminate unconventional weapons stockpiles is too important to be held hostage to such concerns
the unknown night the madness and genius of r a blakelock , an american painter by glyn vincent illustrated 362 pp new york grove press 2750 among 19thcentury american artists , names like winslow homer , thomas eakins , thomas cole or frederic church may be familiar , but not ralph albert blakelock , although contemporary painters often appreciate his work some unabashed enthusiasts even proclaim his genius , admiring his abstract treatment of nature and his mysticism he has inspired relatively little scholarship , but his life merited a cameo portrait in paul auster s novel moon palace \( 1989 \) , in which a character describes blakelock as one of the greatest men we 've ever had , and there he was all broken apart , on the verge of losing his mind he used to tell me about his travels out west , wandering through the wilderness for weeks on end , never seeing a soul three years he was out there blakelock s life rose to tragic proportions it encompassed the youthful adventurer heading west to camp with american indians when his contemporaries sought the salons of europe the prolific father the marginalized and exploited painter the delusionary confined to a staterun mental hospital the victim exploited by a con artist as the focus of a charity claiming to support his impoverished family while actually benefiting only herself unethical behavior by new york s medical , legal and art establishments , with doctors and lawyers failing at the very least to protect the vulnerable artist from fraud , while art dealers and collectors take advantage of the helpless , mentally ill father of eight surviving children the biggest surprise may be that such a subject has had to wait so long for the biography that glyn vincent provides in his first book , the unknown night born in 1847 , the grandson of poor immigrants from england and son of a policeman who became a homeopathic physician , blakelock grew up in new york he passed the competitive entrance exam to the free academy \( later known as city college \) , but soon left school to devote himself to art an uncle who was a music teacher , choirmaster and amateur landscape painter encouraged the boy s interest in art and provided opportunity for painting at his summer home in arlington , vt by the fall of 1867 , though not yet 20 years old , blakelock managed to get a painting accepted by the jury of the national academy of design , which then was the most prestigious place to exhibit although not singled out by the press , he was invited to submit work for exhibition again the next year after four showings at the academy that did not attract enough attention to begin an economically viable career , blakelock decided in 1869 to expand his horizons while most of his contemporaries chose to study in europe , he elected to go west , where some artists , like thomas moran and albert bierstadt , had joined army expeditions and government survey teams blakelock , however , traveled alone , on horseback , sleeping under the stars , encountering the sioux , the assiniboins and other tribes he made a second trip west in 1870 , stopping in wyoming among the uinta tribe in the scenic snake river valley his last journey , to northern california , took place in 1871 he would never forget these experiences , which fed his imagination american indian subjects would inspire him for the next quarter of a century in february 1877 , not quite 30 , blakelock married cora bailey their first child was born in july cora proved to be a devoted mother and an accommodating wife as eight more children followed in rapid succession , she seems to have inadequately understood that so many progeny taxed the limits of her husband s ability to support their family later she would lament that to raise cash to support his growing family , blakelock was often forced to turn out potboilers by 1882 , blakelock and his family had moved in with his uncle , then living in east orange , nj so acute was their poverty that he went to work in a factory , painting trinkets and massproduced landscapes unconventional though he was as an artist , this was humiliating luck soon seemed to change in 1883 , blakelock received a commission for a major painting from a silkmill magnate he began to get positive notices from critics and fellow painters he continued to maintain a studio in new york , often renting space in buildings populated by some of the most prestigious artists of the day but art dealers proved reluctant to intercede for the eccentric blakelock , leaving him to scramble to sell his pictures nor was the national academy quick to elect him to membership as a result , he often sold paintings for much less than fair value for comparable work the humiliation of having to haggle for even paltry remuneration may have precipitated a mental decline cora reluctantly agreed to have blakelock hospitalized in 1899 , after enduring several violent episodes at home and his claims that he was the duke of york ironically , blakelock s reputation seemed to take off shortly afterward one of his landscapes won an honorable mention while on exhibit in 1900 at the american pavilion in the grand palais in paris several private collectors organized shows followed by significant sales such attention , in turn , prompted the first major article to be written about his work
nashville , may 26 new telescope observations suggest that planets may form around distant stars more rapidly than previously thought , and some of these planetary systems could be far more extensive than the sun s , astronomers say the research , reported here today at a meeting of the american astronomical society , showed that many huge disks of dust around young stars leftovers of stellar formation out of which planets coalesce appeared to dissipate within three million years of the star s formation the likely explanation , the researchers said , is that the dust has already collected into the dense building blocks of earthlike solid planets , which would be undetectable with current telescopes if that is the case , the findings challenge the working hypothesis , based largely on studies of jupiter in the solar system , that it takes at least 10 million years for planets to develop out of these protoplanetary disks of dust and gas such disks with enough mass to form planetary systems are relatively common with newborn stars we will have to adjust our theories to understand how planets can form this quickly , dr elizabeth lada of the university of florida said at a news conference dr lada and dr karl haisch of the university of michigan , both of whom conducted the observations with radio telescopes , also concluded that the gas in the disks probably dissipated on a time scale similar to the dissipation of the dust , a finding that indicated that large gaseous planets like jupiter could be getting an equally rapid start other astronomers said they found the research provocative and potentially significant in one of the most active fields of astronomy the study of planet formation and comparative planetary systems in the last eight years , astronomers have detected more than 100 stars and observed even more circumstellar disks where planets may be forming commenting on the new findings , dr david weintraub , an astronomer at vanderbilt university , said it was conceivable that the planetforming process is well on the way around threemillionyearold stars but it is also conceivable , dr weintraub said , that all the dust has simply gone away some was probably sucked up by the star itself , and the rest could have been blown out into space by winds of stellar particles a vanderbilt graduate student , jeffrey s bary , working with dr weintraub , reported xray detections of molecular hydrogen around young stars that could be further evidence of extremely early planet formation molecular hydrogen is the main constituent of protoplanetary disks its persistence around a star with no detectable protoplanetary disk could mean that there had been one and that the dust had now coalesced into planetary objects , mr bary said dr lada acknowledged that it was not possible with current technology to confirm that any planets or growing seeds of planets actually exist around the young stars that have lost their detectable disks still , dr stephen p maran , an astronomer who is a spokesman for the astronomical society , said the observations of how short a time protoplanetary disks persist provided clues to enable you to develop a better theory for how new planets develop the researchers led by dr lada and dr haisch examined dozens of young stars in the constellations orion and perseus , a region of prodigious star birth about 1 , 000 lightyears from earth they determined that the number of massive protoplanetary disks decreased as the age of the clusters of stars they studied increased in one cluster of threemillionyearold stars , there were few such disks by the age of five million years , almost none of the stars appeared to retain their disks in another discovery , a team of international astronomers using infrared telescopes was surprised to find similar circumstellar disks that were 10 to 100 times as large as the solar system or any planetforming disks previously studied the team , led by dr richard elston of the university of florida and dr lada , who are married , calculated that each disk s diameter stretched thousands of times the distance from earth to the sun dr elston said the observations suggested that it might be possible for planets to form at much greater distances from their stars than previously thought this could throw theorists in a spin , but it would be good news for astronomers planets are notoriously difficult to detect near stars , which swamp their visible light , dr elston said so if the more distant reaches of the disk are conducive to planet formation , they will be easier to find once astronomers start looking there

brussels , march 28 the news from absurdistan was the headline on a commentary here the other day , written by luc van der kelen , the chief editor of the flemish newspaper het laatste nieuws a former president and the vice president are indicted for what happened during a war of liberation against a monstrous dictator who had invaded a small country , mr van der kelen wrote this is the totally absurd and inevitable consequence of grotesque legislation the former president to whom mr van der kelen was referring was george bush , the father of president bush , and the vice president was the current vice president of the united states , dick cheney both have been charged in belgium with war crimes in connection with the bombing of a civilian shelter in baghdad that killed 403 people in the persian gulf war of 1991 the accusations were filed under a belgian law that gives this small country universal jurisdiction , to try the perpetrators of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide , even if there is no belgian connection with the alleged crimes , the victims or perpetrators in fact , the effort to use the law against former president bush , which provoked angry complaints from secretary of state colin l powell \( who is also cited in the suit \) , has now led to an abrupt change here on thursday , a parliamentary commission rewrote the law to insert filters that will essentially enable the government to dismiss the case against mr bush there will be enough changes to prevent all these ridiculous cases , mr van der kelen said in an interview hopefully , we will be out of these problems yet , pending a vote of the full parliament on the changes in the law , the belgian effort to make itself a place where the victimized of the world can get a hearing seems a case study in good intentions gone awry it is also the story of a small country seeking a special moral role but , in the view now beginning to prevail , has overstepped the margins of good sense the belgian law of universal jurisdiction was adopted in 1993 , when the parliament , horrified by mounting civil strife in rwanda a former belgian colony wanted to act against what the law called grave violations of international human rights wherever they occurred other countries also have laws that enable them to reach beyond their borders when it comes to war crimes or crimes against humanity israeli law grants its authorities power to arrest and try those responsible for the holocaust , as happened with adolf eichmann in 1961 in 1998 , a spanish magistrate relied on spanish law and the international law of universal jurisdiction to seek the extradition of the former chilean dictator augusto pinochet from britain , where he was living in exile after holding mr pinochet in prison for a year , a british court denied the demand for extradition and instead returned him to chile but the belgian law is unusual in that it requires no connection with belgium at all for a case to be brought in its first years , many people who had suffered grave abuses of human rights did come here to file their cases saddam hussein was accused by iraqi kurds in the chemical attacks of kurdish areas exiled cubans accused fidel castro of human rights violations israeli victims of suicide bombings filed suit against yasir arafat none of those suits meant very much in practical terms the accused leaders ignored them , and belgium clearly has no capacity to pursue anybody indicted of war crimes but supporters of the law of universal jurisdiction felt there was an important element of symbolism we should n't forget that people who have undergone extraordinary suffering have been able to find a country in the world capable of hearing their pain and following up on their demands , even if it is in a purely theoretical way , eric david , a professor of law and a strong advocate of the belgian law told a frenchlanguage newspaper in 2001 , a group of lebanese palestinians filed a suit against ariel sharon , charging him with war crimes because of israel s failure to prevent the mass killings in sabra and shatila in israelioccupied lebanon in 1982 israel protested vigorously , and belgians questioned what business they had subjecting any israeli to prosecution israel became the first country to defend a case here , arguing successfully in lower courts that belgium had no jurisdiction to try an israeli leader but a few weeks ago the belgian supreme court issued a ruling that left open the possibility that mr sharon could be prosecuted the court ruled that mr sharon is immune from prosecution because he is now a serving prime minister , but upheld the principle of universal jurisdiction , meaning that once mr sharon becomes a private citizen , a new suit could be filed against him meanwhile , other israelis cited in the suit are still subject to belgian prosecution it is more than technically possible that if one of them came to belgium for , say , an international conference , or even went to a country with an extradition treaty with belgium , he could be arrested then , on march 18 , seven iraqi families filed suit against mr bush , mr cheney , mr powell and gen h norman schwarzkopf , the american commander in the gulf war the objective of the iraqi families , who together lost four or five children in that bombing , was to bring up the question of responsibility for their losses , said raymond coumont , president of an antiwar group called meetings for peace that filed suit with the iraqis they also knew from their own experience that it is simply not true that precision weapons prevent civilian deaths , mr coumont said and when they learned that president bush had decided to go to war against iraq , they felt that it was the moment to present their case mr powell retorted with a stern warning that belgium was risking its status as an international meeting place and the headquarters of nato , a warning that the government seems to have taken seriously more generally , as mr van der kelen wrote , there seemed something absurd in filing charges against a former president of the united states , even if the feelings of the iraqi families were easily understood this case proved that there is something wrong with the genocide law , didier seeuws , the spokesman for the belgian foreign ministry , said in an interview the government wants to change the law the government of prime minister guy verhofstadt has engaged in intense discussions to persuade parliament to accept the filters in the law that will essentially enable the government to reject cases where the accused person comes from a democratic country
it takes about 45 minutes to get from elmhurst in queens to the financial district in manhattan that is the measure of distance and time on the r subway line in most other respects , though , workingclass elmhurst and the canyons of wall street are lightyears apart richard a grasso , for many the latest avatar of unquenchable greed , crossed that great divide long ago the boy who would become top man at the new york stock exchange was schooled in elmhurst , at newtown high school on 90th street , and lived in neighboring jackson heights by all accounts , mr grasso s blue collar never completely faded , no matter how many millions he earned as his salary and bonuses acquired enough zeroes to make people dizzy , he suggested that at least some of his critics resented his upfrombottom r sum a college dropout suffering from a lack of manors he was n't richie rich he was , if you will , richie from the block on that block , the stretch of 90th street where the turreted newtown high sits , wall street still seems every bit as far away as it must have when mr grasso , 57 , attended classes there in the early 1960 s you might think that a local boy who made good on such a spectacular scale would be held forth as a lustrous example of what could be if one had the pluck and the luck but newtown students who were stopped briefly on their way to class yesterday said their teachers did not make much of mr grasso as a model alumnus , even before his fall from grace they knew he was somehow successful , they said but you might as well have asked them to diagram the human genome as to explain exactly what the chairman of the stock exchange does for teenagers in many corners of the city , wall street is no less distant , and no less an abstraction , than the taj mahal but these young people did appreciate numbers , one in particular 140 million , representing mr grasso s accumulated pay package even without a 48 million bundle that he agreed to forgo that figure brought whistles of admiration wow , that s michael jackson money , said one boy , who practically dissolved into the air the moment he was asked his name maybe he was playing hooky it s great that he made that of himself , he said of mr grasso who would n't take that kind of money \? inadvertently , this young fellow raised an interesting point much of the yelling has been about mr grasso s accepting an enormous payout far less has been made of the fact that when a person gets money , someone else , by definition , has to have given it that someone is the big board s directors , who include many of the same people now resorting to a casablanca defense they are shocked shocked at these shenanigans the newtown student s question almost makes a columnist wonder what to do in the unlikely event that he , like mr grasso , has a huge bundle of cash hurled at his head is he supposed to duck \? what should he do with any stray bills that may flutter down and stick to his clothes \? give them to charity \? perhaps mr grasso would have found less animosity had he done exactly that with one relatively small payment this was a 5 million bonus that he received in 2001 for having ably presided over the reopening of the stock exchange after the sept 11 terrorist attack he was already earning nearly 26 million that year most people probably expect someone making that kind of money to be on top of things in a crisis that s why they get the big bucks , and all that the 5 million has clearly rubbed some new yorkers the wrong way to them , it smacks of profiting from the worst disaster in the city s history of course , many have profited from 9 11 books have been sold , movies have been made , political reputations have been burnished former mayor rudolph w giuliani , who said in an interview that he saw nothing wrong with mr grasso s bonus , is reported to earn as much as 100 , 000 per speech would he have commanded such fees purely on the strength of his mayoral performance as of sept 10 , 2001 , splendid as many thought it to have been \? new york police officers , firefighters , rescue workers and others all made oodles in post9 11 overtime , which artificially inflated the pensions of many who took early retirement but none of them received a bonus for doing their jobs and heroically in many cases learning about that single 5 million payment is what persuaded some new yorkers , when the end came for mr grasso , that richie from the block was just another richie rich after all
macomb , ill , aug 2 kurt warner gave everyone a good story , maybe too good it began just across the state line in cedar falls , iowa , where nine years ago he stocked shelves at a hyvee grocery store , working the graveyard shift for 550 an hour , just so he could stay in shape during the day he bounced around the minor leagues until , with gray stubble on his chin , he led a woeful st louis rams franchise to three seasons like none before but then last year happened four losses to start the season , a broken pinkie in warner s throwing hand in that last loss , another broken bone in the same hand upon his return and rumors that his right arm had gone soft after three great seasons , it s like , 'well , this guy ca n't play anymore , ' warner said thursday at the rams' training camp here it s amazing how quickly it happened in 2003 , the story of the rams will hinge greatly on the recuperative powers of warner after a season that tested his resolve if there are any scars , physical or otherwise , the 32yearold warner has concealed them to the point of invisibility his right hand bears neither the bruises nor the gauze tape that occasionally covered it last season his passes seem to have zip and precision , like old times , his teammates say coach mike martz has named warner his no 1 quarterback , but some memories from last season are fresh warner started six games , and the rams lost all of them with the backup marc bulger under center , though , the rams won six of seven games and flirted briefly with a playoff run both quarterbacks say they accept that warner is the starter , and both seem to mean it i think he still understands he has a ways to go to get up to where i am in the offense , and understands that i'm probably a better quarterback right now , warner said of bulger will that always be the case \? who knows \? he has unbelievable amounts of talent , and i think because of that it makes it a little easier to understand where we are in our careers bulger said after last year , people were trying to throw a wedge between us , telling him he s done , but he has n't wavered one bit his little bump in the road last year is nothing compared to his life and all of things he s gone through a lot of guys would crack under that and there are plenty of examples which i wo n't name but for him , it s nothing he s been there before how many times does he have to prove people wrong \? bulger , in his third season with the rams , has a good feel for the optimism that envelops warner when the rams lost , 2614 , at tampa bay last season to fall to 03 , warner and his family remained outwardly optimistic on a commercial flight home , a day after warner threw four interceptions , his wife , brenda , could be seen passing out his football cards to the children on board but sheer optimism does n't explain how warner fell so hard last season warner said he simply struggled in three tough losses against denver , the giants , and the buccaneers to open the season and was later hampered by his injured hand for the rest of the season , in which he compiled a 674 quarterback rating , compared with 1014 in 2001 bulger pointed to other factors it just seemed like everyone was telling him something was wrong , and he was trying to figure out what it was , bulger said there probably was n't anything wrong , but he was stressing so hard and trying that it just seemed like there was too much effort kurt does n't really have to try that s how good he is now i think he s back to that , where he s just making it look effortless , and the ball is coming out like it used to still , the rams , going into this season , were not immediately sold on warner s health before allowing him to collect on a 6 million roster bonus in february , the team conducted a magnetic resonance imaging test on his right shoulder to ensure that it still had the bigstrike capability of a couple of seasons ago i heard speculation that the rams wanted to do that in the offseason because they were worried about some kind of injury , but they never approached me about it , warner said so i went in and said 'let s go send me' there was never anything wrong with my shoulder it s never been in an issue , i do n't know where it came from i do n't know how it started but i was like , 'i have nothing to hide' obviously , i had a great deal of faith that there was absolutely nothing wrong , and that s how it turned out to be i think i'm playing better now than i 've ever played warner admits that his relationship with martz became different last season as he struggled and his coach turned his attention to the backups but both men say the rapport is strong again , warner adding that all it took was me getting healthy , me getting back in there , and that relationship has just come back together on friday , martz said we 're probably quite a bit closer he does get left out when he s injured , and when you 're really close to somebody , even though this is a business , it s still hard to go through warner said getting out of st louis for a month of training camp was another strong antidote to last season s 79 campaign and the loud speculation that , maybe , his time had simply come and gone among these tall cornfields that line almost every road , warner feels at home and completely at ease amid twoaday practices , sleeping in a dorm room , and lunching on granola , hardboiled eggs , salad and fruit he still has fans here , and they watch from the ropes at practice and remember his feats just two years ago they cheer for him still at the hyvee on university avenue in cedar falls i follow pro football , said brian larson , an assistant manager at hyvee , who worked days when warner worked nights everybody has an off time , and i think it was n't so much him but the team going through a transition larson said that distance and defeats had lessened some of the enthusiasm for warner but warner has been in this position before it s nothing one good season ca n't change it 'll be fun to see what the stories are going to be when the season s over , he said photos in training camp so far , the rams' kurt warner has dispelled reports that his passes have lost zip \( photo by associated press \) \( pg 1 \) kurt warner broke the little finger on his throwing hand last season in week 4 against dallas \( photo by associated press \) \( pg 4 \)
washington , april 7 following are excerpts from the supreme court s 6to3 ruling in virginia v black that states can outlaw cross burning that is meant to intimidate justice sandra day o'connor wrote the majority opinion justice david h souter and justice clarence thomas wrote dissents a full transcript is online at nytimescom national from the decision by justice o'connor the first amendment , applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment , provides that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech the hallmark of the protection of free speech is to allow free trade in ideas , even ideas that the overwhelming majority of people might find distasteful or discomforting thus , the first amendment ordinarily denies a state the power to prohibit dissemination of social , economic and political doctrine which a vast majority of its citizens believes to be false and fraught with evil consequence the first amendment affords protection to symbolic or expressive conduct as well as to actual speech the protections afforded by the first amendment , however , are not absolute , and we have long recognized that the government may regulate certain categories of expression consistent with the constitution the first amendment permits restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas , which are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality thus , for example , a state may punish those words which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace we have consequently held that fighting words those personally abusive epithets which , when addressed to the ordinary citizen , are , as a matter of common knowledge , inherently likely to provoke violent reaction are generally proscribable under the first amendment furthermore , the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a state to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action and the first amendment also permits a state to ban a true threat true threats encompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals the speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat rather , a prohibition on true threats protects individuals from the fear of violence and from the disruption that fear engenders , in addition to protecting people from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur intimidation in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word is a type of true threat , where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death respondents do not contest that some cross burnings fit within this meaning of intimidating speech , and rightly so the history of cross burning in this country shows that cross burning is often intimidating , intended to create a pervasive fear in victims that they are a target of violence the supreme court of virginia ruled that in light of rav v city of st paul , even if it is constitutional to ban cross burning in a contentneutral manner , the virginia crossburning statute is unconstitutional because it discriminates on the basis of content and viewpoint it is true , as the supreme court of virginia held , that the burning of a cross is symbolic expression the reason why the klan burns a cross at its rallies , or individuals place a burning cross on someone else s lawn , is that the burning cross represents the message that the speaker wishes to communicate individuals burn crosses as opposed to other means of communication because cross burning carries a message in an effective and dramatic manner the fact that cross burning is symbolic expression , however , does not resolve the constitutional question the supreme court of virginia relied upon rav v city of st paul to conclude that once a statute discriminates on the basis of this type of content , the law is unconstitutional we disagree in rav , we held that a local ordinance that banned certain symbolic conduct , including cross burning , when done with the knowledge that such conduct would arouse anger , alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race , color , creed , religion or gender was unconstitutional we held that the ordinance did not pass constitutional muster because it discriminated on the basis of content by targeting only those individuals who provoke violence on a basis specified in the law the ordinance did not cover those who wish to use 'fighting words' in connection with other ideas to express hostility , for example , on the basis of political affiliation , union membership , or homosexuality this contentbased discrimination was unconstitutional because it allowed the city to impose special prohibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavored subjects
four years ago , rich egan could n't fathom the usefulness of napster mr egan , the coowner and president of the independent music label vagrant records , had heard about the software which let users trade songs over the internet without paying artists or labels and could not imagine how such a setup could benefit his business but as soon as mr egan tried it , he was hooked today he says seemingly counterintuitively his label simply would not exist without filesharing services like napster and its successors kazaa and morpheus even as the major labels of the music industry pursue file traders for copyright infringement through lawsuits and the court of public opinion , vagrant and many other independent label owners cheer them on file sharing , these owners say , helps their small companies compete against conglomerates with deeper pockets for advertising and greater access to radio programmers our music , by and large , when kids listen to it , they share it with their friends , mr egan said then they go buy the record they take ownership of it as the music industry suffers through its third consecutive year of falling sales , a decline the major labels say is primarily a result of file sharing , vagrant is one of many independent labels having some success of the 100 topselling albums of 2003 through sept 14 , six come from independent labels and collectively have sold six million copies , according to figures from nielsen soundscan during all of 2002 , only four independent releases made the top 100 and together they sold 55 million copies and in an industry where the five major companies the universal music group , which is owned by vivendi universal bmg , a unit of bertelsmann aol time warner inc the sony corporation and the emi group have more than 80 percent of sales , the independents have actually increased their market share this year by nearly a full percentage point by no means have the independents escaped the music business s threeyear sales slump in 2002 , album sales dropped 173 percent , to 650 million units , from the yearend total of 785 million units in 2000 they are down another 86 percent for the first eight months of this year , compared with the period last year the industry s in a disastrous situation , said josh bernoff , a principal analyst at forrester research file sharing , illegal cd burning , competition from other entertainment and the weak national economy are all cited as contributors to a downturn that has led to layoffs and budget cuts in january , one of the bestknown independent labels , artemis records , laid off 15 people , 40 percent of its staff , said danny goldberg , its chief executive , who started the label in 1999 after running major labels like the mercury records group , warner brothers records and atlantic records it s a battle , added alan meltzer , chief executive of windup records we go to war every day fighting for our little piece of territory nonetheless , the sense of worry that permeates the mainstream industry does not consume the independent labels to the same degree windup , which is distributed in the united states by bmg , is one of the more successful modern independents fallen , by the rock band evanescence , has been a staple of the top 10 for the last six months and has sold more than two million copies creed s human clay \( 1999 \) has sold more than 11 million copies , making it the seventhbestselling album since soundscan began tracking sales in 1991 for some independent label executives , their confidence stems from subscribing to

singapore , sept 9 the singapore health ministry confirmed today that a 27yearold postdoctoral researcher who worked in two of the city s medical laboratories had sars , the first new case reported since the world health organization said in july that the highly contagious disease had been contained worldwide the case was discovered two months before the onset of the northern hemisphere winter , the season in which the medical community expected that the disease might recur the acting health minister , khaw boon wan , said at a news conference here that the case represented a low public health risk he said he was confident that the case did not represent a new outbreak of sars because the patient s symptoms had been picked up early and he had been isolated early dr khaw said that 25 people who had been in contact with the researcher including eight people at the singapore general hospital and eight family members had been ordered quarantined he emphasized that he had decided to confirm the man s illness as sars , even though it did not meet the world health organization s definition a spokesman for who , dick thompson , speaking about the case to the associated press , said , we are urging that people take necessary precautions as if this were sars but at this moment it does n't fit the clinical definition of sars dr khaw urged singapore , which suffered a drastic economic downturn because of the threemonth epidemic earlier this year , not to be alarmed my message to singaporeans is to carry on with your life , he said i do n't think singaporeans have to lose too much sleep over this but that does n't mean we should be complacent schools will resume on monday as planned after this week s vacation , he said the singapore general hospital , where the patient was treated before being moved to a hospital dedicated to sars , has been placed on an orange alert the alert , one step below the highest , or red alert , restricts visits to some wards and calls for more intensive temperature surveillance of staff , he said no other institution has been required to take extra precautionary measures who , he said , requires a patient s chest xray to show positive for sars , but three serial xrays taken of the researcher at the singapore general hospital were normal but because a repeat of polymerase chain reaction tests done today at the national university hospital of similar tests done on monday at another laboratory confirmed the initial positive results , dr khaw said , he was confident that the man had sars the polymerase tests detect and amplify genetic material from the patient dr khaw said it was critical to find the source of the patient s infection the researcher , a specialist in the west nile virus , had not traveled to areas affected by sars and had no known contact with sars patients , he said the man had last visited a laboratory at the national environment agency , where research is conducted on the live sars virus , on aug 23 , six days after research on the virus was last conducted there , dr khaw said that gap makes it unlikely that the laboratory was the source of the man s illness , daniel wang , the director general of public health of the national environmental agency , said after the news conference none of the other workers at the environment health institute s laboratory have become ill , both mr wang and dr khaw said
minneapolis charles baxter was sitting at a plastic table on the sidewalk outside sebastian joe s , his neighborhood coffee shop here , when a bus rumbled by , making conversation momentarily impossible the bus was followed by a honking car , then an ambulance , its siren wailing mr baxter beamed we can be as loud as anybody ! he shouted happily above the din if the street noise of his hometown brings out his defensive local pride , it is with good reason mr baxter , 56 , the author of four collections of short stories and three novels , including the feast of love \( 2000 \) , a finalist for the national book award , has accumulated literary accolades and glowing reviews the poet edward hirsch , president of the guggenheim foundation and an old friend , called him one of the most authentic and most moving fiction writers working at midcareer today but despite his enviable track record and a new novel , saul and patsy \( pantheon \) due out sept 9 , he remains surprisingly obscure , less read and talked about than writers of comparable or arguably lesser accomplishment part of the explanation may lie with the label midwestern and the mostly dubious associations it implies that hover over his fiction like , well , storm clouds over the prairie when others think about midwesterners , they think na ve , somewhat simple , mr baxter said ruefully why else would you live here if not for some failure in judgment \? a lean , finefeatured man with a wispy beard and a warm tenor voice , he added with mild defiance alice munro lives in ontario , which is sort of the midwest of canada but her themes are universal when literature is of a certain quality , whatever its origins , you just do n't care it s not simply that mr baxter s stories tend to be set in the midwest , where he has spent most of his life or that his characters are prone to the same snobberies and prejudices about the region as the rest of the nation \( what a midwesterner he was , muses diana in the feast of love about the man to whom she is briefly , disastrously married a thoroughly unhip guy with his heart in the usual place , on the sleeve , in plain sight he was uninteresting and genuine , sweettempered and dependable , the sort of man who will stabilize your pulse rather than make it race \) in mr baxter s case the midwestern label has less do with geography than style , denoting a sensibility that seems stubbornly impervious to fashion subtle forays into the lives of ordinary people , his stories lack the verbal pyrotechnics , formal gimmicks and overweening social ambition that have lately become prerequisites for buzz and the stock in trade of hot novelists like dave eggers , jonathan franzen and jonathan safran foer to use the words routinely invoked by admiring critics , mr baxter s books are luminous investigations of the prosaic quiet , gracious and deeply felt that is a fair description of saul and patsy , a penetrating , surprisingly funny meditation on the dynamics of community belonging and acceptance like many of his characters , saul and patsy are immediately likable and seemingly unexceptional recent college graduates , newly married and indifferent to much besides scrabble , crossword puzzles and each other , they become increasingly entangled in the troubled life of five oaks , the tiny town in rural michigan where saul , determined to help undo the dumbness that s been done , teaches american history at the high school saul s misgivings about five oaks begin almost as soon as they arrive a secular jew from baltimore who has never given much thought to his ethnicity , he becomes uncomfortably aware of his outsider status a middleaged neighbor wants to know whether jews can eat cookies the local barber marvels over his kinky hair and gordy himmelman , a semiliterate 16yearold in his remedial english class , turns in papers embellished with antisemitic slurs only after gordy s eccentric behavior culminates in a crisis in saul and patsy s yard , and they become targets of local hostility , does saul realize that the town s young people share his feelings of isolation and exclusion , an insight that leads to an unlikely and comical catharsis mr baxter said the book grew out of a general preoccupation with a kind of american loneliness that will not go away , and in particular with the problem of underparented children i did n't want to write a postcolumbine book , he said but these children are out there disaffiliated , disenfranchised , the goths , the neogoths , the underparented saul s jewishness was intended merely as a place holder of difference , he said he could have been almost anything a book reader , a musician , an africanamerican , anybody who does n't quite fit mr baxter has written about saul and patsy and five oaks before his first novel , first light \( 1987 \) , a story told in chronological reverse about the relationship between an astrophysicist and her brother , a buick salesman , was set primarily in five oaks and saul and patsy s first few months in the town were originally chronicled in a short story published in 1985 another story , from 1997 , recounted their transition to parenthood
the sun s gonna shine in my back door some day the wind s gonna rise and blow my blues away tommy johnson the united states senate has declared \( with unintended irony \) that 2003 is the year of the blues it has urged the president to issue a proclamation to that effect it s very difficult to overstate the cultural importance of the blues , which have been around about 100 years , were crucial to the overall development of jazz and gave birth about a halfcentury ago to a boisterous new music called rock 'n' roll the blues , powerful and bitter and mean and hopeful and funny , grew out of the brutally degraded condition of black americans in the early decades of the 20th century the music was like a salve to the raw wounds of men and women working literally like slaves in the cotton fields and corn fields of the mississippi delta , or struggling against the dire poverty and grotesque racism of other deep south venues , or trying to survive on domestic and janitorial work in the unforgiving environs of the industrial north these were lives condemned to poverty and tragedy and desperation opportunities were few and life expectancies were pathetically short and yet the people endured the blues provided the soundtrack i got to keep moving , sang robert johnson , perhaps the greatest bluesman of them all i got to keep moving , blues falling down like hail , blues falling down like hail and the day keeps 'minding me , there s a hellhound on my trail , hellhound on my trail , hellhound on my trail now hold onto your hats , folks , because that music is about to make a comeback the filmmaker martin scorsese and some of his associates are raising the curtain today on a dandy project this is special , he said in an interview last week mr scorsese and six other directors , including wim wenders , mike figgis and clint eastwood , are nearing completion of seven featurelength films about the blues excerpts from five of the films will be shown today at the sundance film festival all seven films will be shown on pbs next fall as the centerpiece of an even bigger project called year of the blues this will include a 13part public radio series on the history of the blues , a companion book of rarely seen archival material , and a traveling blues exhibition and education program that the sponsors hope will reach up to five million children the year of the blues will begin more or less officially with a benefit concert at radio city music hall in new york on feb 7 the film project began about five years ago when mr scorsese was the executive producer on a concert film with eric clapton in which footage of blues musicians from the past was used from that , said mr scorsese , came the idea of doing a series of films that would honor the history of the blues the films are not straight narratives , or documentaries , but rather what mr scorsese calls interpretive , personal looks at the blues the idea , he said , was to take the archival footage , and then to take journeys , interpretive looks at the blues , and create an awareness for young people that , first , this is an art form , and then to understand how it happened , where it came from and how it continues mr scorsese s film , from mali to mississippi , is not yet finished i hope to complete it by march , he said it goes all the way back to the antecedents of the blues on the banks of the niger river in mali and then follows the progression of the music to the cotton fields and juke joints of the mississippi delta the blues somehow flourished in those fields of oppression and went on to nurture nearly every form of popular american music that followed in his book deep blues , robert palmer described a visit he made in 1979 to the mississippi delta home of joe rice dockery , who had inherited from his father the remnants of a plantation on which an astonishing number of great blues musicians had lived and played mr dockery had grown up on the plantation but had never heard the music none of us gave much thought to this blues thing until a few years ago , he said in other words , we never heard these people sing we were never the type of plantation owners who invited their help to come in and sing for parties i wish we had realized that these people were so important

phoenix , may 30 for nearly two weeks now , daytime temperatures in some parts of arizona have reached well over 100 degrees , far above normal for this time of year and a notsosubtle reminder that the drought searing the west for the last five years is not going away summer is still three weeks off , but 11 western states are already experiencing extreme or exceptional drought conditions , according to the national drought mitigation center at the university of nebraska and there is little evidence to suggest that relief is coming any time soon the governors of arizona and utah have already declared their states emergency drought areas for this year , a pronouncement that qualifies them to seek federal aid colorado is providing state aid to communities whose local water supplies are drying up utah has asked for federal help , mostly so farmers can buy feed for cattle lake powell and lake mead , the enormous reservoirs on the colorado river that provide most of southern nevada s water , are each about halfempty \( certainly not halffull , to state water managers \) , the lowest they have been in 30 years for the first time , communities that depend on the lakes are collaborating on a regional drought plan , imposing wateruse restrictions and raising water rates by as much as 40 percent the drought has reached such a prolonged and dangerous point that the federal bureau of reclamation , the branch of the interior department that manages river flow and water storage , has issued a major new report , water 2025 , that addresses how to handle water crises when supplies fall , as they are expected to arizona , which has never had a drought plan , is finally developing one beyond that , cities and counties in many western states are stepping up efforts to monitor car washing , lawn watering and other nonessential water uses to the point that they are issuing tickets to people who violate new local restrictions other conflicts are landing in court , like a dispute in new mexico , where diminishing supplies of water in the rio grande are pitting farmers against protectors of the silvery minnow while 35 states have drought plans in effect , persistent hot , dry conditions are forcing government officials to take a harder look at how to manage declining water supplies at a time when the west continues to be the fastestgrowing region in the country and the endangered species act remains sacrosanct with our report , we 're trying to say that even once the drought has passed , the crisis has not passed , john w keys iii , commissioner of the reclamation bureau , said in an interview problems will remain , especially in areas of exploding population like southern nevada and phoenix and other areas where federal laws like the endangered species act and the clean water act have to be taken into consideration the report emphasizes the likelihood that western states will not have enough water for decades , and the need for more ambitious water management plans to blunt the worst of consequences , including wildfires and severe restrictions on use several areas are cited as especially vulnerable , including the southern border of texas , central colorado , the rio grande valley in new mexico , metropolitan salt lake city , northeastern arizona , the arizonacalifornia border and the central valley of california among western states , perhaps none took a harder beating from the drought last year than arizona , where cities have had ample water supplies from the colorado river and other sources but remote regions are struggling in the north , dense forests turned into easy kindling as two wildfires converged to become the biggest in state history , destroying more than 400 , 000 acres what fire missed , insects ate and are still munching since last summer , more than 700 , 000 acres of ponderosa pine trees , left dried and defenseless , have been devoured by the biggest outbreak of bark beetles in recent state history the drought was so severe that last year , for the first time , arizona used its entire annual allotment of water from the colorado , 28 million acre feet , to satisfy immediate needs and store water for the future the same level of use is expected to continue at least through this year , adding to problems in southern california , which has the largest allotment , 44 million acre feet , and counts on unused water from arizona and other states for the growing needs of california farmers and population centers around san diego yet it was only several months ago that arizona state officials met for the first time to contemplate the kind of comprehensive drought response and mitigation plan that other western states had been developing since the early 1980 s why did arizona wait so long \? until recently , the colorado river was always unstintingly dependable , and alternative sources , like the salt and verde rivers , were running at capacity now , the colorado is at 60 percent of normal , and the other rivers are running at record low levels areas here are always under stress , but the drought exacerbated the conditions , said the leader of the group developing arizona s plan , herb guenther , a wildlife biologist and former state lawmaker who was appointed director of the arizona department of water resources this year by the new governor , janet napolitano we began to see larger areas with more people impacted , mr guenther said , and we needed to get in front of the problem to find them immediate relief mr guenther insisted that the state had enough water for the next decade or so , at least enough to satisfy demands from the large metropolitan centers around phoenix and tucson but problems loom despite adequate snows this winter in the rocky mountains , a key source for the colorado , much of the snow melt fed the front range , helping denver , even causing flooding in some areas , but depleting the river of nearly a third of its usual supply for states to the south those conditions are raising pressure on state officials here to maintain adequate supplies of water for rural communities , indian tribes that rely on ground water , livestock farmers and firefighters and problems like that are not limited to arizona lawns are going brown , said pat mulroy , manager of the southern nevada water authority , ticking off restrictions set for later in the year that include a ban on water for car washes , decorative fountains , shopping center misters and golf course fairways this community , she added , is going through culture shock for its new drought plan , arizona will contemplate immediate and longterm changes but even with instant application , mr guenther said , none is likely to make much of an impact for more than a decade we look at drought plans and fire plans the same , he said there are no real shortterm solutions in the meantime , all we can do is fall back and defend our positions photos beetles are killing the ponderosa pines in arizona , including these in prescott national forest since last summer , beetles have devoured 700 , 000 acres of the trees , left defenseless because of the drought \( photographs by jeff topping for the new york times \) the colorado river near hite , utah , last month , as it wound its way to the lake powell reservoir the reservoir is at its lowest level in 30 years \( associated press \) chart maps summer drought outlook current dry conditions , expecially in the southwest , may portend an intensifying drought over the summer drought conditions as of thursday map of the united states highlights the extent of the droughtstricken areas according to the following criteria abnormally dry moderate severe extreme exceptional drought outlook projected through august map of the united states highlights projected droughtprone regions by the following criteria will persist or intensify will continue , with some improvement likely to improve \( sources national drought mitigation center national weather service \)
washington , july 12 from iowa to new hampshire to south carolina , the democratic candidates for president these days are scrambling for issues denouncing president bush s tax cuts , bemoaning his deficit , decrying the chaos in iraq and all too often , those issues bring restrained applause from their crowds but there is one subject that has proved to be a surefire tonic for members of the somewhat dispirited party , and it is not the man they are trying to oust from the oval office in my first five seconds as president , i would fire john ashcroft as attorney general , representative richard a gephardt of missouri said the other day , bringing cheers from hispanic leaders in phoenix we can not allow people like john ashcroft to take away our rights and our freedoms , senator john edwards of north carolina declared in a sweltering library in concord , nh , on monday , drawing a nearly instantaneous standing ovation or , as senator john kerry of massachusetts put it in a speech on domestic security in lowell , mass , last month when i am president of the united states , there will be no john ashcroft trampling on the bill of rights these days , it is hard to go to any event featuring a democratic presidential candidate without hearing a condemnation of the former missouri senator who suffered the ignominy of losing reelection to an opponent who had died in a plane crash the month before the election mr ashcroft , 61 , appointed by mr bush to be the nation s chief law enforcement officer to cheers from conservative republicans and fierce opposition from democratic senators , has assumed the mantle in american politics that has famously been filled by , for example , james watt on the right and hillary rodham clinton on the left he has , for the opposition , become the polarizing embodiment of a party in power he has become the figure of scorn wandering through democratic speeches , a boldface name in democratic fundraising letters , and inevitably , advisers to several democratic presidential candidates said , a character in political advertisements that have not even been made yet and not incidentally , mr ashcroft has also become a convenient foil for democratic members of congress who voted for the antiterrorism patriot act and are now finding themselves trying to explain that vote to liberal democrats who are rallying behind howard dean , the former governor of vermont dr dean denounced the act as a threat to civil liberties and has noted the favorable votes cast by his opponents , including mr gephardt , mr kerry , mr edwards , and senators joseph i lieberman of connecticut and bob graham of florida those candidates , asked about the vote , tend to respond by denouncing mr ashcroft it is hardly unusual so early in a campaign for candidates to demonize an unpopular figure on the other side in order to draw cheers and checks from the most committed party members , who are likely to be paying attention now mr bush s campaign advisers and mr ashcroft s defenders dismissed the attacks as irrelevant partisan sallies it is cotton candy rhetoric that is geared to extreme base voters , said mr ashcroft s spokeswoman , barbara comstock but it dissolves upon the taste test he s doing the job the president asked him to do making sure another terrorist attack does n't happen , she said some republicans expressed concern about potential damage the often unvarnished mr ashcroft might cause this president none of those democrats can beat george bush , but john ashcroft can , said one republican strategist but a senior political adviser to mr bush argued that no matter how unpopular mr ashcroft might be , he would not hurt the president and this adviser suggested that there were no plans , at least now , to try to keep mr ashcroft out of public view as the election approaches i look at it the same way i looked at the trent lott thing , this adviser said , referring to the senate majority leader who was forced out of office after a storm over remarks he made that were denounced as racially insensitive people judge the party by how they view the president they are not going to judge him by a cabinet member and more than half the country does n't know who he is eddie mahe , a republican consultant , said clearly the democrats will be able to use him as a real motivator for their troops but ultimately , they ca n't run against ashcroft they 've got to run against bush still , some democrats suggest that given the sofarenduring popularity of mr bush , mr ashcroft might just have to do for the most part , mr ashcroft has drawn attacks for his record on civil liberties , symbolized by the intense surveillance and investigative tactics embraced by his justice department after the attacks on sept 11 , 2001 but he has from the start arguably been the most conservative member of mr bush s cabinet , on issues ranging from abortion to gay rights , and several democrats said he might have assumed this role even if he had not been pushed into additional prominence after the attacks ashcroft has become a symbol of ideas and doctrine and ideology that are just unacceptable in the bush administration , said chris lehane , who was al gore s press secretary and is this year advising mr kerry he is a living , breathing troglodyte who happens to run the justice department there is no doubt that the democratic presidential contenders are receiving plenty of reinforcement of that view as they campaign among the most hardcore of democrats who turn out for these early events i think he might be the most loathed man in america , said janos marton , 20 , a dartmouth student who pressed mr edwards on the subject of mr ashcroft s civil liberties record at a town hall meeting the other night the way he is undermining civil liberties is disgraceful
los angeles the valley plaza mall in north hollywood , calif , was once the premier shopping center in this region built in 1947 , it was only the second mall in greater los angeles , and it was among the first malls in the nation to be designed as a unified entity but today valley plaza is suffering approximately 30 of its 125 storefronts are vacant because it does n't have a single owner , the center has had difficulty formulating the remodeling and expansion crucial to its continuing health with bigger malls sprouting all the time in southern california , this san fernando valley landmark could face outright closure that s why the architect pierre de angelis , 29 , and his partner , carmen suero , 26 , chose valley plaza as their subject when they entered the dead malls competition , held here recently by the los angeles forum for architecture and urban design mr de angelis and ms suero s submission was among 5 winners chosen out of 75 entries from the united states and a few other countries , including england , israel and australia , in a competition to generate new ideas about how the shopping center , that symbol of american consumerism , can be transformed although none of the designs are expected to be built , the forum will publish a book on the competition and the larger issues behind it in august the mall represents a point in time in the evolution of retailing , said will fleissig of the congress for the new urbanism , a san francisco organization devoted to progressive urban planning now we 're reaching the end of that era and entering something new mr fleissig was on the competition s jury of nine architects , developers and academics because malls gather a variety of goods and services into a central cluster , new urbanism advocates like mr fleissig see them as potentially beneficial public spaces , but only if the malls can respond better to their surrounding environments i do n't think there s anything wrong , per se , with the inside of malls , said another juror , julie eizenberg of koning eizenberg architecture in los angeles the problem is with their transition to the outside although there is not one formula for making the mall a healthier urban space , there is a consensus that to have an ongoing life , malls need to take on more uses social services , housing , religious institutions , said warren techentin , who organized the competition he cited the paseo colorado mall in pasadena as a good model , with apartments on top of traditional mall retailers like macy s and sam goody the paseo colorado also has an underground parking lot , which integrates the mall with the pedestrianoriented shops of downtown pasadena better than a traditional surface parking lot would have done most entries , however , did not include such a mixture of tenants and uses instead , many submissions sought partial or total reinvention of the existing space one of the 21 finalists envisioned a women s minimumsecurity prison another proposed a group of facilities with arts themes a winning entry for the vallejo plaza mall in vallejo , calif , offered by stoner meek architecture urban design of san francisco , imagined the restoration of nearby wetlands and an estuary while consolidating stillopen stores into a defunct kmart perhaps the most controversial entry , mr techentin said , was a winning proposal for the eagle rock mall in eagle rock , calif , by elizabeth meyer and ann rosenberg , who were architecture students when the competition began purposefully challenging new urbanism strategies , their proposal looked back to the mall s suburban origins , with cul de sacs and zigzagging streets , to create a lifestyle park of shops the diversity of design among the winners may stem from confusing statistics on the health of the american mall in 1960 there were 3 , 000 shopping centers in the united states , with four square feet of retail space per shopper today there are nearly 40 , 000 shopping centers in the nation , with 19 square feet of space per shopper however , according to the book greyfields into goldfields dead malls become living neighborhoods , published by the congress for the new urbanism in 2001 , nearly onefifth of america s regional malls , which average about 500 , 000 square feet , are dying or declining meanwhile , larger malls averaging about 900 , 000 square feet often take their place the disparity suggests a kind of retail social darwinism to avoid death , malls must continually get bigger , adding movie theaters and other amenities in an effort to outpace their competitors that s why smaller regional malls are often the ones to go while behemoths like the mall of america in bloomington , minn , still flourish but jeffrey inaba , a juror and one of the authors , with rem koolhaas and others , of the harvard design guide to shopping , said any time there s a plan to just enhance and expand , that s the smell of death you might add 12 years of life , but that should n't be good enough for our profession to survive in the long run , mr inaba said , malls need to embrace reinvention what the five winning designs shared was an acknowledgment that the typical dumbbell mall shape , with four or more bigbox anchor tenants connected by smaller retail shops , is becoming obsolete the de angelissuero plan for valley plaza , for example , eliminated anchor tenants , which are less profitable on a persquarefoot basis than smaller stores the plan also eliminated duplication of retail types , even though duplication had been a pioneering aspect of valley plaza our idea was that the only way to undo it was to propose an even more neutral and simple diagram , mr de angelis said their proposal is a sharp contrast to the actual redevelopment plan being offered for the plaza by the j h snyder development company of los angeles , which allocates 70 million to add more than 300 , 000 square feet of space it s a hodgepodge of old buildings , mr snyder said of the mall the developer acknowledged that housing and other amenities ought to be included in future shopping centers , although they are not planned for valley plaza mr de angelis hopes his proposal can at least influence thinking about how future malls are built the real problem with dead malls is n't that they 're dying , he said it s that they 're being built photos two finalists

david sinclair made headlines last month by discovering that a chemical commonly found in red wine could vastly increase the life span of yeast now he aims to become biotechnology s answer to ponce de le n dr sinclair , an assistant professor at harvard medical school , says he hopes to soon start a company to develop drugs that would slow aging and make people live longer , healthier lives an antiaging pill could be the ultimate blockbuster drug people , particularly aging baby boomers , already spend billions of dollars to fight the ravages of aging with medicines and procedures from heart bypass operations and lipitor to facelifts and viagra but those solutions tackle one problem at a time at least in theory , an antiaging pill could postpone the onset of many problems simultaneously such a pill could be taken not only by people with a certain disease but potentially by everyone of course , if the drug merely meant spending extra decades with the infirmities of old age , many people would not want it but evidence from laboratory animals suggests that slowing aging would also prolong youthfulness and postpone the onset of agerelated diseases like cancer and alzheimer s that would mean one drug that would slow down or prevent cancer , osteoporosis , heart disease , said dr sinclair , who has been making precisely this pitch to the venture capitalists he has been visiting lately there is no single drug like that that has ever been contemplated about a dozen biotechnology companies , some with hopefulsounding names like elixir pharmaceuticals , lifegen technologies , longenity , chronogen , gerotech , juvenon and rejuvenon , are already pursuing agingrelated drugs it is not clear which , if any , will enjoy a long corporate life span but as dr sinclair put it , even if there s a 1 percent chance that we 're right , it s still a pretty good gamble life expectancy has increased in the united states to about 77 years today from 47 in 1900 , largely as a result of better sanitation and medicines that have reduced mortality in children and young adults experts say the maximum life span , defined as the longest any person has ever lived , is 122 even if individual cures were developed for all diseases , experts say , neither life expectancy nor maximum life span would rise much though more people would come closer to achieving the maximum to have people live to 130 or 150 would require slowing aging some scientists say the ability to do that is near genetic studies are peeling back the mechanisms of aging as never before already , dozens of genes have been found that , when turned on or off , can vastly extend life span in yeast , nematode worms and fruit flies no one can doubt that you can postpone aging , said michael r rose , an evolutionary biologist at the university of california at irvine , who bred fruit flies that live twice as long as expected thirty years ago it was thought to be immutable but do n't rush to the drugstore or the wine cellar just yet nothing has been proved to extend life span for people , and it is far from certain that humans will react as yeast does the fledgling industry faces formidable scientific , regulatory , financial and public relations problems , the last stemming from the long association of life extension with quackery no drug to slow aging is expected to reach the market for at least 10 years and if one does , it probably wo n't even be promoted as an antiaging pill that is because aging is not considered a disease , so the food and drug administration might not allow a clinical trial of a drug to slow aging even if permitted , a trial to determine whether a drug prolongs life might outlive some of the scientists conducting it you would have to start treating people in their 50 s and possibly follow them up to the next 50 years , said bernard malfroy , chief executive of eukarion , a company in bedford , mass , that is developing some antiaging compounds your patent would expire so most companies plan to show that their drugs can prevent or treat a disease associated with aging , like cancer or alzheimer s extending healthy life is the reason elixir exists , said ed cannon , chief executive of elixir in cambridge , mass , the best financed of the new companies but along the way there is a toll stop , and we have to pay our toll by showing we can intervene in conventional disease indications to the extent that they follow this strategy , though , the companies become nearly indistinguishable from many other companies developing drugs for cancer , heart disease or the memory loss that precedes alzheimer s the difference , the companies say , is that they are coming at these diseases by understanding aging , rather than the more specific mechanisms of each disease some companies specifically disavow any interest in extending life span we really do n't want to go after antiaging drugs , said iraj beheshti , chief executive of chronogen in montreal we want to use aging discoveries to reach diseases of aging
jack goguen sits in his sunny los angeles backyard in blue jeans and talks with a palpable sense of detachment about his previous life as a sales and marketing executive his new work , as a oneman company called j r home remodeling , leaves him little time to dwell on the frustrations that confounded him when he was laid off from his job in the airline catering business a month after the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks sent his industry spiraling letting go was hard , but starting over has been a dream meanwhile , in new york , mary arda , a former bond trader and media executive , has not bought herself even a new pair of socks in a year she puts everything she has financially and emotionally into mary s off jane bakery , the shop she opened last june on eighth avenue near jane street it has been much harder than ms arda expected , but she gets goose bumps when she talks about what it means to have her own business among her neighbors in greenwich village and in silicon valley , maeling tien was laid off from her job as a programs manager for a dotcom three years ago she moved into a new house , became pregnant with her first child and planned to stay at home at first mrs tien , 33 , was consumed by the demands of parenthood but then something happened drawing on her experiences as a parent , she saw an opportunity and pounced about six months ago , on her son kyle s first birthday , mrs tien opened keiki place , a play center for toddlers and their parents in cupertino , calif like so many people who have lost their jobs in the current economic downturn , mr goguen , ms arda and mrs tien had to rethink their lives before starting anew they have had mixed results , but each one said that the entrepreneurial experience creating and operating their own small business has been an opportunity to learn laid off suddenly after 30 years in the business , mr goguen , now 62 , was certain he could be an asset to one of the companies in his industry , despite the downturn that i could n't convince someone else of that was very disappointing , he said mr goguen , whose wife is nine years younger than he is , was not ready to retire he gave himself six months to look for a job in his field or start something new the right job never came through he asked himself , what am i capable of doing well \? his father was a builder , and mr goguen had always enjoyed the remodeling projects he did for himself but despite the fact that he holds an mba , he did not trust himself to make an objective assessment of his financial situation he consulted a financial planner before declaring himself open for business mr goguen spent about 20 , 000 on construction equipment and a sports utility vehicle for hauling it around he contacted realtors and mortgage brokers in the community to spread the word about his work , and the floodgates opened next thing he knew , mr goguen was bartering part of a kitchen renovation in exchange for legal services that would incorporate his new company his friends were flabbergasted that mr goguen would trade in his business suits and dress shoes for a life of physical labor , but he said he felt liberated for him , the most important thing was understanding and dealing with his new reality the wellmeaning people who continued to tell him how great he had been as a sales executive were not helping as quickly as you can , you must cease to dwell on the past regardless of how good you were or how much you enjoyed your work and accomplishments , he said mr goguen said he had lost inches off his middle , spent more time outdoors and delighted in the people he has met on his jobs and his business is doing better than he could have imagined after one year , he is earning almost as much as he did as an executive although he hates the paperwork , he said it was deeply satisfying to know that his job was done according to his own standards companies say they want 100 percent customer satisfaction , but they do n't mean it , mr goguen said profit motive always comes into play a sole practitioner must perform every day in order to survive and grow for ms arda , a wall street veteran , starting a bakery has been an endurance test it s a lot more difficult than i thought , she said i have a business that s open 17 to 20 hours a day , 7 days a week coming from the corporate world , i thought , businesswise , this is going to be a piece of cake but this is a whole different world after she switched jobs , ms arda worked for about a year as the director of sales and business development for the web sites of univision communications , the spanishlanguage media giant she realized in mid2001 that she would soon be laid off instead of asking , oh , my god , what am i going to do \? she started thinking , maybe this is my time divorced and in her early 40 s , ms arda had dreamed of opening a bakery that reflected her cuban upbringing she had tried the food business before as a caterer and food stylist and , briefly , as a restaurant owner in miami none of the jobs worked out well starting over again had been in the back of my mind forever and ever , but i was really afraid of taking the risk , she said
frank p quattrone told jurors yesterday during his last day of testimony that if credit suisse first boston s lawyers had told us that the document retention policy was suspended he never would have sent an email message to his staff endorsing a colleague s instructions to clean up those files mr quattrone , wiping his brow , looked directly at the jury and said , none of this would have happened on the 10th day of mr quattrone s trial on charges that his email message was an effort to obstruct a government investigation into first boston s handling of initial stock offerings , mr quattrone reasserted that he did not think that he , nor the investment bankers who received his email message , had anything to do with the inquiry but the prosecution , which made its closing arguments after the defense rested its case , contended otherwise he chose to encourage his employees to clean out their files even though he knew that there was a grand jury subpoena seeking some of those files , said david anders , assistant united states attorney , looking up from a thick binder of notes , and that choice was criminal mr quattrone s lawyer , john w keker , responded during his closing argument , which will continue today , that what you just heard is mostly conjecture , speculation , false logic he told the jury , as the judge , richard owen , appeared to nod off , that the evidence that the prosecution presented is not the quality of proof that is required in a criminal case during his testimony yesterday , mr quattrone , who appeared a bit more tense and tired than he was last week , said he did not know that the scope of the investigation included his investment banking group because he had been told by david m brodsky , the first boston general counsel then , only that the investigation focused on whether hedge fund investors were running up big commissions on unrelated trades , paying csfb big commissions on unrelated brokerage transactions in an effort to obtain initial public offering allocations mr quattrone has contended that he and the investment bankers in his technology group were not involved in deciding which clients received shares in hot stock offerings but late last week , he appeared to retreat on his testimony , acknowledging that he and other bankers played some role in the process yesterday , mr keker tried to rectify the conflicting testimony did you make any ipo allocation decision regarding any ipo \? mr keker asked no , mr quattrone replied he later elaborated on his involvement in the process i would forward the request along to the appropriate people , equity capital markets , mostly , and just put in a good word for the client , he said , referring to requests he would receive for allocations of stock offerings on crossexamination , mr quattrone at times continued to appear evasive , frequently answering questions by saying , i ca n't recall when steven r peikin , an assistant united states attorney , asked whether he knew what a grand jury was when he received a correspondence about subpoenas that had been served just days before he sent the email message in question , he replied i believe that i did not know what a grand jury was at the time after the defense rested , mr quattrone s defense team made its second request of the trial to dismiss the charges against him judge owen of federal district court denied the motion , saying that adequate evidence had been submitted to warrant continuing with the trial those emails that were put in friday put a lot of the allocation process into the investment banking division , he said while the jury was outside the courtroom later , mr anders , the assistant united states attorney , began his closing argument frank quattrone knew the rules , mr anders said he knew without being told that when there s a subpoena , you ca n't destroy documents mr anders then repeated testimony about how mr quattrone had become a successful investment banker and described how his income increased from 9 million in 1998 to more than 120 million in 2000 we did not offer that evidence just to throw these big numbers at you , he said the evidence of his compensation provides you with quattrone s motive he later said that mr quattrone s jittery crossexamination should make jurors question his credibility he was clearly prepared for his direct examination but was that the real frank quattrone \? he asked why do n't you compare this rehearsed frank quattrone with how he acted on crossexamination \? mr anders then accused mr quattrone of lying does he have a motive to lie \? ask yourself who is he \? he s the defendant and more than anyone else , he has a strong motive to lie he ended his closing statement by telling the jury please do n't be misled although this is a serious case and an important case , it s not a close case frank quattrone was caught redhanded mr keker , mr quattrone s lawyer , responded in his closing argument you ca n't say that you 're proving a case beyond a reasonable doubt and have part of your argument , as mr anders had to , depend on mr quattrone being the smartest , brightest guy that ever walked on the face of the earth , and then turn around and say , 'well , actually , when he sent this email he was the stupidest person that ever stepped on the face of the earth , because if he had done nothing , he would have accomplished his criminal objective' by allowing his colleague s email message on documents to go out without comment after repeating how mr quattrone had dashed off scores of other email messages to friends and colleagues during the same hour he sent the message in question , mr keker said ask yourself if that s how an otherwise blameless , crimefree pillar of the community commits a crime ask yourself , in a case that requires very deliberate , nasty criminal intent , he continued , is that where a man goes off the rails under circumstances like that and decides that he is going to commit a crime \?

the gaping holes in the tanbrick facade of the verizon building are still open to the ground zero void the blasted steelwork is jacked up like a rube goldberg contraption only four tortured pieces of the 72foot ornamental entranceway bronze work now exist such are the wounds inflicted by the crushing debris from not one , but three , neighboring buildings the north and south towers of the world trade center , and 7 world trade center , which pancaked next door but the verizon building is very much alive enduring a daily chaos of cement mixers and the sparks from welders' arcs , the building at 140 west street is again sending out dial tones to 34 , 000 customers it is putting stockbrokers online it is generating revenue it is doing so without the 1 , 700 office workers who have been relocated to other buildings aside from communications equipment , the verizon building is populated only by a temporary staff of construction engineers and the 250 hard hats who are toiling there to bring it all back this seatofthepants reconstruction of the landmark 32story building could use a metaphor , and dominic p veltri , verizon s new york manager for design and construction , is ready to supply one what we 're doing here is engineering on the fly , he said we 're changing a flat tire on a bus going down the highway at 60 miles an hour some bus for four decades , the landmark 1926 art deco building at the corner of vesey street was the headquarters of the new york telephone company it is currently the most visible symbol of reconstruction efforts at ground zero for thousands of tourists gawking at the building , the grievous damage , and the army of construction workers swarming to mend it , are a sobering reminder not only of the horrors of the terrorist attack but also of the heroic efforts to clear the rubble and bring back lower manhattan beyond this , the construction effort is a boost for a company that was besieged by servicerestoration complaints after the terrorist attack , and has subsequently battled the communications workers of america in an eyeblackening advertising war over job security that culminated when verizon , citing cellular and cable competition and federal regulatory strictures , laid off more than 2 , 700 workers in new york and new jersey last month , generating a christmas blizzard of news media reports about the plight of the newly unemployed to date , the reconstruction effort has not been affected by the fight with the union , although if picket lines materialize during contract negotiations next august , some construction workers may not cross the repopulation of 140 west street with some office workers is now scheduled to begin at the end of 2003 , but the rebuilding could continue for years so far , 70 million has been spent to stabilize the building , and the restoration is expected to cost at least 140 million more , only part of the 14 billion that verizon is spending downtown to restore equipment and cables since the day the building opened in 1926 , it has been a beehive of both administrative and technical activity , and its design was considerably more than functional it was intended to establish a presence , given the building s role as administrative headquarters and central office nevertheless , according to george famulare , verizon s manager of corporate real estate , the building is a tank built with reinforced concrete and steel , its floors can hold 250 to 300 pounds per square foot , constructed to support the giant electromechanical switching assemblies that were replaced long ago by electronic alternatives if that sturdiness accounted for its survival , the subsequent efforts to protect and restore 140 west street have been nothing short of homeric verizon lost two of its technicians , who were working above the crash zones , in the world trade center attack none died in the verizon building mr famulare supervised the evacuation after seeing people jumping from the towers he found himself trapped under his desk after the ceiling fell during the collapse of the south tower eventually he escaped through the cloud of ash and dust looking like a white powdered doughnut , he recalls then he stayed to shut down crucial equipment during the collapses , steel projectiles from the towers hit the verizon building , sliced the mains and left water cascading into the building s five subbasements , filling the lowermost vaults like a swimming pool a javelin of steel actually speared through the sidewalk concrete and lodged in the basement the building s fuel oil tanks were submerged in water , then burst up in the topmost subbasement , a pool of shindeep water made unusable the miles of snaking phone cables \( black for copper , orange for fiber optics \) in the 250footlong , 60footwide cable vault at 10 21 pm , the building s backup batteries ran out of power and the last call went through the switching equipment below , subbasement b held much of the telephone company s historical records , memorabilia and antique equipment , which was damaged by the flood it took two months to pump out 12 million gallons of water mixed with 40 , 000 gallons of petroleum
boldly declaring what his authority means , city council speaker gifford miller stripped three democratic councilmen of their roles on council committees yesterday , in apparent retribution for voting against an 185 percent property tax increase earlier this year tony avella and allan w jennings of queens and james e davis of brooklyn , each of whom had voted against the tax increase , were removed from one committee post each , setting off a lively debate during yesterday s meeting about the nature of democracy , revenge and the role of god in government stripping council members of their positions is a tactic often used by council speakers to punish lawmakers who do not fall into line on critical votes as punishments go , yesterday s was of the light mayonnaise variety none too heavy , but definitely noticeable none of the men were stripped of committee chairmanships , and only mr jennings lost a seat on the finance committee , a prominent post mr davis was upset at losing his seat on the cultural affairs committee , because most of the big brooklyn cultural institutions are in his district mr jennings did not take it well arms stretched in a crucifix pose , he said , two thousand years ago , there was a man from galilee who did not agree with caesar , and he too was sacrificed and punished after further biblical musings , mr jennings looked at mr miller and said , i love you my brother , and i forgive you mr davis asked angrily , is this a political mafia or is this a democracy \? mr avella , who was stripped of his role on a minor committee , voted in favor of the changes just just four members mr jennings , mr davis , charles barron of brooklyn and g oliver koppell of the bronx opposed the measure on committee membership changes mr miller made clear that he would not tolerate dissent on important votes in the end , this is about recognizing that if we are to empower ourselves , mr miller said , we must empower each other

given that the artistic muse of the clinton administration was linda bloodworththomason , the creator of the sitcom designing women , george w bush s appointment of bo derek to the board of the kennedy center for the performing arts could hardly be faulted for breaking with tradition ever since abraham lincoln overruled his advisers to attend our american cousin , culture has been considered ladies' work in washington first ladies' work it was jacqueline kennedy who brought pablo casals to the east room , not her husband , who celebrated his inaugural with a command performance by the rat pack it is laura bush who invites writers to the white house , not the president , whose inaugural concert featured andrew lloyd webber , ricky martin and wayne newton \( where was barry manilow when the country needed him \?

i 've been waiting for one of the trailing democratic presidential candidates to give the following speech since none have , i'm offering it to them , free of charge my fellow democrats , it s good to be back in new hampshire today but i 'd like to throw away my stump speech and talk honestly about the state of this campaign i am losing howard dean is crushing me he has money he has a movement and he s had one other big advantage no opposition from the moment his campaign took off , the rest of us contenders tried to mimic his success we ratcheted up our attacks on the bush administration we became more combative we attacked the war in iraq in short , we 've tried to be better howard deans than howard dean the results have been pathetic oh sure , we sniped at him at times we pointed out his flipflops and his gaffes but dean s core strength is that he is tough enough to stand up to the republicans his supporters do n't care if he s flipflopped on issues or if he makes a gaffe or two they just want to know he can take on karl rove howard dean is liberal aggression , and none of us have ever taken that on until today but now i am relaunching my campaign around one simple slogan stop the war i do n't mean the war in iraq i mean the war at home i mean the partisan war between republicans and democrats that rages every day in washington and produces behavior that would be unacceptable in any other arena of life i mean the war that poisons our airwaves , clogs up our bestseller lists and stagnates our politics i 've lived at the front it s in washington , dc this is world war i each party has its trench works each party has its heavy artillery anybody who dares wander from the predictable party lines and do something unorthodox gets his head blown off nothing ever changes if dean is our nominee , he may fight the beltway wars more aggressively than other democrats , but we will still be a nation at war i have seen dean up close the man hates his opponents his kind thrives only during times of domestic war if we nominate dean , it will be bad for our party and bad for our country it will be bad for our party because 40 percent of the voters in this nation call themselves moderates if we nominate dean , george bush will have a good shot at winning a large chunk of those votes that s disgraceful after the partisan way george bush has led this country but it will be our fault because we nominated someone just as partisan on the other side but suppose dean does win the white house he 'll propose some good legislation i 'll support it , but it will never get passed because each party will still be down in its trenches , and nothing will move except the bouncing of the rubble and the writhing of the wounded we 've all seen the dean style if he is elected , we will be a nation at war every second of his term i do n't even want to think about what our country would be like after four years of that remember when george bush used to say he was going to change the tone in washington \? he lied about that he could n't even reach out to jim jeffords , a moderate in his own party he was never going to reach out to democrats he is too intellectually insecure he ca n't handle people who disagree with him , so he retreats into the cocoon of the likeminded i'm opting out of the game of tit for tat i'm going to get us out of the trenches if i do nothing else in the oval office , i will free people to build new coalitions , explore new ideas and talk to one another for the first time in a decade this is an evenly divided country that is the political fact of our time it is about time we had a president who understands that , who has a strategy for governing in such circumstances howard dean and george bush do not they just want to pound away and pound away and ram things through more artillery , more troops , more screaming and more hatred as for me , i say no more war i'm for movement i'm for progress , and if you are , too , come along with me
houston with its no 1 market presence , wide variety of products , unsentimental business tactics and folksy founder , the sysco corporation could easily be mistaken for the walmart of the foodservice distribution business and with its chief competitor , us foodservice , dealing with an accounting scandal , sysco has attractive prospects despite a weakening economy the chief threat to sysco is the possibility that walmart itself , through its mclane foodservice unit , will seek a larger slice of the market sysco is one of the great uninterrupted growth stories in american business , said robert s goldin , an executive vice president at technomic inc , a consulting and research firm in chicago that has worked for most big companies in the food industry , including sysco sales at sysco have climbed from 115 million in 1969 when john f baugh created the company by merging his business , zero foods , with eight regional food service distributors to 153 billion in 1998 , when he retired in 2002 , revenue was 233 billion , up 71 percent from the previous year , while profits climbed 138 percent , to 6798 million last year , sysco posted an impressive 30 percent return on equity and more than a 20 percent return on invested capital earnings per share have increased an average of nearly 19 percent over the last five years , and dividend growth has been at least 10 percent during the same period investors have treated sysco as a growth stock since the market peaked three years ago , sysco shares have risen more than 45 percent , while the standard poor s 500stock index has fallen 41 percent in addition , sysco has never taken a writedown its performance is in stark contrast to that of its nearest rival , us foodservice , a division of the dutch conglomerate royal ahold in february , problems at us foodservice led ahold to reveal that it had overstated earnings by at least 500 million mitchell j speiser , a senior equity analyst at lehman brothers , said the scandal had already prompted some us foodservice customers to shift to sysco even with these new customers , sysco , the market leader , has only 13 percent of the 173 billion american food service market , mr speiser said there s a lot of room for growth , he said , especially because most types of operators that buy from sysco restaurants , hospitals , schools and corporate cafeterias do not use just one distributor but some chefs said they were put off by the thought of a deeper relationship with sysco i'm against putting all my eggs in one basket , especially if that basket belongs to sysco , said monica pope , chef and owner of boulevard bistrot , a restaurant in houston whether or not they own an establishment , chefs are usually the ones who deal with distributors ms pope said some sysco representatives came to her restaurant during lunch unannounced three years ago and handed her a certified letter demanding immediate payment of a bill that was 120 days overdue i was sitting at a table with my father and everyone was watching , she said you do n't have to do that other chefs and restaurateurs have complained that sysco pressures them to continually increase their orders , threatening to drop them if they do n't jim sullivan , a restaurant consultant in appleton , wis , said that even after taking into account that chefs are a freudian smorgasbord of personalities , there is a widely held belief that sysco is this 500pound gorilla that bullies operators richard j schnieders , sysco s chief executive , said the company runs a profitability analysis on each of its 400 , 000 customers if they do not make the cut , we either ask for a bigger order , reduce service by sending trucks out less often or help find them another distributor , he said there are an estimated 2 , 850 broadline or soup to soap distributors and 25 , 000 specialty distributors in the united states , though none approaches the size and reach of sysco chefs also complain that sysco offers rockbottom pricing on crucial center of the plate foods like chicken or steak , only to make it up by charging high prices on other products like broom handles and cocktail napkins sysco sells more than 300 , 000 products , from haricots verts to hairnets independent restaurant operators , known as street accounts , are most vulnerable to such tactics they make up 80 percent of the market and offer the highest margins to distributors because chains and larger institutions like schools and hospitals have people to study the books and negotiate volume deals , said timothy banning , a chef in ventura , calif mr banning runs a web site and message board for professional chefs called madchefscom mr schnieders said that sysco s pricing was negotiated by sales associates and operators , taking into consideration the quantities used by a restaurant we have to make it work for the customer and for us the operator is in it to make money , and so are we , he said we are not the cheapest out there , but we think we deliver the greatest value
sacramento , april 25 what if \? that is the question on many minds here as statewide opinion polls show gov gray davis s popularity at an alltime low , and as a fledgling effort to recall him from office enters a pivotal stage mr davis was reelected just five months ago , but many voters seem to have little loyalty to him though a recent poll showed that most people would not go so far as to sign the petitions now circulating to put his recall on the ballot , nearly half said they would vote to remove him in a recall election that has raised all sorts of speculation about mr davis s future , and forced democrats to strategize about how they would keep a republican out of the statehouse in the event considered improbable but not impossible of a recall election once it gets on the ballot , it is a purely ingenious piece of mischief , said bruce cain , a professor of political science at the university of california at berkeley and it could happen anywhere if it were to succeed here , i think it would be widely copied it is one of those innovations that the rest of the country could come to regret much of the conjecture about mr davis stems from the fact that under state law , the names of his potential successors would also appear on a recall ballot if voters chose to oust him , they would select the new governor at the same time from a field that could be wide open , since state law allows anyone from a recognized political party who pays a filing fee and collects 65 signatures to place his or her name on a recall ballot mr davis is one of many governors across the country who are watching their popularity decline in large part , pollsters say , because voters blame them for the sour economy and large service cuts a recent poll by the field research corporation found that mr davis s 24 percent approval rating the lowest for any california governor in the 55 years field has been conducting these surveys was directly linked to the state s economic woes , which include a 35 billion budget deficit over two years other governors with falling poll numbers include gary locke of washington , james e mcgreevey of new jersey and george e pataki of new york in good times , governors get more credit than they deserve in bad times , the reverse is true , mr davis said in an interview this week it is not fun the numbers decline , but it is part of the process during difficult economic times the recall effort is led by a small group of antitax crusaders and conservative republicans , including a former adviser to bill simon , mr davis s republican opponent last november but its appeal is potentially broader peter camejo , the green party nominee for governor in november , said he or some other representative of a broad progressive coalition would probably enter the fray , if only to keep a rightwing republican from getting the job the california green party is to decide next month whether it will officially support the recall effort i do n't think governor davis is missing what is happening here , mr camejo said once the recall is on the ballot , he will see how fast his support in the democratic party disappears though the green party is small , its support of governor davis s recall would carry symbolic significance by broadening his opposition to include the left patrick h caddell , a pollster for president jimmy carter and a selfdescribed liberal populist , said he was also weighing whether to support the recall , which he said had both democrats and republicans running scared it is not only gray davis opposing it , but the republican political establishment is against it , because they understand the danger it represents , mr caddell said if gray davis can go , anybody can go officially , no democrat has come forward as a possible replacement candidate , in part because the recall drive has yet to gain the kind of momentum that would pose a serious challenge to the governor in california s 31 previous gubernatorial recall attempts since 1936 , including one against mr davis four years ago by antiimmigration groups , none qualified for a vote as of this week , proponents had gathered about 60 , 000 of the nearly 900 , 000 signatures needed by september to get the measure on the ballot , said ted costa , an antitax advocate who is one of the recall effort s leaders mr costa said his campaign had managed to raise just 200 , 000 toward the estimated 1 million to 2 million needed to hire professional signature gatherers and conduct a statewide directmail campaign so far , the recall effort has been largely centered on drumming up support on the internet and conservative talk radio shows , efforts mr costa said were not enough but the movement got a boost this week when representative darrell issa , a republican from southern california , expressed his support for removing mr davis and offered himself as a replacement candidate mr issa , who ran unsuccessfully for the senate in 1998 , said in an interview that he would not bankroll the recall forces , but would devote time and energy to getting others to support them mr costa described mr issa s involvement as a potential breakthrough
s o paulo , brazil , april 10 nobody invests 4 billion to change their mind later , read the advertisements in leading brazilian newspapers the ads are meant to deliver a clear message from the aes corporation to its customers , the markets and the government we 're absolutely here to stay , said steven clancy , president of eletropaulo , latin america s biggest power distributor and aes s main brazilian unit that there should be any doubt about aes s commitment to brazil may seem strange the 4 billion that aes , based in arlington , va , has sunk into brazil since 1996 makes it the largest private investor in the country s electric power industry and aes gets a quarter of its worldwide revenue from brazil , more than it gets from north america but since january , when aes defaulted on part of the 12 billion it borrowed in 1998 from brazil s national development bank to buy eletropaulo , there has been mounting speculation that the company is preparing to leave the country aes says that is not so hence the ad campaign but if the company were to depart , analysts say , it could lead to an exodus by other foreign utilities , especially now that the new leftleaning government appears to be favoring the public sector over private investors in the industry mr clancy said that for the moment he was concentrating on renegotiating aes s brazilian debt with commercial banks , holders of the company s debentures , and bndes , the state development bank he must also strive to cut costs and improve a sagging cash flow , while keeping customers happy and persuading shareholders around the globe that the brazilian operation is worth keeping none of these tasks will be easy aes lost 277 billion in the fourth quarter of 2002 , mainly because of failed investments overseas , and it has sold off units scattered from california to the middle east to raise cash and reduce the likelihood of any more defaults in brazil talks with bndes over the company s obligations were already difficult last year since the workers' party government was sworn in jan 1 , they have all but stalled completely the new administration named leftleaning executives with a nationalist penchant to run bndes , and the bank has hardened its negotiating line , saying aes must repay all its creditors or hand eletropaulo back to the state the only deal we 'll do with aes is one in which they pay their debt , darc costa , the bank s no 2 executive , said in a recent interview either they pay cash or they pay in assets but they have to pay on a recent trip to bras lia , the united states assistant secretary of commerce , william lash , fired back , saying that aes could not pay because it was itself owed more than 300 million by local governments but analysts said that hard words and brinkmanship on both sides could damage the negotiating atmosphere beyond repair i have a feeling it could be tough for aes to keep hold of eletropaulo , said armando franco , energy analyst at tend ncias , a consulting firm based in s o paulo these negotiations are not going on in heaven there are no angels on either side according to one eletropaulo executive , mr clancy is adopting a more diplomatic approach in brazil than aes representatives have in the past mr clancy arrived in s o paulo last september and formally took over as president in february previously , there was sometimes a 'me tarzan , you cheetah' approach , said the executive , who spoke on condition of anonymity but up a tree in brazil , very often cheetah turns out to be more agile than tarzan mr clancy , striking a conciliatory tone , seemed confident that he could reach a deal with bndes whenever you 're in negotiations with someone with whom you have a 1 billion debt and you 're not paying , it s bound to be strained , he said there s no easy solution for either side but i'm optimistic we could have something by the end of may mr clancy laid the blame for aes s default two missed payments totaling more than 400 million on a perfect storm of negative factors that have plunged nearly all of brazil s privatized utilities into crises , and have transformed aes into a poster child for the energy sector s woes there is no doubt that the whole sector is hurting electricit de france had to inject 1 billion of fresh capital last year into light , the debtridden power distributor in rio de janeiro the ppl corporation wrote off its entire 317 million investment in a controlling stake in cemar , a brazilian utility that filed for bankruptcy protection early this year enersis , the latin american investment arm of spain s endesa , recently refinanced 23 billion of its debt because of the economic crises in brazil and argentina nobody is in great shape , said claudio sales , head of the brazilian chamber of investors in electricity mr sales said that all of brazil s privatized utilities were suffering from three main problems first , years of drought and a lack of investment culminated in a nationwide energy crisis in 2001 facing blackouts and rationing , brazilians slashed consumption by 20 percent or more , and demand has not rebounded
washington where are iraq s weapons of mass destruction \? it s a good question , and unfortunately we do n't yet have a good answer there is hope that the capture of abid hamid mahmoud altikriti , saddam hussein s closest aide , will provide the first solid clues in any event , the mystery will be solved in good time the search for iraq s nonconvential weapons program has only just begun in the meantime , accusations are mounting that the bush administration made up the whole iraqi weapons threat to justify an invasion that is just not the case america and its allies had plenty of evidence before the war , and before president bush took office , indicating that iraq was retaining its illegal weapons programs as for allegations that some in the administration may have used slanted intelligence claims in making their case against saddam hussein , they seem to have merit and demand further investigation but if the truth was stretched , it seems to have been done primarily to justify the timing of an invasion , not the merits of one the fact that the sites we suspected of containing hidden weapons before the war turned out to have nothing in them is not very significant american intelligence agencies never claimed to know exactly where or how the iraqis were hiding what they had not in 1995 , not in 1999 and not six months ago it is very possible that the missing facilities , weaponized agents , precursor materials and even stored munitions all could still be hidden in places we never would have thought to look this is exactly why , before the war , so few former weapons inspectors had confidence that a new round of united nations inspections would find the items they were convinced iraq was hiding at the heart of the mystery lies the fact that the iraqis do not seem to have deployed any stocks of munitions filled with nonconventional weapons why did saddam hussein not hit coalition troops with a barrage of chemical and biological weapons rather than allow his regime to fall \? why did we not find them in ammunition dumps , ready to be fired \? actually , there are many possible explanations saddam hussein may have underestimated the likelihood of war and not filled any chemical weapons before the invasion he may have been killed or gravely wounded in the decapitation strike on the eve of the invasion and unable to give the orders or he may have just been surprised by the extremely rapid pace of the coalition s ground advance and the sudden collapse of the republican guard divisions surrounding baghdad it is also possible that iraq did not have the capacity to make the weapons , but given the prewar evidence , this is still the least likely explanation the one potentially important discovery made so far by american troops two tractortrailers found in april and may that fit the descriptions of mobile germwarfare labs given by iraqi defectors over the years might well point to a likely explanation for at least part of the mystery iraq may have decided to keep only a chemical and biological warfare production capability rather than large stockpiles of the munitions themselves this would square with the fact that several dozen chemical warfare factories were rebuilt after the first gulf war to produce civilian pharmaceuticals , but were widely believed to be dualuse plants capable of quickly being converted back to chemical warfare production in truth , this was always the most likely scenario chemical and biological warfare munitions , especially the crude varieties that iraq developed during the iraniraq war , are dangerous to store and handle and they deteriorate quickly but they can be manufactured and put in warheads relatively rapidly meaning that there is little reason to have thousands of filled rounds sitting around where they might be found by international inspectors it would have been logical for iraq to retain only some means of production , which could be hidden with relative ease and then used to churn out the munitions whenever saddam hussein gave the word still , no matter what the trailers turn out to be , the failure so far to find weapons of mass destruction in no way invalidates the prewar intelligence data indicating that iraq had the clandestine capacity to build them there has long been an extremely strong case based on evidence that largely predates the bush administration that iraq maintained programs in weapons of mass destruction it was this evidence , along with reports showing the clear failure of united nations efforts to impede iraq s progress , that led the clinton administration to declare a policy of regime change for iraq in 1998 in 1995 , for example , united nations inspectors found russianmade ballisticmissile gyroscopes at the bottom of the tigris river jordanian officials intercepted others being smuggled into iraq that same year in july 1998 , international inspectors discovered an iraqi document that showed baghdad had lied about the number of chemical bombs it had dropped during the iraniraq war , leaving some 6 , 000 such weapons unaccounted for iraq simply refused to concede that the document even existed
key west , fla feb 26 not long after school lets out , the cool and elegant home of wayne larue smith and daniel skahen , on a shady street near the historic district here , is transformed by the boisterous whoops of two boys they exclaim at a bee on the porch , at the lime tree in the backyard , at the consequences of mixing dirt with water they jump in the pool and welcome a visitor s applause at each twisting fall and cannonball one is 5 , the other 6 one white , the other of mixed race they are bursting out of their skins with questions and energy mr smith , a 47yearold lawyer , and mr skahen , a 36yearold real estate broker , would like to adopt the boys , who have lived with them as foster children for about two years each but they are a gay couple and florida is the only state that forbids any adoption by a homosexual on tuesday , a federal appeals court in atlanta will hear their challenge to the law gay people are the only group categorically restricted from adopting children in florida even people who have abused drugs and alcohol or people who have a history of domestic violence may adopt under some circumstances state courts have upheld the law , with a state appeals court ruling in 1993 that the ban could be justified because homosexual parents are unlikely to be able to give heterosexual children sound dating advice but this is the first time a federal court has considered the ban the supreme court has said that states are required only to offer plausible rationales for laws that single out homosexuals florida officials have offered two judge james lawrence king of federal district court in miami rejected the first , that the law was a legitimate expression of public morality as it bears on the questions of what environments are best for children , and what groups of people are entitled to recognition as families the court , he wrote , cannot accept that moral disapproval of homosexuals or homosexuality serves a legitimate state interest but he accepted the second reason , that children are better off with married heterosexual couples children , the state s lawyers wrote , should be raised in homes with married mothers and fathers due to the stability provided by marriage and the contribution of male and female influences to childhood growth and development , including heterosexual modeling judge king accepted that and upheld the law he noted that the federal constitution is not a license for the courts to judge the wisdom , fairness or logic of legislative choices lynn dennis wardle , a law professor at brigham young university , said there was substantial justification for the law as a policy choice the gay couple involved in the florida case is on face value very appealing , mr wardle said i would still say that a mom and a dad would be better than those two men mr smith and mr skahen , who agreed to discuss their case on the condition that the boys not be named , say this ignores reality , as there is a shortage of interested married couples in florida , which has 3 , 500 children in foster care awaiting adoption if history is a guide , a quarter of them will be placed with single heterosexuals matthew coles , a lawyer with the american civil liberties union foundation , which represents the plaintiffs , said he would urge the appeals court to consider the plight of florida s children nobody was breaking down the doors to come in and take care of these kids , he said , referring to the two boys in key west these people have given these kids a childhood they never would have had if the state of florida had an ounce of decency , they would be trying to find more parents like them while the state has vigorously defended the adoption law , it also recently consented to a novel arrangement for the younger boy fashioned by a state judge here in december , the judge , sandra taylor , made mr smith and mr skahen the younger boy s permanent legal guardians she wrote that the men were model parents , that the boy is bonded and attached to them and is in a stable and nurturing environment he has progressed remarkably in school and is completely healthy , judge taylor wrote the boy , who is bighearted and talkative , learned something new at school not long ago , and he was eager to share it the other day standing with his right hand on his heart , he recited the pledge of allegiance , with grave seriousness then , for good measure , he sang the entirety of god bless america becoming his legal guardian , mr smith said , is a mysterious half loaf we have all of the responsibilities but none of the rights , he said he wondered , too , why the state would trust the couple with permanent legal custody of the boy but draw the line just short of adoption mr smith and mr skahen , who have been together for 11 years , have not told the boys that they have become the younger one s guardians , in part because the boys are too young to understand and in part because a quirk to the law appears to forbid a similar solution in the older boy s case and there is reason to think that he may be placed elsewhere any day now mr skahen said that when he booked a disney cruise for their family for june , he paid for trip insurance , just in case mr smith said their best hope for keeping their family intact was that the older boy was , like many of the children in foster care in florida , not quite what prospective parents were looking for nobody wants to adopt a 6yearold with developmental problems who is biracial , he said , bitterness tinged with hope he

by the time they were 13 , young athletes by the hundreds , having shown a special talent in their best sport , were dispatched to a sportspecific academy in the distant mountains there , living away from their parents , they followed an intense regimen , drilled in their schoolwork but training at least six days a week , sometimes twice a day they spent their formative high school years this way , lavished with the best coaching and facilities the nation could offer while traveling to international junior competitions and exotic summer training camps by the time they were 18 , the best of them , the top 1 percent , were assigned to the national team years later , they won olympic glory east germany , right \? not even close but it does describe the adolescent years of nearly every toplevel athlete on the current united states ski and snowboarding teams a group that has suddenly found itself among the best in the world in sports formerly dominated by europeans what , you thought bode miller rolled out of bed three years ago and decided he wanted to be a world champion \? from the time he was 14 , miller was rolling out of bed at 6 am at the remote carrabassett valley academy in maine to begin a 15hour day filled not only with a prepschoolquality education but also with five hours a day of training on the slopes of nearby sugarloaf mountain cva , as it is known in the ski community , is among the most renowned of two dozen yearround boarding schools for premier skiing , snowboarding and freestyle athletes the academy produced miller and kirsten clark , a 2002 olympian and an alpine silver medalist in this year s world championships virtually all of the american medal winners in snowsport disciplines at the 2002 olympics and this year s world championships are ski academy graduates from erik schlopy , a bronze medalist in last month s world championships , who attended northern vermont s burke mountain academy the first american ski academy , established in 1970 to the downhill and superg star daron rahlves , who went to central vermont s green mountain valley school , to the olympic snowboarding gold medalist ross powers , who graduated from the stratton mountain school , winter olympics glory is found in sportspecific academies in the west , there are far fewer full school year academies , but plenty of olympiclevel success stories the lowell whiteman school in steamboat springs , colo , produced travis mayer , the olympic silver medalist in moguls , and johnny spillane , who recently became the first american to win a world cup gold medal in a nordic event while it is unfair to compare the american ski academy experience to the east germansponsored sports academies , where athletes were enrolled , sometimes against their will , and supplied with steroids , it may surprise many americans how specialized the junior competitive aspects of skiing and snowboarding have been for decades the best athletes in these sports attend from a tender age what could be called skiing or snowboarding conservatories wellappointed , technologically advanced institutions with stateoftheart athletic facilities set in bucolic mountain surroundings while the perception might be that they are sent there by pushy parents living out olympic dreams through their children , usually it is the other way around the children want to pursue their own dreams and end up coaxing their parents to agree at the same time , it is clear that many parents quickly see the benefits in an education rivaling that of most top prep schools with small classes and high college placement ratios in an environment that also provides top coaching in a chosen sport many of these parents pay upward of 25 , 000 annually in tuition and board for their children to attend the academies a significant number of students qualify for partial , or even full , scholarships these are highly motivated and disciplined students who are used to succeeding at everything , including their academics , said seth marx , dean of students at the stratton mountain school , which has graduated 24 olympians they are chasing a very lofty goal and there is a specific path , a level of coaching and competition you have to tap into and even at 13 years old , if you 're going to be in the olympics , you need to be in that lane realistic expectations it is understood , even preached by the academies , that few will make the national ski or snowboard team , let alone qualify for the olympic games but for the many teenagers whose best sport is skiing , snowboarding or nordic skiing and not , say , baseball or basketball this is their best way to see just how good they can become the misconception about ski academies , or maybe what people do n't put enough stock in , is the value of the pursuit of a kid s dream , said bill mccollum , the editor of ski racing magazine , who was the headmaster of the killington mountain school for 13 years of course it s a rarity to make the national team , but that does n't make the process any less meaningful for all the others who do n't make it it is rewarding in its own right
leslie a perlow was going , well , nuts she was writing a book , the publisher s deadlines were looming , and her research assistant kept tripping her up she 'd wind up frantically retyping pages work he was paid to do because somehow he never got around to it in time but when it came to critiquing her work a task that was not part of his job he was ohsoefficient , often implying that he could write a far better book every friday she 'd go home boiling , vowing to confront him on monday every monday she found an excuse not to have the conversation she became ever more frustrated and acted ever more irritable finally , she fired him , but not until after i 'd let him make me crazy and insecure , she recalled with half a laugh , half a wince it s not a particularly unusual story , until you realize what ms perlow was writing about her book , which came out in may , has the enticing title when you say yes but mean no \( crown business \) , but that s not what it s really about the lengthier but much more accurate subtitle says it all how silencing conflict wrecks relationships and companies and what you can do about it as ms perlow sees it , saying nothing is a lot worse than saying yes or no sure , she knows that conflict and confrontation can be unpleasant , hence the tale of her own reluctance to criticize but she insists that the adage , if you ca n't say something nice , do n't say anything at all , is dead wrong conflict , she says , is not just healthy , but vital her premise is simple when people raise concerns , voice criticisms and express differences , be it in bedrooms or boardrooms , spats do n't escalate to wars , defective products are not released and bosses do not fire employees for problems they might have corrected but when people stifle themselves , marriages can head to divorce , products to the clearance shelves and companies to bankruptcy court people silence themselves because they want to be seen as accommodating and hardworking , ms perlow said they think that by staying silent they can speed things up or preserve relationships , but they usually make everything worse ms perlow , 36 , an associate professor at the harvard business school , knows of what she speaks she is a corporate ethnographer \( translation i do in corporations what anthropologists do in exotic lands \) who has made a career analyzing how people behave at work her original fascination how people navigate the competing demands of work and life rapidly evolved into a study of conflict , and its suppression those sound like very different topics they are not during a recent lunch that started over soup and salads at the harvard club balcony the nonposh part of the sumptuous manhattan club to which guests with notepads are summarily dispatched and ended nearly five hours later over dessert and tea in the equally nonposh but notepadfriendly new york times cafeteria , ms perlow connected the dots for a few years in the early 90 s , ms perlow , freshly armed with an economics degree from princeton , was a worker bee herself , doing entrylevel tasks \( she bridles at the expression grunt work \) at a couple of consulting firms both firms had familyfriendly policies on the books , yet the hours were daunting late nights , early mornings , lots of weekends why \? people were constantly frittering away the days with kibitzing and questioning , yet no one would say , leave me be , i 've got to get home early the result nothing got done between 9 and 5 , ms perlow said ms perlow set out to find out why and since then , she has seen the vicious spiral of silence do its dirty work at countless companies there was the big office equipment company whose software engineers spent hours every week putting together elaborate presentations for their weekly meeting with the boss they told her it was a waste of time , but their boss expected it the company s culture was one of accommodating management s requests , ms perlow said fine except that the boss also thought the meetings were a waste of time , but would n't call them off , fearing his underlings might think he was not interested in their work we all know how hard it is to talk back to superiors , but often we forget how hard it is for bosses to speak up to us , ms perlow said so , despite the universal distaste for them , the meetings and busywork continued so did horrific hours like the consultants from ms perlow s first jobs , the engineers constantly interrupted each other with questions , advice or friendly chat ms perlow was certain that they wanted to tell colleagues to go away but were afraid to offend she persuaded them to enforce a daily block of quiet time , during which it was considered acceptable to ask to be left alone they tried it , and productivity went up significantly the unwillingness to speak up had trapped them all in dysfunctional behavior , ms perlow said what finally cemented her attachment to the subject of silencing was when she saw it help bring down a dotcom

falluja , iraq , july 2 an explosion at a mosque here that killed at least six people on monday night , including the mosque s imam , resulted from the presence of a bombmaking class inside , the united states central command said in a statement issued tonight but an american commander in the area said he would continue to adhere to a policy of not searching mosques unless troops were fired on from them it s sovereign territory , said capt john ives of the third infantry division in falluja , about 35 miles west of baghdad mosque members insisted that the explosion had been caused by an american missile fired from a helicopter or an airplane , a version of events that quickly gained currency on the streets of falluja and beyond , prompting vows of revenge captain ives said that since the explosion there had been a series of incidents of men driving by and firing at american soldiers , but that none had hit their targets the central command statement said an investigation by the military and the iraqi police had concluded that coalition forces were in no way responsible for the explosion neighbors interviewed on tuesday concurred , saying they had heard no aircraft before the explosion but had heard that explosives were being stored at the mosque another statement from the central command said a soldier from the army s 352nd civil affairs command had died of wounds incurred on tuesday , when his convoy was hit by an explosive device in baghdad allied forces have carried out repeated raids trying to prevent such attacks , looking for bombmaking activity as well as weapons but captain ives said american soldiers would not trespass on what he called holy ground to do so would risk further alienating a muslim population already seething at the americanled occupation even during the investigation of the mosque explosion , which leveled two rooms adjacent to the mosque , soldiers did not enter the mosque itself , captain ives said he added that he had received tips about guns or bombmaking activities in other mosques and had reported them to either the mayor and police chief or to a moderate , procoalition cleric who then spoke to the imam at the mosque in question we tell him , he said of the moderate sheik he tells the imam to cease activity it works in the case of al hassan mosque , the only reports captain ives received had concerned sermons against the allied forces he asked the moderate sheik , who could not be located today , to speak to the imam , sheik leith khalil daham unfortunately he did n't get there in time , captain ives said sheik daham , who died in the blast , was a young radical , just short of 25 , who took over at al hassan mosque just over a year ago it is one of about 60 mosques in falluja many sunni muslim clerics have preached against the american occupation , but sheik daham s sermons , broadcast by loudspeaker , were extreme enough , and popular enough , to draw the notice of the allied forces his best friend , sheik ahmad hassan , 25 , arrived today to become the new imam at al hassan he said sheik daham had grown up poor in a village near falluja he left middle school in 1992 to attend a newly established religious school in falluja from there he went to a religious college in baghdad sheik hassan said the young men had lived in mosques and delved deeply into the shariah , the code of islamic religious law , under the tutelage of an older sheik american concerns about islamic militants have focused largely on iranianinfluenced shiite hardliners in southern iraq attacks in central iraq have generally been attributed to disgruntled former adherents of saddam hussein s baath party , which during most of its time in power followed a secular ideology but the use of a sunni mosque to make bombs suggests that the resistance may have a decidedly nonsecular component it shows , as well , how politics and selfpreservation eroded mr hussein s commitment to a secular iraq in the 1980 s , iraqis say , men were discouraged from growing beards and the koran could not be read on television but after the persian gulf war of 1991 , as mr hussein sought to appease the arab world and secure his own base , he began building mosques and encouraging the teaching of the koran while some restrictions on the country s oppressed shiite majority were eased , it was the sunni arab minority , from whom mr hussein drew most of his support , that benefited the most young sunni militants from across the muslim world thrived in iraq , and their numbers grew during a decade of sanctions sheik hassan said he and sheik daham had received government stipends to study at the islamic college in baghdad they did n't interfere in our study , he said of mr hussein s officials they did n't interfere in our books i have to tell you the truth reaction from bush \( by the new york times \) , washington , july 2 president bush today came close to taunting iraqis who were attacking americanled forces in iraq and said the assaults would not cause the united states to leave prematurely there are some who feel like that the conditions are such that they can attack us there , mr bush said my answer is , bring them on we 've got the force necessary to deal with the security situation photo muslims in falluja prayed yesterday at al hassan mosque , where an explosion on monday night killed at least six people the united states army denied accusations that an allied missile strike had caused the blast \( associated press \) map of iraq shows the location of falluja falluja

cleveland , aug 21 the huge gray cooling tower of the davisbesse power plant stands along lake erie like a monument to nuclear energy and industrial might that it has been idle for more than a year , though , makes it a testament to something else , according to former employees and the federal regulators who ordered it shut down the dormant plant , for them , is an example of neglect and poor management by its owner , the firstenergy corporation , which allowed hazardous conditions to fester so badly that a catastrophic accident may have been only months away the shutdown of davisbesse the plant , outside toledo , was taken offline after acid nearly ate through the reactor lid is the most extreme example of shortcomings in how firstenergy runs an empire with 43 million customers across new jersey , pennsylvania and ohio but it is not the only one its new jersey subsidiary has come under fire for frequent blackouts , for inadequate maintenance and for allowing stray electricity to run through the ground , leaving residents of brick , nj , tingling when they step into pools and jacuzzis and in northern ohio , mayors have complained to state regulators that power failures by firstenergy have become more frequent and longer , forcing some to buy dieselpowered generators for municipal buildings the company has been responsible for more blackouts in ohio already this year than all of last year when firstenergy s network of transmission lines and power plants in northern ohio failed last thursday one of the first problems in the cascade of events that resulted in the nation s largest blackout misgivings among elected officials and others about the company s performance turned into wider and more fundamental questioning of its conduct as one of the major players in the nation s deregulated , physically vulnerable energy market firstenergy contends that its run of recent problems is not the result of a systemic management failure or inadequate investment in its power system , and some industry monitors assert that the company s performance is by and large no better or worse than other giant utilities firstenergy has failed , it said , to meet national standards for safe operations in very few categories and the federal officials investigating the blackout have been explicit in cautioning against assuming who , if anyone , was to blame , and emphasizing that it will be weeks before they sort out what exactly accounted for the failure of any part of the system firstenergy , based in akron , is no enron , the once highflying texas energy merchant that sold its power plants at the dawn of energy deregulation to focus on buying and selling power formed in 1997 by the merger of two ohio utilities , firstenergy kept its smokestacks and power lines but the company is in many ways emblematic of how traditional utilities have tried to adapt to the freewheeling ways of deregulation it has become aggressive about expansion , but a number of its senior managers stepped down or were reassigned while the company was under fire it , like similar energy companies , has invested ever larger amounts on lobbying and political campaigns , pouring money into local and national politics and earning victories on rates and energy policy and , documents indicate , firstenergy has made what many experts and elected officials regard as less than impressive efforts at spending on the things that they say the nation s electricity grid needs most upgrading its transmission system in the three years since deregulation legislation passed in ohio , its spending on maintaining its highvoltage transmission lines in ohio has remained all but flat the decision not to increase such spending came as industry groups and government regulators were warning that the grid system in the midwest , including firstenergy s territory , could become a choke point in a summer power surge firstenergy has insisted it was an accidental player in the blackout , that the problem began elsewhere but many experts say the problems at firstenergy are indicative of broader issues affecting many power companies as competitive pressures have increased the drive for profits , and the role of government to police the operation of the nation s power grid is extremely limited this has always been a utility that has dug in and supported the status quo , not wanting to modernize , not wanting to make investments , said state senator eric d fingerhut , a democrat from the cleveland area who sits on the legislative committee that oversees power companies firstenergy concedes none of that the company has been through some difficult times recently , todd schneider , a company spokesman , said it has been in tough situations before , and we have successfully emerged in 1999 , a fierce battle unfolded in the ohio legislature over legislation to deregulate the state s electric utilities the plan called for allowing new companies to sell power in territories once monopolized by the local utilities firstenergy , just two years old and rapidly growing , had other ideas the company , like other utilities in ohio , tried to stop the legislation , hiring more than two dozen topdrawer lobbyists and consultants , including robert h bork , the former united states supreme court nominee , who had an expertise in the legal questions involved

passengers at the 429 airports used by commercial airlines in the united states all know the drill to get on a plane , you must pass yourself and your belongings through a security checkpoint run by federal screeners who use electronic devices to look for guns , knives and other potential weapons setting off the metal detector with as much as a forgotten quarter in a pocket automatically elicits an embarrassing public patdown and electronic wanding but this is not the drill for thousands of daily passengers who fly on corporate aircraft , which usually operate from private terminals at the 5 , 000 or so domestic airports that do not handle commercial air traffic in the united states last year , according to industry statistics , more than 10 , 000 companies operated about 15 , 500 fixedwing aircraft , ranging from twoseat turboprop planes to heavyiron jet behemoths that can carry 40 or more passengers yet none of the passengers on those planes receive the preboarding security checks by federal screeners that are standard practice at commercial airports very few , in fact , even pass through a metal detector and officials in the industry are increasingly worried that lax or haphazard security procedures have created an opportunity for terrorists corporate aviation is a soft target , said charlie leblanc , a vice president of air security international , a houston company that provides security services for operators of corporate aircraft business jets of all sizes make up nearly twothirds of the total domestic corporate fleet if terrorist groups are looking to continue to use aviation , and if they 're thwarted using commercial aviation , they 're going to be looking at other forms of aviation , he said not very many years ago , the typical corporate aircraft was owned and operated by a single company , and most passengers were familiar faces since about 1996 , however , corporate aviation including fractionalshare businessjet operations , private charter flights and programs that hire out corporate jets like limousines has surged increasingly , corporate planes are carrying passengers who are strangers to one another and to the flight crew fractionalshare programs , which allow companies and individuals to buy time shares in a jet jointly owned with others , have added 4 , 000 new general aviation customers in the last five years alone , said steven f o'neill , the chief executive of citation shares , a fractionalownership company jointly owned by cessna aircraft and tag aviation usa and the average share size is growing smaller fractional share owners grew by almost 1 , 000 to 5 , 827 in the period from 2001 to 2002 alone , according to the national business aviation association the overall number of flights by business jets rose 13 percent last year at the recent trade show of the national business aviation association in orlando , fla , there was abundant discussion about security many agreed that to stave off unwanted federal regulation , the industry needed to move aggressively to adopt voluntary , uniform standards for such matters as preflight boarding , aircraft security on the ground and security at corporate airports right now , corporate aircraft security is a hodgepodge put in place by individual operators who themselves decide how they want to deal with it , mr leblanc said the transportation security administration , whose budget has been strained by the demands of security screening at commercial airports , has so far trod gingerly in dealing with corporate aviation in a security advisory to the industry last month , the agency merely urged vigilance and suggested that general aviation operators consider matters like methods for securing unattended aircraft , verifying passengers' identities and verifying the contents of baggage and cargo there are about 214 , 000 general aviation planes of all types registered in the united states in the corporate aircraft niche , operators range from a guy that owns a cessna 250 to a general electric that has five or six gulfstreams and two 737 s in its fleet , mr leblanc said , explaining the complexity of drafting regulations to cover the whole field security procedures vary widely , from virtually nonexistent to minimal and sometimes better the same can be said for airports that cater to business aviation , which can range from a small runway with a combined snack bar and control tower in idaho , to megacorporate jetports with luxurious terminals near big cities , where 35 million business jets owned by fortune 500 luminaries are parked almost wing to wing many operators have tightened security procedures since 9 11 , but the industry , in consultation with the transportation security administration , recently instituted a training that it hopes to expand next year under it , operators who attend security training seminars , which are now held at a few designated corporate airports , receive what are known as tsa access certificates the certificates loosen restrictions for them on international flights and are eventually expected to allow holders more ready return access to airways and airports closed by emergency restrictions only a handful of operators have enrolled in the voluntary program , but federal officials are not making public noises , at least , about cracking the whip let me tell you clearly , the tsa does not consider corporate aviation to be a threat we see you as a potential target , pam hamilton , the agency s director of aviation initiatives , said at the trade show this month we understand that you represent the industrial base of this country , and that your mission is to move your corporate executives from point a to point b efficiently , safely and securely for operators of planes 12 , 500 pounds and heavier who provide charter flights \( which tend to have the widest variety of passengers \) , the tsa already mandates training in security procedures among them are requiring a governmentissued id and checking passengers' names against the federal no fly list of thousands of names of suspected terrorists some fractionalshare companies , which often also have charter operations , have adopted those socalled 125 standards across their fleets we apply the 125 rule to all flights we owe that security to our customers , said ron vlastelica , a longtime swiss air pilot who now flies for global jet shares , a van nuys , calif , company that sells fractional shares in used gulfstream iii longrange jets , and is affiliated with pacific jet inc , a businessaircraft charter company mr leblanc , whose company helped draft the curriculum for the security seminars , said that he expected the industry to begin moving more forcefully toward adopting uniform security procedures for all business aircraft operators nobody wants to take away from the corporate aviation experience , and nobody wants to turn corporate aviation into a commercial security model , he said but there still needs to be some level of security that is going to ensure that the aircraft is n't hijacked , or that someone is n't just going to go into the cockpit and kill the crew members and make the flight crash photo capt jason marinelli aboard a private jet that he flies for global jet shares , a california company selling fractional ownership in planes \(

mineola , ny , sept 30 the head coach of mepham high school s football team apologized on tuesday for not being able to protect three freshman players who say they were sexually assaulted by three older teammates at a preseason training camp but at the same time , the coach , kevin mcelroy , said he and his staff did everything they could to ensure the safety of the students mr mcelroy , speaking publicly for the first time since the allegations of abuse were reported , also said he did not know of any previous incidents of hazing on the team but as the investigation enters its fourth week , former football players at mepham , in the long island community of bellmore , have spoken of hazing and initiation rituals ranging from jocular to cruel one former player , wesley berger , said older players dunked his head into a toilet at the start of the 1995 season , and then beat him with cleats and helmets after he reported the incident to coaches the father of another player said his son was not just thrown into a toilet , but beaten by older players until his back and shoulders were bruised among about a dozen former mepham players , some said they never saw or experienced any hazing , but a majority recalled a variety of rites sometimes , they said , senior players would shear their younger teammates' hair , throw the younger boys into the shower or have them chug beer from a hose at a weekend party a lawyer for mr mcelroy , joseph s rosenthal , said that mr berger was simply posturing for publicity and that none of the mepham coaches knew of any initiation traditions on the team mr mcelroy said he had learned about the allegations of sexual abuse five days after the team left the training camp in late august in preston park , pa , and returned to bellmore mr rosenthal said in a telephone interview they ran a pretty tight ship as far as they knew , there was no hazing mr mcelroy said the recent accusations , if true , transcended any definition of hazing , and he characterized them as vicious criminal acts according to prosecutors in pennsylvania , the varsity players sodomized three of their junior varsity teammates with golf balls , pine cones and broomsticks no one has been arrested or charged , but three varsity players have been suspended from school , and the bellmoremerrick board of education has canceled the mepham pirates' football season football players' parents and mepham students who know the students suspected in the attacks said the abuse occurred multiple times and happened inside the student bunks at camp in the weeks after the team s stay in the camp , two parents complained that their son , a junior varsity player , had been threatened by one of the students suspected in the attacks before the trip their son was not among the students who reported being abused but on tuesday , mr mcelroy said the coaches and school had responded to that complaint and had taken every possible precaution to ensure that all students behaved well all the players and their parents signed codeofconduct agreements that outlawed behavior like hazing , drinking and smoking the students were supervised all day during scrimmages and workouts and had to be in bed at 10 pm , mr mcelroy said they bunked about 12 to a cabin , older players mixed in with younger ones to guide the freshman boys through the intense experience of football camp boys are boys , and they have to grow up , too , mr mcelroy said the district attorney for wayne county , pa , mark r zimmer , has subpoenaed a dozen people with connections to the case , including mepham s five football coaches and the three students who said they were abused mr zimmer , who had complained that silence was impeding the investigation , said on monday that witnesses and their lawyers were now agreeing to cooperate , and could testify before a grand jury in the meantime , mr mcelroy said he was grappling with understanding what happened , and former pirates football players said they were casting back into their memories of mepham some , like dan bruzzo , remember the experience as an unalloyed pleasure mr bruzzo , a 1996 mepham graduate and offensive tackle , said older players challenged the younger ones to achieve but never threatened or hazed them the treatment i received there was better than the treatment i received in the hallways , said mr bruzzo , 25 joseph padrucco , 26 , who has fond memories of the team , said freshmen always occupied the lowest social slot on the team younger players , he said , were assigned the worst lockers and had to perform menial tasks like fetching water and carrying the cones used in practice some older players would call the younger ones names , or occasionally toss a younger one into a locker , mr padrucco said there was occasional picking on , mr padrucco said you 'd just catch a little more hell or get yelled on a little bit more it s unfortunately a law of high school pick or be picked on brian szeglin , who graduated in 1999 , said any hazing or initiation was over after the first two weeks of practice everyone on the football team got flushed , he said , describing a practice in which a player s head is forced into a toilet that was just the usual thing but one father in north bellmore whose son played for mepham 11 years ago said the boy quit the mepham football team after two days because of the severity of the hazing the father , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said senior players beat his son , who was then a junior part of the privilege of being a senior varsity player at mepham is that they get to beat up on other kids , the father said it really turned me off that a child can be physically abused because he wanted to be part of something imagine your child being beaten up as part of a ritual in a public school that was what really disgusted me photos the mepham high school football coach , kevin mcelroy , seated at left , with his

after he stopped boozing and before the cancer killed him , the abstract artist stewart hitch had a period of intense clarity , which was expressed in one wish made over and over to friends and family find a home for my paintings since his death a year ago this month , mr hitch s kin , a motley group of bar buddies and his painter colleagues have been struggling to do just that , even though it means solving the mystery of where the paintings have disappeared to first appropriately enough to mr hitch s legacy , the trail starts at fanelli s cafe on prince street that venerable soho bar was his real home carried from nebraska to soho on the winds of the 1960 s , mr hitch had gone about emulating his idol , jackson pollock painting energetically , womanizing rapaciously and drinking ferociously but he achieved only minor recognition as a thirdgeneration abstract painter , and by his death his work had fallen out of favor if his canvases had been stowed in a warehouse , they might already have been shipped to relatives and forgotten instead , in a faint echo of the disputes involving the celebrity estates of mark rothko and andy warhol , mr hitch s legacy is shrouded in controversy his paintings have been taken , friends say , by a con artist who , they believe , is selling them on the black market they have formed a posse and even hired a private eye to get them back his friends' campaign is not only about the money , though if the missing canvases sold at prices comparable to earlier works , they would be worth half a million dollars it is also about the art , and about honoring a soho that is swiftly passing for the paintings are proof positive that this slice of manhattan was not always about stores that featured 700 towel sets , but was once the wild and sparkling center of the entire art world as might be expected of the regulars of an unrepentant , smokesaturated bar like fanelli s , no one remembers exactly when ralph iorio began hanging around there he and a companion known simply as apples were working some kind of small construction job in neighboring nolita and were going to fanelli s daily for lunch or cocktails they looked like characters out of the sopranos mr iorio was large and loud and wore his black hair slicked back apples was disheveled , and he mumbled mr hitch was drinking heavily , of course in his early days , there had been sodden nights aplenty , but back then they were just punctuation to long stretches of isolation in the studio by the late 1990 s , mr hitch was known as lord of fanelli s and could be found tossing back his morning eyeopener as early as 10 am by fall 1998 , mr iorio , a beefy grifter in his 40 s with a shady past , and mr hitch , bar impresario and straightshooting nebraskan , were frequently hunkered together others pegged mr iorio and apples as con men , but mr hitch liked them he and mr iorio talked of setting up a company called s r construction , named for their first initials to help establish it , mr hitch forked over 25 , 000 , a small fraction of the 190 , 000 he had recently got from the sale of his loft in return , mr iorio offered to store 100 of mr hitch s now homeless paintings his life s work without charge at a friend s garage in jersey city the artist happily accepted the business plan , mapped out on a cocktail napkin and sealed with a vodka and cranberry juice , struck the artists' friends as highly dubious we all warned him this guy was no good , said kevin bartelme , a bar buddy of mr hitch s , but he was drinking like half a gallon of vodka a day he was suicidal perhaps not surprisingly , the two partners soon had a falling out mr hitch wanted his paintings back , the painter s friends say , but mr iorio was always making excuses then , in june 1999 , mr hitch passed out at a houston street bar and woke up in st vincent s hospital to find that doctors had discovered cancer in his stomach , lungs and every lymph node in between he became sober and the search for the paintings suddenly became urgent mr hitch pressed to find mr iorio , making frantic phone calls and even , doubled over in pain , traveling to the jersey city garage where the canvases were supposedly stored the garage owner said he had never seen any paintings , adding that he himself was looking for mr iorio until the day mr hitch died , on feb 18 , 2002 , he was completely frustrated in his quest template for a generation stewart hitch s work may not earn him any entries in art history encyclopedias to come , yet his life and career are a perfect template for a generation of postwar painters lincoln , neb , in 1940 , the year mr hitch was born , was a quintessential american town during a quintessential american era but according to the artist s nephew , david jones , when stewart hitch s high school buddies were driving dodge desotos , dreaming of ranch houses and soaking up the prosperity of the postwar years , he was writing poems about a local serial murderer , charlie starkweather , and applying to art school
a battleweary garry kasparov and a stolid deep junior agreed to a 28move draw yesterday in the last game of their manvsmachine chess competition at the new york athletic club the sixgame match ended in a tie , with each side winning a game and drawing the other four mr kasparov , the russian grandmaster , earned 750 , 000 for his effort the money was put up by the world chess federation , and the competition was staged by x3d technologies , a manhattan company that manufactures a system for viewing computer and television images in three dimensions the even score disguised the fact that the games were fiercely fought in 1997 , mr kasparov , who was then the world chess champion , famously lost a match to the ibm supercomputer deep blue in that encounter he played conservatively , trying to avoid the tactically complicated positions that he normally favors against human opponents , but that are dangerous against calculating monsters like deep blue and deep junior this time he played his trademark aggressive chess , said mig greengard , a new york master who provided live commentary during the games at www chessninja com on the web he won the first game the same way he disposes of the best humans he came up with a startling novelty in the opening and then pressed his initiative until he had an overwhelming material advantage and deep junior threw in the towel kasparov also played forcefully in the next two games and reached strong positions but he made tactical blunders when he was short of time he had two hours for his first 40 moves allowing the machine to escape with a draw in game 2 and turn the tables for a victory in game 3 it s easy to get into time pressure against computers , said lev alburt , a new york grandmaster you know that these machines will never miscalculate , and so you can waste valuable time rechecking your own calculations in the fourth game , kasparov avoided an early tactical skirmish by adopting a hedgehog formation , in which none of his pieces and pawns were placed beyond the third rank he was banking on the fact that the machine lacked the longterm planning ability to figure out how to infiltrate his fortress , and indeed , deep junior shuffled its king back and forth because it could not come up with a plan but the machine eventually threw its queenside pawns forward it seemed to develop an initiative , but then kasparov forced an exchange of pieces that steered the position into a drawn endgame the penultimate game was the last time that kasparov had white and the advantage of moving first he is going to be gunning for bear , maurice ashley , a brooklyn grandmaster , told the 300 spectators before the game but it was the computer that quickly became the hunter on the 10th move , deep junior flamboyantly sacrificed its darksquared bishop for a lowly pawn to lure kasparov s king into the open when a machine willingly gives up a piece against you , one thought goes through your head , said mr greengard it s a thought you ca n't print in a family newspaper your second thought is , so , should i just resign \? ' mr kasparov was playing in a private room at the athletic club , but his expressive face , projected onto a 12foot screen in the spectator area , showed that he was shocked by the move it s d j blue all over again , said joel benjamin , a threetime united states champion who worked with ibm on deep blue in the 1997 match , the ibm machine won the final game by similarly sacrificing a piece and hunting down kasparov s king this time , though , kasparov was able to put up a better defense he allowed deep junior to take a draw by perpetual check experts will be arguing for months , mr greengard said , about whether kasparov could have won if he had opted instead for a dangerous continuation that left his king in the center the grandmasters at the athletic club were divided on how soon it will be before silicon beasts dominate worldclass chess completely i give us only a few years , mr kasparov said then they 'll win every match , and we may have to struggle to win even a single game mr alburt was more sanguine i believe that even at the end of this century , the top humans will be defeating computers , he said there are now physical limits to increasing computing power to the point where the game can be solved by a machine mr ashley said he was tired of such speculation cars can outrun us , he said , but that has n't stopped us from having foot races even if a computer is the best player on the planet , i 'll still want to go around the corner , set up the chess pieces and try to kick your butt photo the manvsmachine chess game yesterday between garry kasparov and deep junior had spectators hanging on every move in the end , the rivals agreed to a draw , and their sixgame match ended in a tie \( michael nagle for the new york times \)
foxboro , mass now that the jets are 03 and desperate for a victory next sunday against the bill parcells cowboys , it s time to realize that maybe much too much was expected of this jets team , even if there were not seven surgical pins in chad pennington s left wrist and without pennington , the jets are just that much worse if you consider that an offensive unit involves 14 players adding a fieldgoal kicker , a kickoff returner and a punt returner the jets were without five important players from last season s team , which finished first in the american football conference east pennington and the four players hijacked by the washington redskins during the offseason \( wide receiver laveranues coles , guard randy thomas , placekicker john hall and kickoff returner chad morton \) on defense in yesterday s 2316 loss to the new england patriots , the jets were also without cornerback donnie abraham \( broken shoulder \) and tackle josh evans \( suspended in all likelihood for at least half the season , for violating the nfl drug policy \) it s not as if the jets have replaced those seven players with better or even equal talent of the seven new players at those positions , none are anywhere near the current talent level of the seven absentees at quarterback , vinny testaverde is exactly what he was supposed to be a 39yearold backup he can still throw he completed 25 of 43 passes for 264 yards against bill belichick s defense , but of his 12 thirddown passes , he completed only one , an early 14yard flip to jerald sowell for a first down two other completions were short of a first down eight were incomplete and one was intercepted by cornerback asante samuel , who skipped 55 yards for the touchdown that opened a 239 lead but say this for testaverde he s a class backup when he was reminded that , with 40 , 300 career passing yards , he had moved past johnny unitas into eighth on the career list , he knew it was only a number , not a suggestion that he was a superior quarterback to johnny u it seems irrelevant with an 03 record , he said i 'd give it all back for a win at wide receiver , the experienced curtis conway , who was signed when the redskins lured coles with a sevenyear , 35 million contract that included a 13 million signing bonus , caught 5 passes for 70 yards yesterday , but he dropped two that might have changed the outcome at right guard , brent smith has struggled , as expected after starting only 13 games in four seasons with the miami dolphins , he spent the last two seasons on injured reserve after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in each knee he s not the blocker thomas was , as curtis martin is learning doug brien , signed to replace hall , has been on tour for a decade with the san francisco 49ers , the new orleans saints , the indianapolis colts , the tampa bay buccaneers and the minnesota vikings he has made six of his seven fieldgoal attempts in the 03 start , but when the jets needed a 42yarder midway through the fourth quarter yesterday , he was wide left morton s replacement on kickoffs , michael bates , averaged 28 yards on 5 returns yesterday , with a long of 42 yards , but he has to do better than that to make the jets forget morton s two touchdowns on kickoff returns that won 2002 s hectic opener in overtime at buffalo without abraham and evans , the jets' defense has suffered ray mickens is a capable nickel back but not an everydown cornerback someday the jets' touted firstround draft choice , tackle dewayne robertson , may live up to his billing , but the sun has n't come up yet on that day to add to the problems , mo lewis , who will be 34 next month , and 31yearold marvin jones are showing signs of slowing down either that or all the opposing running backs are faster add all that up and this jets team , on paper , is nowhere near the level of last season s team and on the field , it s nowhere , period on offense , it produces yards but not touchdowns that s why coach herman edwards tried to steal a touchdown with a fake field goal that had the holder , dan stryzinski , throwing a pass just beyond the fingertips of center kevin mawae , who lined up as a wing blocker i'm trying to get something going , edwards said i'm trying to get some energy in this team i am trying to score touchdowns so the jets are 03 and pennington is expected to miss four more games , if not five or six or maybe more by then , the jets are likely to be too far out of the divisional race for pennington to be a factor edwards knows it , saying , we need to try to win a game before the break , meaning the jets' bye week after next sunday s game against dallas \( which has another exjet , running back richie anderson \) if the jets slide to 04 , it will be the fifth time this often frustrated franchise has lost its first four games they slid to 05 twice , in 1980 and again in 1996 when they slid all the way to 08 and 115 , prompting bill parcells s arrival as the jets' coach and majordomo in 1997 now look who s coming to the other sideline sunday at giants stadium photo jets coach herman edwards appeared to find some humor while arguing with the side judge jeff lamberth in the first half yesterday \( photo by associated press \)
washington , april 29 following are excerpts from the supreme court s ruling in demore v kim that the government can imprison those it seeks to deport without giving them a hearing chief justice william h rehnquist wrote the majority opinion justice david h souter wrote a dissent a transcript is online at nytimescom washington from the decision by chief justice rehnquist in the present case , the statutory provision at issue governs detention of deportable criminal aliens pending their removal proceedings such detention necessarily serves the purpose of preventing deportable criminal aliens from fleeing prior to or during their removal proceedings , thus increasing the chance that , if ordered removed , the aliens will be successfully removed respondent disagrees , arguing that there is no evidence that mandatory detention is necessary because the government has never shown that individualized bond hearings would be ineffective but as discussed above , in adopting section 1226 \( c \) , congress had before it evidence suggesting that permitting discretionary release of aliens pending their removal hearings would lead to large numbers of deportable criminal aliens skipping their hearings and remaining at large in the united states unlawfully respondent argues that these statistics are irrelevant and do not demonstrate that individualized bond hearings are ineffective or burdensome it is of course true that when congress enacted section 1226 , individualized bail determinations had not been tested under optimal conditions , or tested in all their possible permutations but when the government deals with deportable aliens , the due process clause does not require it to employ the least burdensome means to accomplish its goal the evidence congress had before it certainly supports the approach it selected even if other , hypothetical studies might have suggested different courses of action zadvydas is materially different from the present case in a second respect as well while the period of detention at issue in zadvydas was indefinite and potentially permanent , the detention here is of a much shorter duration zadvydas distinguished the statutory provision it was there considering from section 1226 on these very grounds , noting that postremovalperiod detention , unlike detention pending a determination of removability , has no obvious termination point under 1226 \( c \) , not only does detention have a definite termination point , in the majority of cases it lasts for less than the 90 days we considered presumptively valid in zadvydas the executive office for immigration review has calculated that , in 85 percent of the cases in which aliens are detained pursuant to section 1226 \( c \) , removal proceedings are completed in an average time of 47 days and a median of 30 days  for the reasons set forth above , respondent s claim must fail detention during removal proceedings is a constitutionally permissible part of that process the ins detention of respondent , a criminal alien who has conceded that he is deportable , for the limited period of his removal proceedings , is governed by these cases the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed from the dissent by justice souter kim s claim is a limited one not that the government may not detain lprs to ensure their appearance at removal hearings , but that due process under the fifth amendment conditions a potentially lengthy detention on a hearing and an impartial decision maker s finding that detention is necessary to a governmental purpose he thus invokes our repeated decisions that the claim of liberty protected by the fifth amendment is at its strongest when government seeks to detain an individual the chief justice wrote in 1987 that in our society liberty is the norm , and detention prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception accordingly , the fifth amendment permits detention only where heightened , substantive due process scrutiny finds a sufficiently compelling governmental need in deciding in salerno that this principle did not categorically bar pretrial detention of criminal defendants without bail under the bail reform act of 1984 , it was crucial that the statute provided that , i n a fullblown adversary hearing , the government must convince a neutral decision maker by clear and convincing evidence that no conditions of release can reasonably assure the safety of the community or any person we stressed that the act was not a scattershot attempt to incapacitate those who are merely suspected of serious offenses , and held that due process allowed some pretrial detention we have reviewed involuntary civil commitment statutes the same way in addington v texas \( 1979 \) , we held that a state could not civilly commit the mentally ill without showing by clear and convincing evidence that the person was dangerous to others , the elevated burden of proof was demanded because loss of liberty calls for a showing that the individual suffers from something more serious than is demonstrated by idiosyncratic behavior the statutory deficiency was the same in foucha , where we held that louisiana s civil commitment statute failed due process because the individual was denied an adversary hearing at which the state must prove by clear and convincing evidence that he is demonstrably dangerous to the community

while saddam hussein was in power , the families of his victims never dreamed they would ever have the opportunity to find the bodies of their loved ones now that he has been deposed , they are rushing to excavate the mass graves of his regime with shovels , backhoes and bare hands so far , at least 10 gravesites have been publicly identified , with more turning up almost daily the macabre scramble at these sites is destroying evidence that could be used to bring the murderers to justice , and depriving thousands of the opportunity to identify the bodies of their loved ones this could have been avoided if it had been made clear that there would be an orderly process this is a deep failure by american and british forces , which have neither secured the sites nor communicated any plan for excavations to the iraqi people the largest gravesite found so far is near the town of hilla , south of baghdad it was first brought to the attention of the forces in iraq on may 3 local people waited for action seeing none after a week , they began to bulldoze and dig last week , american marines were at the site providing water , folding chairs , and awnings for shade about 3 , 000 bodies were found perhaps 800 of them had id cards and 150 or so others were identified by the less reliable means of clothing or personal effects because of the crudeness of the excavations , iraqis may never know how and when the people buried at hilla died the identities of those with no id cards will remain forever a mystery it is not clear why american soldiers had not secured hilla to await a more systematic and professional exhumation l paul bremer , the american civilian administrator in iraq , said on thursday that the forces there had offered to do so but local officials turned them down human rights watch says the opposite that the mayor of hilla asked for marines to help guard the site , but they were never sent and indeed no site is secured it is clear that there remains something of a shortage of troops and that there are numerous competing needs for them including protection of nuclear research sites but securing these gravesites deserves high priority not only have the americanled forces made no effort to tell iraqis why they should wait , but there has also been little apparent progress on a program for proper exhumations iraqis need to be trained to do forensic investigations graves must be mapped and photographed investigators must set up a registry of missing persons that includes photos and known information , such as the clothing worn when they disappeared and the date and place they were last seen meanwhile , pentagon officials seem to underestimate the significance of the problem they are treating the hilla exhumation as one that meets the needs of the iraqis instead , they should learn a lesson from kosovo , where nato secured mass grave sites immediately , allowing forensic experts to properly dig up the dead and collect evidence this is what needs to happen in iraq
baghdad , iraq , sept 25 making a strong statement about the magnitude of security problems in iraq , secretary general kofi annan decided today to remove most of the united nations' remaining 86 foreign staff members there among the most recent casualties of the violent attacks tormenting the country was akila alhashimi , a member of iraq s 25member governing council she died here this morning , five days after unidentified gunmen ambushed her in the street as she drove to work her death , coinciding with the announcement of mr annan s decision and a bomb attack on a hotel used by nbc news , seemed to underscore the deteriorating security situation here two days ago , a bomb exploded outside the united nations headquarters here , the second attack on the organization in two months ms hashimi was shot in the stomach and suffered a serious wound to her pancreas her condition had appeared to stabilize earlier this week after two surgeries at the americanrun ibn sina hospital here , but she weakened from internal bleeding and fell into a coma on wednesday she died at about 11 30 am , american authorities said ms hashimi was 50 a member of a prominent family of shiite clerics , she is survived by three brothers , two sisters and two halfbrothers in keeping with islamic tradition , which calls for the dead to be buried as quickly as possible , her funeral will be held on friday she will be buried in najaf , the site of the holiest shiite shrine , about 100 miles south of baghdad iraqi and american leaders said ms hashimi , one of three women on the governing council , had been a force for peace and tolerance and vowed to continue her work the council called for a threeday period of national mourning ms hashimi fell as a martyr on the path of freedom and democracy to build this great nation , the council said in a statement she died at the hands of a clique of infidels and cunning people who only know darkness l paul bremer iii , the american administrator for iraq , said in a statement that the people of iraq have lost a courageous champion and pioneer for the cause of freedom and democracy the attack on ms hashimi appears to have marked the end of a brief period of calm in baghdad earlier this month this morning a bomb outside a hotel used by nbc news killed one man and wounded two others the attack was the third fatal blast in as many days because of its relationship with mr bremer s administration , the governing council is an obvious target for attacks , and some of its members have harshly criticized the occupation administration for failing to guard them properly ms hashimi had received threats in recent weeks , her brother , zaid , said he said the callers warned that she would be punished for collaborating with the occupation authorities at a news conference today , lt gen ricardo sanchez , the commander of the occupation forces in iraq , said the allies had helped council members improve their security we have been working with the governing council , he said that work continues on a daily basis in response to another question , he declined to say whether he believed baghdad and iraq were becoming safer or more dangerous there is n't a security crisis in the country at this point , general sanchez said none of the bombs this week have been as destructive as the truck bombs that devastated the united nations compound and the jordanian embassy in august but they are disturbing reminders that baghdad seems to be growing more insecure the list of targets also appears to be widening today s attack was the first on an american news organization , although no one from nbc was seriously wounded on tuesday , a suicide bomber blew up his car in a parking lot outside the united nations , killing one security guard safety was a note mr annan stressed in his address to the general assembly on tuesday , and a number of foreign staff members have left in the last two days today , shasi tharoor , a public relations official at the united nations , explained the decision to remove the rest , saying the secretarygeneral s responsibility for the security of the staff cannot be minimized what he did was done keeping in mind the united nations commitment to making a contribution in iraq and his legal and moral responsibility to the staff on wednesday , a roadside device exploded as an american patrol drove by , missing the patrol but destroying two buses and killing at least one iraqi the rumble of this morning s blast , just before 7 am , echoed across much of baghdad at the aike hotel , in a residential neighborhood in eastern baghdad , shattered glass and twisted metal littered the sidewalk , and electric power lines lay in the street the bomb had been planted on the north side of the hotel next to its electric generator it s not safe to live in this country , said johnny lawrence , who lives across the street from the hotel and was slightly wounded when the windows in his house shattered mr lawrence , an iraqi christian , said he had initially welcomed the collapse of saddam hussein s regime , but that he has changed his mind mr hussein grabbed everything for himself and his children , and nothing for his country , mr lawrence said but one thing about it , he continued , you were secure you could sit in the garden and have tea by 9 am the street outside the hotel was quiet dozens of american soldiers and iraqi police officers were on the scene , some blocking the road , others poking at bomb fragments and reporters stood nearby then a red and white iraqi ambulance swung up , and a halfdozen men carried away the notquitehidden body of the somali guard , the latest casualty in a guerrilla war that is growing messier by the day by

balad , iraq , nov 1 in one 24hour stretch , america s successes and difficulties in this country showed themselves in the figure of lt col nate sassaman on friday , colonel sassaman stood before the newly elected balad city council , walking them through such democratic bedrocks as the secret ballot and the open meeting on saturday morning , after a couple of hour s sleep , colonel sassaman led a company of 150 soldiers on a series of housetohouse searches for weapons and guerrillas on the outskirts of town it s like jekyll and hyde out here , said colonel sassaman , a 40yearold battalion commander and former starting quarterback for army s football team by day , we 're putting on a happy face by night , we are hunting down and killing our enemies that type of discrepancy is true across iraq , but seldom is it lived with such intensity in the same place , by the same soldiers , as here to the north of baghdad six months since president bush declared the end of major hostilities in iraq , america s soldiers are waging two starkly different campaigns laying the groundwork for democratic rule while battling an insurgency that is undermining that very work here in balad , a district of 180 , 000 people 50 miles north of baghdad , the two american campaigns are unfolding sidebyside , by virtue of the area s exceptional demography the city of balad is an island of shiite islam in the heart of the area known as the sunni triangle the shiites in balad suffered under saddam hussein , as they did in the rest of iraq for that reason , they have largely been cooperating with american efforts to implant the rudiments of a democratic system in balad and in southern iraq , where the shiites predominate , the environment remains relatively calm but here in central iraq , american soldiers are battling a ferocious guerrilla insurgency , drawn largely from the region s sunni population the sunnis , though a minority in iraq , fared well during mr hussein s reign , and their neighborhoods are now generating violence against the americans across much of the area , building democracy has taken a back seat to fighting the war so it is that balad and its environs contain most of the contradictions facing the americans in iraq the relative peace of the shiite areas and the violence of the sunni areas , all in one it is that dual reality that gives colonel sassaman sleepless nights we 're doing something worthwhile here , colonel sassaman said in an interview at the headquarters of his unit , the first battalion , eighth infantry , part of the fourth infantry division but it s clear that our enemies are going to keep attacking us until we kill and capture every one of them that s going to take a while on a recent afternoon at balad youth center , colonel sassaman found himself in the unlikely position of presiding over one of the first meetings of the balad city council seated at an elevated table , he looked like a soldier but acted more like a teacher , moving the meeting along , reminding the iraqis of their responsibilities , nudging here , shepherding there i want take a moment to congratulate the mayor for the great job he s done , colonel sassaman said into the microphone , and for all his efforts he has made for a secure and stable environment in balad the mayor , nabeel darwash , stood up , and all the iraqis clapped the city council meeting that unfolded in balad on friday was a measure of the progress the americans have made here , and in other parts of the country where the environment is peaceful enough to allow american soldiers and their iraqi allies to begin the quiet work of building a democracy and not only that in balad , the american military has been setting up police forces , repairing electrical lines and filling up hospitals with medicine for colonel sassaman , the key to the success inside the city has been simple his soldiers do not get shot there as a result , he has channeled the overwhelming majority of the reconstruction money at his disposal more than 1 million into balad , and away from the outlying areas , where the war is we had 90 mortar attacks on americans in three months over here , said the colonel , referring to the areas surrounding balad in the city , we had none as in much of iraq , large groups of iraqis appear willing to work with the americans many iraqis , especially the shiites and kurds , still harbor grim memories from the days of mr hussein , and their gratitude to the americans , and their desire to get on with rebuilding their country , appears in many places to outweigh the everyday indignities of military occupation the result , in some parts , is that the first shallow roots of democracy appear to be taking hold i won an election , without threats or intimidation , hussein ali , a 43yearold shiite farm owner who was recently elected to the balad city council the people know me in this town i 've pledged to do my best for them , to improve city services at friday s meeting , the iraqi council members seemed to have taken gracefully to new democratic ways they filled out their paper ballots , dropped them into the box and moved solemnly back to their seats when their names were called , the council members , many of them old before their years , stood erect before their new constituents in their first vote , the council members took a bold step , rejecting a new term for the mayor , mr darwash , and deciding to find somebody else someone more capable , mr ali explained afterwards
it has been a stunning spring of emergence in the stanley cup playoffs three of the four remaining teams did not even exist until the 1990 s and have never before reached this level in the postseason one of them , ottawa , is in bankruptcy protection and on the verge of new ownership another , anaheim , is for sale but none have written a more improbable script than the minnesota wild , which defeated the vancouver canucks , 42 , in game 7 on thursday night to move into the western conference finals yet the wild has the lowest payroll among the league s 30 teams , at 207 million , according to the nhl players' association the wild , which began play in 2000 , will face the mighty ducks of anaheim , a team that began play in 1993 that series starts this afternoon in st paul in the eastern conference finals , the ottawa senators , who began play in 1992 , will play host to the devils tonight compared with the other three teams , the devils seem relatively wealthy and well established they have played in new jersey since 1982 they spent the previous six seasons in denver as the colorado rockies and the two before that in kansas city as the scouts the devils have won the stanley cup twice and may be considered the favorites this spring , even though the senators are seeded above them of the four finalists , the devils have the highest payroll , at 554 million , eighth in the nhl , according to figures from the players' association the ducks are 10th at 455 million and the senators are 19th at 348 million but what is the hockey world to make of the wild , which eliminated the colorado avalanche and the canucks after trailing in each series by three games to one no team in nhl history had done that and minnesota did it with only one player , cliff ronning , making more than the average nhl salary ronning earns 185 million the average in 20012 , the last season computed , was 164 million the puckstopping burden for the wild has been shared by dwayne roloson , who is 54 in the playoffs , and manny fernandez \( 32 \) teams rarely succeed in the playoffs with such a formula , but the wild is not a franchise bound to precedent although this is minnesota s first appearance in the postseason , the wild players have shown more poise than their opponents that was apparent in game 7 in vancouver , when the canucks trailed by 32 late in the third period after squandering a 20 lead vancouver forward todd bertuzzi took an interference penalty for knocking defenseman andrei zyuzin into roloson with bertuzzi in the penalty box , pascal dupuis of the wild scored his second goal of the game to make it 42 with 2 minutes 33 seconds left when asked if he had envisioned such success so soon , wild coach jacques lemaire replied are you kidding \? never in a million years much of the credit for the wild s success goes to lemaire , who coached the devils to their first cup in 1995 he favors a rigid and disciplined defensive system but look at all the scoring with a patient and opportunistic approach against vancouver , the wild scored 16 goals in the final three games leading them is the speedy marian gaborik , a 21yearold left wing from slovakia who was the team s firstround choice \( third over all \) in the 2000 entry draft he has nine goals and eight assists in the playoffs on the other end of the star spectrum is minnesota s secondleading scorer , wes walz , who has seven goals and six assists his thirdperiod goal thursday night tied the score at 22 walz , who turns 33 on may 15 , bounced around four nhl teams and five minor league teams and played four seasons in switzerland before signing as a free agent with the wild in the summer of 2000 like many of his teammates , he has finally found a niche in the twin cities maybe the hockey gods are on our side , walz told the st paul pioneer press i never used to believe in them , but i believe in them a lot more now minnesota now takes an unfamiliar position the wild has homeice advantage because it is seeded sixth and the ducks are seeded seventh until this season , anaheim had qualified for the postseason twice in nine seasons and won only one round but the ducks , behind goalie jeans bastien gigu re , swept the defending champion detroit red wings in the fourofsevengame firstround series , then eliminated dallas in six games in the second round gigu re , from montreal , is one of three french canadian goalies who will have starring roles in the conference finals the most prominent is martin brodeur of the devils , who is also from montreal the third is ottawa s patrick lalime , born in st bonaventure , quebec \( the most accomplished goalie from quebec of this era , patrick roy of colorado , is said to be considering retirement \) speaking of french canadian influence if minnesota and ottawa advance , the championship round will match coaches named jacques lemaire of the wild and martin of the senators lemaire doug risebrough , the wild s general manager guy lapointe , the team s coordinator of amateur scouting and the assistant coach mario tremblay all learned their craft as players under scotty bowman in montreal during the canadiens' run of four straight cups from 1976 to 1979 the canadiens rarely make the postseason these days , and the nordiques are long gone from quebec city but la belle province is well represented in the conference finals photos patrick lalime of the senators , left , and the devils' martin brodeur face each other tonight , when the eastern conference finals open in ottawa \( photographs by associated press \) wild goalie dwayne roloson , left , will be matched against the mighty ducks' jeans bastien gigu re during the western conference finals \( left , reuters associated press \)
jenin , west bank , oct 5 it was a few minutes past 8 am on saturday when hanadi jaradat s parents last saw her the 27yearold apprentice lawyer was in a hurry as she walked down the steep , narrow streets of this old arab town , telling her parents she had a land contract to complete , for a fee of 500 in israeli shekels , a small fortune for any impoverished family in jenin at the parting , ms jaradat was barely six hours away from her death in that time , she met with accomplices from the islamic jihad militant group , journeyed 30 miles west across the hills to the israeli city of haifa , changed from a traditional black arab cloak and headdress into jeans and a ponytail that made her indistinguishable from the casual weekenders of israel , and walked into a seaside restaurant to detonate a bodybelt bomb in the blast , she killed herself and 19 others , all israelis 14 jews , 3 of them children , and 5 arab christians what happened in those hours is the focus now of israeli investigators , who want to know how ms jaradat reached haifa , crossing the path of a 400mile barrier of electrified fencing that israel is erecting in the hope of halting palestinian attacks an israeli security official said on sunday that preliminary investigation showed that the bomber had entered israel through a hole in the 90 miles of fence that have been completed in northern israel perhaps , although the official did not say so , through a gap that had been left lightly guarded just east of the palestinian village of qaffin ms jaradat s parents , in jenin , say questions about the bombing and their daughter s involvement with islamic jihad are baffling ones right up to the moment of their last farewell , they said , they had no indication that their daughter had any contacts with islamic militants no sense , they said , that she had any ambition but to establish her career as a lawyer , marry and have children her father , tayseer , age 50 , moves slowly , suffering from a degenerative liver disease that made it difficult to keep up with his daughter as they walked on saturday morning , ms jaradat ostensibly to her law office , her parents to the vegetable market in the center of jenin so she said she would walk ahead , her parents said , and waved as she walked away , smiling just as she appeared later , on television , in the traditional suicide bomber s video she made , when she closed the koran and smiled , shyly , as though preparing for a graduation or a wedding she walked faster than us , saying 'hurry , hurry , ' then she went ahead , said rahmeh jaradat , 51 , the bomber s mother , who gathered her seven surviving children around her as she spoke at her brotherinlaw s house in jenin , where the family moved before israeli troops arrived in jenin in the predawn hours of sunday to demolish their home , the routine punishment for suicide bombers' families she gave us the impression she was in a hurry to complete that deal , her mother said she was happy , her father said the suicide bombing was one of more than 100 in the past three years of the uprising that palestinians call the aqsa intifada , attacks that have killed about 430 people , about half the intifada s israeli victims but the haifa attack was heard around the world , because it was followed by an israeli airstrike in syria , and prompted the united nations security council to meet in a special session on sunday in israel , the haifa attack cast a heavy pall over yom kippur , the jewish day of atonement in a relative s home in the old quarter of jenin , a short walk from the field of tumbled stones that is all that is left of their old house , the jaradats had their own story of loss , before that of hanadi the shooting death in jenin four months ago of their oldest son , fadi , 23 , and his cousin saleh , 31 , during an israeli crackdown but a visitor meeting the jaradats found no overt grieving for hanadi , and no sympathy for the haifa victims , at least none the family would acknowledge jenin is ringed by israeli armor , a city not far from lebanon and syria that has become a stronghold of islamic jihad , with simmering hostilities among its 30 , 000 people eighteen months ago , in one of the harshest attacks of the intifada , the government of prime minister ariel sharon cracked down with infantry , tanks and bulldozers that killed dozens of palestinians and left an entire neighborhood in rubble much about the jaradats suggested the careworn but proud gentility found in many palestinian homes there was elaborate courtesy , and thick cups of turkish coffee the family recounted a common palestinian saga the father s long years working in israel as a house painter , the struggle to support hanadi when she studied law in jordan , the sense of hopelessness once israel closed its borders to palestinian workers after the conflict began , the reliance on the pittances fadi , their son , could earn working in the vegetable market but on the subject of the bombing , the responses sounded programmed , as though the family were more concerned about the pervasiveness of islamic holy war in jenin than in voicing their innermost thoughts in place of tears , there were wan smiles when the family talked about hanadi s death , and a studied indifference to the carnage she caused the parents spoke of the attack as god s will
the house on beartown road a memoir of learning and forgetting by elizabeth cohen 270 pp new york random house 2395 some memoirs make you feel as if you 're a voyeur watching spectacularly vulnerable lives laid bare , and if you , the reader , were more virtuous , you 'd stop staring and move on elizabeth cohen certainly has the raw ingredients for such a book in 1999 , the seemingly idyllic life she shares with her husband , her baby , three cats and two dogs takes an unexpected , painful twist i did n't know how sacred that sweetness was , she writes , nor fathom how quickly it could disappear it starts when her mother and sister ship her father once an accomplished academic , now descending into the haze of alzheimer s across the country to live with her meanwhile , her husband , who is 15 years younger than she is and has been having an affair with an 18yearold , abandons her and their baby , ava , and moves out west and then there s cohen , an overwhelmed 40yearold reporter trying to rein in the sudden chaos of caring for her child and her father in upstate new york but instead of molding all this into 270 pages of scathing retribution or bitter selfpity , cohen has written a frank , funny and unexploitative memoir she is not shy about detailing her father s alzheimer s , but she s equally intent on illuminating his dignity indeed , the disease s cruel habit of eating away at memory made her determined to understand better the man who now depends on her for his existence and though she does n't glamorize alzheimer s , she s not blind to its occasional heartbreaking beauty when her father forgets a word , the descriptions he comes up with instead are poetic ava is the one that fills the room with hurricanes and toast is singed bread apples are the crackly , magnificent , sweet ones in one of the book s most engaging aspects , grandfather and granddaughter virtually transform cohen s home into a study lab for memory every room seems to hold a shining example of memory s remarkable powers and humiliating failures ava races through the house soaking up facts and language with her porous , eager mind \( cohen refers to it as a gluey flytrap \) meanwhile , cohen s father is , bit by bit , losing his grasp of the simplest words and phrases daddy walks around dropping pieces of language behind him , the baby following , picking them up indeed , they develop a dance of language and memory ava corrects him when he almost bites a bar of soap and shows him which utensil the fork is cohen s father may not be able to distinguish a fork from a spoon , but he can still instruct his granddaughter on how to use each of them , just as he shows her how to wash her hands with the soap he came close to eating between these two human bookends of memory and learning stands cohen the cleaner , cook , handholder and general caretaker of this vulnerable pair who compulsively tests her own memory and wonders if her father s fate will be hers , and her daughter s as well inevitably , though , much of her free time is consumed by caring for her father she makes cue cards to direct him to his bedroom , the bathroom , the front door she changes his clothes and tucks him in at night \( and then repeats the task for her daughter \) she reads to him and plays memory games she helps him again and again when he s forgotten a basic fact like her name , who she is or which room is which throughout , the reader realizes that her efforts to prevent him from slipping further into alzheimer s and to keep him out of a nursing home are , in part , attempts to save the world she has created cohen has become close to her father not in spite of his illness but because of it not all parts of the house on beartown road some of which originally appeared in cohen s columns for the binghamton press sunbulletin work equally well most of the narrative takes place over one long winter with too much snow and too little heating oil and just as cohen seems to lose track of time , in her repetitive , diarylike descriptions of the weather and her domestic life , so do we the details of her schedule , her father s forgetfulness and her lonely nights watching infomercials occasionally read like filler substituting for deeper analysis and yet it s hard not to be charmed by her simple , straightforward style and her selfdeprecation cohen readily admits to her shortcomings , including her occasionally botched attempts to be a good enough mother and daughter , her frequent neglect of simple tasks , like feeding her pets , and her na vet about some of her choices among them , her marriage and her move from manhattan to rural new york back then , cold was just something that made life more cozy , she writes an excuse to build an attractive fire but if cohen moved to upstate new york with an idealized image of a white farmhouse with creaking floorboards and a big porch where she 'd spend long afternoons sipping iced tea and reading , those ideas vanished under the weight of her responsibilities instead , she benefits from other aspects of smalltown life like the quiet , steady kindness extended by neighbors and colleagues who witness her desperate situation these are mostly background characters a little girl whose arm is severed in an accident , a paternal neighbor suffering from parkinson s disease but it s clear they are meaningful lifelines some invite her for dinner , a muchneeded respite from the family s reliance on denny s others drop off homecooked meals and shovel snow from her driveway and paths many never seek thanks \( it sometimes seems like we have been assigned a troop of forest elves to look after us \) the only evidence of their presence is their boot prints in the snow those prints are a metaphor for what rural life and family life become for cohen during his career as an economist , her father wrote about the importance of kinship in rural societies on the traditional farm , the elderly contributed essential skills and wisdom long after their physical decline though the extended family is mostly lost to modern , urban existence , cohen has managed to find and create kinship and community groups for her own family none of that would have happened , however , had she not been courageous enough to bring illness into her home drawing \( ray bartkus \)
auckland , new zealand , friday , jan 17 when larry ellison s oraclebmw team won its america s cup challenge series race on thursday , the syndicate sent its fleet of 10 bmw 7 series to the end of a wharf near viaduct harbor and had chauffeurs flash headlights and blow horns as its yacht came into port today those cars stayed in the garage the swiss team alinghi , with the new zealander russell coutts at the helm , beat oracle today by 13 seconds to take a 41 lead in the louis vuitton cup the winner of the fiveofninerace series will face team new zealand for the america s cup in february racing today took place in smooth water and a steady southerly breeze of about 14 knots , conditions expected to favor oracle , the san franciscobased team oracle led around the first three marks , but in the middle of the fourth leg , coutts and his team pulled off a roll , one of the most demoralizing tactics in sailing with oracle and its skipper , chris dickson , ahead on the downwind leg , coutts positioned his yacht and its big , winddevouring spinnaker directly between oracle and the breeze oracle s spinnaker collapsed like a rag and , starved of its power , the boat slowed down as alinghi plowed past if you do n't squash them now , you never will , dickson told his helmsman , peter holmberg they never did alinghi led around the final two marks , and oracle never got close enough to attack for the first time in the series , holmberg failed to execute a flawless start forced to tack at the last second in search of clear air , he crossed the line six seconds behind alinghi the boats streaked upwind the boat feels good today , holmberg told oracle s crew moments later , a righthand shift gave oracle the lead oracle led around the first mark by 28 seconds and held onto its lead on the next downwind leg on the third leg , alinghi and coutts initiated a tacking duel with oracle upwind , alinghi turned six times in rapid succession each time , oracle turned with alinghi to try to send the dirty air toward the swiss boat that is what sailing manuals say to do , but none of them explain how to outsail a faster boat alinghi had better acceleration out of each turn than oracle s yacht , usa76 with each turn of the wheel , coutts nibbled at dickson s lead by the third mark , alinghi was 10 seconds behind , close enough for an attack on the downwind leg we did n't tack as well as they did , said tomasso chieffi , oracle s tactician that attack came halfway down that leg oracle was powering off the left side of the course , with alinghi in chase the swiss boat gained just enough ground to block oracle s wind then came the roll that was really the game breaker , said josh belsky , an alinghi crew member the loss is especially tough on oracle because it comes after it seemed to be making headway against alinghi after sound defeats in the first two races of the series , oracle lost the third race by one second and on thursday handed coutts his worst loss in 10 years , by 2 minutes 13 seconds oracle and alinghi will have a day off saturday to rest and tweak their yachts racing will resume sunday alinghi needs just one victory to eliminate the american boat we have n't given up yet , chieffi said photo ernesto bertarelli , head of the alinghi syndicate , celebrating his latest victory over oraclebmw \( reuters \)
brussels , may 13 the european union s highest court ordered the british and spanish governments today to scrap golden share laws and similar mechanisms that let them continue to wield control over companies they once owned the ruling is a significant step forward in the european union s drive to create a single market for capital the court , the european court of justice , ruled that britain must give up its golden share in baa , the former british airports authority , which operates heathrow and gatwick airports near london and others inside and outside the country the share represents a minuscule financial stake in the company but gives the government special veto rights over major corporate decisions , most notably bids to merge with or acquire the company similarly , the court ordered spain to give up immediately its special rights over telef nica , the country s dominant phone company tabacalera , the main tobacco company argentaria , a major bank repsol , a major oil company and endesa , the electric utility the rights were conferred by royal decrees issued when the companies were privatized , and were meant to last 10 years the court said that retaining golden share or royal decree rights would be permissible in cases where national security was at stake , but it concluded that none of the companies involved in today s rulings qualified accordingly , the court declares that the spanish and uk rules are contrary to the free movement of capital in the european union , the court said in a written statement the ruling was welcomed by investors and bankers , and by the european commission , the union s executive body , whose job it is to break down national barriers and create a single unionwide market for all goods and services the ruling clears the way for further commission action against such obstacles , jonathan todd , a commission spokesman , said today peter montagnon , chief of investment affairs at the association of british insurers , said that by itself , today s ruling would probably not increase the pace of crossborder mergers in europe , but it does move europe closer to the level playing field for investors that the association advocates its members hold some 1 trillion in investments around the world we need to eliminate all such distortions , and create a situation where one share equals one vote , mr montagnon said the european commission has confronted many member nations over golden share arrangements and other legal mechanisms meant to shield important companies from possible foreign takeover , including the dutch government s special role in tpg , the express delivery company , and royal kpn , the former telephone monopoly it has ordered denmark to give up its stake in copenhagen airports , and it has told italy to shed golden shares in eni , the oil company enel , italy s biggest utility telecom italia and finmeccanica all these cases may eventually come before the european court of justice more recently , the commission has told germany to abolish a law capping the voting rights of any one shareholder in volkswagen at 20 percent and guaranteeing the government of the state of lower saxony 20 percent voting rights even though its financial stake is smaller the law also allows the regional government to nominate directors of volkswagen as well as tackling individual cases , the commission has also been trying for 15 years to enact a unionwide law on takeovers the most recent draft was blocked by germany over concerns that it would expose german companies like volkswagen to hostile foreign takeovers while leaving untouched some other nations' protective arrangements , like the multiple voting rights commonly used in scandinavia mr montagnon said the commission should abolish multiple voting rights arrangements as well if all obstacles to crossborder mergers and acquisitions are removed , he said , the result will be a more prosperous europe
ask average people what they 'd do if they won a million dollars and , as the television jingle goes , they 'd likely buy a house if they already own a house , maybe they 'd buy a dream car or a boat or some other recreational vehicle some might even travel the world as for me , if i won a million dollars , i 'd pay my cable bill with strategic budgeting , i may be able to stretch it to an entire year s worth of payments and come out clean but that depends on cablevision , of course this company i 've hired for my television viewing consistently neglects to upgrade my services but spontaneously increases my monthly payments , for no apparent reason other than to see just how far it can push the envelope take this month s surprise mailer , for instance for the past two years , i had been paying 2999 a month for optimum online , an internet service that i use for workrelated research suddenly , i'm to pay an extra 15 or so for the exact same service 4495 a month , which , cablevision is pleased to point out , includes a 5 discount off the regular price of 4995 \( what i 've done to deserve this vip treatment is beyond me \) how long the discount will last they do n't say , preferring the shock value in a future bill in my household we do n't receive cinemax , oxygen or any other networks that we 'd like we do have access to a mindnumbing array of sports , cartoon and weather channels under the company s cryptic auspices of a family cable plan , we also get three spanishlanguage stations and a slew of home shopping channels plus the channels every household with children wants court tv and cspan for this i'm paying another 4577 in monthly charges what i 'd like to know is , exactly what family did cablevision question before putting together this hodgepodge of programming options \? speaking of options , i'm well aware that there are plenty available to disgruntled consumers like me but i have n't signed up for the cable alternatives college course yet , as it conflicts with the bill reading comprehension course i'm already taking truly , i do n't want to hate my cable company but with a total bill of 9678 , they mock my impotence with each monthly statement and while i do n't love the electric company , at least i can exercise some semblance of control by leveraging usage if i blast the air conditioner 24 7 , i can anticipate a jackedup bill the following month no surprises same with the telephone , the heating bill and water with cablevision , not only am i not getting the channels i really want , but i'm also taken aback on a monthly basis by incomprehensible increases and surcharges none of which benefit my tv system , but all of which wreak havoc on my nervous system perhaps we cablevision subscribers \( the few of us who remain \) should hook up and file a classaction suit for emotional pain and suffering for who among us does n't tremble at the sight of the mailman dropping off the latest monthly damages \?
it had been a horrible day for the washington freedom , losing a game and first place in the women s united soccer association frustration beaded like sweat on a humid afternoon last sunday a late scuffle and a cynical foul lent ugly tension to a 31 defeat by boston two freedom players were expelled , and at the final whistle , goalkeeper siri mullinix moved to confront the referee mia hamm sprinted toward midfield at robert f kennedy stadium in washington , intercepted mullinix and firmly steered her away then hamm gathered her teammates and jabbed her index finger at the air as she spoke , exhorting them to use their emotions for determined playing , not overheated complaining she knows about volatility as a girl , she would simply quit playing backyard games or board games with her brother and sisters if she began losing just walk away in a huff , or maybe tip over the game board , she said in past years , she might have been the one challenging the referee but on this day , when her teammates lost their composure , hamm kept hers , assisting on washington s only goal with a perfectly bent corner kick and dousing a potentially flammable moment at game s end a broader equanimity now accompanies her after some professional and personal turbulence in recent years enormous pressures were placed on her shoulders the success of the 1999 women s world cup and the start of the wusa two years later were staked largely on her reputation as the greatest scorer in soccer and one of its most recognizable and marketable faces while girls continued to wear her no 9 jersey and shriek her name , hamm seemed to grow physically and emotionally worn her marriage failed knee and shoulder injuries limited her soccer and required surgery her own enthusiasm wavered , and for the first time she came under real criticism was she the same player \? was she done \? i love when people challenge her and say she ca n't do it , jim gabarra , coach of the freedom , said any time someone questions whether she s the player she was , she always seems to answer at 31 , with another world cup approaching in september , hamm again finds her career in ascendancy she has never been so fit , and she has become a more creative and versatile and tactical player , comfortable both slashing forward and serving balls from midfield , her passes as dangerous as her shots washington reached the wusa title game last season , and this year , hamm has six goals and five assists in eight games last night , she scored her worldleading 140th international goal as the united states national team defeated ireland , 50 , in salt lake city i do think she is playing the best of her career , april heinrichs , coach of the national team , said in a telephone interview in both her professional and personal lives , hamm appears much more at ease , happier she is engaged to nomar garciaparra , the boston red sox shortstop , and seems more embracing of her celebrity it has been a fundamental contradiction in her career a fierce desire to be the best player in the world , and an equal determination to remain out of the spotlight last month , hamm was guest host of the nbc program today , something that never would have happened before the 1999 world cup , when she became reluctant even to promote her autobiography , declining individual interviews for fear that she would blur her focus and siphon all the attention from her lesserknown teammates mia has been the face of women s soccer for 10 years , brandi chastain , a longtime member of the national team , said by telephone the burden and responsibility that go with that are pretty heavy though she handled it with grace and humility and poise , that can wear on you it s exhausting you ca n't be yourself in that environment you always worry about what others need and want now she s much more comfortable where she is perhaps no one else so embodies the sporting , cultural and commercial advances made by female athletes over the past three decades sex plays almost no part in the appreciation of hamm s skill she is the bestknown american soccer player , man or woman , and has scored more international goals than even the great pel of brazil gatorade features her in commercials , and such is her familiarity that it is not necessary to mention her name last october , hamm recalled , she walked into a store in north carolina to buy water and a cookie , and a woman said , anyone ever told you that you look like that mia hamm girl \? really \? and that s a good thing why \? because she s rich really \? real rich although a group of advertising executives voted her the 10thbest endorser of products among athletes in the 20th century , hamm is hardly one of the world s highestpaid soccer players she and other wusa stars took a pay cut this season to 60 , 000 from 85 , 000 to help ease the fledgling league s finances david beckham makes twice that much in a week for manchester united i never heard that one before , hamm said , remembering the store encounter with a laugh i thought she would say beautiful , talented , smart , funny but no , real rich early promise , then troubles
following are excerpts from a questionandanswer session between president bush and reporters at the white house yesterday , and from the nbc news program meet the press yesterday with tim russert , the host , and the syrian deputy ambassador to the united states , imad moustapha , as recorded by federal news service inc full transcripts are at nytimescom iraq president s news conference q secretary rumsfeld said today he thinks syria is harboring some iraqi leadership could syria take military action \? president bush no , syria just needs to cooperate with us i made that clear on friday i will , if need be , reiterate it today the syrian government needs to cooperate with the united states and our coalition partners and not harbor any baathists , any military officials , any people who need to be held to account for their tenure during what we are learning more and more about it was one of the most horrendous governments ever q given the success of the american military forces , what is the message to people like in syria , north korea \? a i think that people have got to know that we are serious about stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction , and that each situation requires a different response but we are making good progress in north korea we have made it clear that we think that the best way to deal with their proliferation is through a multinational forum it looks like that might be coming to fruition that s very good news for the people in the far east who are concerned about north korea and their willingness to develop nuclear weapons we 're making progress on all fronts q do you think there are weapons of mass destruction in syria \? a i think that we believe there are chemical weapons in syria , for example , and we will each situation will require a different response , and of course we 're first things first we 're here in iraq now , and the second thing about syria is that we expect cooperation and i'm hopeful we 'll receive cooperation syrian ambassador s comments mr moustapha let me tell you this today every day you will have new reports against syria , accusing syria of things it has not done it s not about what syria has done it s about how they are trying to portray syria here , but certain groups and individuals in washington and of course happily i can say that lots of senior people in this administration , from the state department and senior officials at the cia , are very unhappy about this campaign against syria mr russert so no member of the saddam hussein regime fled into syria \? a i mean by just trying to say no , i am giving credit to those accusations ca n't we say that it s not about the daily press release against syria there s something more sinister behind this \? q but that s a very specific question a yes , the answer is no q the ambassador to the united states from iraq , mohammed aldouri , is now in syria he flew there a probably if i am not wrong , i mean it s none of my business , but he left new york airport , he went to paris , and then probably he went somewhere else i have to explain this to you we do not require visas from any single arab nationals , so any arab from morocco , from kuwait he can go to syria this is a very different story q let me show you on the screen exactly your policy here it says syria has long maintained one of the most liberal entry policies that have been released anyone holding a passport from any arab country can enter or leave if anyone is going , it s beyond our control as the government said , the spokesman for the foreign ministry we have long borders with iraq , and we ca n't put a policeman on every single meter you heard secretary rumsfeld say specifically that senior members of the regime are in syria , that syrian fighters have gone to iraq and have been killed there , and that syria is harboring terrorists from hezbollah and hamas what is your response to that \? a well , the response , sir , is very easy first , you have a huge us army in iraq that has secured iraqi western borders , and you are controlling the situation there if you have problems , please let your us army deal with these problems let me say this it s about divergence of attention the chaos and the lawlessness and the catastrophe , the human catastrophes that are taking place in iraq today are really embarrassing lots of people in this administration and the only way to deal with them is to divert attention and they will keep on doing this and accusing syria of things that syria is not doing , just to divert attention please , let us go to the basics and understand what is going on here q but you also saw the pictures of celebration , of iraqi children hugging and kissing us marines , flowers , tearing down saddam s statue what does that mean to you \? if in your mind the war is so wrong , then why are the iraqi people so happy \? a you want the answer \? all right , it s a very simple and straightforward answer look , how can the iraqi people , decent people , be celebrating when their historic capital has been bombarded with b2 s and tomahawks and missiles for 15 days , and huge casualties , civilian casualties , have been inflicted , and then decent people were really at their homes \? what happened is people who were looting , and thieves and hooligans , once they receive the approvement from the press , they will just draw the v sign and then continue their looting yesterday , decent people from baghdad that were very angry came out , and they had their first expression of what they thought of the us troops i saw it on cnn they were shouting decent people from baghdad were not looters they were shouting , yankees , go home q so the iraqi people have not been liberated \? they do not have more freedom now \?
lee r raymond made more money last year than all but a few other chief executives , but nobody would know it by looking at the executive pay table that exxon mobil , mr raymond s company , is to publish later this month since the start of 2002 , philip j purcell of morgan stanley , frederick w smith of fedex and dozens of other executives also made millions of dollars each that do not appear in the summary of their compensation and none of their companies were violating the securities and exchange commission s rules about pay disclosure all of these executives sold large piles of their companies' shares in 2002 , transactions that are obscured from the view of many investors even though stock now constitutes the crux of executive pay as it has for more than a decade the sale of shares does not appear in companies' annual listing of executive pay as a result , pay experts say , the picture of compensation that appears in corporate proxy statements is often incomplete , excluding important information about executives' confidence in their own companies stock sales are instead relegated to a document known as the form 4 , which , unlike a company s proxy statement , is usually not available on the web site of the sec the most significant thing to add to the proxy would be stock sales and purchases , said ira t kay , the director of the compensation practice at watson wyatt company , which helps companies set pay what did they do with the shares \? that s always the big thing in 2002 and the first part of this year , insiders , who are mainly executives and members of corporate boards , sharply curtailed their selling of company stock for the first time since 1997 , according to thomson financial , a research company they sold 118 million shares last year , down about 28 percent from both 2000 and 2001 insiders , however , were not wildly bullish last year they increased their buying only modestly to 542 million shares , up 13 percent from 2001 suggesting that many executives did not see their own stock as undervalued despite the market s slump people think the worst is over , said lon gerber , the director of insider research at thomson but they do n't see a catalyst that is going to cause things to turn around even in a slow year for insider selling , some executives did well leading the sellers among companies in the standard poor s 100stock index , bill gates , microsoft s chairman , sold 26 billion worth of stock between the start of 2002 and midmarch of this year two other microsoft insiders ranked second and third roger a enrico , the retired chief executive of pepsico who will retire from its board this year , was fourth the rest of the top 50 included numerous officials from microsoft , goldman sachs , lehman brothers and morgan stanley , as well as gary w loveman , the chief of harrah s entertainment , and august a busch iii , chairman of anheuserbusch pay experts say stock sales should be considered separately from salary , bonus and other annual executive pay executives typically are awarded shares over many years , and sale proceeds are a part of longterm , rather than a single year s , pay but the timing of sales and the gains from them are crucial to understanding executives' overall pay , as well as their own estimate of their company s prospects , experts add it s important to know how much executives are dumping , said judith fischer , managing director of executive compensation advisory services , a research company in alexandria , va it s a significant statement by the executives of their confidence in the company at many of the companies that have come under government investigation , executives made millions of dollars selling shares before they began to sink richard m scrushy , the former chief executive of healthsouth , for example , made more than 50 million selling healthsouth stock last year since the sales , federal regulators have charged mr scrushy and the company with accounting fraud and healthsouth s stock has collapsed executives on the list of the s p 100 s biggest sellers stressed that they remained confident about the future in some cases , they were selling shares they owned for years mr raymond of exxon mobil still owns 2 million shares of company stock , having sold about 800 , 000 shares since the start of 2002 , said tom cirigliano , a spokesman the sarbanesoxley act , passed by congress last summer amid a spate of corporate scandals , will make information on insider selling more accessible but finding the data will still be complicated senior executives and directors already file a form 4 with the sec whenever they sell company stock investment research companies collect the data and sell it for a fee , sometimes 15 a form , while yahoo publishes a list albeit often incomplete of the trades on the internet sarbanesoxley will require companies to file the forms electronically starting this summer , and the sec will make the forms available on the internet to get a complete picture , however , investors must do much more than read the executive pay section of the proxy \( proxies list the exercising of stock options , but not whether executives then sold the shares they received \)
washington , march 21 as one of 99 senators who voted on thursday to commend president bush for his leadership on iraq , tim johnson , democrat of south dakota , wanted the troops to know that we are proud of our military , proud of their capability and confident that they will win this war mr johnson s pride , though , is tinged with a father s fear he is the lone member of the senate and possibly the only member of congress whose child is helping in the fighting in iraq mr johnson s son brooks , 31 , is a sergeant in the 101st airborne division , in a helicopter assault unit that , the last the senator knew , was stationed in kuwait , awaiting orders last fall , the senator voted to give the president authority to wage war with iraq , a decision that effectively put his son in the risky spot today before the bombing of baghdad began , the sergeant sent his father an email message to say that he s doing fine , he s intensely busy , he has not been getting a lot of sleep , the senator said by thursday , mr johnson was ensconced in his office , glued to a television set and contemplating though not secondguessing , he said his decision last fall i emailed back and forth with my son prior to that vote , said mr johnson , who has since been critical of mr bush s diplomacy brooks s conclusion was , 'dad , i 'll do the best job i can as a soldier , and your job is to do the best job you can as a senator for our country' members of congress with children in the military have been much more of a rarity since the demise of the draft those whose sons and daughters enlist , as did sergeant johnson , are rarer still two house members have children who joined as officers , according to a survey critics of the war say armed conflict might be less likely if the politicians who made the decisions to commit troops put their own sons and daughters at risk , an argument put forth by representative charles b rangel , democrat of manhattan , when he introduced legislation to revive the draft some scholars say war itself might be waged differently if the children of the elite were involved when you have the leadership of the country not having its children in the ranks , i think that sends a subliminal message to society that these wars cannot take casualties , said charles c moskos , a professor of sociology at northwestern university who specializes in the military professor moskos noted the difference between today and decades past was that all of the kennedy brothers served , none of the kennedy cousins served mark shields , the television commentator , surveyed all 535 members of congress in the fall he found that senator johnson was the only one who had a son or daughter who had enlisted in the military it s unthinkable , said mr shields , adding that the draft had prompted him to enlist in the marines as a young man those in power are totally divorced from those at peril mr shields turned up two lawmakers whose children began their careers as officers , representative ike skelton , democrat of missouri , who through a spokesman declined to talk about his family , and representative duncan l hunter , the california republican who is chairman the house armed services committee mr hunter s son duncan duane , 26 , is a second lieutenant in the marines undergoing artillery training at fort sill , okla , mr hunter s office said since the survey , representative marilyn musgrave , a freshman republican from colorado , has joined congress her youngest son , john , 22 , is an enlisted sailor who works as a technician on a submarine tender in the mediterranean given the opportunity , ms musgrave said , she , too , would have voted for the war resolution in october recently , she added , she approached a colleague who was speaking on the house floor in opposition to the war i told her , 'i have a son in the military and i think your timing is lousy , ' ms musgrave recalled it becomes very personal when it s your son in mr johnson s case , the personal has at times become political in his reelection campaign last year the national republican senatorial committee ran an advertisement that criticized mr johnson for voting against some military programs democrats responded by noting that sergeant johnson was then in afghanistan the iraqi war is sergeant johnson s fourth in five years he also fought in kosovo and bosnia the senator said that he had tried to separate personal concern from public policy , and that despite the classified war briefings he receives along with other members of the senate , he has never used those channels to gain information about the safety or whereabouts of his son the last thing brooks needs , mr johnson said , is a senator father bothering his commanding officer photo staff sgt brooks johnson , right , a son of senator tim johnson , in kandahar , afghanistan , in march 2002 with a member of his squad from the 101st airborne division the sergeant was last reported in kuwait

toulouse , france everybody agrees that the a380 is a whale of a plane , but that may in fact be the problem the whaleness , that is the superjumbo a380 , scheduled for commercial service in early 2006 and currently represented at the airbus headquarters here as a lifesize mockup , is a tubby behemoth of a plane that looks like it might have easily digested both a 747 and a 737 for lunch , with plenty of room left for dessert in a month or so , ships and trucks will start arriving at the sprawling a380 assembly plant here carrying wings , fuselages and engines made elsewhere in europe airbus will then begin putting together the huge new jetliner , for which the company says it already has 129 orders \( retail price 270 million each \) last week , airbus invited reporters to its headquarters for an update on the progress of the plane , as well as a look at the mockup and the new assembly line suffice to say that the a380 is really , really big , even in comparison with the current jumbo of the sky , the boeing 747 , first introduced in the 1970 s the a380 has a wing span of 261 feet , 50 feet longer than the 747 because its fuselage is designed with two full decks from fore to aft , it also has 49 percent more floor space than a 747 that means it will hold a lot more passengers airbus promotes the a380 as having a capacity of 555 passengers that s 139 more passengers than the 747 carries but airbus executives concede that the a380 will actually be able to carry more than 800 passengers , if an airline decides to really pack them in how this airplane is going to be configured with seats once it takes to the skies in 2006 is one of the mysteries of the a380 program another is whether the world s major airports will be prepared to handle the plane for airports , preparing for the a380 requires substantial modifications to runways , taxiways and terminal gates for example , baa , the company that operates heathrow international airport in london , says it will spend more than 750 million over the next 10 years to accommodate the a380 at heathrow , where baa estimates the plane will account for about one in every eight flights by 2016 boeing 747 s , which the airbus believes will be rendered obsolete by the a380 , now account for one in nine heathrow flights as this plane nears introduction in a little over two years , there will be plenty of opportunities for the news media to evaluate the potentially profound changes in longhaul air service not to mention the implications for airbus s rival boeing that are posed by the a380 for me , a person whose main interest in aviation is having a comfortable place to sit , i have to say i fixed with some horror on that little figure of 800 or more potential passengers even at the 555 passenger figure airbus likes to use , i still shudder at the thought of being the middle cow in a fiveacross row in the cattle car luckily , at lunch at the airbus headquarters last week , i found myself sitting next to the only major airline executive present , richard branson , the chairman of virgin atlantic , an airlines that spends a lot of time thinking about how to balance revenue with passenger comfort sir richard is an affable guy who loves to talk , so i figured it was going to be a cinch to get him to spill the beans on what virgin s version of the a380 will look like in terms of seating virgin has ordered six a380 s ten commercial airlines \( as well a cargo carrier , fedex \) have so far placed orders for 129 of the a380 s the biggest customers to date are emirates \( 41 planes \) , lufthansa \( 15 \) , qantas airways \( 12 \) , and air france and singapore airlines \( 10 each \) none of the airlines that have discussed their likely use of the plane have suggested they plan on flying more than 555 seats , and several have hinted they hope to use the airplane s space to introduce new passenger amenities , like walkup lounges and perhaps dutyfree shops , even in coach but you never know virgin s sir richard warmed to the subject quickly he said virgin planned to operate its a380 s with a maximum of 524 seats in three classes these are its highly regarded businessclass cabin , called upper class suites its premium economy class cabin , which provides more legroom and better service at a higher price than standard coach and , of course , its lowestpriced coach cabin all that extra space , certainly gives you the opportunity to do innovative things in the cabin , he said , adding , the challenge is how do you do economy class , how do you configure it \? among the innovations to consider in any move to make the back of the plane a more comfortable place , he said , was a better use of the space taken up by the galleys for food preparation he began to discuss an idea for inflight selfservice food counters , and the notion that reducing the need for galleys would provide the space to allow passengers to amble about and perhaps get their own meals in coach , cafeteriastyle you want to elaborate on that \? i asked he evidently did , and would have , except that paul moore , virgin s cordial director for corporate affairs , shot him a stricken look from down the table sir richard promptly clammed up sorry , he said got to wait on that on the road appears each tuesday drawing \( drawing by david suter \)
documentaries commanded an extraordinary amount of attention this year , from andrew jarecki s capturing the friedmans , first shown at at the sundance film festival in january , to nathaniel kahn s my architect , a surprising commercial success that opened in november at film forum in manhattan and continues to draw large crowds but the documentary or , as it is now fashionable to call it , the nonfiction film has increasingly become a genre divided against itself on one side of the aesthetic gulf are those filmmakers , like france s nicolas philibert \( whose to be and to have is in its fourth month at the cinema village \) and new york s jennifer dworkin \( whose love and diane played at film forum this spring \) who are the heirs of the cin ma v rit movement of the 60 s and 70 s these directors use the tiny new video cameras just as their forebears jean rouch , the maysles brothers , frederick wiseman and many others used the portable 16millimeter equipment that had just become available their intent is to record reality with as little intervention as possible , to confront the spectator with a more or less unvarnished truth that asks viewers to draw their own conclusions massing on the other side of the chasm are filmmakers who do not hesitate to use every rhetorical device available to them voiceover narration , musical accompaniment , distorting lenses , the elaborate visual effects and complex editing patterns made possible by the new digital editing technology to shape their raw material into an argued , structured piece leading this group is errol morris , the bostonbased director of gates of heaven and the thin blue line , whose film the fog of war opened earlier this month pointing up the idealism of the v rit directors , with their belief that objectivity is still an achievable goal in a postmodern world , the manipulators embrace and emphasize the artificiality of their approach there is no reality to be seized , they suggest , but only subjectivities to be represented the year has seen its share of triumph on both sides for the realists , there is probably no purer film than mr philibert s , a resolutely lowkey study of a gifted grade school teacher working with children in the mountainous region of the auvergne as the teacher , georges lopez , attends to the needs of his charges , who range in age from 4 to 11 , mr philibert looks on with a quiet attentiveness though the film does contain a brief interview with the teacher that fills in some details of his past , to be and to have takes place almost entirely in the present tense , asking us to witness events as they unfold what we wish to make of them is left up to us , although mr philibert s respect for his subject is always evident compare this to mr morris s film , which presents its subject , robert s mcnamara , in an anonymous studio mr mcnamara speaks straight into the camera , as if he wished to talk directly with his listeners , but mr morris will have none of this the film is full of interventions , ranging from questions hurled by an unseen person \( presumably , mr morris \) to elaborate computer animation effects , used at one distracting moment to depict the atomic bombing of japan the effect is one of a bizarre struggle between observer and observed , as if the two men were armwrestling for authorship rights while mr mcnamara adapts a selfserving pose of perfect candor and awshucks guilelessness , mr morris counters with a slyly distanced style , dropping in sarcastic asides \( doomladen music cues or cutaways to apocalyptic newsreel footage \) that chisel at mr mcnamara s authority without overtly challenging anything he has to say though the occasional documentary still appears as photographed on 35millimeter film like jacques perrin s hit , the nature study winged migration video has come to dominate the field tape is far cheaper than film , both in the shooting and the processing , which allows v rit filmmakers like ms dworkin , carles bosch and jos mar a dom nech \( balseros \) and rebecca cammisa and rob fruchtman \( sister helen \) to distill their work from hundreds of hours of videotape , where earlier documentarians \( like robert flaherty in his pioneering 1922 nanook of the north \) had to confine their observations to 10minute takes , which often meant staging events for the camera the revolution will not be televised , an amazing insider account of the 2002 attempted coup against the venezuelan president hugo chavez , was made possible because an irish news crew happened to be on the spot , armed with plenty of blank cassettes in bus 174 , a study of a bus hijacking in rio de janeiro in 2000 , the directors felipe lacerda and jos padilha mold their film around the many hours of live coverage shot by local television stations the banalization of video technology , its spread throughout the culture as a surveillance device \( some of the most striking moments in bus 174 come from scenes taken by traffic control cameras \) and its incorporation into the daily lives of private individuals \( thanks to the new , pockedsized digital video cameras \) have created a fresh source for documentary images no film has yet made a more dramatic use of home video material than andrew jarecki s capturing the friedmans , in which the implosion of a middleclass long island family \( a father and son have been accused of child molestation \) is portrayed through startlingly intimate home videos of family arguments and private breakdowns a tragic parody of reality tv , capturing the friedmans is one of the year s documentary hits , taking in 37 million at the box office the film suggests that americans have become their own big brothers , ruthlessly cataloging their own failures and indiscretions the paranoid future imagined by fritz lang in his 1960 the thousand eyes of dr mabuse \( the eyes are video cameras hidden in a hotel , which the master criminal mabuse uses to observe and control his victims \) has already arrived and perhaps been surpassed there is no reason to hide the spying lenses they are out in the open , acknowledged and even willingly introduced into the most personal spaces nathaniel kahn s my architect has become a sleeper hit in the weeks since it opened at film forum , with the highest openingweek gross in the theater s history perhaps its power is due to its unselfconscious combination of the two currently dominant documentary styles the picture is at once an oldfashioned , pbsstyle educational film about the work of the great architect louis kahn , and an agonized psychodrama staged by and starring his son , nathaniel the manipulated , rhetorical side of the film uses authoritative voiceovers and expert witnesses , old television clips and film of louis kahn taken for other documentaries the open , realist side uses videotape to portray nathaniel s subjective experience of his father s neglect mr kahn does not reconcile the two styles so much as he productively rams them together the cool , institutional tone of the sections devoted to louis is undermined by the undisguised amateurishness and awkwardness of the nathaniel scenes , yielding the sense of a sleek , manufactured reality colliding with a raw and bleeding one and it is there that the documentary exists in this year of 2003 , in the intersection of the made and the found photos scenes from my architect the film s director , nathaniel kahn , with his father , louis kahn , around 1970 , far left , and the capital building louis kahn designed for dhaka , bangladesh \( photos by louis kahn project inc harriet pattison louis kahn project inc far left \)
paul anka has been serenading audiences across the globe since the 1950 s , when he first sang diana , about his crush on his babysitter his touring schedule is relentless , with stops over the past few months in japan and the mgm grand casino in las vegas but on april 12 , after recent performances in las vegas and at several florida sites , mr anka will appear at a more unprepossessing venue washington township high school , in the middle of suburban gloucester county , home of the washington township center for the performing arts mr anka is far from the only big name to appear recently at the washington township center , which has 2 , 500 seats , comparable to many casino showrooms last month , bb king , david copperfield , and frankie valli and the four seasons also performed there over the past two years , willie nelson , kenny rogers , trisha yearwood , the comics wayne brady and george carlin , and barry manilow have given shows at the high school hall yet washington township s high school is just one of a few in southern new jersey that are presenting highgloss acts the metropolitan opera , as well as brenda lee and tammy wynette , have played middle township high school in cape may court house bill cosby will be coming to the new 1 , 500seat lenape regional performing arts center at cherokee high school in medford , burlington county , this summer david bromberg will be part of the spring series at williamstown high school s 1 , 100seat theater we saw the opportunity to make a wonderful cultural thing for the community here , said vincent marini , producing artistic director of the lenape center , which opened in the fall of 2001 yes , this is a high school theater , but it was wonderfully built and it is one of the premiere venues in the region why not use it for more \? during the school year , the lenape center dedicates its space to productions from cherokee and the other two high schools in the district , shawnee and lenape it books outside acts only in the summer middle township mostly does the same but williamstown and washington township book bigname acts throughout the year washington township even has a fulltime booking agent , rebecca keith , on staff , although she is currently on maternity leave we view this as an alternative revenue source for the school , but even if it only breaks even or loses a little bit , it is a wonderful experience for students to see how a theater works , said thomas j flemming , the washington township school superintendent mr flemming said that when the high school , the largest in southern new jersey with over 3 , 000 students , was adding the auditorium in 1995 , the district wanted to make it more of a community gathering place originally , the idea was to have more community theater , dance and music groups use it , but that still left a lot of time idle then we saw that all the stars could be aligned for us , he said we are close , but not too close , to philadelphia we have ample free parking and good roads nearby and there are a lot of acts that ca n't fill the big arenas in philadelphia that we could accommodate mr flemming also said that the stagehands union in the philadelphia area agreed to use students in an internship program in exchange for setting up the shows , which beefed up the school s arts program middle township high school , which built its theater in 1992 , was the first to see the possibilities in booking its hall an administrator there had a connection to the metropolitan opera and arranged for the company to put on productions of the barber of seville and other operas over the next several summers although there was little call for more than community theater in the winter , district officials realized that the theater , with 900 seats , could become a summer diversion for the tens of thousands who go to the cape may county resorts when school is closed it s not hard to sell out 900 seats when the shore is packed , said richard ludwig , who teaches performing arts during the school year , but also books and oversees the theater we 've had everything from jazz like milt hinton and maynard ferguson to the vienna boys choir to brenda lee to dance festivals we have even put our own big band together since so many musicians summer at the shore we charge 5 for their concerts and sell out all the time the people who run these theaters say their success rests in part in the fact that the theaters are relatively new , built on land that was previously part of the schools' outdoor grounds , or in the case of williamstown , conceived as part of a new high school all the theaters have the modern lighting and sound systems that bigname acts require they are also just far enough off the track between new york , philadelphia and atlantic city to pull in audiences who may not travel to those cities but they are not so far off the track that they cannot be filled profits are modest for the schools , officials say we use this as a way to bring the arts into the community , and if we make some money to maintain the theater , that is a bonus , said jim mcaloon , coordinator for the williamstown theater , which opened in 2000 , and also chairman of the school s fine and performing arts department on a technical and artistic level , our students get to see all the hookups and setups of a theatrical performance , and get to usher and meet some of the performers if you are trying to make a lot of money doing this , you might well be disappointed none of the high schools in north or central new jersey have built theaters on the scale of the ones in the south lenape s mr marini said that while some administrators from those areas have called to ask about what he does , none seemed ready to follow his lead they would face more competition , he said , from major theaters in that area , like the paper mill in millburn , and also from the new jersey performing arts center in newark there is little to compare with that in south jersey , he said the tweeter center in camden , he pointed out , is generally a summer venue and , in any case , tends to book rock acts that would not be suitable for a high school stage while atlantic city casinos may seem like big competition , in fact they have created opportunities because performers know the area and its demographics well , and understand that they will have an audience also , the high school shows can often be scheduled between performances at the casinos , allowing the entertainers to use their time more efficiently mr cosby , for example , will appear at lenape in between dates at the new borgata hotel and casino performers can be skeptical at first doing this , but once they see the theater , they are attracted , said mr marini , who graduated from cherokee high school in 1993 , and studied theater at new york university some performers , he said , like the idea of performing at a school mr cosby , he said , asked for a school sweatshirt as a souvenir linda eder , who appeared on broadway in jekyll hyde , performed at the lenape center last summer and is returning on sept 13 it was n't easy convincing us to come there , said dave hart , her manager , who said that before committing to playing there he asked for extensive photographs of the stage and for technical information about the theater linda does a sophisticated show you think of an old highschool auditorium as something with no windows , hot and sweaty and with floorboards that creak all the time , he continued lenape is not at all that it is extremely sound technically mr hart , whose agency group also represents betty buckley , tom wopat , kristen chenoweth and hal linden , added i would n't hesitate to have any of those people perform there photos high schools in southern new jersey with new theaters including washington township , top left , and middle township , top are booking big acts , like paul anka and bill cosby mr cosby

trenton , dec 18 the district attorney in northampton county , pa , named charles cullen on thursday as a suspect in the death of a 78yearold patient whose end may have been hastened by an overdose of the same heart medication that mr cullen is accused of using to kill a new jersey priest last june mr cullen , 43 , has confessed to killing as many as 40 patients during his nursing career , and is being held in a psychiatric center near trenton john morganelli , the district attorney , said at a news conference in easton , pa , that more than 150 other deaths that occurred at easton hospital during mr cullen s tenure there would be reexamined , and that bodies would be exhumed if the investigation suggested a reason most will probably be found to be unconnected to mr cullen , mr morganelli said but he added , we 're trying to be broad here so that everyone that had a loved one in that hospital can be assured that their case will be looked at the second death officially tied to mr cullen came to light after a review of records at easton hospital disclosed that the autopsy performed on ottomar a schramm noted an excess of the heart drug digoxin as a contributing condition to his death in december 1998 , at age 78 the death had been ascribed to natural causes linked to mr schramm s several illnesses , and was one of several deaths being reviewed after a tip led the pennsylvania state police to begin its own investigation in lehigh and northampton counties six weeks ago but after learning that mr cullen was charged on monday in somerville , nj , with administering a lethal dose of digoxin to the very rev florian j gall in june , mr morganelli said that mr schramm s case was singled out , and after more investigation , the cause of death was changed from indeterminate causes to homicide mr cullen was working at easton hospital between november 1998 through march of 1999 , mr morganelli said therefore , i consider charles cullen a suspect relative to the death of ottomar a schramm details about mr cullen s habits , as they have emerged in court documents and police reports , suggest he led a lonely life of strange , sometimes disturbing behavior in 1993 , he pleaded guilty to trespassing after breaking into the house of a colleague , michelle tomlinson , whom he had once taken on a date mr cullen claimed he had broken in to check on ms tomlinson because he thought she might try to commit suicide when he pleaded guilty , he defended his actions , telling the judge , i was concerned for her wellbeing and her safety , your honor , and i have never in my life ever intentionally tried to inflict any distress or harm on anyone investigators from the pennsylvania state police were looking into mr cullen s performance at several hospitals and a nursing home in the state , mr morganelli said , adding that a decision on charges would be made in the next few days mr cullen s public defender in new jersey , johnnie mask , said on wednesday that mr cullen might seek to avoid the death penalty in new jersey by offering to make a full accounting of his crimes , perhaps by looking through photo albums to refresh his memory committing to such a proposal so early in the process was quickly rejected by the somerset county prosecutor , wayne j forrest , and by mr morganelli basically , we handle our things on our end , not based on what the defense lawyers are saying , mr morganelli said i do n't anticipate making any types of deals with any lawyers at this point while the legal noose around mr cullen tightened , the families of hundreds more patients who died at the hospitals that once employed mr cullen began demanding assurances that their family members were not among the murdered it was just such a quest that prompted father gall s family to plan a suit against the somerset medical center and perhaps other hospitals , said their lawyer , michael j barrett of woodbridge the family is not interested in suing for damages , mr barrett said they are more interested at the moment in finding out what happened , and they have particular concerns about this individual s background , about what kind of checking into his background the somerset hospital did prior to his hiring mr cullen was fired from at least 5 of the 10 medical facilities for which he worked yet no serious complaints to the nursing licensing boards in new jersey or pennsylvania were made , and none of the hospitals that hired him admit to knowing of his spotty record anthony j macri , a denville , nj , lawyer , who represents three families who plan to sue several institutions over their failure to sound the alarm on mr cullen , said the hospitals' concern over being sued if they passed on unfavorable information about a job applicant was baseless , since telling the truth is not defamatory a fear of defamation should never override their obligation to be concerned first about their patients , he said
crew members have told investigators that the ranking officer of the staten island ferry that crashed on wednesday apparently was not in the pilot house as it approached its dock , in violation of city procedures , according to two officials with knowledge of the investigation one of the officials said that the officer , capt michael j gansas , apparently arrived at the controls sometime before the boat hit the pier , and realized that the ferry s pilot , assistant capt richard j smith , had either passed out or had somehow lost control of the boat meanwhile , federal investigators said they had determined that the ferry was traveling at its cruising speed , 17 miles per hour , on impact , and had not sped up or slowed as it approached the st george terminal on staten island the finding suggested that there was some period of time during which crew members should have noticed that the boat was not slowing normally one crew member explicitly told investigators that captain gansas was not alongside captain smith as the boat neared the dock , according to one official with knowledge of the inquiry it is becoming increasingly clear he was not where he was supposed to be , another official said as detectives , prosecutors with the staten island district attorney s office and federal officials focused on those final minutes , their investigation moved ahead on several fronts in trying to explain the crash , which killed 10 people , the deadliest mass transit accident in the city in more than 70 years investigators with the national transportation safety board said that the boat , the andrew j barberi , appeared to have no mechanical problems and that the wind and waves , while high , were not dangerous enough to have halted ferry service that afternoon tests found that captain gansas , 38 , and five other crew members had no alcohol in their systems similar tests showed that captain smith , 55 , had neither alcohol nor illegal drugs in his system but ellen g engleman , the chairwoman of the safety board , said it would issue a subpoena for more blood and urine samples to determine whether captain smith had used any prescription drugs police officials have said that captain smith , who tried to kill himself after the crash and remains hospitalized in critical condition , told a police officer that he had high blood pressure and had taken medication for it wednesday morning before reporting for work he said he remembered leaving manhattan for the crossing to staten island but had blacked out sometime during the journey ms engleman said that captain gansas , who is now represented by a lawyer , has agreed to be interviewed by federal investigators next tuesday his lawyer , catherine m foti , would not comment on the investigation but released a statement calling the crash a terrible tragedy and adding that captain gansas' thoughts and prayers are with the families of all those affected by this unfortunate accident captain smith , who slashed his wrists and shot himself with a highpowered pellet gun , remained unable to speak yesterday , and ms engleman said he would be interviewed as soon as it was medically prudent questioning of the two men will focus particularly on what happened as the boat passed a buoy , sometimes called the little lighthouse , that sits about a half mile away from the st george terminal and marks the point at which the 3 , 300ton ferry , carrying hundreds of passengers , should have begun slowing for its approach to the concrete piers traveling at 17 miles per hour , the boat could have covered the final distance from the buoy to the pier in a little less than two minutes it remained unclear yesterday at what point in the approach captain gansas or other crew members noticed the excessive speed and the fact that the boat was several hundred feet off course a mate or deckhand often serves as lookout it also remained unclear whether any other crew members were in the pilot house with captain smith not only during the approach but at any point during the crossing ms engleman would not discuss the specifics of the interviews conducted so far she said only that investigators had received conflicting accounts of what had taken place in and near the pilot house federal investigators began interviewing crew members and deckhands yesterday and said their goal was eventually to assemble a detailed 72hour history of the operations of the ferry leading up to the crash , which tore a huge gash in the ferry s starboard side above the waterline the full investigation could take up to a year , officials said as investigators prepared to work through the weekend , they said the andrew j barberi would be towed today to the brooklyn navy yard , where it will undergo more extensive inspection ms engleman said mechanical and engineering problems were not being ruled out as factors , though there initially appeared to be none we have inspected the bridge control , she said nothing appears to be out of order the coast guard said that the last quarterly inspections of the ferry were on april 17 and july 25 , and that the boat was found to be in working order ms engleman added that the weather conditions were also still part of the investigation the winds did reach 37 miles per hour just before the crash , she said but the focus of the investigation seemed to be narrowing already to captain smith s physical condition and the roles of captain gansas and the other crew members city officials said that written regulations address the roles of the crew members at various points during crossings , and that the captain is required to be with the pilot during docking but ferry crew members said yesterday that on some ferries , the officer not at the wheel goes to the other end of the boat , to the other pilot house there , to prepare for the journey in the opposite direction , and the mate or deckhand leaves the pilot house to prepare for unloading passengers , leaving the pilot alone at the wheel as to captain smith s physical condition , investigators want to learn if he was taking any prescription medications like those used to treat high blood pressure or heart ailments several years ago , the coast guard published guidelines for doctors who perform physical examinations for the licensing of boat pilots , and listed high blood pressure among the potentially disqualifying conditions doctors say some drugs for high blood pressure can , in some cases , cause dizziness or blackouts yesterday , questions were also asked about whether the passengers aboard the ferry on the day of the accident were given adequate warning of an impending crash by the crew passengers reported that there were no warnings or whistles , ms engleman said , but she added that in interviews with deckhands , some said they saw that the crash was about to occur and began warning passengers to move back photo the damaged areas of the andrew j barberi were covered yesterday as another ferry approached the st george terminal on staten island \( photo by associated press \) \( pg b4 \)

nbc already pays the highest prices in television for two of its longrunning hit shows , friends and er now , nbc faces an earlierthanexpected renegotiation of another cornerstone of its toprated lineup its successful franchise of three law order dramas universal television , the studio that produces the law order shows , is planning to bundle all three into one deal , even though two of the shows have two seasons left on their current contracts universal wants to have the settlement wrapped up by december and the total price tag universal executives are aiming to reach more than 550 million a year would make the deal the most lucrative entertainment agreement in television history universal appears to have powerful leverage , making its demands more than just the usual negotiating posturing the three series law order , law order special victims unit and law order criminal intent all win their respective time slots and lead nbc to ratings victories on the nights they are broadcast and universal has one more chip to throw on the table dick wolf , the creator of the franchise , is creating a fourth law order edition for the fall of 2004 if nbc balks at universal s demands , the studio and mr wolf could shop the new show \( without the law order prefix \) to another network in a development that only adds to the backstage drama of this negotiation , nbc has one option to avoid having to write that gargantuan check to another company buy universal television first nbc and its parent , general electric , are among the bidders for the entertainment assets now being peddled by universal s debtridden parent , vivendi universal in 1998 , nbc set the previous record price for television shows by paying more than 280 million a year at 13 million an episode to warner brothers to renew er the 550 millionplus price for the troika of law order shows , as calculated by senior executives involved in the negotiations , would come from a fee of about 8 million an episode for the 70 to 72 episodes produced annually a projected threeyear deal at that level would cost nbc in excess of 16 billion that total will not include whatever nbc pays for the fourth law order edition mr wolf declined requests for an interview but according to executives aware of mr wolf s plans , the new law order will contain many elements common to the other three it will be a crime drama set in new york , with a multicharacter cast and stories derived from reallife incidents the one wrinkle this show will concentrate more on the court side of the drama and less on the police side universal executives said the new edition , which they refer to simply as four , also may be attractive to nbc or another network because mr wolf plans to use a rotating repertory company of actors some of the biggest actors in new york are interested because they would not have to appear every week , said david kissinger , the president of universal television production but universal will not let the fourth edition go forward before a deal is made to extend the other three , several universal executives said they added that the company is confident another network will step up and buy the special victims unit edition , the one law order show entering the final season of its existing deal , should nbc pass so far , the real negotiation has not started , said david goldhill , the president of universal television nbc executives declined to comment on any aspect of the law order situation but nbc does have some negotiating points in its favor network executives could argue , with some justification , that the network has contributed significantly to the success of the threepart franchise with its cast suggestions , its publicity and promotion the network could also point out that while mr wolf has developed shows for other networks like dragnet on abc , feds on cbs and new york undercover on fox only on nbc have his shows become powerhouses normally , a network facing this kind of negotiation will argue that a show s demands are excessive because it is getting old and fading in popularity but the law order shows display no such weakness the original law order has run for 13 years , and remains unassailable on wednesday nights at 10 the youngest of the three shows , criminal intent , has in two years become a hit on sunday nights at 9 svu has dominated on friday nights at 10 for four years , and this coming season nbc has removed one edition of dateline so the show can run on tuesday nights at 10 nbc will be able squeeze more advertising revenue out of svu as a tuesday night entry than it could on friday but if the show grows in popularity on tuesday , universal will have an even stronger argument for a huge bump in the license fee universal executives did not disclose what nbc is currently paying in fees for the shows except to say that other drama series with lower ratings get higher fees of the original law order , mr kissinger said , nbc has it at a fantastic bargain
silly billy may be the bestknown children s party clown in new york city so naturally andrew jarecki wanted to include him in the lighthearted documentary he was making about clowns but as he began to interview david friedman , who performs as silly billy , mr jarecki s first reaction was what makes this clown so angry \? before long , mr jarecki was on the trail of the altogether different story , tragic not comic , that would become capturing the friedmans , which won the grand jury prize at the sundance film festival in january and opens in new york on friday and nationally in june simultaneously earnest and pulpy , raising as many questions as it answers , this riveting documentary reexamines the charges of child molestation that resulted in prison for david friedman s father and youngest brother this may seem familiar , the routine stuff of television shows like 48 hours or hbo s america undercover series \( indeed , hbo has bought capturing the friedmans and plans to show it next year \) but the friedman story is so juicy and is getting so much attention partly because it took place not in a trailer park but in great neck , ny , the affluent long island suburb usually associated with upwardly mobile stories of striving and achievement the father , arnold friedman , was a columbia university graduate , a longtime , prizewinning high school teacher the brother , jesse , was a high school student their accusers were boys who had taken afterschool computer classes in the friedmans' basement call it dateline filtered through david lynch even the sprinkler systems maintaining great neck s pristine lawns become ominous in the camerawork of aldolfo doring yet mr jarecki manages to convey sympathy for arnold and jesse friedman , raising significant points that cast doubt on their guilty pleas without making claims for their innocence at the same time , his film conveys the utter strangeness of this family , its fixation on documenting itself even at its worst especially at its worst the film is embroidered with vivid and sometimes alarming selections from the friedmans' weirdly comprehensive home movies there are the happy friedmans at birthday parties and at the beach , images so familiar that they seem like stock footage from a collective memory bank then , after arnold and jesse are arrested , in 1987 , come the screaming friedmans , yelling at one another as the videotape rolls in one of those tapes , recorded a year after the arrests of his father and brother , david friedman is seen sitting in a white tshirt and boxers on his bed , clearly distraught , talking to the camera this is private , so if you 're not me , you really should n't be watching this , because this is supposed to be a private situation between me and me , he says so turn it off , do n't watch this yet this private moment is now available to anyone for the price of a movie ticket capturing the friedmans casts a spotlight on the most sensitive aspects of documentary filmmaking what is the responsibility of filmmakers to their subjects , as they transform them from private to public figures \? and what s the matter with us , that we ca n't take our eyes off the screen \? have we lost the ability to distinguish between public and private , or are we just living through a new variation on the old hollywood dream , in which the fantasies and frailties that are made larger than life happen to be real \? or do we rationalize our prurience by saying that the friedmans are fair game , having already lost their privacy to the criminal justice system and the reporters who cover it \? these issues have become more critical as reallife stories have increasingly rivaled fictional ones in the public imagination what specifically changed the course of mr jarecki s story was david friedman s hostility toward his mother , elaine 'my mother is an idiot , ' that was a big theme with him , said mr jarecki , discussing their early interviews mr friedman kept at it 'my mother is crazy , my mother is a lunatic' that angry outpouring convinced mr jarecki that he needed to meet elaine friedman at the time , he knew only that silly billy was an unusually cranky clown , and he wanted to know why the mother was reticent during their first interview , which appears in the film i ca n't say too much about it , she says about the past , appearing flummoxed we were a family mr jarecki told me that her use of the past tense broke his heart and sharpened his curiosity i did n't know why this family had ceased to be , but they clearly had , he said as the filmmaker continued his investigation , he found himself pulled in many directions elaine friedman , who felt she had been unfairly reviled by her sons , became interested in revisiting the case , while a third son , seth , who lives in california , wanted nothing to do with the project and does not appear in the film uncle howard , arnold friedman s brother , a sentimental man in his 60 s , agreed to participate simply to help shape a humane portrait of his brother and nephew david friedman would have been happy had the movie just gone away

' the book s subtitle captures its contents the amazing , true story of how an obscure brooklyn horn player became the last great broadway showman as a teenager , mr feuer played the trumpet professionally he worked his way out to los angeles , where he became a musical director at republic pictures that s where he collaborated with the composer frank loesser for the first time and met ernest martin , who agreed that a cockamamie broadway musical had to be a cinch for a couple of hotshots like us the hits that feuer and martin accumulated over the next 20 years proved them right , and made them legends still , there s nobody left who knows the whole story , mr feuer writes in the prologue , not even me the subject of first nights illustrates the way mr feuer s memory works asked about openingnight parties , he said he did n't have them spend 25 , 000 to throw a party \? hell with that i want to find out if the show s a flop , then have a party jed feuer , a composer , said that could n't be right , because he remembered attending them as a boy \( he is 54 \) undeterred , the elder feuer barreled ahead with a story about the opening night of where s charley \? , his first broadway show adolph green delivered the reviews to mr feuer s apartment and said , do you really want me to read these \? mr gross said that mr feuer could attach a personal anecdote to almost any showbiz name he mentioned the book recounts , among others , the tale of the young mr feuer s romance with the actress susan hayward , cole porter s kingly arrival in philadelphia for the outoftown tryout of cancan and how mr feuer dealt with the director bob fosse s paranoia while producing the movie cabaret when mr gross cited groucho marx , mr feuer obliged by describing groucho s behavior at a party before dinner , when we were having cocktails , groucho sat next to posy , mr feuer said then we went into dinner and they wanted him to sit next to posy again he said , 'i 've used you up' he wanted to switch seats ! mr feuer roared with laughter mrs feuer cut him off that s not a very nice story to tell , she said tartly in that case , mr feuer told his wife of 55 years , i 'll have a drink of your wine he helped himself to a sip from her glass one of the book s most intriguing passages is n't gossip but rather a backstage insight about george s kaufman , the original director of guys and dolls the show s librettist , abe burrows , always acknowledged that kaufman helped shape the dialogue he was , after all , one of the great playwrights of the american theater , and frequently sharpened the scripts he directed mr feuer discloses some specifics that were n't published in the biographies of loesser , burrows or even kaufman himself it was kaufman s idea , mr feuer writes , to give the show a second plot by providing the gambler nathan detroit with a love interest , adelaide he was also responsible for the exquisite detail that they have been engaged for 14 years
baghdad , iraq , april 10 the sandstorm lasted two days , sapping morale and twice turning the setting sun the color of blood lt col steven e landis called the slanting and choking sands the wrath of allah supplies of water and ammunition ran low in these first days of the war as iraqi fighters launched unexpectedly fierce attacks on troops and supply lines that now stretched nearly 300 miles to the rear the army s third infantry division swept across the harsh , open deserts of southern iraq in less than 72 hours , an advance that was called the longest mass movement of armor since world war ii and was as breathtaking as it was grinding the vanguard of the division s first brigade about 5 , 000 soldiers with tanks , bradley fighting vehicles and howitzers crossed the striking escarpment north of najaf on march 23 , the war s third day the brigade s officers always said they would pause there for a day or two , resting their soldiers and refitting their weapons for the last push to baghdad but they were still there nine days later the troops , accompanied by a reporter , endured wild fluctuations between the day s heat and the night s chill , numbing tedium , growing frustration , rising fear and mounting casualties the rapid march that capt adam j morrison had at first called the cannonball run threatened to become a crawl , if that a single shot to the head killed specialist gregory p sanders on march 24 as he stood beside his tank in the najaf area he was 19 and the brigade s first soldier to die sgt roderic a solomon died on the 28th when the bradley he was in crashed into a ditch he was 32 four more from the same company pfc michael r creighton weldon , specialist michael e curtin , pfc diego f rincon and sgt eugene williams died a day later when a bomb in a taxi exploded at a checkpoint none had turned 25 yet that was the day , march 29 , when maj morris t goins , a tall , easygoing north carolinian who is the first brigade s operations officer , swore you ai n't going to get there , he shouted at another officer , gesturing toward baghdad , if all you 're worrying about is what s back there those were the darkest days of the division s sweep across iraq , when fear , anger and doubt cut into soldiers in the desert like the grit in the wind in faraway places , which to the brigade s soldiers , meant places like kuwait and washington , commanders and commentators questioned the pentagon s strategy , contemplated an operational pause , and debated the semantics of words like bogged down but where the desert meets the fertile crescent of the tigris and the euphrates , the division s mechanized forces remained largely intact , even if bloodied on its flanks by fedayeen fighters the division needed only the order to move again that order came sometime before the moonless hours after midnight on april 2 , when the brigade s armored forces began to move again the renewed advance had been preceded by days of aerial bombardments of iraqi forces guarding the southern approaches to baghdad a little of the cool swagger of major goins , the brigade s operations officer , returned that day he never seemed happier than when the division was moving thirtysix hours , he told a dozen soldiers from the brigade s mobile command post as they began to break camp in the desert at last then we 'll be in the history books forever fighting the war by the evening of the same day , april 2 , the brigade had seized a bridge at the village of yasin al khudayr and crossed the euphrates the division s second brigade followed , veering to the east and attacked up route 8 , which leads to baghdad just 24 hours later , the first brigade occupied what was then known as saddam international airport , only three miles from the center of baghdad on the day before the war started , back in their desert camp in kuwait , the brigade s commander , col william f grimsley , had outlined the brigade s attack plans the sweep through featureless desert , the euphrates crossing , the assault on the airport he was asked how long , honestly , he believed the war would last , a question he had left unanswered in his briefing what day is it \? he replied wednesday \? i think a week from today , we 'll be on the outskirts of baghdad such a claim seemed like wild hubris but had it not been for the nine days in the desert north of the escarpment at the holy city of najaf , he would have been right in the end the war went more or less as foreseen , though much of what military commanders expected did not happen , and many unforeseen things did war has the feel of epic history , even lived from within the confines of one unit for the soldiers of the third infantry division s first brigade , the awareness of being part of something vast was accompanied by the inescapable fact of viewing the conflict through the narrow prism of immediate , personal experience i could see more of this war on television , pfc steven l jones said one day , driving in a humvee through the deserts of southern iraq during the brigade s first long march to najaf
jerusalem , march 23 israel s defense ministry wants to push a security fence deeper into the west bank , where it would bring another 40 , 000 jewish settlers and around 3 , 000 palestinians to the israeli side , officials said today palestinians sharply criticized the plan , saying it would undermine a united statesbacked proposal that is intended to restart peace talks and lead to a palestinian state this is part of the ongoing israeli effort to deepen its occupation , said nabil shaath , a palestinian cabinet minister israel began erecting the barrier last year , saying that the aim was to stymie palestinian suicide bombers , and that it is not a border the initial stage of the fence roughly follows the frontier of the west bank , though it dips into the west bank in several places the new proposal cuts deep into the west bank to protect several jewish settlements , including two large ones , ariel and immanuel , not far from the palestinian city of nablus last year , palestinians ambushed two buses near immanuel , killing 18 israelis rachel niedakashkenazi , a defense ministry spokeswoman , said the proposal would be presented to prime minister ariel sharon s government in the coming days while the proposed fence would include some 40 , 000 jewish settlers , about 3 , 000 palestinians would also be left on the western , or israeli side , the israeli newspaper haaretz reported mr sharon took cabinet members on a field trip last week to see the work on the fence , which includes ditches , patrol roads and electronic detection systems and is about 50 yards wide his government has agreed in principle to fence off the entire west bank , a distance of about 225 miles the prime minister also called last week for a northsouth fence in the jordan valley , which would run parallel to the border with jordan , with jewish settlers inside the protected corridor mr sharon , who has long opposed territorial concessions to the palestinians , has repeatedly said that the barrier is strictly for security this is a specific military measure to reduce as much as possible the possibility of palestinian terrorist attacks , said raanan gissin , spokesman for the prime minister this in no way implies it will be a future border however , the palestinians say the israeli measures are creating de facto borders that cut off large chunks of the west bank the palestinians are seeking a state that includes all of the west bank , the gaza strip and a capital in east jerusalem with attention focused in iraq , the sharon government is going to do what it likes with the settlements , said mr shaath , the palestinian official this is why we want a settlement freeze the longer you wait , the worse things become dan schueftan , an israeli academic who has closely followed the issue , said he believed the latest move was part of a larger effort to keep the three largest israeli settlement clusters on the israeli side of the fence in addition to the ariel settlements , the other large clusters are around jerusalem and in gush etzion to the south of jerusalem many hardline israelis also oppose the fence , because like the palestinians , they fear it will be seen as a border that could weaken israeli claims to additional west bank land sharon is very reluctant to build the fence , said mr schueftan , a senior fellow at the center for national security studies at the university of haifa but he feels he has no other choice , and that it does n't clash with fundamental israeli security needs israel has built about 150 settlements in the west bank and the gaza strip , where around 220 , 000 settlers live the west bank frontier exists only on maps , and the lack of a physical barrier has allowed palestinian suicide bombers to slip into israel for attacksin the past 30 months more than 80 palestinian suicide bombers have come from the west bank and none from gaza , which is fenced off the first two stages of the fence are going up in the northern west bank and around jerusalem , and are to be finished by july , the defense ministry said photo israeli soldiers secured part of a new security fence line near jenin in the west bank last week the israeli defense ministry wants to push the fence deeper into the west bank to protect more settlers \( agence francepresse \) map of israel highlighting the location of the proposed fence israeli officials want a security fence extended near nablus
camp doha , kuwait , thursday , march 20 some wars begin with a bang others begin with limited airstrikes , stealthy border movements and psychological operations to weaken the enemy s resistance this war began with both the major blows were cruise missile attacks from the red sea and the persian gulf and strikes by f117 stealth fighters against three leadership targets , an apparent effort to decapitate saddam hussein s regime the strike recalled the cruise missile attack the clinton administration mounted unsuccessfully to try to kill osama bin laden in afghanistan it was an attempt to end the war with a single , decisive blow but even before the baghdad attack took place , the final preparatory phase of the war was under way it included attacks on artillery , a major psychological operations campaign , and the positioning of ground troops along the kuwaitiraq border despite these twin developments the attack on the leadership and the maneuvering at the border the major air and land assault to collapse mr hussein s regime has not yet been unleashed if the attempt to wipe out the iraqi leadership is not successful , the united states is still preparing the knockout punch meanwhile , it has already hit some targets on wednesday afternoon , allied warplanes attacked about a dozen iraqi artillery pieces near the southern iraqi town of al zubayr and on al faw peninsula the strikes were important militarily and also for what they signaled politically allied planes patrolling the southern noflight zone have attacked surfacetoair missiles , radar and surfacetosurface missiles in southern iraq but this was the first attack on artillery the military rationale seemed clear to set the stage for the invasion of iraq the artillery pieces that were attacked included ghn45 howitzers , an austrianmade 155millimeter gun that has been part of iraq s arsenal for some time and that the iraqi military moved south near al zubayr about three weeks ago with a range of about 25 miles , the howitzers could reach the american and british forces moving into northern kuwait and threaten them as they advanced north allied warplanes also attacked type 59 field guns stationed on iraq s faw peninsula , which were in range of kuwait s bubiyan island the attacks were also something of a political milestone lt gen david d mckiernan , the allied land war commander and his top deputies have been concerned about the artillery and had wanted to destroy them before sending american and british troops into harm s war in iraq the bush administration had been reluctant to give general mckiernan the goahead when the issue of iraqi compliance with orders to disarm was before the united nations security council officials argued that an attack then would suggest that washington had written off a peaceful resolution after president bush issued his ultimatum that mr hussein leave iraq within 48 hours , however , it was clear that the diplomatic phase had come to an end so defense secretary donald h rumsfeld gave the approval to strike the american military took another step on wednesday to create the conditions for a fullfledged air and land assault , issuing instructions to what it hopes are poorly motivated iraqi troops on how to surrender to allied forces or at least ensure that they are not attacked the message was delivered by a radio station near the kuwaitiiraqi border operated by american special operations forces and by an airborne radio station leaflets with similar instructions were dropped by allied aircraft one american concern was that any iraqis who heeded the instructions would be attacked by security agents deployed with iraqi soldiers to enforce mr hussein s will the instructions were disseminated on the clear assumption that allied troops were soon to be the dominant force in iraq leaflets dropped by united states aircraft instruct the iraqis to park their vehicles , put white flags on them , move more than half a mile away from their vehicles and wait for further instructions other indications of a looming attack were evident in kuwait american and british forces moved to attack positions inside the previously demilitarized zone that separates kuwait and iraq careful cuts have also been made in the elaborate 33 million electrified fence that separates kuwait from iraq the army s third infantry division and 101st airborne are still on the kuwaiti side of the demilitarized zone , as are the united states marines and british forces by moving forward toward the border and arranging for gaps to be cut in the fence , however , the allied ground troops are leaning forward to gain a bit of a head start none of this should be mistaken for the crushing blow that is likely to descend on iraq soon that attack is expected to feature precision bombing in baghdad , strikes against iraq s elite republican guard and the advance of army and marine forces toward the iraqi capital the airstrikes in baghdad will be more concentrated than in 1991 , so concentrated that its advocates have called the plan shock and awe the land forces will travel farther than during the 1991 persian gulf conflict when it happens ,

mention the word potentilla to many gardeners and what comes to mind is a common little bush covered with screaming yellow flowers frankly , i hate that color , and never gave the shrub a second thought until this january , when i saw six deer casually eyeing my unfenced front garden in central new jersey and its spring and summer dining possibilities that was when i remembered that this gaudy bush is shunned by grazing deer i promptly decided that screaming yellow would be better than no color at all and began to scour the web for more information what a pleasant surprise to discover that plant scientists have been doing a lot of breeding in recent years , creating some stunningly refined potentillas the elegant new ones come in just about every color except blue , with double and semidouble blossoms , and foliage that can be dark green or with blue or gray hues tim woods , a product development manager at spring meadow nursery in grand haven , mich , is among the recent converts like many people in my profession , i am somewhat of a plant snob , he said , adding , potentillas are dreadfully common when one has plant snob tendencies , common just wo n't do what changed his mind was visiting the university of minnesota landscape arboretum and seeing a potentilla collection with a dazzling variety of colors there was dakota sunspot , with dark green leaves and , as mr woods , a fan of yellow , put it , the brightest goldenyellow flower of them all these days , i call myself a reformed plant snob , he said with my bias , i was pleased to learn he was also enchanted by abbotswood , with large , pure white flowers , and by snowbird , a compact potentilla with double white flowers dr campbell g davidson , manager of a canadian government agriculture research station in morden , manitoba , has been a potentilla booster and breeder for 20 years one of their more interesting aspects is their flowering period , which is one of the longest for temperate woody landscape plants , he said in return for full sun and reasonably welldrained soil , potentillas can flower from early june through to november if not braked by frost in my wildest dreams , he continued , i picture a little shrub that will challenge the rose we have a long way to go , but one has to remember that roses have been bred for thousands of years , and on a relative basis we 've just started on potentillas dr davidson noted other strong points , including resistance not only to deer but also to disease and insects , and an ability to tolerate drought others prize the shrub s small dimensions potentillas usually grow to a height of two to four feet with a similar spread because of their size and long bloom period , they are ideal for pocket gardens and mixed perennial borders dr davidson and other researchers have developed genetic models that determine flower color their work is now coming to fruition at specialty nurseries where limited quantities of the new potentillas are being grown in shades of apricot , pink and red pink beauty , widely regarded as an exceptional beauty , is on my order list it grows into a globe about three feet across , bearing dark green leaves and nonstop clear pink , semidouble flowers is there a catch \? alas , yes potentillas , native to cooler regions throughout the northern hemisphere , do not like the sticky summer nights that prevail in the midatlantic and southeastern states many cultivars simply shut down their flowering in such conditions jeff thompson , general manager of eaton farms , a wholesale company in leesport , pa , says that pink beauty has nonetheless performed well during the brutal summers that have plagued the midatlantic region in recent years the worst that happens is that the flowers temporarily fade , he said , to blush or white mr thompson also recommends mckay s white , which features creamy white flowers primrose beauty , with soft yellow flowers that glow against grayishgreen foliage and goldfinger , with bright yellow flowers although flower production on these three cultivars stops during hot spells , it soon resumes to shorten the intermission to a month , mr thompson recommends trimming the top three or four inches off the plant half a bloom season is better than none when deer are on the street , of course , which is why potentillas will be among the plants i try this year and with all the different cultivar colors that are now available , i can continue to avoid coloring my garden with screaming yellow sources include any good garden center , which should be able to track down one of the new potentilla cultivars being grown by some wholesale nurseries in addition , the mail order nursery forestfarm offers a good selection 990 tetherow road , williams , ore 975449599 \( 541 \) 8467269 , or www forestfarm com photos primrose beauty , top pink beauty , below and mckay s white , right , show potentillas' variety in color \( photographs courtesy of pennsylvania pride nursery products \)
venosa , italy amid rolling pastureland about 180 miles southeast of rome , dust is flying workers carefully dig through crumbling sandstone deep beneath the surface of a grassy hillside stout wooden beams support a makeshift entrance and a labyrinth of newly exposed passageways that lead into an ancient underground maze a loopy string of construction lamps illuminate the way an excited archaeologist leads a visitor to a wooden board protecting a discovery made just the previous afternoon it is a sevenbranched candelabra , the original symbol of the jews , carved into a slab found at a burial niche the carving is so sharp and clean , it might have been completed yesterday the quality and clarity foreshadow even more important finds likely to come the catacomb is only one of dozens of jewish sites , artifacts , documents , rare books and manuscripts being discovered , analyzed and restored in southern italy and sicily this work by scholars and government authorities is beginning to flesh out the largely unknown story of vibrant yet longlost communities of jews that inhabited the region from roman times to the end of the middle ages jews were expelled from southern italy , known then as the kingdom of naples , in the 16th century few returned even after the ban was lifted in the 18th century historians associated with the excavation believe the catacomb may be the largest ever found in western europe hundreds of niches have already been cleared , the bones either looted or reburied according to ritual law what is striking is that the inscriptions on the burial slabs found to date are almost totally in greek there is little or no hebrew when hebrew is used , the characters mostly spell out greek or latin words both greek and latin were commonly used in that part of italy at the time this suggests an assimilated life for the jews who may have lived here outside venosa between the third and seventh centuries ad our jews were not separated from everyone else in those early centuries , said dr cesare colafemmina , visiting professor of hebrew and hebraic literature at the university of calabria documents indicate that emperor titus brought 5 , 000 captives to the region after the destruction of the second temple in jerusalem in ad 70 , dr colafemmina said but hundreds more are thought to have settled here before and after that time , simply because it was a prosperous crossroads of maritime trade and jews played a vital role in mediterranean commerce by the end of the fourth century many towns were dominated by jews they even became political and community leaders , he said there has been limited interest in the area by most jewish scholars because virtually none of today s jews understand their ties to these people , said dr yom tov assis , professor of medieval jewish history at the hebrew university of jerusalem and academic chairman of its international center for the teaching of jewish civilization this oversight has been so even though historians consider that some the jews of southern italy were the ancestors of the earliest jewish settlers in northern and eastern europe all too often , dr assis said , we favor jewish history only from a base of our known family history or something that happened in our own day so the current work is being led mostly by nonjewish italian scholars who view it as an integral part of the early history of the italian peninsula and paneuropean trade its scholarly distinction is confirmed by the oftquoted words of rabbeinu tam , a grandson of rashi , a famous 11thcentury french rabbi from out of bari the torah will go forth , rabbi tam noted , paraphrasing scripture , and the word of god from taranto bari and taranto were important ports in the region and it is yielding fascinating dividends for instance there is a firstcentury travertine tombstone now in the basement of the national archaeological museum of naples , yet another example of vibrant jewish life here during the first millennium it was found in 1996 in the museum s storehouses by dr giancarlo lacerenza of the oriental institute in naples and a specialist in ancient near eastern history its emotionally charged latin inscription is now regarded by scholars as the first archaeological corroboration of the plight of the jewish captives being herded by the romans into italy from jerusalem in the late first century ad this is the headstone of claudia aster , a 25yearold jew brought to the area , probably as a girl , and sold as a household slave the inscription reads claudia aster , captive from jerusalem tiberius claudius proculus , imperial freedman , took care of this epitaph i ask you to make sure through the law that you take care that no one casts down my inscription addressed in the plural to all inhabitants of the area , or travelers passing through , dr lacerenza said , it sounded like an elaborate appeal for the protection of the inscription although such appeals have been found on other roman tombstones , it is possible that claudia did not want history to forget that she and her people had been taken there as captives and her roman master may have honored her wishes , possibly because he fell in love with her or even married her dr lacerenza said that aster may have been a latin or greek version of the jewish name esther claudia , say other historians , would have been the name given to her as a member of the household of someone named claudius at the national library in naples , in the grandeur of the palazzo reale , new interest apparently is being taken in creating public displays for its formerly stored and largely unknown collection of early hebrew manuscripts and incunabula , possibly the largest in italy many of these were originally acquired from the farnese library , the personal library of pope paul iii \( 14681549 \) naples was a major center of jewish book production during the 15th century southern italy had previously claimed pride as one of the earliest centers of jewish learning in europe , making it an obvious location for such treasures indications of the affluence of early jewish life in sicily abound , especially in siracusa , formerly the ancient greek port of siracuse land records show that luxurious homes were owned by jews there is a newly restored mikvah , or ritual bath , in the old jewish quarter that is divided into five separate baths , rather than a communal pool , as was customary two baths are hidden within private alcoves , which may have been for those who could afford the luxury still , all five are interconnected and tied into a common source of flowing water , as required by jewish law archaeologists say the style suggests a late roman or byzantine origin about 70 miles northwest of siracusa , in the mountain village of agira , a holy ark of intricately carved stone , dated 1454 , has been taken from a site that used to be a synagogue and moved inside the adjacent norman church for preservation and viewing until the site itself can be restored the ark is the repository for the torah scrolls dr assis said it was of catalan origin , possibly fashioned locally by jews fleeing catalonia during the persecutions of the mid15th century sicily was also ruled at this time by catalan monarchs , but they were more tolerant than their counterparts on the spanish mainland the island was an obvious haven since it was prosperous and long favored by merchant jews from all over the mediterranean scholars said an ark as old as this was a rare find ark were typically made of wood , and a stone example is considered the most impressive and scarce photos an arch discovered by archaeologists in a catacomb at venosa , italy \( cesare colafemmina \)

bird cages as hanging lamps , a thatched nipa hut roof over the bar and the ornately carved wooden wall plaques of southeast asian scenes the owners , who also run the plum tree , a very good japanese restaurant in new canaan , have obviously spent a fortune on the d cor and on an elaborate menu that tries to bridge two cuisines that are basically not compatible thai and japanese in the mid80 s , the first wave of thai restaurants appeared along the eastern seaboard and had the authenticity of the little eateries i knew in bangkok and elsewhere in thailand then came a parade of chinesethai , indianthai , indonesianthai , fusionthai these neighboring countries have through time had their influences on thai cooking at the same time , thai cooking here has become americanized , more predictable thai cooking may seem easy , but at its best it walks a delicate gastronomic tightrope , often combining in the same dish the tastes of sweet , hot , sour , bitter and salty in a way that is subtle and unique papaya thai goes through the motions of thai dishes , but many are lackluster , with none of the sparkle and subtlety of the authentic in the pad thai , key ingredients were missing and the fresh coriander \( rare in most of the dishes we ordered \) was so limp it should have been discarded yum pla muk , which should be a sparkling salad of corkscrew of saut ed squid , onion , scallion , lemon grass , kafir lime and hot chili , was mostly a boring duet of tough squid and raw onion slices panang curry was a mild coconut stew with chicken \( other options were shrimp

plum tamarind glaze was more sweet than sour the desserts , though not exactly thai classics , desserts turned out to be the best part of my three meals at papaya thai one was thaibased a sweet sticky rice with fresh mangos instead of being the usual sticky pudding with slices of mango , it resembled segments of a sushi roll , with a bit of mango in the center of the sweet rice , which was rolled in tissuepaperthin crisp pastry , served with dabs of coconut cream it was a clever melding of thai ingredients and japanese techniques that worked and was delicious another delight was ice cream inside an envelope of sweet , donutlike fried dough it was sweet , hot and cold , a pleasing concept for couples on a date or maritime center visitors , papaya thai , with its reasonable prices , can

an upstart airline is hiring an upstart agency in an appropriately upstart fashion , awarding the account by abruptly halting a review that was to have run at least another month the united states division of virgin atlantic airways will formally announce today that it is naming crispin , porter bogusky the hot miami shop drawing praise for offbeat work for the mini as the new agency on its account billings are estimated at 12 million to 15 million crispin , porter was one of five contenders in the review , which began in january when virgin atlantic parted with its agency of nine years , cmg communications in new york the company said it wanted a larger agency after its recent growth the review , managed by roth associates in new york , was to have been narrowed this month to two finalists , with a winner to be named in june instead , virgin atlantic executives are cutting short the process , deciding after meeting with the five agencies that crispin , porter would mesh best with its desire to capitalize on its unconventional brand image with marketing initiatives that go beyond traditional advertising like television commercials and print ads we were completely committed to doing a whole agency search , start to finish , john riordan , vice president for north american marketing at virgin atlantic in norwalk , conn , said yesterday in an interview at no point did we waver , until we met cpb , he added and then it was , 'ok , enough' it is not unprecedented for marketers to shortcircuit reviews this brusquely , but it is unusual typically , they prefer to complete the process at the very least so they can get to know the other contenders well enough to hire one later if the winning choice turns out to be a terrible mistake in this instance , though , virgin atlantic has selected the right partners , mr riordan said , calling the agency s staff members kindred spirits it s such a strong , solid cultural fit for us , he said , because crispin , porter has had home runs with untraditional brands that is what virgin atlantic customers perceive the airline to be after years of humorously cheeky campaigns that tweak its far larger competitors , like british airways among the brands handled by crispin , porter are mini , sold by the bmw of north america division of bmw the ikea north american division bell bicycle helmets , sold by bell sports sirius satellite radio and truth , the name coined by the agency and its partner , arnold worldwide in boston , part of the arnold worldwide partners division of havas , for an antismoking campaign aimed at teenagers , which is sponsored by the american legacy foundation the fit is also reinforced , mr riordan said , by the penchant that crispin , porter has for being media neutral when developing campaigns considering tactics besides the triedandtrue tv spots and newspaper ads we have very big competitors that spend five or six times more than us , he added , so the airline has to look to other , less costly types of advertising among them are using word of mouth as a marketing tool , public relations , email marketing , promotions , direct marketing and event marketing so much of what we 're about is our lust to work with untraditional brands , said jeff hicks , partner and president at crispin , porter , which is 49 percent owned by the maxxcom division of the mdc corporation the desire to break with convention is exactly the kind of thing we gravitate to it s a little too early to talk about what we 're going to do for virgin atlantic , he added , but i guarantee it will defy the rules and what s been done in the category , and make people take notice of virgin atlantic in a way they have n't in the past that approach , while successful recently for crispin , porter , is fraught with pitfalls it works if you do it properly , but like any good advertising , it is polarizing , said paul cappelli , president at ad store in new york , an agency also known for its upstart approach in creating campaigns for nontraditional brands like jetblue airways there are people who think nothing is funny , he added you have to make them nod in appreciation , nod in connection with your brand for jetblue , whose campaigns from ad store aim pointed barbs at traditional airlines , none of us want to make fun of the predicament they 're in , mr cappelli said , referring to the financial crises facing the biggest carriers we want to make fun of the way consumers perceive they 've been treated by the other airlines , to offer a little bit of comeuppance for instance , in one new commercial for jetblue , two boys are describing the types of airlines they would invent when one says , i'm going to charge extra for every little thing , and i'm going to charge businessmen a gazillion dollars a ticket , the other boy says , your airline , completing the thought with a vulgarism the virgin atlantic account is the most recent in a lengthy list to land at crispin , porter since the agency was awarded the mini account in february 2001 other new assignments in that time include ikea sirius the buca chain of italian restaurants , handled by the agency s fledgling los angeles office and molson usa , a joint venture of molson and the adolph coors company during that period , billings at the agency , founded in 1965 , have grown to an estimated 250 million from 150 million and last week , crispin , porter won the most awards , seven , in the annual international andy awards competition sponsored by the advertising club of new york the other agencies in the review were the martin agency in richmond , va , part of the partnership division of the interpublic group of companies merkley newman harty partners in new york , part of the omnicom group mullen in wenham , mass , also part of the partnership division of interpublic and tbwa chiat day in new york , part of the tbwa worldwide unit of omnicom a sixth agency , berlin cameron red cell in new york , part of the red cell division of the wpp group , withdrew last month virgin atlantic , owned by the virgin group and singapore airlines , was one of the few airlines to come through 2002 with black ink on the books on monday , the company reported a pretax profit for its fiscal year ended april 30 , achieved despite a revenue decline of 7 percent and flat passenger counts costs were cut by laying off employees and trimming some north american routes photo the us unit of virgin atlantic has selected crispin , porter bogusky \( agence francepresse \)
albany , feb 28 after weeks of opposition by state lawmakers and local officials , gov george e pataki today retreated from his proposal to bill local governments for half the costs of property tax breaks offered to businesses in state economic development zones mr pataki , a republican , made the proposal in his executive budget last month , saying that it would save the state about 4 million annually currently , the state pays 250 million every year to local governments to cover the cost of a variety of tax breaks in 72 specially designated empire zones across the state but the assembly speaker , sheldon silver , a democrat , and the senate majority leader , joseph l bruno , a republican , opposed the change this week , mr bruno proposed expanding the program by adding 18 more zones , mostly in counties that have none many state and local government officials also lobbied against mr pataki s plan , saying it would not only cost local governments money but would also discourage them from participating in one of the state s most successful economic development programs mr pataki withdrew his proposal today as part of a series of mostly technical amendments to his 908 billion budget for the 20032004 fiscal year , which begins april 1 under the state constitution , today was the last day he had to submit his amendments to the legislature kevin c quinn , a spokesman for the state division of the budget , said the governor s decision resulted from his understanding that while the state is facing a severe fiscal crisis , so are the local governments we 're going to continue working with them and the legislature to make sure the empire zone program continues to be implemented in the most costeffective manner possible assemblyman robin schimminger , a democrat and chairman of the assembly s economic development committee , said the governor s proposal had been illconceived it would have gutted the program because local governments would have been reluctant to pick up half the costs , he said in other changes , the governor reduced his revenue projections by about 200 million this year he also factored in another 5 million for extra antiterrorism measures state budget officials said that personal income tax receipts were lower than estimated , and a new computer system that was expected to generate more money through tax audits had not been installed as quickly as planned at the same time , state officials said that they expected to pay about 25 million less to local governments for school aid claims this year , partially offsetting the decrease in revenue the governor also proposed adding a surcharge to the registration fee for boats the governor s amendments also projected an additional 213 million in savings for next year , largely as a result of revised spending and revenue estimates these savings included lower welfare costs , spending reductions at various agencies , and an influx of federal money for medicaid payments
los angeles , feb 27 the california highway patrol agreed to stop using minor traffic violations as a pretext for searching cars for drugs under a settlement of a racialprofiling lawsuit announced today the agency will also extend a ban on socalled consent searches , in which officers ask motorists for permission to search their cars even if there is no probable cause to do so the american civil liberties union , which filed the classaction suit three years ago on behalf of africanamerican and latino motorists who said they were the victims of racial profiling by highway patrol officers , called the agreement a landmark in civil liberties law this is a groundbreaking settlement , said jon b streeter , the civil liberties union s main lawyer in the case while there have been quite a few racialprofiling cases around the country in the last 10 years , none of them have resulted in the kinds of reforms we 've gotten the chp to agree to here under the settlement , the highway patrol will also compile comprehensive statistics on each traffic stop , including the driver s race , reason for the stop , whether a search was conducted and the legal basis for the search in addition , the agency will name an auditor to analyze information traffic stops and the records of individual officers to identify any who might be engaging in racial profiling the auditor will report directly to the commissioner of the highway patrol the patrol , in a statement today , did not admit that it practiced racial profiling and noted that the accord did not require it to pay damages it will pay 875 , 000 in legal fees and other court costs for the case that was filed in federal district court in san jose nothing during this threeyear litigation established a pattern or practice of racial profiling by the chp , said d o helmick , commissioner of the patrol the chp reaffirms its commitment to provide service to the public and treat people respectfully and fairly the patrol said just 2 percent of traffic stops and other public contacts resulted in searches of those , it said , 999 percent occur after an arrest or the impounding of a vehicle involved in a crime the primary plaintiff in the case , curtis rodriguez , said accord would make highways safer for all drivers latino and africanamerican motorists will no longer have to live in fear of being stopped and searched simply because of the color of their skin , mr rodriguez said mr rodriguez of san jose , a lawyer , was stopped and searched by patrol officers in june 1998 he said he saw a number of other latino drivers stopped in the same area of highway 152 just before he was pulled over officials of the civil liberties union said the highway patrol s agreement to stop asking drivers' permission to search their cars was a first in the nation civil liberties lawyers say the socalled consent searches , although the united states supreme court has ruled them permissible , are inherently coercive because of the disparity in power between an officer and a motorist commissioner helmick stopped such searches in 2001 , after studies showed that latinos in parts of california were about three times as likely to be searched by chp officers as whites the accord ment extends that moratorium three years mark schlosberg , director of police policy practices at the aclu of northern california , said he hoped that the agreement would set a standard for police departments across the state already data collected locally , even by police departments in diverse and progressive cities such as san francisco and sacramento , demonstrates large disparities in the rates at which africanamerican and latino motorists are stopped and searched , mr schlosberg said

proposing for the ayes was earl browder , a loyal stalinist who had nonetheless been removed by moscow \( for some minor deviations \) from the leadership of the american communist party opposing him was the mercurial genius max shachtman , later to become a salient cold warrior but then the leader of the trotskyist \( or trotskyish \) workers party reaching his peroration against browder , shachtman recited the names of the european communist leaders who , for their own minor deviations , had been liquidated by stalin turning to his antagonist , he pointed and said there , but for an accident of geography , stands a corpse ! eyewitnesses still relish the way in which browder turned abruptly pallid and shrunken eric hobsbawm has been a believing communist and a skeptical eurocommunist and is now a faintly curmudgeonly postcommunist , and there are many ways in which , accidents of geography to one side , he could have been a corpse born in 1917 into a diaspora jewish family in alexandria , egypt , he spent his earlyorphaned boyhood in central europe , in the years between the implosion of austriahungary and the collapse of the weimar republic this time and place were unpropitious enough on their own had hobsbawm not moved to england after the nazis came to power in 1933 , he might have become a statistic he went on to survive the blitz in london and liverpool and , by a stroke of chance , to miss the dispatch to singapore of the british unit he had joined at least a third of those men did not survive japanese captivity , and it s difficult to imagine hobsbawm himself being one of the lucky ones for the most active part of his life as an intellectual and a historian , hobsbawm identified himself with the soviet union , which came into being in the same year he did the failure and disgrace of this system are beyond argument today , and he does n't any longer try to argue for it in interesting times , he explains his allegiance in a pragmaticloyalist manner , to the effect that many people were saved by communism from becoming corpses , and that one was obliged to choose a side this is utilitarianism , not marxism , and he seems to recognize the fact by being appropriately laconic about it it seemed to make sense at the time he lost the historical wager and so did the party history , he says , does not cry over spilled milk willing as i was to be repelled by such reasoning \( blood is not to be rated like milk , after all \) , i found that i was instead rather impressed by its minimalism if you wanted to teach a bright young student how communism actually felt to an intelligent believer , you would have to put this book despite its rather stale title on the reading list to have marched in the last legal communist demonstration in berlin in 1933 may have been an experience as delicious as protracted sexual intercourse \( hobsbawm s metaphor , not mine \) , but the experience of defending the indefensible and more insulting of being asked to believe the unbelievable was far less delightful and , equally to the point , very much more protracted again , hobsbawm s vices mutate into his virtues \( and vice , as it were , versa \) he is determined to show that he was not a dupe , but went into it all with eyes open , while he is no less concerned to argue that he did not want to become one of those god that failed excommunists is this idealism or cynicism \?

boston , may 9 the noise was still deafening , a hostile screech from every corner of the fleet center , when richard jefferson floated toward the basket for his first shot of the night but jefferson clanged his dunk attempt off the rim , to the delight of the crowd the reverberating sounds did not rattle the 22yearold jefferson in the noisy , unfriendly confines described in detail in recent days by nets coach byron scott jefferson shrugged off the noise and was the calmest man on the court sometimes when the crowd is loud here , you ca n't tell if they 're cheering for us , cheering for them , jefferson said you 're just having fun it s just loud and you have a good time this is what it s all about that s the most fun part of the game , having the crowd go crazy , booing , yelling that s what we thrive on tonight , with tempers on edge all over , jefferson emerged again with a nearperfect performance he hit every shot he took in the first half after the missed dunk , and the nets followed , methodically building a lead by the end of the night , jefferson had 20 points , 7 rebounds and 6 assists , and the nets had a 9476 victory to take a threegamestonone lead in the fourofsevengame series a year ago , the nets stepped into the fleet center for game 6 of the eastern conference finals and into a vicious din , the rivalry having grown heated jefferson , a rookie then , scored 11 firsthalf points to keep the nets in the game , which they eventually won to advance to the nba finals i barely remember that , jefferson said i remember that only because i was upset that i did n't play in the fourth quarter it was an opportunity i was happy to take advantage of the opportunity i had friends and family here i was like a kid in the candy store seeing jefferson mature in the face of the pressure made the nets' decisions to trade keith van horn after last season and elevate jefferson to a starting role that much easier now with jefferson and martin setting forth a convincing argument as the best forward tandem in the series , the nets silenced the crowd martin scored 25 points tonight , shooting 10 of 12 sometimes it is their defense that is most impressive they provide quicker , stronger antidotes for every move the celtics' paul pierce and antoine walker attempt sometimes it is their rapidly expanding offensive arsenal and sometimes it is just their youthful confidence and enthusiasm when the nets cleared their bench with 2 minutes 59 seconds remaining , jefferson followed kenyon martin and jason kidd to the sideline he paused in front of them to mimic martin , gripping one side of his jersey and pulling it aside in a macho pose they 're great players , celtics coach jim o'brien said they came in here with three players who can absolutely murder in every phase of the game nothing that they have done has surprised me one bit perhaps not surprised , but disappointed the celtics chose to give martin and jefferson open jump shots , but after their 16for21 shooting tonight , it may be time to rethink that strategy you take the lesser of the two evils , pierce said they 're so athletic getting to the rim , if they get that step they 'll dunk on you you give them challenged jump shots they 've been knocking down shots much of their success has come through athletic ability , often soaring high above the defense to grab a lob from kidd and throw down an acrobatic dunk but for much of this postseason , jefferson and martin have gained confidence in their outside shooting , which was on full display tonight to say that jefferson has gained confidence implies that he lacked it , something that would be laughable to his teammates sometimes basketball is a very easy thing , jefferson said if you work on something , your game will be elevated i think that s why my game has progressed the way it has i think my coaches last year , when they made the trade , saw the amount of hard work , the amount of effort i put into my game , and they knew it was only a matter of time before it would show on the court jefferson is as outspoken as any member of the team he was the first nets player to come to kidd s defense when controversy swirled this week and he was the first to declare that the nets were coming to boston intent on taking both games and ending this series in four games nothing he did in tonight s game provided any indication that it was idle talk on the bench in the final moments , jefferson put an ice pack on his back and a towel over his head and ignored the taunts from the emptying crowd with the clock ticking down in the final minute , jefferson and martin led the nets one more time , heading for the exit before the final buzzer photo the nets' kenyon martin , left , had a gamehigh 25 points and shot 10 of 12 from the field \( agence francepresse \)
the bush administration proved over the weekend that it can plan for war against iraq and fight international terrorism at the same time the capture in pakistan of khalid shaikh mohammed , a top operative of al qaeda who is suspected of planning the sept 11 attacks , was the most significant strike against the terror group since the united states dislodged the osama bin laden network from afghanistan america is safer today because mr mohammed is in custody , and the cia and fbi should be applauded for their role in his capture but a cautionary note is in order pakistan s pivotal role in the seizure of mr mohammed is one more demonstration of the importance of working in concert with other nations in the fight against terrorism the united states cannot defeat al qaeda without the help of dozens of other nations the same principle applies to iraq president bush may be able to win a military victory against saddam hussein without broad international support , but he wo n't be able to rebuild iraq , much less change the political and economic dynamics of the islamic world , without a great deal of foreign assistance after a weekend of fastmoving events , including the destruction by iraq of some of its illegal al samoud 2 missiles , mr bush needs to take a deep breath the white house seems increasingly intent on attacking iraq , whether or not baghdad disarms and whether or not the security council endorses a war mr bush may soon find himself forced to choose between going ahead with an invasion despite marginal international support , or bowing to demands by many allies to give inspectors more time we believe more time is warranted to determine whether iraq s dismantlement of missiles is a signal that mr hussein is reconsidering his stubborn defiance of the united nations and to see if a solution short of war is still possible it was a bad weekend for the war initiative the turkish parliament failed to approve american plans to use turkish bases as a staging ground for the invasion iraq s willingness to begin destroying its missiles is sure to give invasion opponents a stronger hand during un debates this week a white house spokesman s statement late last week that mr bush would be satisfied only with the departure of mr hussein appeared to shift the rationale for war to fit new circumstances the turkish parliament s vote , narrow though it was , conveyed an awkward message mr bush argued last week that invading iraq would help bring democracy to the middle east a few days later , a parliament full of democratically elected muslims rebuffed washington s request to use turkey as a springboard for an invasion of iraq the missile destruction is important , though not proof that iraq has changed course destruction was the only action possible if iraq wanted to head off a security council resolution supporting invasion iraq has about 100 of the missiles , and it has so far destroyed only a few we are not under any illusion that mr hussein is disabling his missiles simply because he likes the idea iraq would never be making even these grudging concessions if american troops were not massed near iraq s border the un must realize that whatever success it has achieved of late in getting iraq to abide by its directives has come only because of american military might the threat of force , however , should not give way to the use of force until peaceful paths to iraqi disarmament have been exhausted and the security council gives its assent to war everything that happened over the weekend underlines the fact that the united states should not invade iraq without broad international support even if there is a quick military triumph , many things could go wrong over the long haul the turks could intervene militarily in northern iraq to assert control over the kurds there , who have established an autonomous and democratic government the fragile pakistani government could be toppled in an antiamerican reaction , endangering the war on terror iraqi biological and chemical weapons could fall into the hands of terrorists none of these events will necessarily happen , but the odds that they will are as good as the odds that a war will lead to the establishment of a peaceful , democratic state in iraq
kearny , nj robert deavers , guilty of two rapes , has done his 20 years in prison he still has not been freed instead , for five years , he has been locked up by state officials who are worried about what he might do mr deavers took another try at gaining his release in the fall of 2002 at a hearing , his third the subject was his state of mind , and he quickly lost hope a state psychiatrist who had interviewed him briefly told the closed , nearly empty courtroom that mr deavers tended to selfrighteousness and had been taken to task in group therapy for being overconfident a psychologist who had never met him but had reviewed his records said he was egocentric there was much testimony about an incident in which he had bumped into a female guard by noon mr deavers knew what would happen a month later the judge would rule that he was too dangerous to be released back in his room , mr deavers resumed his role in a fiercely debated but politically popular system of preventive detention used by new jersey and 15 other states in hearings here at the northern regional unit at kearny , a department of corrections center , men who have finished their prison terms are involuntarily committed as psychiatric patients and , with a handful of exceptions , are recommitted each year mr deavers is one of 287 sexually violent predators in two highsecurity psychiatric centers in the state the law has long allowed the commitment of mentally ill people who pose an imminent danger to others but the detention of these men , many legal experts say , is a striking departure from the principle that people who are not mentally ill may be confined only for their acts , not their thoughts in yearly review hearings , the men are judged by their sexual tastes and fantasies or what psychiatrists suppose to be their fantasies as well as their performance on psychological tests , their attitudes toward authority and their willingness to acknowledge their crimes and disorders many are rapists or child molesters , and the fear that they might commit more of the same crimes is grave in 1998 new jersey like other states reacting to murders by sex offenders with previous convictions authorized the commitment of anyone who has served time for a sex crime and is found to have a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes him likely to commit another crime these men are to be given treatment , chiefly group therapy , until they are judged no longer dangerous five years later , only a handful have been released , and critics of the commitment process psychiatrists , civilliberties advocates and even some early supporters of the law are concerned that it is merely an exercise rigged to keep sex offenders locked up for a lifetime one kearny resident , committed after five years in prison for having sex with a teenager , said , i 'd be better off if i 'd killed him the process is severe for a purpose dealing with a type of criminal that society regards as dangerous , devious and manipulative new jersey s law is considered one of the strictest , prompted in part by the 1994 rape and murder of a 7yearold , megan kanka , by a neighbor who had served two prison terms for sexually assaulting children supporters of the law note that most of those committed are repeat offenders , and say they warrant every effort to determine whether they might commit future crimes as hard as it may be to predict behavior , they say , the alternative is waiting for another rape yet because of the secrecy surrounding the law , few of those supporters know how it has been put into practice new jersey , more than most states , seals the commitment process from public view it is one of three states that do not have juries at the hearings , which are closed to protect patients' confidentiality patients' names never enter any public record the decisions of the two superior court judges who handle all the cases are sealed but in a halfdozen recent cases , a new york times reporter was allowed , with the patients' permission , to attend hearings at kearny those proceedings along with interviews with lawyers who represent sex offenders , with some current and former state employees and with more than a dozen patients offer a glimpse into the workings of the sexually violent predator act the proceedings are a mix of psychiatry and law that according to many in both professions , blurs distinctions the system has long made between the mad and the bad the hearings are roughly modeled on commitments for the mentally ill , but with a key difference in a regular civil commitment , the focus is on the patient s current state of mind crimes committed long ago are usually not considered relevant in the hearings at kearny , however , criminal records are considered critical evidence of the patient s thoughts , behavior and possibility of committing future crimes since the patient s state of mind is at issue , almost any information about him is admissible , including much that would be barred in a criminal proceeding , like hearsay evidence , evaluations written years ago by the police or psychiatrists , statements to therapists and the patient s own writings
philosophers have described soul mates as two halves of the same whole each half wanders the earth , searching for its complement that is a concept that often comes to mind when one listens to the music pete kember and jason pierce have released in the last dozen years in the 80 s mr kember \( also known as sonic boom \) and mr pierce \( also known as jason spaceman \) played together in a band from rugby , england that band was called spacemen 3 its music filtered garage rock through the long lens of minimalism with whispered vocals and droning guitars , spacemen 3 turned songs into textures and albums into moods long before radiohead the overall effect is best described by the title of one of their albums , taking drugs to make music to take drugs to since the band split up in 1990 , both mr kember and mr pierce have released highquality albums on their own mr kember with the bands spectrum and experimental audio research , and mr pierce with the group spiritualized but , as good as their postspacemen efforts have been , none have matched the breathless beauty , sonic intensity and musical prescience of their work together the best evidence of this comes in the form of new releases from spiritualized , spacemen 3 and sonic boom amazing grace spiritualized first he was too early , now he s too late on amazing grace \( spaceman sanctuary \) , mr pierce returns to the vein of garage rock mined by spacemen 3 recorded in three weeks , amazing grace is a relatively simple and raw recording for the ambitious mr pierce there s just a string section , a brass section , dozens of different guitars and keyboards , backing choruses , a junkyard s worth of percussion instruments and a guest appearance from the avantgarde saxophonist evan parker the beauty of the album comes from its contrasts gospel lyrics are delivered with punk attitude , and mockclassical arrangements fight for transcendence over threechord garage rock this album comes on like a braking race car , opening with pure adrenalized rock 'n' roll before shifting down to a pensive , minimal drone though it may not be spiritualized s best album , songs like hold on , oh baby and lay it down slow are rapture in slow motion forged prescriptions spacemen 3 released in 1987 , the perfect prescription was spacemen 3 s masterpiece , a guitardriven trip in which the droning lows were as addictive as the exploding highs on forged prescriptions \( space age recordings \) , mr kember returns to the album and releases it anew with a different track order , more guitars , a betterfidelity mix and different versions of some songs what is interesting about spacemen 3 is that nearly every song is inspired by something arguably greater than itself on forged prescriptions \( and the bonus disc of outtakes and alternate versions \) , songs by lou reed , red krayola and the 13th floor elevators become jumping off points for some of the most mindnumbing psychedelic rock of the era though i prefer the original cd version of the original recording \( especially since it includes the stunning 17minute bonus track rollercoaster \) , some songs on the remix cd sound better than the originals though it may not be for everyone , spacemen 3 s prescription be it forged or perfect stands as the pinnacle of the genre that this band singlehandedly reinvented sonic souvenirs dean wareham and britta phillips it has been several years since mr kember released any new music , though he has said that he was working on a new spectrum album in the meantime he has remixed five songs by dean wareham and britta phillips \( both members of the slowrock band luna \) on sonic souvenirs \( jetset \) the songs are a good match for mr kember , and his remixing here seems to be a subtractive process even when he adds music , he still manages to make it sound like less photos

washington , july 16 american intelligence agencies failed to obtain reliable human sources inside the afghanistan training camps run by al qaeda before the september 2001 attacks , according to government officials who have read an unreleased congressional report on intelligence lapses in the months before the hijackings the absence of such sources left counterterrorism officials largely blind to osama bin laden s specific intentions before the attacks and contributed to what the joint intelligence committees concluded in their report was a lack of knowledge about al qaeda even as the agencies for years collected information that showed the terror network hoped to strike inside united states the failure of human intelligence is a new finding from a report that , according to some people who have read it , will provide many important new insights into the activities of american intelligence agencies before the attacks other officials , including some from intelligence agencies criticized in the report , said it would shed little new light on the events leading up to the attacks the central intelligence agency has long disputed having had problems obtaining high quality human intelligence in afghanistan asked to comment on the report s findings , a cia spokesman referred to testimony by george j tenet , the agency s director , last oct 17 mr tenet said the agency put in place in 1999 an intelligence collection program against mr bin laden the operation included a blend of aggressive human source collection both unilateral and with foreign partners and technical collection the result , mr tenet said , was a large stable of assets the nearly 900page joint committee report is scheduled to be made public on july 24 after months of delays caused by disagreements over how much of it could be declassified the report is based on a lengthy inquiry that included nine public hearings and 13 closed sessions conducted last year by a joint panel of the house and senate intelligence committees the report , which has been sent to the government s printing office , is the product of months of sometimes rancorous negotiations between the committee s staff , the bush administration and intelligence agencies cited in the reports , among them the cia , the federal bureau of investigation and the national security agency nearly one entire section of the report , describing the actions of foreign governments in advance of the attacks , has been cut from the final report at the insistence of the intelligence agencies , officials said unlike most other government intelligence reports , how much has been edited out will be publicly known because the final report shows the deleted material , with the actual words blacked out by a marker it s a solid report , said eleanor hill , the staff director of the investigation who supervised the writing of the report referring to the lengthy negotiations , ms hill said we prevailed on some issues they prevailed on others , and there were some areas in which i felt they could have declassified more information but in general it will give the public a pretty clear picture some mysteries from after the attacks will apparently remain , like the question of how 15 young men from saudi arabia could join in a suicide conspiracy to attack the world trade center and the pentagon without the knowledge of the saudi government congressional officials had hoped that the report would provide the first authoritative assessment of whether saudi arabia played any role , even unwittingly but the intelligence agencies were aggressive in their efforts to limit how much the report would disclose about the issue senator bob graham , a florida democrat who was chairman of the senate intelligence committee during the inquiry , has said that the question of the role of saudi arabia and other countries will remain secret in an appearance on monday on cnn , mr graham said in response to a question that the report would provide only very shrouded coverage of the role played by foreign governments mr graham , a candidate for the democratic presidential nomination , added , unless there is a change at the white house between now and the release day of this report , the american people will again be denied access to information that in my judgment they deserve to have after last year s hearings , the committee concluded that the fbi and the cia had missed warning signals of the attacks and focused too much attention on threats overseas rather than on the possibility of an attack in the united states the hearings provided a much fuller account of the hijacking plot and 19 hijackers than the bush administration has ever revealed in part , the tone of the debate over the final report mirrors the disagreements between the committee staff and intelligence agencies that raged throughout the inquiry when a series of combative and critical interim reports by ms hill s staff infuriated senior officials at the fbi and the cia as a result , the pending release of the final report has stirred further anxiety within the government for their part , representatives of intelligence agencies said they made no effort to protect their agencies from embarrassment , but sought to keep information out of the report only when it threatened to compromise intelligence sources and collection methods one official who has read the report said counterterrorism officials regularly complained about the absence of human intelligence from the afghanistan camps , saying that counterterrorism analysts were forced to rely on reports from foreign intelligence services , satellite imagery and intercepted communications , none of which detected any advance sign of the impending attacks we had amazing satellite pictures of them having graduation ceremonies at the camps , but we never had a clue what they planned to do when they left afghanistan , one official said
milan , march 4 four women closed the italian fall 2003 season today , their clothes changing the tempo and temperament of fashion after years of male domination , have the women finally taken over macho milan \? donatella versace sent out her best collection since she took over her late brother s house six years ago at marni , consuelo castiglioni fled the commune the boho prints , the hippie fringe for sophisticated tweeds draped in cocoons of featherlight fur miuccia prada continued to sort out the boys from the girls , creating a cerebral sisterhood at miu miu \( and , inevitably , a few dunces and librarian types \) , while angela missoni let herself be a little bit of a diva this has been a season of design in which women , far more than men , drew from the well of their own personalities , none more so than ms versace it took a moment to realize tonight , as the models stalked an oval runway to the dance classic pump up the jam , their ironed hair lengthened with extensions , that each was the lacquered essence of donatella she was spoofing herself her unabashed love of glamour , the womanly body going around in tootight pants and tipsy heels yet she was also serious , getting down to business at the outset with streamlined pantsuits and pencil skirts in white or putty stretch wool the neutral daytime palette remained constant , in sync with the emphatic silhouette , its line broken only by eyepopping coats in lynx and leather swinging with fringe pants stretched over the buttocks , leaving the soft part just below the waist showing and some of the models might mind about the view from the rear but what mattered more was that ms versace was audaciously putting herself into the clothes ms castiglioni must have sensed , as her audience did , that she had become hemmed in by her artsandcrafts style , and that if she did n't stretch herself , think harder , she was going to be some kind of den mother to the weird and dippy her most sophisticated gesture was to combine boyish tweed shorts \( cuffed and worn over high brown boots \) with frankly glamorous furs made out of horizontal strips of fox or raccoon connected by ribbons , they puffed weightlessly over the body there were wrap skirts in tweed and rusticlooking tunic tops gathered with thin leather belts ms castiglioni revisited some of her artsy effects , scattering circles of red sequins over the yoke of a dress and putting loose jumpers in gray flannel over abstract print tops but even these touches revealed a new dimension to her talent miu miu is often a kind of junior addendum to the prada collection , and this season ms prada evidently felt she had still more to say about the evolving mix of men s and women s clothes she opened with a stiff cotton coat fastened with turnkey locks , a style that instantly evoked the early 1960 s and the american sportswear maverick bonnie cashin yoked over the shoulders was a mink that might have been vintage in any case , it seemed to run into the fur tippet debouching from the model s neck on her arms were long , wooly gloves too much \? perhaps there were moments when the tweed and tattersall layers , puffed with motley fur and mixed with crepe , vintageprint skirts , seemed stuffy and overdreamed and yet the collection was loaded with so many ideas , connected in some way to ms prada s own eclectic approach to dressing , that it was impossible to dwell on a few dunces loose tshirts , for instance , were an ingenious blend of knitting \( across the shoulders \) and cotton jersey printed with cartoon drawings those drawings also appeared in a print on nude chiffon dresses and skirts worn over sexy undergarments the collection had an innocence , expressed in lowslung flannel trousers and manly oxfords but it also had a knowing decadence , as if the sorority had broken into the old boys' club and made off with their vests ms missoni s collection had polish and steam snug jackets in a zigzag m lange of orange , brown and aqua , finished with a brown border and worn with hot pants , hinted of the 1960 s but a missoni knit can bear only so much mod simplification before it starts to look like the petrified reflection of a matron staring into the windows at scully scully after a combout the designer gave everything more eccentric flavor , tossing fox stoles over clingy sweaters and pairing black tights with creamy hoyden stilettos the clothes looked coordinated and not trousers in saffron yellow satin worn with a jersey blouse in sunset swirls , and the caprice of an apricot fox stole moseying over the shoulder photos missoni gave trousers a mannish look and sent them out with a swirlprint blouse topped by a fox stole donatella versace topped tight trousers with a tshirt and a coat with trailing fringes and wide military lapels from miu miu , a tweed skirt with a knit and cotton jersey miu miu s cartoonprint crepe chiffon dress marni s geometric print outfit a tweed wrap skirt with a jacket of ribbon and fox fur , from marni \( photographs by associated press \)
the life of justice william o douglas reads like a novel he was on the supreme court of the united states for over 36 years , longer than anyone else , going through four wives , seven presidents and four impeachment attempts his image has been that of an antigovernment idealist pitted against an establishment that blanched at his much younger wives and his stand against the vietnam war now that a new book about douglas says he lied about \( or at least embellished \) many parts of his life from having had childhood polio to graduating second in his law school class some scholars are again asking what such information reveals about the legacy and work of judges , especially those on the supreme court in wild bill the legend and life of william o douglas \( random house , 35 \) , bruce allen murphy , a professor of civil rights at lafayette college in easton , pa , argues that douglas s sloppiness in framing and writing supreme court decisions and his penchant for falsehood stemmed from boredom with the high court and a deep need to invent the person he wanted to be a politician yet after romping through more than 700 pages about douglas s lies and his meanness to his wives and children , some scholars take issue with the idea that douglas s or any other judge s personal biography is crucial in determining a judicial legacy these traditional biographies are pointless if you 're interested in understanding the significance of the judge as a judge , said richard a posner , a judge for the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit and a senior lecturer at the university of chicago law school citing a book of his , mr posner continued i said what are needed are critical studies , as opposed to biographies the relation between personal character and professional reputation is often nonexistent people operate on different tracks very successful people , when you look at them , they very often turn out to be psychological basket cases they were successful in part because they were driven by some deep personal insecurity mr posner recently gave wild bill a mostly favorable review in the new republic but said professor murphy did not adequately interpret douglas s judicial work he wrote that none of douglas s personal failings would have mattered except that douglas presented his life to the public as exemplary of american individualism and achievement melvin i urofsky , a professor of history and public policy at virginia commonwealth university in richmond and an editor of a book of douglas s letters , agrees to an extent he said douglas s primary legacy was as a supreme court justice in the end , that s what really counts not whether he was a scoundrel , a liar , a womanizer still , he says that looking solely at the judicial record is too narrow if you believe a person s life informs their work , it does matter clearly , thurgood marshall s background had a great deal to do with his position on capital punishment , seeing how blacks were disproportionately sentenced to death in the south , he said he added that justice sandra day o'connor talked about how she faced discrimination in her law career because she was a woman and therefore had a special interest in sex discrimination cases professor urofsky noted that other biographies had hinted at douglas s lies and that it was long known in academic and legal circles that he was a womanizer and made things up in his autobiographies professor murphy s book , he said , documents even more lying david j danelski , a retired professor who is working on his own douglas biography , and some of douglas s former associates contend that although douglas exaggerated , he was basically a decent , smart man in particular , they say , professor murphy does not prove that douglas never had polio as a child or that he lied about his class rank or whether his first wife supported him in law school \( still percolating is a debate that hinges on technicalities over whether douglas was legitimately buried in arlington cemetery wild bill says that douglas lied about serving in the war \) professor murphy stands by his work , saying i tried to look at douglas s life and connect the image with the decisions he was writing they do connect if you read who he says he was in his autobiographies , you can see the iconoclast , leftwing , antigovernment jurist but much of what he wrote about himself cannot be confirmed now , who was douglas really \? he was a very frustrated and disappointed politician that frustration translated into sloppiness on the high court , professor murphy said douglas s inattention to detail can be found even in one of his most influential opinions , griswold v connecticut , which defended the right of marital privacy and is seen as a precursor to roe v wade , which affirmed a woman s right to abortion , professor murphy writes the first draft of douglas s opinion about the sacred association of marriage coming from a muchmarried and unfaithful judge was hastily written and narrowly constructed , he says it was justice william j brennan jr and his law clerks , he said , who expounded on the right of privacy in this case , which was brought to the court by the state s planned parenthood league the league had been convicted of violating anticontraception law by dispensing advice and contraceptives to married couples as a result of brennan s successful lobbying , douglas was credited by his supporters with being even more activist , 'inventing' the right of privacy and 'finding' it in the constitution , professor allen writes the question of the best way to make sense of the career of a judge pops up from time , as judicial biographies are written justices like felix frankfurter , oliver wendell holmes , and louis d brandeis have been puzzled over for decades in various biographies and studies in the case of holmes , for example , scholars have tried to figure out how his civil war experience formed who he was and how some of his misanthropic comments squared with his enduring reputation for being a passionate defender of the first amendment it is not easy to make a coherent story of a judicial career , lawrence m friedman wrote in the new york times in a 1984 review of brandeis and frankfurter a dual biography by leonard baker mr friedman , a law professor , argued that understanding the work of the court required knowledge of the statutes and procedures the social , economic and political milieu and the personal life of the judge that s where biography comes in there is no substitute for a look at a justice s written work , but biographies like this can show why a judge did what he or she did , said james l swanson , a lawyer and editor in chief of the cato supreme court review , which is published by the cato institute , a libertarian research foundation in washington the book did change my opinion of douglas , mr swanson continued as important as the result is how the justice got there , what type of legal analysis the justice used photo justice william o douglas at age 40 in 1939 \( harris ewing \)

detroit , sept 11 the big three and the united automobile workers are on the brink of an unprecedented early and simultaneous resolution to their contract talks , people close to the negotiations said the parties are looking to wrap up negotiations before midnight sunday , when the fouryear labor contracts expire reaching an accord at all three companies would be a historic sign of unity between the union and management , but time is running short and hiccups have a way of derailing negotiations two weeks ago , i thought the odds were fairly high against it , said buzz hargrove , the president of the canadian auto workers union , referring to the chances for an early threeinone deal for the united auto workers , something that has never happened before i still find it highly unlikely but not impossible , mr hargrove added , because there really is a clear effort to do it at all three representatives of ford motor , general motors and the chrysler group unit of daimlerchrysler and the union would not comment substantively on the talks we 've been working hard since our handshake and making steady progress , said anne marie gattari , a ford spokeswoman , referring to the ceremonial handshake between management and union leaders that opened the talks last month we 're moving in the right direction traditionally , the union picks one company as a target and negotiates an agreement with it that first deal becomes the framework the others follow negotiations with the target company traditionally go up to the deadline , and sometimes beyond it , and are often contentious this time , ron gettelfinger , the new president of the union , is pushing hard for an early deal to send a signal to wall street , the media and anyone else listening that the union is basically in accord with the big three why \? one need look no further than august sales results , when the combined market share of gm , ford and chrysler reached a record low in august , toyota also surpassed chrysler in sales for the first time the milestone was largely symbolic , because toyota , which includes lexus , still trailed daimlerchrysler , which includes mercedes but , coming during contract talks , it was quite a potent symbol of the declining fortunes of the domestic industry and its dwindling union , which had fewer than 700 , 000 members last year , compared with 15 million in 1980 increasingly , the union and the big three see themselves as allies in a fight against foreignbased nonunion rivals companies like toyota , honda and nissan have assembly plants in the united states , but none are represented by a union , except for joint ventures like a plant operated by toyota and general motors in california neither are domestic plants owned by bmw or mercedes what it says is both sides are dealing with each other from great weakness , said gerald c meyers , a professor at the university of michigan and the former chairman of american motors , now a part of daimlerchrysler the auto companies are struggling , professor meyers said the volume is high enough , but they ca n't make any money at these prices neither side wants a strike , especially because companies like toyota have been siphoning off market share from the big three this year , through august , the market share of the traditional domestic auto industry was 601 percent , down from 619 percent last year , according to the autodata corporation and that decline occurred despite a price war that increased industry sales as detroit far outspent rivals on rebates and cutrate financing deals the two of them are basically on the same side , they have a common enemy , professor meyers said what s the old saying \? the enemy of my enemy is my friend and that s about the way it is gary chaison , a professor of industrial relations at clark university in worcester , mass , said what we have now is really remarkable , if you think about it it s the union and the big three trying to figure out a way of living together where they can face off the nonunion companies , professor chaison added it is probable , too , that the union thinks a nonconfrontational approach might help in what have thus far been fruitless efforts to form unions at automakers that are not in the big three if they seem too militant , professor chaison said , they may turn off organizing efforts at parts plants , or at toyota or mercedes workers want protection , but they also want to avoid conflict with employers the crucial issues in the talks include the considerable health care benefits the big three pay to hundreds of thousands of workers , retirees and their families for gm , which has the largest proportion of retirees , health costs average 1 , 200 a vehicle that is a serious competitive disadvantage , considering their foreign competitors' costs are much lower because they are based in countries with nationalized health care systems and have almost no retirees in this country mr gettelfinger has drawn a line in the sand over the issue , insisting that his members will keep their health benefits but concessions are expected in other areas , including cutting back on wage increases , allowing plants to close and changing some work rules will the triple deal happen \? mr hargrove said his canadian auto workers union , which agreed to new contracts with the big three last year , would not have enough people to conduct negotiations in earnest with the three companies simultaneously we would n't have enough people to cover it negotiators , the health and safety experts , the pension experts , he said , adding , when you have three of them , especially when you 're the quarterback trying to run three fields , it s quite a challenge , i 'd say

this month , composers recordings inc , the scrappy nonprofit label that has maintained the most eclectic , undogmatic and adventurous catalog in the field of contemporary music , will shut down after 48 years composers recordings , which also styles itself cri , put out dozens of landmark recordings of elliott carter , roger sessions , ralph shapey and other major composers , and also championed american mavericks , like wallingford riegger , virgil thomson and david del tredici not many record companies have released , on one hand , sober albums like milton babbitt piano music since 1983 , with works by a brainy american serialist and , on the other , trendy compilations like gay american composers over its lifetime cri has produced some 900 recordings and as a matter of policy , none were ever removed from the catalog naturally , the demise of cri is being lamented in the field and pointed to as another grim indicator that the classical recording industry is tottering but there is a potential upside to this story new world records , another essential nonprofit label , specializing in american music from the colonial era to the present , is poised to take over the cri catalog , releasing an undetermined number of titles but the plan also calls for new world to digitize the master tapes of the complete cri archive and keep each album available as a custommade cd , burned to order and mailed to the buyer with the original liner notes not only that , new world is exploring the possibility of making cri recordings available through digital downloads , as that technology becomes more viable so what seems a simple act of one nonprofit s salvaging another s catalog could represent a bold step into the online future of recording the demise of cri is a story of a custodianship that ultimately proved economically untenable the company was long a responsible keeper of its catalog new world will continue this component of the mission if anything , according to paul marotta , new world s managing director , the distribution of archival recordings should be improved , thanks to the technologies now available of course there is an emotional aspect to the ending of cri , mr marotta said but the story is being told with such gloom and doom new world records is healthy and well run we intend to take up this challenge and fulfill it the other aspect of artistic custodianship involves cultivating an audience for the art form , and cri was less adept at this the board saw the troubles coming years ago founded in 1954 by the composers otto luening and douglas moore , both then teaching at columbia , and oliver daniel , an arts administrator , the company welcomed composers who were being ignored by commercial labels large and small recognizing that some of the music it recorded was important but specialist fare unlikely to have widespread appeal , cri became a nonprofit in 1976 though this move stabilized the label , it meant that composers who wanted their projects considered would now be expected to find their own financing the company kept trying to connect with larger audiences under the energetic leadership of joseph dalton from 1990 to 2000 , cri reached out to the downtown newmusic scene and began a series for ethnic composers , like tania le n and chen yi but in the mid90 s , the larger industry fell victim to a concurrence of declining sales and product gluts john g schultz , who had worked as a manager for the soprano jessye norman and an administrator at qualiton imports , a record distributor , became the executive director of cri in 2000 it was , mr schultz conceded recently , an exasperating experience even though cri was a nonprofit , he said , we still had to do marketing , promos and sales and , he added , we could not meet our daytoday operating costs while the commercial industry around us was collapsing in cri s last years , its annual budget has been roughly 500 , 000 with retail sales essentially nonexistent , mr schultz said , the company was dangerously reliant on grants from foundations like the aaron copland fund for music and the alice ditson fund of columbia university but such funds rarely provided more than 75 , 000 in a given year as one significant achievement of mr schultz s tenure at cri , he instituted a program to sell cd s through the internet some major orchestras have been learning how effective this distribution method can be the london symphony orchestra , on its own lso live label , and the san francisco symphony , on its sfs media label , garnered grammy awards in the last two years for selfproduced projects colin davis s account of berlioz s epic opera , les troyens , with the london symphony , and michael tilson thomas s performance of mahler s sixth symphony with the san francisco symphony but at cri , direct distribution accounted for only 20 percent of sales and at a specialty label like cri , selling even 500 total copies of a cd over several years was thought a decent success four historic reissues of music by the selftaught experimental composer harry partch sold some 15 , 000 copies total , a breakthrough achievement excellent reviews , some strategically smart advertising and wordofmouth buzz drew that elusive general audience to these cd s of partch s ethnictinged music , composed entirely for the exotic instruments he invented himself , like organs with 43note scales , gourd trees and cone gongs

cama ari , brazil from the heart of its plant here , braskem , the product of the recent merger of six brazilian petrochemical companies , certainly looks imposing , with ducts , pipelines , tanks and flares as far as the eye can see and by latin american standards , braskem is , indeed , huge it is brazil s fifthlargest industrial group , with some 3 , 000 employees , 13 factories in four states and 31 billion in assets in 2001 , combined sales of the six companies that now make up braskem were 18 billion but compared with globestraddling competitors like dow chemical or basell polyolefins , a 5050 joint venture of royal dutch shell and basf , braskem is a dwarf basell has annual sales of more than 65 billion , and dow , which swallowed union carbide in 2001 , recorded sales that year of 28 billion so when braskem s chief executive , jos carlos grubisich , said that a principal point of the merger was to create in brazil , with brazilian capital , a petrochemical player with real chances of having international ambitions , what does he mean \? of course the big guys like dow and basf have business volumes that are far bigger than ours , but we are highly competitive in the region , mr grubisich said at a recent interview at the plant in cama ari , an industrial district in the northeastern state of bahia where the company is based our priority is to consolidate our regional leadership , and then , in a second phase , take steps toward the internationalization of our business in latin america , we have an advantage of scale over the subsidiaries of the big players , he said we are now the region s undisputed market leader on a divideandrule basis , mr grubisich is right , at least for south america , where braskem vies with basell for leadership of the polypropylene market , leads dow in polyethylene sales and splits the pvc market equally with solvay of belgium none of the big multinationals have a presence in all sectors in the region , though they operate in various sectors of the industry around the world the creation of braskem will change the nature of the petrochemical market in brazil , if not regionally , said ian dunn , who until recently was basell s senior vice president for south america braskem has a structure and a capacity to squeeze the market and the competition in a way we will be very interested in watching for now , mr grubisich , 46 , who moved to braskem from the french chemical group rhodia , said his top priority was to put into effect 115 projects to cut costs and improve efficiencies among the six merged companies that make up braskem that should save braskem some 85 million a year , he said , freeing up more of the company s 400 million cash flow to repay its hefty 2 billion debt , nearly 70 percent of which is dollarlinked the merger of companies controlled by the odebrecht and mariani families , which now control braskem signifies a sort of coming of age for brazil s outdated petrochemical industry until recently , it had sat by as the industry worldwide integrated production from raw materials to more complex plastic resins the petrochemical sector in brazil is consolidating very late in the day , said luis nassif , a leading business commentator for the daily folha de s o paulo had this been done during the privatization process in the early 90 s , braskem could have been a world player by now mr nassif said that without the merger the brazilian market would have been fragmented and open to the risk of dow coming in and taking over the sector now , braskem has gained critical mass , he said not all analysts agree that brazil s petrochemical industry would be so attractive to foreigners luis paulo foggetti , an analyst at the s o paulo brokerage firm fator doria atherino , said it would take 5 to 10 years for it to modernize enough to lure foreign capital for now , he said , the industry was too dependent on supplies from the state oil giant , petr leo brasileiro , or petrobras , and on imported technology , and most companies are still largely family owned brazil s chemical exports totaled 35 billion in 2001 , but imports totaled 107 billion the 72 billion shortfall was one of the largest sectoral deficits in brazil s trade account had there been no merger , however , it would have meant a further step back , mr foggetti said you might have seen petrobras having to intervene in all those various companies generally , investors have yet to be convinced by the merger , which was announced in august between then and the end of november , braskem s shares , which had already been heading down on expectations of the merger , slid nearly 40 percent in the s o paulo exchange , and they are still down around 20 percent its american depository receipts have had an even bumpier ride in december , the company announced a 470 million loss for the first three quarters , though that was largely a result of the brazilian currency s 40 percent devaluation against the dollar , which affects the company s debt and its margins mr grubisich , however , says he is confident that braskem will soon impress investors unlike the industrialized world , latin america still has huge growth potential , he said brazilians , for example , use 50 pounds of plastic per capita a year , compared with 176 pounds per capita in europe in 2001 , brazil s plastics industry had revenue of 91 billion , according to the country s association of plastic producers , off 6 percent from 2000 s numbers in dollar terms , but the group predicts that the current demand of four million tons will almost double by 2008 but for regional demand for plastics to increase , overall economic growth , which has been held back by recession in argentina and virtual stagnation in brazil and venezuela , must take off again and the industry itself must try to develop local technology to wean the industry off its dependence on imports as it works to produce more finished products brazil needs to examine the value chain of its plastics industry , mr grubisich said our clients need to export more what s the point of us exporting plastic resin to asia and then asian industries producing plastic bags with it to sell back to brazil \? map of brazil highlighting cama ari cama ari is the headquarters for braskem , created in a merger

the national academy of sciences has now released its longawaited study of the environmental consequences of three decades of oil drilling along alaska s north slope the report concludes that these consequences have been largely unfavorable and are likely to get worse despite efforts by the oil companies to minimize damage the report did not address the likely effect of drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge , an adjacent property coveted by the oil companies and the bush administration but it presents a disturbing picture of what could happen , even with improvements in drilling technology , and is thus another good argument for leaving the refuge alone oil was discovered on the north slope in 1968 the area has since supplied about 20 percent of america s domestic production , but at considerable environmental cost the reproductive rates of certain bird species , including snow geese , eiders and some shorebirds , have declined female caribou are producing fewer calves , while offshore seismic activity has driven whales out to sea and beyond the hunting range of native communities the report also says that thousands of acres of tundra vegetation have been destroyed and that wilderness values a broader term encompassing solitude and scenic qualities have been compromised in a much larger area the problem has not been the individual wells but associated infrastructure , like roads , pipelines and housing none of this is likely to deter congressional proponents of drilling in the refuge s coastal plain , an undisturbed 15millionacre wilderness that cannot be drilled without specific authorization by congress nor is it likely to deter gale norton , the secretary of the interior , who has lately been quite busy searching for oil elsewhere in alaska in recent months , her department has moved to open 88 million acres in the northwest corner of the national petroleum reserve , while seeking to ease important environmental protections imposed by the clinton administration when it made 46 million acres in the reserve s northeast corner available for leasing in 1998 her department also plans to lease nearly 10 million acres in the beaufort sea off the state s northern edge as this page has pointed out , there are better ways to decrease america s dependence on foreign oil than punching holes in the arctic merely requiring suv s to meet the same fuel economy standards as ordinary cars would save one million barrels a day , more than the refuge could produce at peak volume once again the burden of fashioning a rational energy strategy that emphasizes conservation falls on the halfdozen republican senators who helped derail president bush s efforts to open up the refuge last year their votes will be needed to ensure that the administration s assault on alaska does not get any worse than it already is
washington , sept 19 jetblue airways acknowledged publicly today that it had provided a pentagon contractor with information on more than one million of its passengers as part of a program to track down terrorists and other high risk passengers that data , which was turned over in violation of the airline s own privacy policies , was then used to identify the passengers' social security numbers , financial histories and occupations jetblue , a threeyearold discount airline , sent an email message to passengers this week , conceding that it had made a mistake in providing the records last year to torch concepts , an army contractor in huntsville , ala , for a research project on airline passenger risk assessment this was a mistake on our part and i know you and many of our customers feel betrayed by it , said david neeleman , jetblue s chief executive , in an email message that the airline , based in new york , said was sent to about 150 passengers who had written in so far to complain mr neeleman , the founder of jetblue , which has been a rare success in the airline industry and has prospered because of its reputation for low fares and consumer friendliness , insisted that none of the passenger information was shared with the government the sole set of data in torch s possession has been destroyed , he wrote no government agency ever had access to it privacy rights groups expressed astonishment that jetblue had shared so much passenger information with a contractor , describing the privacy breach as among the most serious reported by any american company in recent years jetblue s announcement comes at a time when many civil liberties groups are warning that privacy rights are becoming victims of the government s struggle against terrorism and the desire of law enforcement and intelligence agencies for quick access to customer information that has traditionally been closely held by corporations the airline said it had provided torch concepts with records on about five million individual itineraries , reflecting the travels of about 11 million passengers in 2001 and 2002 the records , it said , would have included the passengers' names , addresses and phone numbers but not credit card numbers or government identification numbers commonly collected from travelers like passport numbers a lawyer for torch concepts , richard marsden , said that the passenger records provided by jetblue were destroyed by the contractor earlier this week after the existence of the project was reported by wired news , a technologynews web site it s all been destroyed in the last 24 hours , he said in a telephone interview but privacy advocates said further investigation was needed five million is a big number , said marc rotenberg , executive director of the electronic privacy information center in washington jetblue passengers have reason to be very upset will the data be destroyed \? will there be some compensation for the passengers \? mr neeleman said that the passenger information was turned over last year as a result of an exceptional request from the department of defense to assist their contractor , torch concepts , with a project regarding military base security he said that jetblue was told that this project had no connection with aviation security the pentagon , which was still largely shut down because of hurricane isabel , had no immediate comment on the issue torch concepts , which describes itself in promotional material as a contentmanagement and informationmining company , was hired by the army more than three years ago to determine how information from public and private records might be analyzed to help defend military bases from attack by terrorists and other adversaries while the company has insisted that the army study was never intended to be used to improve security at civilian airports , there was clearly discussion within the company of whether its research might be of use to the department of homeland security , which is responsible for airport security in a study prepared in february and released at a symposium sponsored by the homeland security department , torch concepts said that several data elements have been identified which best distinguish normal jetblue passengers from past terrorists the report said that after receiving the passenger information from jetblue , torch concepts matched the passenger names against a variety of databases that it had purchased from acxiom , a large consumer research company for approximately 40 percent of the passengers , the report said , the acxiom databases provided additional demographic information , including a passenger s social security number , occupation , income , gender and home and carownership history , as well as the number of adults and children living in the passenger s household mr marsden said the company and its study had no link to the pentagon s broad electronic surveillance project known as terrorist information awareness , which has drawn harsh criticism from capitol hill and from privacy groups in recent months who consider it an effort to intrude on the rights of americans in the name of counterterrorism nor , he said , was there any link between the torch concepts' project and a huge government passengerscreening program that is now being developed by the transportation security administration the government s antiterrorism program , the second phase in a effort known as the computer assisted passenger prescreening system , has also been criticized by privacy advocates as overly intrusive gareth edmondsonjones , a spokesman for jetblue , said in a telephone interview that the decision to provide the passenger information to torch concepts was a clear violation of the company s own policy we have the strongest privacy policy in the industry , which clearly says that we do n't supply customer data to third parties , he said asked if mr neeleman or other senior executives had approved the sharing of the passenger information , mr edmondsonjones said he did not know , adding that there had been no discussion of disciplinary action against anyone at the company for the policy breach that s not even come up , he said we made the decision as a company , at whatever level it was done he suggested that the decision to turn over the passenger information to the contractor was motivated by the airline s concern with security in the aftermath of the sept 11 terrorist attacks in a post 9 11 word troubled by security issues and terrorists , we had a special request from the department of defense to assist in a military project , he said the decision was made to assist photo david neeleman , jetblue s chief executive , said in a recent email message to 150 passengers that this was a mistake on our part and i know you and many of our customers feel betrayed by it \( photo by associated press \) \( pg c14 \)
trying to categorize the tin hat trio is a mistake this is precisely the point many people who want to know more about music wonder what they are supposed to like this eclectic group is about banishing the supposeds and making , simply , music good music for those who need categories , here are a few klezmer , jazz , contemporary classical , rb , pop this music uses elements of all these categories and corresponds to none of them the trio plays violin , steel guitar , accordion , toy piano , prepared piano and on their recordings , at least whatever other instruments strike their fancy their latest release , rodeo eroded \( ropeadope \) , brings a tuba into the mix there was no tuba at the trio s concert at merkin hall on thursday night , part of the series new sounds live \( taped for broadcast on wnyc \) , but the group further defied categorization by breaking down into its component parts the first half of the program was devoted to music that the members rob burger \( keyboards \) , mark orton \( plucked strings \) and carla kihlstedt \( violins \) have been developing independently after the intermission , the three came together and offered selections from their three albums it made for a long , meaty , absorbing evening the trio has already spun off two new groups , offshoots of two cd projects that john zorn commissioned for a recording series called radical jewish culture mr burger s fourman lost photograph wove a wistful klezmery haze \( thanks to the clarinetist chris speed \) around fragments and snatches of folksounding tunes , evoking , in pieces like arturo the aquaboy , the sound of a rusting tin windup toy with her group 2 foot yard , ms kihlstedt presented the violinist as vocalist , singing her own lyrics in a fine whiskery breathypop soprano over the intertwined musings of cello \( marika hughes \) , percussion \( shahzad ismaily \) and her own violins \( one strung with four differently tuned e strings \) 2 foot yard took the uncategorizability of the evening about as far as it could go , way out on a limb and managed the acrobatic feat of pulling it off with music at once bizarre and compelling \( although the lyrics were hard to follow on a first hearing \) mr orton s two pieces were more conventional written compositions , one for clarinets and pump organ , reedy musings on the theme of darkness , and one for ms kihlstedt s violin both were actually excerpts of larger pieces and ms kihlstedt s solo itself sounded fragmentary , its shards not very satisfyingly explored by the time the tin hat trio itself took the stage , one was deeply curious to hear what these three strong musicians had come up with together they did n't disappoint if the trio is their day job , they should definitely keep it , whatever else they continue to do on the side whatever you want to call what they do , it makes you listen its borrowings go beyond pastiche rather , they offer a kind of esperanto of expression , using honkytonk waltzes , improvisatory solos , thoughtful , rasping held notes and accordion oompahs to get across what it is they want to say it s solid , appealing and fresh it also breaks down the categories of concert and club music some people will undoubtedly find that this is not what concert music is supposed to be like these people are part of the problem with the field in the first place

warsaw , feb 21 waiting for a mckielbasa sandwich at a downtown outlet of the world s most ubiquitous american fast food chain , a 29yearold economist did not hesitate when asked where he would stand if asked to choose between the united states and europe america is a better partner for us and i trust america more than france or any other country , said the economist , maciek wesolowski , joking that he was buying the mcdonald s sandwich a polish sausage on a hamburger bun in honor of polishamerican friendship poland , the largest and most economically promising of the 10 countries set to join the european union , is unapologetic about its enthusiastic american allegiance and its vocal resistance to the current quest by two traditional european powers , france and germany , to establish their political independence from the united states like its central and eastern european cousins , poland hopes integration into the european system will bring economic salvation and promote stability in a region still apprehensive from the memories of war but most poles believe that only the united states can guarantee the country s security as long as the us is a functioning reality and a united europe is a dream , we will always choose the reality over the dream , said janusz reiter , poland s former ambassador to germany and the director of the warsawbased center for international relations , a research organization that bodes ill for any swift and complete integration of the european union , which began more than a halfcentury ago as a sixnation common market intended to bond germany and france the union now has 15 member nations , but with the addition next year of 10 mostly former communist states , france and germany may find their traditional dominance harder to maintain certainly , this week s admonition by president jacques chirac of france to the central and eastern european candidate nations who support the american position on war with iraq to keep silent rather than undermine european unity won france no friends in poland he is trying to treat the eu candidates as a french colony or a french suburb , said mr wesolowski over his mcdonald s sandwich squeezed for centuries between germany , which last occupied and ravaged poland in world war ii , and russia , whose soviet dominance is an all too recent memory , poles so yearn for closeness to america home of millions of polish immigrants that some have even suggested the country should join the north american free trade agreement , not the european union but in the basement canteen of warsaw university law school , maciej szczerba , a recent graduate , hunched over a wooden table to explain that , despite reservations , poland had no alternative to the european trading bloc more than 20 percent of poland s workingage youth is unemployed , and economic growth has slowed since the burst of the 1990 s to 13 percent in the last two years the mood is very gloomy and everybody is waiting for eu accession , mr szczerba , 24 , said european union membership next year will bring in billions of dollars in subsidies for infrastructure , and gradually grant poles the coveted right to work and live anywhere in the member states a stark contrast with the closed borders of communist years yet ambivalence persists there have been large protests against the european union by poland s numerous farmers two opposition parties argue that membership will dilute poland s national identity the rev tadeusz rydzyk , a charismatic priest who controls one of the country s most popular radio stations , worries that it will erode the country s strong catholic faith there is serious concern among government officials and diplomats that a referendum in june on joining the european union may fail to draw the minimum 50 percent of the electorate required poles are n't enthusiastic about being subsumed by another entity , given their history of being subsumed , said a western diplomat who has lived for many years in the country indeed , as elsewhere in eastern europe , these questions of national identity , economic welfare and the frequently smallbore politics of emerging democracies often overwhelm global matters like possible war in iraq as a matter of everyday conversation polls show that the majority of poles oppose war with iraq a rare instance of not following the government in its proamerican position but the opposition is mostly passive when hundreds of thousands , even millions , of people turned out to protest a possible war in western european capitals last weekend , fewer than 2 , 000 protesters gathered in warsaw there is none of that hesitation , however , about the north atlantic treaty organization , which the poles along with the czechs and hungarians joined in 1999 the nato flag flies above the presidential palace in warsaw from 2008 , thanks to the purchase of 48 f16 fighters from the united states , poland will be able to fly in alliance operations that purchase of american rather than european warplanes has particularly angered european union officials because it will spend money freed from the state budget by incoming european union subsidies poland has become one of our most important allies at nato , given its strong military capabilities and clear political will to face the problem of global terrorism , the united states ambassador at nato , nicholas burns , said this week julius janiszewski , 24 , a law student at warsaw university whose greatgrandfather was killed by the germans , said of poland s support for the united states , we always felt when we were oppressed that america supported us , even during communist times as an example of how america can be counted on to act , mr janiszewski pointed to the wars in the balkans in the 1990 s a horrific war with terrible atrocities was stopped , not by france or germany or the european union , but by america , he said mr reiter , the former ambassador to germany , was clearer yet about poland s reluctance to follow any european policy that might mar the alliance with the united states if france considers this need for emancipation from the us as the basis for a common european security policy , it will not be supported by eastern european countries , he said yet it is plain to polish diplomats that europe cannot be just an economic unit , with no political voice we believe there is much sense in having a strong european voice , poland s foreign minister , wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , said in an interview but why must that be seen as competition or in contradiction with america \? the real problem is the method to achieve that common position , he said , adding that no country could expect to dominate the process we all have to learn how to live in a bigger family and in a family of equals mr reiter said the alternative is an economic bloc within which there would be political coalitions , and ad hoc coalitions would create an unbearable distrust between countries in europe it would destroy everything we 've built since world war ii photo mcdonald s in warsaw advertises a sandwich developed for poland a sovietbuilt

toronto , march 18 the islanders seem to be banking heavily on the fact that the national hockey league has to invite eight teams from each conference to the playoffs how else can another slow start in another important game be explained \? the islanders , who inched closer to clinching a playoff spot tonight with a 33 tie against the toronto maple leafs , were not impressed with their effort their three goals came in a desperate third period that followed two dull periods coach peter laviolette termed it a stolen point the islanders \( 3229102 \) , the eighthplace team in the eastern conference , lead montreal and the rangers by 6 points both of those teams have played one more game than the islanders the devils beat montreal tonight , 10 i think we played hard to steal it , laviolette said of the point earned but we put ourselves in that predicament toronto right wing owen nolan broke a 22 tie with his second goal of the game nolan took a perfect pass from robert reichel and beat goaltender rick dipietro 11 minutes 24 seconds into the third period but the islanders kept pressing defenseman janne niinimaa got the puck in the faceoff circle to the right of toronto goaltender ed belfour and flipped a shot that nicked off islanders center dave scatchard s stick , then went in with 2 35 remaining it was a pretty big goal for us , scatchard said of his 24th goal of the season the islanders had fallen behind , 20 , on nolan s first goal of the game , scored 9 24 into second period but they tied the score with goals from adrian aucoin and arron asham in a twominute span early in the third period michael peca won a faceoff in the maple leafs' zone and fed aucoin , who simply skated inside the blue line and put enough on a backhand that the puck skipped through belfour s legs at 6 57 of the third period it was aucoin s eighth goal asham then tied the score by poking the puck away from defenseman tomas kaberle at the maple leafs' blue line , skating in alone on belfour and whipping a shot past him 8 55 into the period asham s 11th goal ended a 15game streak without one i seemed to get good wood on it , but that really does n't matter , asham said the shot went in thank god it s been a long time ca n't complain about those toronto \( 392662 \) dominated the overtime period , but dipietro \( 27 saves \) , making his first start in eight days , made five saves in overtime he stopped the formidable mats sundin on consecutive shots in a frantic final minute it was a good confidencebuilder , dipietro said i like playing in this building it beats playing in front of 1 , 000 people in bridgeport the islanders took one shot in the first period a season low and would have been a lot further behind than one goal had it not been for dipietro he made several tough saves , including pad stops on robert svehla and nolan on tapin attempts alexander mogilny scored his 29th goal of the season on toronto s eighth shot of the game the islanders had none until oleg kvasha nudged a soft shot at belfour 19 11 into the period trailing the play , shawn bates went down in a heap and received an unsportsmanlike penalty for diving it was the islanders' second such penalty jason blake got one when nik antropov crosschecked him at the end of the first period toronto defenseman glen wesley , one of several veterans acquired at the trading deadline for the maple leafs' stanley cup push , fired a shot that was tipped by sundin dipietro stopped it , but nolan popped in the rebound at 9 24 as sundin fell on dipietro the islanders somehow rallied when asked if the team is still paying too much attention to the standing and the outoftown scoreboard , peca said i hope not i'm not thinking that way we did do that a little while ago but i think we learned our lesson not to get complacent

hiroshima , japan after 18 years of almost daily lectures about surviving the atomic bomb dropped here on aug 6 , 1945 , setsuko iwamoto s stories to classrooms full of students have a finely limned quality about them , as smooth as pebbles in a creek there is no straining for melodrama as the 71yearold woman recounts how her skin seemed to melt and pour off her arms after the flash , or how whatever scraps of cloth that could be found were used by people to protect themselves from the black rain that fell afterward stories of survival do not get much more compelling but ms iwamoto worries now , with japan inching toward rearmament , that the spirit of hiroshima and the moral power of her story are fading each year , she said , the stares of the students she faces from the podium grow blanker , just as their questions about the atomic bombing grow more stilted , appearing rehearsed rather than heartfelt just a few years ago , most schoolteachers had direct memories of the war , said ms iwamoto , who said she was found to have cancer last year but appeared hale that s not the case at all anymore , though , and i wonder once this kind of lecture ends , how effectively the experience of war is taught in my day we had trouble just surviving every day , whereas these days everyone in japan is comfortable , ms iwamoto added children learn about war through manga comic books and think it is kind of cool they have no particular sensation of japan s defeat the profound shock of the hiroshima bombing , and that of nagasaki three days later , is widely credited not only with ending world war ii , but with creating a strong emotional underpinning to japan s official creed of nonviolence , consecrated in an americandrafted constitution that faces increasingly strident calls for revision fears about japan becoming increasingly blas about remembering the atomic bombings , though , are not limited to the survivors , or hibakusha , as they are known here hiroshima s entire image and economy are linked to the horrendous final days of world war ii , and city officials say visits by japanese travelers are locked in a serious , longterm decline , broken only by a modest spike since the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the united states commissions have been formed to reverse the trend a museum on the grounds of the peace park , near ground zero , has been expanded and modernized in the hope of popularizing visits here , even a manga has been created to celebrate the memory of sadako sasaki , a 12yearold who died of blood cancer years after the bombing we are faced with the challenge of conveying this experience to the next generations , said noriyuki masuda , associate director of the hiroshima peace memorial association at some point we realized that what we had was a crisis involving young people s consciousness we have been facing a change in attitudes and a decline of interest in japan as a nation when ms iwamoto completed her onehour presentation to a lecture hall full of sixth graders who had come to hiroshima on a field trip , five minutes were left for what was billed as a question and answer session in lieu of a question , a young girl who appeared to have been chosen for her excellence in study walked nervously to the microphone and read a brief speech in the name of her class why must there be war \? she said flatly , ending her comments with a wish for the lecturer s good health asked if visits at a slightly older age might favor deeper thought , not to mention real questions , the girl s teacher , keiko tokunaga , demurred this is the age when children are just beginning to think about the world , she said , and i think that it is the best time to introduce ideas like this but this is just a start out on the grand plaza of the peace park , where the famous atomic bomb dome sits , just a stone s throw across the motoyasu river , one has trouble imagining that visits to the hiroshima memorial grounds are in decline over the course of a fine spring day , one group after another of uniformed students troops from the museum to the dome , typically laying wreaths and garlands of origami cranes by a statue of miss sasaki , the renowned 12yearold bomb victim foreign visitors , whose numbers have increased as those of japanese have declined , are also constantly in evidence this day , a group of volunteer greeters were excitedly awaiting the arrival of a group from senegal , including the country s ambassador at the approach of an american journalist , a group of ninth graders from tokyo was unfailingly polite , and even excited to be answering questions about their trip here none had discussed the bombing , or japan s longfixed identity as a nation of peace , with their parents before coming nor did they have many ideas of how the war began or why it ended amid mushroom clouds and hundreds of thousands of instant casualties this was kind of an experiment , because it was the first atomic bombing , said eiichiro hiraka , a 14yearold with a dream of becoming a professional baseball player hiroshima was the perfect size for that a classmate , kaoru iwasaki , said she had studied world war ii the year before but did not remember much i'm sorry , but i ca n't tell you why the war started , she said asked the same question , her friend chisato kajitani declared that she was not very interested in the subject i 've never really thought about that question before , she said photos as part of a visit to the museum at the hiroshima peace memorial , a group of elementary school pupils listened to setsuko iwamoto speak about her experiences as a survivor of the world war ii atomic bombing \( photographs by toru morimoto panos , for the new york times \) map of japan highlighting hiroshima
albany , jan 27 the albany county district attorney has begun a formal criminal inquiry into the dealings of a private prison company that gained millions of dollars in state work while extending favors to several state lawmakers the district attorney , paul a clyne , said that his investigation of correctional services corporation had just begun , and that it was impossible to predict its ultimate scope we are going to be looking primarily at csc they are at the center of the wheel , mr clyne said the company provided a variety of services at halfway houses in the state for prisoners set to be released as far as i am concerned , my investigation could involve 100 legislators or it could involve none , mr clyne said the district attorney declined to say if a grand jury had been impaneled to hear evidence in the case so far , assemblywoman gloria davis of the bronx has admitted in a manhattan court to accepting free transportation from the company in the late 1990 s in return for her influence on its behalf in the legislature assemblyman roger l green of brooklyn , as well , has told reporters that he accepted rides to and from albany in a company van , but denied wrongdoing of any kind both applied for reimbursement for travel to the capital during that same period , according to records released by the state assembly i will say that we intend to cooperate with the investigation , gerald l shargel , who is mr green s attorney , said today he has done absolutely nothing wrong there is nothing improper about his conduct still , mr clyne emphasized that his inquiry would not be limited to those two lawmakers nor would it be limited to the 27 democratic legislators from the new york city area who wrote letters urging the extension of the company s contracts in early 1998 , mr clyne said however , it would not be inaccurate to say that it is possible that those individuals could become part of the investigation , mr clyne said just months after the 27 letters of support for the company were written in 1998 , an audit of the company s work by the state comptroller s office found that the company had claimed expenses that were either unrelated to its program or unnecessary the audit concluded that the company owed a 5 , 643 refund to the state because of its 1996 filings manhattan prosecutors and the lobbying commission in albany are looking into the company , and federal authorities say they have an open investigation into allegations that the company s employees were forced to work on political campaigns of new york state and city lawmakers during the 1990 s
san diego , jan 27 last season , dexter jackson did not feel like a part of the tampa bay buccaneers' defense sure , he was there at free safety replacing damien robinson , who had gone to the jets , but jackson was always used in the deep third of the field , never up into the action always out of the box this was tough on a player used to being an axis in high school in quincy , fla , jackson was the quarterback , placekicker and punter he was also a track hurdler and a point guard at florida state , he was a force at safety but after playing in 25 games in his first two bucs seasons , none as a starter , he was inserted last season with minimal responsibilities and little trust there were some people in our building who were n't sure dexter could cut it , monte kiffin , the bucs' defensive coordinator , said , hinting that he was one of them dexter just was n't being consistent little trust meant little opportunity the bucs sort of hid him in their defense this season , however , jackson started fast and finished faster the buccaneers brought him into the action into the box he played cornerback in some packages as deftly as he played safety maybe it was the interception that helped win the monday night game against st louis in september , or the fourthquarter breakup of a fake atlanta punt in early october , when he nailed tight end brian kozlowski just as the ball arrived , creating an interception for cornerback dwight smith and a path to another victory or maybe it was the interception of the packers' brett favre and the return of 58 yards to the green bay 5 that helped win that november showdown maybe it was all of those plays and a few more that began to bring jackson out of the shadows , into the box , into the limelight and here on sunday in super bowl xxxvii , his steady climb reached its zenith in a game of megastars , jackson glowed brightest he was the game s most valuable player he gained the first two of five bucs interceptions of oakland quarterback rich gannon and jackson ignited his team to a 4821 victory over the raiders quarterback brad johnson was awarded the trip to disneyland that usually goes to the mvp no matter , jackson said yesterday as he sat in a cadillac convertible that was on display in his news conference he eventually chose a spiffy cadillac escalade to go along with his mvp trophy i'm a little disappointed , jackson said i always wanted to hang out with mickey mouse and the guys i was n't selected , but that s fine i can ride by disneyland in my new cadillac on my own so it will be great i 'll just toot my horn when i ride by disneyland on my way to six flags jackson was in the box now , clicking , captivating his audience the national news media wondered aloud where has he been \? who is this gem \? he looked at ease yesterday , poised on the platform he shared with paul tagliabue , the nfl commissioner , and jon gruden , the tampa bay coach jackson wore his bright red tampa bay gear and a bright smile , and he handled his day in the spotlight with savvy and cool before sunday night , his was hardly a wellknown name that is a grand thing about the super bowl the least can become the most , the pauper can become king we thought a lot of guys in our secondary could win the mvp because rich gannon throws the ball 40 or 50 times and we knew we would have some chances , jackson said our defense does have pro bowl stars , but it is more than those guys everybody on our defense looks to make a difference last night my time came this is a great way to build your name and your future jackson , 25 , is an unrestricted free agent he just finished the final year of his fouryear deal what timing every nfl player dreams of it happening just this way play out the final year of your contract , have a splendid season , win the super bowl and the game s mvp award jackson just carved a way to a big contract either with tampa bay or elsewhere at 6 feet 1 inch and 203 pounds , he is strong enough to play safety but quick enough to play cornerback he is in his prime he is on his way in march , jackson and his wife , tina , are expecting their first child , a girl they will name jasmine jackson s mother , lula lee , watched sunday s game from her hotel room because of back pain associated with diabetes , which she has had since the 10th grade he worked as a lifeguard and with community programs for children during high school to help support her and his younger sister jackson s teammates affectionately call him dirty because he comes from the dirt roads of rural quincy he will go back there , he said , to lake laquain , to fish and absorb his new fortune and fame we saw on film that every big play that gannon had , he liked to pump fake the ball left and right a lot and come back to the seams , jackson said we were ready for that we were ready for everything they tried because i ca n't remember a play they ran that we had n't seen and prepared for i think he underestimated our closing speed i was able to read his intentions but lay off back in my zone and give him the appearance that his receiver was open then once he delivered the ball , i just closed and made the plays jackson credited strong safety john lynch for his tutoring and linebacker derrick brooks for his inspiration brooks told jackson during the game that what he had accomplished was what brooks had been talking about with him for the last four years that in this super bowl , the torch had been passed and that jackson could take his place as a great player on a great defense not yet , jackson said i still see things i can improve on i can finetune my game with a championship ring on his finger and with an mvp trophy in his case and with his game easier to find now in the box photos the super bowl mvp dexter jackson , right , and dwight smith , left , had two interceptions each in tampa bay s victory \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg d1 \) buccaneers free safety dexter jackson after making one of his two firsthalf interceptions in the super bowl \( associated press \) \( pg d3 \)
washington , june 11 the bush administration has decided to place teams of american inspectors at major seaports in muslim nations and other smaller , strategically located foreign ports to prevent terrorists from using cargo containers to smuggle chemical , biological or nuclear weapons into the united states , senior administration officials said the inspectors , they said , will be provided with radiation monitors , chemical detectors and other equipment to inspect high risk metal cargo containers before they are placed on ships bound for the united states the move is the second phase in a government program begun shortly after the terrorist attacks of sept 11 , 2001 , to station american customs inspectors overseas to work side by side with their foreign counterparts in searching for unconventional weapons the first phase focused on 20 large container ports in europe and asia , none of them in countries with predominantly muslim populations officials said the department of homeland security planned to place teams of inspectors that would remain indefinitely in dubai , the persian gulf emirate that is a crucial transhipment point for containerized cargo in the arab world malaysia turkey and other muslim nations al qaeda is believed to have a sizable presence in both dubai and malaysia intelligence agencies report that al qaeda has repeatedly used cargo ships to move conventional weapons and explosives , including the explosives used in the 1998 bombings of two american embassies in east africa human cargo is also a concern in october 2001 , only weeks after the sept 11 attacks , the authorities in an italian seaport discovered an egyptian man suspected of qaeda membership hiding in a shipping container bound for halifax , nova scotia airport maps and security passes were also found in the container , which he had outfitted with a bed and bathroom the man disappeared while on bail robert c bonner , the commissioner of customs and border protection in the homeland security department , said the expansion of the program reflected a continuing concern that al qaeda and other terrorist groups would try to place chemical , biological or nuclear weapons into some of the more than six million containers that arrive in the united states from overseas each year i'm not prophesying anything , mr bonner said in an interview but i do have concern that we need to have this security system in place as fast as we possibly can he said the system of containerized shipping was vulnerable to terrorist exploitation and you do n't have to take my word for it , he added every national security expert i 've heard has come to the same conclusion the issue of cargo security has become increasingly contentious on capitol hill many prominent lawmakers from coastal states have accused the administration of failing to provide the money to safeguard ports from terrorist attacks and to prevent terrorists from using cargo ships to transport weapons tom ridge , the homeland security secretary , who will announce many of the details of the expanded inspection program in a visit thursday to port elizabeth , nj , said that identifying and dealing with highrisk containers at the earliest possible point protects the entire international supply chain and all of the world s major seaports he said the posting of customs inspectors abroad , a 17monthold program known as the container security initiative , had emerged as a formidable tool for protecting us from the threat of terrorism in the first phrase of the program , the customs service , which has since been merged into the homeland security department , opened negotiations with foreign governments representing the world s 20 largest cargo ports , as measured by shipments to the united states , to permit american inspectors to be stationed permanently in those ports administration officials said teams of american inspectors would be at work at almost all of those large ports a list that includes antwerp , genoa , hamburg , hong kong , rotterdam , shanghai , singapore , tokyo and yokohama by the end of the year mr ridge signed an agreement today with the prime minister of thailand , thaksin shinawatra , who is visiting washington , to allow american inspectors to work the giant thai port of laem chabang , which is no 20 on the list but while those 20 foreign ports represent almost twothirds of the containerized cargo bound for the united states , officials said there was mounting worry that al qaeda might try to make use of cargo containers passing through other , smaller ports , especially in muslim nations where the terrorist group has a strong following in the new phase of the program , mr bonner said , the bush administration would place teams in an additional 20 to 25 foreign seaports , with the ports to be chosen on the basis of both cargo volume and their strategic location in nations or regions where terrorism is believed to be a special threat we will be expanding to important parts of the islamic world , he said we will be looking more strategically administration officials said that the malaysian government had already agreed to join the program , and that negotiations would begin soon in earnest with both dubai and turkey , which are also expected to sign on quickly the department of homeland security has already placed 130 inspectors overseas as part of the first phase of the program , with another 170 in training to join them department officials said more than 100 million had already been committed to setting up the program mr bonner said foreign governments were eager to allow the american inspectors into their ports , if only because it meant that cargo shipped from their ports would face no special delays for inspection when it arrived in the united states governments that refuse to join the program would risk having their cargo shipments held up on arrival in this country foreign governments that agree to join the program are required to provide the american inspectors with highlevel detection equipment , including radiation monitors that would be used to detect nuclear devices or the components of radioactive weapons mr bonner said that while the united states had no intention of buying detection equipment for use in foreign seaports , the administration had asked the world bank to consider how to help foreign governments raise the money for it under the program , the american teams are expected to carry out inspections of a small sample of cargo containers that raise suspicion because their shippers are unknown , because their contents are in question or for some other reason each team is expected to have about five members at the news conference on thursday , mr ridge is also expected to announce the distribution of 170 million in federal grants to strengthen port security around the country , most of it directed to state and local governments , and 30 million for research and development on cargo security chart map in the works scrutinizing usbound cargo abroad the bush administration is expanding a program that places customs inspectors at foreign seaports to check cargo containers in the program s second phase , inspectors will be based in some muslim countries like malaysia and the united arab emirates the first phase was directed at the 20 ports with the most

when valery gergiev conducted the kirov orchestra at carnegie hall in april , the players seemed weary and uninspired , despite their tireless maestro s urgent ministrations they had , after all , finished their own extended tour in the united states and were then extending it to replace mr gergiev s other orchestra , the rotterdam philharmonic , which had canceled its tour on short notice but last week mr gergiev and the kirov returned to open carnegie hall s season , fully alive to the sense of occasion they were , by all reports , in fine fettle for the first concert , on wednesday , and they delivered highly charged performances of two touchstones of the 20thcentury repertory over the weekend shostakovich s seventh symphony on friday and prokofiev s ballet score romeo and juliet on sunday no surprise , really mr gergiev and the orchestra have recorded both works impressively for philips \( the shostakovich in collaboration with the rotterdam philharmonic \) the prokofiev work , episodic and wildly colorful , is particularly well suited to mr gergiev s mercurial style , which is geared more to the excitement of the moment than to epic sweep this music has always seemed to bypass brain and even ear , going directly to the nerve endings , and mr gergiev often seems to be trying to do the same the results here were superbly evocative , alternately touching and jarring , with heartbreak lying ever close at hand shostakovich s symphony the leningrad , of 1941 brings the heat of battle into play in its first movement yet despite that immediacy , it plays out on a grander scale , opening with memories \( however accurate \) of an idyllic past and ending with visions of a heroic future mr gergiev s colleague yuri temirkanov , across town at the st petersburg philharmonic , is the reigning master of this work , spreading it onto the broadest canvas and holding attention throughout yet mr gergiev s approach , again more episodic , proves gripping in its way he grabs the listener by the lapels repeatedly \( as mr temirkanov does not have to do \) and drives the big moments home thrillingly he imbued the ending with such overwhelming force here that it seemed to tie everything together retrospectively , leaving the impression of a unified if not always cohesive whole the orchestra does not retain much of the characteristic brazenness , swagger and stridency of the old russian style , but then , few do that sound lives on more in vocal than in instrumental performance , and it could be heard at times from irina matayeva , a soprano , and yevgeny akimov , a tenor , in shostakovich s from jewish folk poetry , which opened the friday program but the mezzosoprano is central to that work in more ways than one and yekaterina semenchuk made the most of her turns , especially the lullaby little son , my fairest , conveyed in plush , velvety tones on whatever national or international level , the orchestra played splendidly the strings were warm and sensitive in their quiet playing the brasses were brilliant at the other extreme , none more so than sergei kryuchkov s principal trumpet in romeo it was as if the orchestra had come to celebrate not so much the glory that was once leningrad , but the glory that is now the restored st petersburg photo valery gergiev conducting the kirov orchestra on friday \( photo by jack vartoogian for the new york times \)
ofra , west bank , june 9 as an opening gesture to comply with the new americanled peace initiative , israeli soldiers drove to a hilltop here in the west bank and tore down what the israeli army described as a watchtower adjacent to a settlement the rusty tower looked unremarkable but to the government of prime minister ariel sharon , it was technically an unauthorized outpost , one of 14 erected as adjuncts to nearby israeli settlements that the army pledged today to destroy as part of israel s commitment to the current peace plan , called the road map , between israelis and palestinians to the angry israeli settlers who live nearby , the downed tower was a frightening portent that mr sharon may be willing to bargain away the right they believe that jews have to inhabit land in the west bank and gaza that was seized from palestinians after the 1967 war this is the first step , warned yudah yifrach , 27 , one of several hundred settlers who came here to protest the tower s removal but to palestinian leaders and critics of the settlements , the demolition of the tower showed just how little the sharon government was actually willing to concede , at least now , in the early stages of the peace plan at the same time , the army tore down two trailers both , like the watchtower , empty of people that constituted another outpost , called neve erez south , about 15 miles from here the move against the outposts came after the israeli army demolished 13 palestinian homes early today in the northern gaza town of beit hanun , including one belonging to a militant , mussa sakhawil , who helped carry out a shooting on sunday that left four israeli soldiers dead in a news conference today , the palestinian prime minister , mahmoud abbas , condemned the attacks , even though an overwhelming majority of palestinians consider israeli soldiers in the west bank and gaza to be legitimate targets he also ruled out the use of force against militant groups , saying , we need a dialogue that leads to a truce by tonight , the army reported that it had dismantled five of the outposts , none of them inhabited of the 14 outposts scheduled for destruction in the next few days , 10 are uninhabited and so , critics argue , their removal is only the most tentative step toward complying with the peace plan it s a phony show that has no value , nabil abu rudaneh , an aide to yasir arafat , the palestinian leader , said in a telephone interview tonight few issues present a greater challenge to the peace plan s success than the question of the roughly 200 , 000 israeli settlers in the west bank and gaza the plan now backed by the bush administration has chosen to grapple first with that question through the phenomenon of outposts , which are difficult to define for several years , israeli settlers have been expanding the reach of their communities by erecting what they call outposts , usually on nearby hilltops they generally consist of a few structures , some with water and electricity , put in place for various overlapping reasons , as a marker for future expansion or as retribution when palestinians kill israelis critics contend that some were built exactly for moments like this one when a peace plan would require concessions that would chip away at the settlements many of the outposts are uninhabited the first phase of the peace plan requires that israelis led by mr sharon , a longtime supporter of the settler movement dismantle all the outposts erected in the last two years since he came to power peace now , an israeli group that monitors settlements , says 62 such outposts have been built since 2001 , mostly in the west bank but mr sharon s government puts the number closer to 100 and says that it will destroy only those outposts built without government authorization , a qualification not included in the peace plan itself the dispute over what exactly constitutes an outpost was evident tonight as soldiers tore down the tower on a hill near the settlement of ofra , which was founded near the palestinian city of ramallah in the mid1970 s it also showed the complications for mr sharon as he seeks to comply with the terms of the peace plan without alienating his core political constituents on one hilltop is a community called amona , founded three years ago and holding roughly 25 young jewish families and their children on another , until tonight , was the watchtower peace now said it considered the houses and the tower part of the same outpost the government apparently disagreed , dismantling only the tower and saying it had taken down a separate outpost the whole story is rather tricky , said dror etkes , who monitors settlements for peace now the government obviously has right now the interest to present itself as dismantling settlements but i think what they are doing now is splitting existing outposts and giving them separate names until now , he said , his group considered the tower part of the outpost obviously , they do n't want to dismantle amona , with 25 families very established mr etkes emphasized that he did not rule out that mr sharon who shocked many israelis last week by using the word occupation to describe the israeli military presence in the west bank and gaza might take on some of the more populated outposts in the coming weeks we might see in the next days some surprises , mr etkes said we must all admit that the last two weeks in israel were quite surprising that was the fear of the several hundred settlers who gathered at the site of the watchtower tonight as the sun was setting they prayed and chanted most relevantly , they blocked half a dozen israeli army vehicles seeking to carry the tower away like the hardliners on the palestinian side , the settlers said they were opposed to the road map plan the bible grants the land to jews , they say , and so they have the right to be there plus , they say , any peace plan is a reward to terrorism let s say after al qaeda bombed one of the buildings , said one settler , chaim bloch , 41 , referring to the sept 11 attacks on the world trade center , they said , 'let s start negotiating on the second building' what would you say to them \? there are fears in both the palestinian and the israeli camps of violent confrontations between factions over the peace effort we will do everything in our power to ensure that there is no violence , that not one person raises his hand or his finger on an israeli soldier or policeman , said ezra rosenfeld , an official with the yesha council , a settlers' group , which has vowed to rebuild any outpost that is destroyed but there may be those who will ignore our request and who will actively resist evacuation recent opinion polls show that most israelis support the removal of all outposts a new poll released today by the jaffee institute for strategic studies in tel aviv showed that 59 percent of israelis would support such a removal , an increase from 50 percent who said the same thing a year ago in addition , 56 percent of those polled said they would support a unilateral withdrawal from all settlements as part of a peace accord , up from 48 percent last year it s a relaxing of opinion stemming from the perception of a lesser threat to israelis' security , said asher arian , a professor who directs the poll the other part is a perceived direction signaled by the prime minister , and i think public reacts to that our public opinion at this moment reacts to this prime minister photo jewish settlers who watched israeli troops tear down a watchtower prayed , chanted and blocked the path of army vehicles taking the tower away \( rina castelnuovo for the new york times \) \( pg a12 \) map of the west bank highlighting ofra

san francisco , aug 14 four prominent republicans on the ballot and only one democratic governor to throw out of his job what s the california republican party to do \? as the campaign for the oct 7 recall election gets under way in earnest , gov gray davis and his fellow democrats still have the biggest hurdle keeping mr davis in office while positioning lt gov cruz m bustamante as a successor should mr davis lose the recall vote but the state s republicans , who have taken delight in the democratic squirming , are facing a monumental predicament of their own they have four major contenders among the official list of 135 possible successors to mr davis , and none of them seem prepared to back out those four republicans arnold schwarzenegger , bill simon jr , tom mcclintock and peter v ueberroth insist that they are in the race until the end but some republican strategists worry that their infighting might help hand victory to mr bustamante and the democrats every republican has to be worried about bustamante , said shawn steel , former chairman of the state republican party and one of the recall s original proponents we are not going to win this by having three perfect republican campaigns and one mediocre democratic campaign that would spell victory for the democrats there is no question that the early momentum among republicans has gone mr schwarzenegger s way , even within the state s republican leadership and some of its elder statesmen mr schwarzenegger s campaign announced today that george p shultz , secretary of state in the reagan administration , would serve as a chairman of an economic council advising him i am grateful george has agreed to serve his state yet again , mr schwarzenegger said in a statement in the week since mr schwarzenegger officially entered the race , the state party has lost both its spokeswoman , karen hanretty , and one of its most visible consultants , rob stutzman , to the schwarzenegger campaign republican operatives move around , mr stutzman said the ballot will have two parts one that asks whether mr davis should be removed from office , and another that asks voters to choose a successor from the 135 challengers should he lose the republican state chairman , george m sundheim iii , long advocated a single republican on the ballot , but gave up on the idea as it became apparent that there was no consensus candidate since then , mr sundheim has been careful to say the party remains welcoming to all the republicans he says the departure of ms hanretty and mr stutzman came about because of their individual decisions , not by action on a party level but at the same time , the state s republican congressional delegation has made no attempt to appear evenhanded half of its 20 members have already lined up behind mr schwarzenegger , with none of the others so far endorsing any other republican in the race representative david dreier , a los angeles county republican who heads the delegation and was the first to endorse mr schwarzenegger , said he had spoken with mr ueberroth , the former baseball commissioner , and mr simon , who lost to mr davis in the election for governor last year , to encourage them to join the schwarzenegger juggernaut mr dreier said today that he also intended to ask mr mcclintock , a state senator with a long republican r sum , to do the same i am not armtwisting , mr dreier said in a telephone interview but at the end of the day , i do hope that bill simon , tom mcclintock and peter ueberroth all rally around arnold we need someone who will be an amazingly successful , charismatic and exciting ambassador for california around the world and that someone is arnold mr sundheim said he had taken a different tack with the competing republican candidates right now , he said , i am saying keep the message positive the only way we can lose is if we start going at each other and tear each other down but the two prominent conservatives in the mix mr simon and mr mcclintock maintain that the party elders are misreading the recall effort s grassroots conservative origin though the drive has grown well beyond those beginnings , the mcclintock and simon campaigns remain convinced that conservative republicans are the most motivated voters in the recall they see mr schwarzenegger , a moderate , as beatable on the strength of that conservative base but even if they are correct , the two conservatives have been unable to sort through a fundamental problem they are essentially competing for the same group of voters , which , if split , would most likely sink both candidacies that situation has led to tension between the two campaigns k b forbes , a spokesman for mr simon , describes the recall election as an a b c race arnold , bill and cruz mr mcclintock does not even warrant a mention john m feliz , meanwhile , the mcclintock campaign director , acknowledges the simon factor but insists that if someone has to go , it must be mr simon asked if either mr simon or mr mcclintock would drop out of the race , mr feliz replied one of them will it is not going to be us as a practical matter , the republicans face another obstacle that the democrats do not even if the republicans rally around a single candidate , it is too late to remove any of the candidates' names from the ballot , according to the secretary of state s office that deadline passed last saturday , when the final paperwork for candidates was due if they choose not to campaign , that is their choice , said doug stone , a spokesman for the secretary of state s office , but if they are on the certified list , they are on the ballot the abundance of candidates , republican and otherwise , was one of the ticklish issues confronting the california broadcasters association today the group , which represents nearly 1 , 000 television and radio stations across the state , announced that it would present a recall debate on sept 17 the problem with the 90minute debate , however , is trying to decide whom to invite if all candidates appeared , each would get just 40 seconds of airtime the association said it would narrow the field to candidates who have a reasonable chance of winning but nothing about the recall is simple , even a debate the association issued a complex series of criteria for candidates to qualify anyone who receives at least 10 percent support as measured in one of the state s three major public opinion polls before sept 5 automatically makes the cut but if fewer than six candidates meet that criterion , an independent poll of undecided voters will be conducted by california state university to determine which of the remaining candidates those polling at least 5 percent are preferred in the debate , the association said winners of the university survey , that is would be announced on sept 8 photo bill simon jr , one of four prominent republicans in the recall race \( photo by monica almeida the

as washington lobbyist for the toyota motor corporation , james r olson spent years developing relationships on capitol hill and in the white house but in 1995 , he thought that his political world had come to an end that may , mr olson watched in dismay as the clinton administration threatened to place a 100 percent tariff on sales of japanese luxury cars in the united states , part of a trade war with japan over american companies gaining access to its market the dispute was resolved a month later , but not before mr olson vowed to expand toyota s leverage in the united states he figured that the japanese company s clout would be much greater if it had factories in more than just one state kentucky toyota now has five american plants in alabama , indiana , kentucky and west virginia and one under construction in texas when mr olson retired this month after 18 years as toyota s field general in the american political and economic wars , he was pretty confident that the automaker was finally safe from detroit s protectionist volleys we 've got 35 , 000 employees and 14 billion invested in dealerships , development centers and factories across the united states , said mr olson , 62 , who joined toyota in 1985 , after working for the ford motor company in an interview , mr olson said the political environment had changed greatly during his tenure what are you going to do , blow up our plants \? we have countless political allies that like toyota and would be willing to stand up for us we 're too embedded here now to be threatened by protectionism , he concluded toyota , whose biggest market is the united states , has said that its intent was to build vehicles close to its customers but mr olson bluntly acknowledged another factor there is a business reason , but there is also a political reason , he said he defends his willingness to leverage toyota s economic capital by pointing to the tactics of detroit companies , longtime powerhouses on the washington scene the big three have used government affairs as an offensive weapon for years , he said they know how to use their political networks and do so superbly such forthrightness has made mr olson one of the most visible and controversial figures in the american automobile industry in the last two decades he is fond of pink dress shirts and navy pinstriped suits , has a cackling laugh that can be heard a block away and has a gutsy pragmatism about the automotive game mr olson and his wife , mary ann , who have a grown son , cameron , divide their time between new york and a sprawling postandbeam house , which mr olson helped design , in north carolina he expects to remain a consultant to toyota , where he was an interpreter of american ways for a succession of japanese executives who were initially skittish about having too large a profile in the united states one who listened most closely was toyota s chairman , shoichiro toyoda , an architect of its american expansion plans mr olson met mr toyoda in november 1985 , when the diminutive mr toyoda traveled to inaugurate toyota s plant in georgetown , ky mr olson , much taller , feared that a regularsized american lectern might make mr toyoda seem even shorter so he called friends at a parts supplier and ordered a motorized lectern that could be adjusted for height arriving for the ceremony , mr olson discovered that mr toyoda s assistants had set the lectern for his height , then taped the controls shut while mr toyoda and the lectern were in harmony , the shortened stand made mr olson look like quasimodo by comparison , he recalled , laughing always concerned about appearances , mr olson regularly conducted market research to gauge how americans felt about buying cars from a japanese company the latest surveys , taken this fall , showed that 75 percent of americans did not consider a company s nationality in choosing a car , mr olson said that is up from 63 percent just after the september 2001 terrorist attacks and it is 15 percentage points higher than equivalent surveys showed in 1992 , which mr olson considers a turning point for foreign auto companies in the united states public opinion , as measured by the surveys , began to shift in the wake of the 1992 trip to japan by the first president george bush , accompanied by chrysler s former chief executive , lee a iacocca , and other detroit automobile executives , he said mr olson speculated that american consumers were disillusioned by seeing mr bush , who famously fell ill at a banquet , lobby the japanese government on detroit s behalf that really backfired on the big three , mr olson said but as one of the first americans to join a japanese company , mr olson has felt detroit s bite on the day he resigned from ford s public relations department , he said , he was given an hour to pack his things and was escorted out of ford s headquarters by security workers with one exception , none of his coworkers said farewell the only person who had the class to say goodbye was edsel , mr olson said , referring to edsel b ford ii , a company director and henry ford s greatgrandson mr olson said he never regretted switching sides even in his 18 years at ford , its engineers recognized the quality of toyota s cars and its manufacturing expertise , he said detroit s bosses were a different story i sometimes think top management may have underestimated us , mr olson said not anymore in august , toyota outsold the chrysler group , a unit of daimlerchrysler , in cars and trucks , not including the mercedes luxury brand , in the united states , though chrysler has surpassed it narrowly each month since toyota , meanwhile , passed ford in global sales for the third quarter , to become the world s secondlargest auto company , behind general motors toyota s chief executive , fujio cho , is pushing the company to capture 15 percent of the global market by 2010 , similar to what gm has now mr olson , however , is not underestimating detroit s ability to rally i 've seen the big three time and time again come back from the brink of death , he said if they hit a lot of doubles , triples and home runs , they could bounce right back photo james r olson , who recently retired as toyota s lobbyist in washington , said , we 're too embedded here to be threatened by protectionism \( photo by fred r conrad the new york times \)
a federal judge dealt prosecutors a major blow in their racketeering case against peter gotti yesterday by barring the testimony of a mafia turncoat who was prepared to testify that mr gotti is now the head of the gambino crime family once led by his brother john the prosecutors' contention that peter gotti ascended to head the family is a pillar of their case against him because they maintain that payments he had received from a gambino crew were a form of tribute typically paid to a mafia leader the judge , frederic block , has clearly angered and confused prosecutors after just two days of testimony with occasionally inconsistent rulings that have left the government scurrying to adapt its case against mr gotti and six others in his decision , which appeared to catch prosecutors off guard , judge block , of federal district court in brooklyn , barred the testimony of michael d'urso , a former genovese crime family associate who has been a star government witness in other mob cases after excusing the jury and hearing the proposed testimony from mr d'urso , judge block said he had concluded that among other things , mr d'urso s knowledge of the events at the center of the gotti case was too remote it s not close enough it s just too general , said judge block as he ruled on the defense motion to bar mr d'urso s testimony as hearsay and irrelevant the sweeping 67count indictment includes allegations of gambling , loan sharking , extortion and corrupt control of the new york waterfront but the charges against mr gotti center on money laundering , and prosecutors say that his role as the boss of the crime family links him to the other illegal acts the judge s decision weakens the government s case , and it is not clear whether the prosecutors have another mafia insider who can testify that mr gotti is the gambino boss in court yesterday , prosecutors led mr d'urso through his proposed presentation concerning several issues in the case he said he had been told by a member of the genovese crime family after the imprisonment of john j gotti and his son , who is known as junior , that peter gotti said he had risen from the position of acting gambino boss mr d'urso said the genovese soldier quoted peter gotti as saying 'i'm not acting i'm official i run this family' about two hours after the ruling , the chief prosecutor in the case , andrew m genser , urged the judge to reconsider judge block refused , saying , i have to really take control , in a firm way , hopefully he added that he did not want to appear to be a little bit lance itoish , a reference to the judge in the criminal trial of o j simpson who was widely criticized after the court closed for the day , prosecutors continued to press the issue by filing a letter asking the judge again to reconsider mr genser reacted testily when the judge first refused to allow mr d'urso to testify and asked mr genser which other witnesses were ready mr genser said that none were , suggesting that the prosecutors had not expected the ruling it s very difficult to anticipate , as these rulings are made on the fly , he told the judge the prosecutors took issue with the decision for several reasons beyond the damage it did to their case against mr gotti mr d'urso , for example , said that one of the other defendants , jerome brancato , had essentially confessed to him in a taperecorded conversation that the gambino family controlled the waterfront by saying , 'i got two guys in there' in an unusually prickly exchange , mr genser said the judge was barring evidence of an admission of the crime in this case judge block then said , you 've got to have better evidence than that to justify a conviction mr genser shot back , obviously we have , your honor yesterday s disagreement followed an earlier ruling that was also a setback for the prosecutors on wednesday , judge block appeared to bar a federal bureau of investigation expert on the gambino family from testifying about the names and mafia ranks of scores of people who have had ties to mr gotti and the other defendants then , yesterday morning , the judge seemed to reverse himself partly and allowed prosecutors to call the agent to the stand again the agent , gregory hagarty , was permitted to identify by name and apparent mafia position the people photographed in the presence of some of the defendants but he was not allowed to identify the mafia position investigators believe to be held by any of the defendants

rudolph w giuliani testified yesterday that as new york city mayor , he immediately called for the firing of a police officer and two firefighters for their participation in a racist 1998 labor day parade float because he feared the possibility of civil unrest leading to violence and riots my response was that it was very offensive , mr giuliani said , it was outrageous , and that it had the potential of causing serious disruption , civil unrest , and concerned me greatly but the judge who is presiding over the trial in a lawsuit over the firings questioned the appropriateness of the mayor s quick condemnation of the men and suggested that his strong response had landed the matter in court mr giuliani noted that the parade , in which the men wore blackface , took place in broad channel , queens , not far from howard beach , the site of racial violence in 1986 , and said that he wanted no uncertainty among the public about how he felt the reality is if you equivocate in circumstances like that , he said , that creates the opening for people to exploit and create unrest mr giuliani was testifying in federal district court in manhattan in a civil trial stemming from lawsuits filed by joseph locurto , the fired police officer , and the former firefighters , jonathan walters and robert steiner , who are all seeking reinstatement after the parade , in which the men rode on a float titled black to the future 2098 , the mayor said of mr locurto the only way this guy gets back on the police force is if the supreme court of the united states tells us to put him back the men say that their actions were entertainment protected by the first amendment , and that the firings violated their rights their lawyers also contend that mr giuliani orchestrated the firings because he had been widely criticized for racial insensitivity , particularly in the police department s handling of the socalled million youth march in harlem , just days before mr giuliani denied that he had directed the firings or that he had acted because of any such controversy , and said that if the police and fire commissioners at the time , howard safir and thomas von essen , had not agreed that the men should be fired after investigating the matter , they could have ruled the other way but the judge , john e sprizzo , who is presiding over the trial without a jury , noted that the fire and police commissioners work for you and serve at your pleasure you are the boss , the judge remarked at one point you 're no 1 , like president bush is no 1 mr giuliani replied , but i was n't the boss of the disciplinary process , saying the commissioners had independence in such matters judge sprizzo said , if that were truly your state of mind , the statements you made were really most improper the judge also said that the mayor s remarks had political overtones the statement was designed for public consumption , he said mr giuliani replied , it was designed to avoid disruption in the city but the judge again later questioned the remarks you wanted to make the city feel you were on top of this situation , and would be very tough on it if you had just gone weaker , you might have not had the political impact , but you would not be here none of us would be here later , mr von essen testified that he had originally concluded that what he called the firemen s horrible mistake did not warrant dismissal , but i did n't see the big picture he later changed his mind , he said photo former mayor rudolph w giuliani testified yesterday in federal court in manhattan about the firings of a police officer and two firefighters \( ozier muhammad the new york times \)
it is tempting to look at a lineup and think of each player in the bestcase scenario the offense has so much potential that way , and its chance of success is tantalizing too bad , yankees general manager brian cashman said , that baseball does not work that way it s just the nature of the game you do n't get all your guys going at the same time , cashman said yesterday before a sixgame homestand with the texas rangers and the seattle mariners that starts tonight at yankee stadium every time you get one problem kind of worked out , another one pops up with the best record in the american league \( 6742 \) and a lead of three and a half games over the boston red sox in the east , the yankees' problems are relative but for the moment , two of their best hitters are struggling , and the team offense has been relatively tepid the yankees won five of nine games on their trip , gaining a game on the red sox in the standing but they lost two of the three series , at boston and at oakland , sweeping the middle series against the freefalling anaheim angels alfonso soriano is in a deep slump , and bernie williams has been inconsistent since coming off the disabled list july 9 , with a 241 average and the yankees' futility with the bases loaded has been a persistent problem the yankees are batting only 224 with the bases loaded , worse than every al team except detroit the yankees rank 18th among the 30 major league teams in batting average with runners in scoring position , at 258 their overall average is 268 that problem does not worry cashman , who has studied years of data on socalled clutch hitting and found nothing to suggest that some hitters do better under pressure that stuff is cyclical , cashman said historically , you hit close to your norm with runners in scoring position it s not something we care too much about but what we do care about is getting guys on base that creates an atmosphere where we have chances to score and put pressure on the opposing pitcher the yankees whose 355 onbase percentage ranks second in the majors to boston s 360 jettisoned a player who repeatedly squandered scoring chances raul mondesi , who is batting 148 with runners in scoring position this season , was sent to the diamondbacks last tuesday for three players , including outfielder david dellucci with mondesi gone , the yankees will use a rotation of outfielders , unless they acquire an outfielder who clears waivers players began clearing waivers yesterday , and cashman said most guys will get through asked if he expected to address right field through a trade , cashman said it s too early to say we 'll see i just know i'm more comfortable going with these guys than staying the way we were before ruben sierra , karim garcia and dellucci could give the yankees as much offense as mondesi but none are as intimidating a defensive presence as mondesi , who is fast and has one of the strongest arms in baseball sierra has played only 45 games in right field the past three seasons and is considered a defensive liability manager joe torre did not start him on sunday because of the spacious outfield in oakland garcia has a strong arm but is somewhat slow dellucci has a weaker arm but gets to the ball quickly garcia is batting 315 for the yankees since his trade from cleveland on june 25 sierra , acquired in a trade with texas on june 6 , is batting 291 as a yankee dellucci is 3 for 8 since being acquired the yankees can probably get by without major offensive contributions from right field a more pressing concern is the play of soriano , who made four errors and hit 171 on the road trip cashman stressed the importance of torre s calming influence on a slumping player like soriano that s what joe s great at doing , cashman said he allows guys to deal with it and work their way through it there s no panic involved in that clubhouse when you have a guy suffering through a slump just continue to run them out there and eventually , they 'll pull through it but even torre has seen enough of soriano s slump to make changes he benched soriano for one of the anaheim games , and dropped him to seventh and eighth in the order in games against oakland torre said he moved down soriano to keep him out of the spotlight , and he said soriano seemed to be thinking too much at the plate after sunday s game , when soriano went 2 for 3 and drove in the yankees' only run , torre indicated that soriano would bat leadoff tonight i would n't hesitate to put him back at the top of the order , torre said he had two hits in the game and had better quality atbats he seems more comfortable he has quickness in his hands but he was n't flying open soriano said he noticed a difference at the plate on sunday the ball was coming to me , soriano said before , i was coming to the ball i felt comfortable cashman said once we get him fixed , another problem will crop up we 'll just have to deal with it as well inside pitch

it is often one of the more shocking aspects of horrific child abuse cases the way child welfare workers ignored warning signs before catastrophe struck yesterday , state records made public under court order offered chilling examples of just how disastrously new jersey caseworkers had failed to act to protect children in the foster care system despite evidence that they were at serious risk in one case , the documents show , three foster children were subjected to years of sexual abuse because the state s division of youth and family services failed to remove them from a home in which the father had already been identified as a possible menace by the agency s investigators in another , an 11yearold girl and her 14yearold sister were tied up , beaten with belts and hangers and sexually abused by other children in their foster home even after the foster parent had been suspended by the state child welfare agency for prior abuse and in another , caseworkers did not remove children from a foster home run by a woman who it had learned regularly kept an 8yearold child out of school to care for two younger children while she went to work the children were removed only after a caseworker on a subsequent visit found the children home alone and the 4yearold running around with a knife perhaps most striking about the cases made public yesterday was that they involved foster homes the state regarded as its most sophisticated homes licensed to care for children with complex and delicate medical and emotional needs the records released yesterday include 11 case files from 1998 to 2002 and they reflect the errors made by the agency spanning the administrations of gov james e mcgreevey and his predecessors , christie whitman and donald t difrancesco after the death of faheem williams , a 7yearold whose body was found in a locked newark basement in january , mr mcgreevey vowed to bring sweeping reforms to the troubled child welfare agency there is no excuse for leaving children in dangerous situations or with people who have been identified as having an abuse or neglect history , said joe delmar , a spokesman for the agency but it is important to remember that these are selected individuals and cases , and while they are troubling and upsetting , it is important to know that our foster parents do quality work every day mr delmar added that his agency had already revoked the licenses of two of the group homes listed in the documents and was investigating a third new jersey was ordered to make the files public by united states magistrate judge john hughes of federal district court in trenton in response to a court action brought by the new york times the files were already in the possession of children s rights inc , a manhattanbased advocacy group that is suing new jersey over its foster care system several weeks ago , the state had made public the first collection of records 17 cases dealing with children who had died or been grievously abused while in its care but the 28 cases that have been made public to date reflect only a tiny fraction of the child welfare population in new jersey , and lawyers and others , including family members of those who have dealt with the agency , say the cases released so far only hint at the scope and variety of harm endured by children in the state s care the agency serves more than 6 , 000 children in foster care abuse rates in the state s foster system are three times the rate deemed tolerable for any child welfare agency by federal law among the saddest stories revealed in the documents are those of children who lived in dangerous homes for extended periods after dyfs knew that abuse or neglect was taking place in 2001 , the agency found that two mentally impaired children were being neglected by their foster parents despite the fact that the parents were being paid extra to provide additional monitoring , they were ultimately discovered to have frequently left the children alone or in the care of their 12yearold biological son the agency took action to remove the children only after repeated reports to the police from neighbors who spotted the children unsupervised in dangerous situations riding bikes on a street with heavy traffic or playing in a lake a mile from the house one neighbor spotted the children playing alone in the snow in her backyard at 2 am but the documents make clear that none of this was a surprise eight months before the home was closed , in fact , dyfs s own investigators had found evidence that the foster mother was leaving the children , including one with an iq of 48 , home alone for hours and was repeatedly canceling medical appointments the investigators had concluded that the children should be removed and the home closed , but the dyfs official charged with monitoring the home said she was unaware of the finding and so the children remained unattended and at risk in another home , a fragile 5yearold , who could not speak because of a tube inserted in his trachea , was found to have been repeatedly kicked and hit with objects by people in the foster home the child was one of six children , four of whom were classified as deserving special medical attention , who had been placed in the home , which was approved only for two children with special medical needs again , the agency had known quite a bit about the home before the children wound up physically harmed long before the 5yearold was removed from the home , for instance , dyfs workers had reported on overcrowding and physical disrepair in the home , noting the smell of urine in the hallways moreover , two months before dyfs took action because of the physical abuse , a nurse had filed a report on a brutal argument between the foster parents in which they screamed profanities and threatened to toss the children out in the middle of the night another nurse , the agency s records show , had asked to be reassigned because she could not stand to see the foster children mistreated sometimes , the documents released yesterday show , children remained in dangerous , nearly lethal homes because of the poor quality of investigations of prior alleged abuse in another case , dyfs officials cited a hillside , nj , foster home in 1997 for uncovered radiators , which later burned one of the three foster children in the home the investigators also explored allegations that the foster parents had medically neglected one child by not seeking treatment for a burn and had physically abused another by pouring hot sauce into his mouth after a bedwetting incident the investigators determined that the claims could not be true two years later , in january 1999 , the agency found that the foster parents had not taken some of the children to therapy appointments and had failed to meet regularly with social workers the agency considered removing the children , but did not six months later , social workers found still more violations , including uncovered garbage and a swimming pool without a protective guardrail yet the children remained in the home it was not until august 2000 , after one of the foster children was transferred into another home , that the extent of the problems became clear at that point , the boy who was transferred out of the home told dyfs officials that he and two other boys , his 9yearold brother and a 12yearold , had been repeatedly sexually and physically abused by their former foster father over the preceding three years the boys said that the foster father groped them and forced them to perform oral sex the children also said that their foster father slapped and punched them , beat them with a hanger and crushed their toys as a method of discipline
saving the sun a wall street gamble to rescue japan from its trilliondollar meltdown by gillian tett illustrated 337 pp new york harperbusiness 2695 more than a decade after the air first began gushing out of the japanese economy , the country still has n't recovered economists have debated many technical fixes but in saving the sun , her narrative of an american private equity fund s takeover of japan s longterm credit bank \( ltcb \) , gillian tett suggests that the barriers to recovery are more cultural than economic japan s problem , according to tett , is the deeply held belief that risk and reward must be shared , that group cohesion trumps strict economic considerations tett , a correspondent for the financial times of london , diagnoses the economic problem thus japan s banks lent indiscriminately throughout the postwar period , especially during the boom years of the 1980 s during that time they had little regard for standard banking considerations like a client s ability to pay back a loan the trouble was that this led to huge overcapacity , since borrowers never had to explain how they might generate returns on the bank s investment that s where japan s culture of socialized risk comes in in a wellfunctioning economy , the banks would have pulled the plug on their worst borrowers in order to redeploy capital more productively later on in japan , the idea of letting longtime borrowers fend for themselves was anathema the banks kept throwing good money after bad , in hopes that the economy would improve and the delinquent borrowers become profitable to american eyes , of course , the flip side of economic inefficiency is economic opportunity and that more or less sums up how tim collins , the politically wellconnected manager of a highly profitable vulture fund called ripplewood , saw the japanese banking system in the late 1990 s in the spring of 2000 , collins and his partner , chris flowers , a mergers and acquisition specialist from goldman sachs , took control of the recently nationalized ltcb needless to say , there was trouble from the getgo tett describes how efforts to convince the japanese that ripplewood intended to reform , not cannibalize , ltcb \( subsequently rechristened shinsei bank \) came undone at the company s first press conference after flowers answered his cell phone while a highranking japanese official was speaking , the local press became convinced that he had arranged the call to put the official in his place tett , who began her career as an anthropologist , has a keen eye for these details she recounts , for example , the horror of the japanese bankers at finding a team of indian technology experts , whom the americans had hired , casing the shinsei headquarters in search of new efficiencies perhaps the most comic scene in the book comes just after the takeover , when vernon jordan \( one of collins s many highpowered friends \) joins a couple of american executives for lunch in the company cafeteria trying to be friendly , jordan et al sit down at a table of lowlevel secretaries and commence making small talk their efforts elicit only frozen stares but the biggest flashpoint between the americans and the japanese comes , not surprisingly , over the issue of liquidating bad loans during their negotiations with the japanese government , collins and flowers had insisted on a provision that would protect them from being swallowed up by ltcb s loan portfolio in response , the government offered what s known as a put , meaning the americans were entitled to return any loan they deemed nonperforming in exchange for a kind of refund the catch was that the japanese never intended for shinsei actually to use the put in japanese culture , a bank was expected to stand by its major borrowers through thick and thin shinsei created a national scandal the first time it handed back a loan throughout the saga , tett implies that the attempt to impose americanstyle capitalism on the japanese amounted to a misunderstanding of the implications of culture for economics flowers like most of the shinsei investors did not give much credence to the idea that japan needed to be special , tett writes , with a hint of a sneer money was money she suggests that the wiser approach would have been a kind of third way to restructuring the nation s banks much like the scandinavian countries' approach to their own financial crises in the early 1990 s indeed , when shinsei finally begins showing signs of life , tett concludes that it has stumbled upon a uniquely japanese approach to reform more gradual , more respectful of consensus her point here seems to be either that no economic system can function if it s not in tune with a country s cultural values , or that radical economic change can really be accomplished only through cultural change but is this true \? it s not clear the scandinavian reforms tett alludes to were actually a lot like what the ripplewood team had in mind for japan in sweden , the government either took over or bailed out major banks , stripped them of their problem loans and then returned the banks to the private sector as quickly as possible moreover , the supposedly welfarestateloving swedes managed to cut costs and rationalize management like regular wall street raiders likewise for japan what tett sees as the third way seems to me a lot more to me like the american way , perhaps with a slight japanese sheen yes , shinsei s american managers learned to be slightly more tactful with their japanese colleagues and clients but none of the progress shinsei made between march 2000 and march 2003 , as the proportion of bad loans in its portfolio fell from over 20 percent to roughly 5 percent , could have been accomplished had the japanese not come around to the american way of thinking namely , that a bank ca n't stay afloat if it s not figuring out which customers are likely to pay it back perhaps tett was guided by an anthropologist s identification with her subjects some of the most moving passages in the book revolve around katsunobu onogi , an ousted ltcb president who was torn between his fidelity to tradition and his knowledge that the bank s practices were unsustainable yet what she sees as cultural obstacles to reform look more like convenient excuses by reluctant politicians and executives it seems that economics is n't nearly as constrained by culture as she suggests or that a culture can change pretty quickly when it has to
william reesmogg , the former editor of the times of london , raised a very important question in an essay he wrote after watching the recent , massive antiwar demonstrations in europe referring to the various banners carried by protesters , he noted there was , i thought , one slogan which was missing there were quite a number which called for 'freedom for palestine' but i looked in vain for one which called for 'freedom for iraq' none of the speakers expressed any wish to free iraq mr reesmogg is quite right when it comes to the middle east , the whole issue of democratization and better governance simply is not part of the debate over the future to the extent that it is , it is used as a tool to beat up on enemies , not a supreme value to be promoted for everyone let s start with the europeans there is only one group of arabs for whom europeans have consistently spoken out in favor of their liberation and that is those arabs living under israeli occupation , the palestinians those arabs who have been living under the tyranny of saddam hussein or other arab dictators are of no concern to president jacques chirac of france and his fellow travelers we all know what this is about the jewish question for too many europeans , arabs are of no moral interest in and of themselves , observes the middle east analyst stephen p cohen they only become of interest if they are fighting jews or being manhandled by jews then their liberation becomes paramount , because calling for it is a way to stick it to the jews europeans' demonstrations for a free palestine and not for a free iraq or any other arab country smell too much like a politically correct form of antisemitism , part of a very old story the truth is , france is not interested in promoting galit , fraternit and libert in the middle east it is primarily interested today in managing american power it is primarily interested in positioning france to become the world s next great uncola , the leader of the alternative coalition to american power in fairness , though , before now the us has never shown much interest in arab democracy either it treated the arab states like big , dumb gas stations , and all the us cared about was that they kept their pumps open and their prices low otherwise they could do whatever they wanted to their own people at home or out back only after 9 11 , as we realized that what was going on out back in these countries threatened us , did the us begin to call for democracy in the arab world but only to get rid of yasir arafat and to punish those arab regimes it did not like , namely saddam hussein s you still have not seen any serious democratization effort being directed at saudi arabia or egypt or kuwait for america , government of the people , by the people and for the people is only for our enemies , not our friends but then , other than a few courageous arab liberals , arab intellectuals have not made democracy promotion a supreme value either in part it s because liberating palestine has always been treated by them as a more important political value and in part it s because many arab societies are still so tribalized , and have such a weak sense of citizenship , they fear that democracy could bring forth fundamentalists , a rival tribe or anarchy hence the arab saying better a hundred years of tyranny than one day of anarchy ironically , 9 11 began to change this view you can see it in the lack of arab support for saddam there is a much deeper awareness that leaders like saddam are what have retarded arab development but because arab peoples and systems have never developed their own way of getting rid of bad leaders , they can only look to outsiders to do it and that evokes the worst memories of imperialism and colonialism , notes mr cohen they do n't want to get rid of saddam at the cost of being controlled by americans so they are paralyzed wanting their saddams removed , but deeply afraid of who will do it and what will come next what all this means is that when it comes to building democracy in iraq , the europeans are uninterested , the americans are hypocritical and the arabs are ambivalent therefore , undertaking a successful democratization project there , in a way that will stimulate positive reform throughout the region , will require a real revolution in thinking all around among americans , arabs and europeans if done right , the middle east will never be the same if done wrong , the world will never be the same
a few weeks ago , i made a pilgrimage to the yucat n , the place where i first fell in love with flyfishing nearly 30 years ago on the caribbean shores of mexico , just south of tulum and its sunwashed maya pyramid , a very rutted road leads to a tidy line of thatched cottages no television , no newspapers just the calming murmur of the surf this is boca paila , or mouth of the kettle , so called after a tidal lagoon behind the lodge that must have looked , to an imaginative cartographer , like a huge kettle with narrow spout on that first trip , in 1975 , i knew very little about fishing but over the course of five days i caught hardcharging bonefish and impossibly tenacious permit on spinning tackle and live shrimp the rest of the party was a genial bunch who braved persistent wind , clouds and rain the three enemies of the shallowwater flyrodder and found what little shelter there was from the wind to wave their willowy wands in the air it was the first time i had seen flyfishing it was as close to an epiphany as i have ever come , and i resolved to become a flyfisherman over the next few years i studied the art of flyfishing with a devotion akin to religion it was , to quote robert traver , not because i regard fishing as being so terribly important but because i suspect that so many of the other concerns of men are equally unimportant and not nearly so much funi returned to boca paila because i hoped to catch a permit on a fly in my memory , i could still see hundreds of permit flashing across the flats of boca paila from that first trip i remember my guide , jorge , interrupting a serious conversation about the many virtues of johnny bench to point out the marvelous throngin the 28 years since that trip , i have cast to perhaps two dozen permit , and true to their kind they either fled with the speed of rocketpropelled grenades or sauntered away with the disdain of a sophisticated lady giving the brushoff to an artless suitor so my heart raced , when , on the first day of my return to boca paila , our guide , juan caamal , a patient and optimistic maya , pointed out a permit mudding about 150 feet away time stopped i held my breath as we closed on the fish it would take a long cast , lest the permit sense us in the calm shallows i let the fly sail right in front of the fish but just as the fly landed , he turned i cast again and , once again , the fish feinted left as i cast right my third cast scared him right off the flat my fishing partner , josh feigenbaum , and i contented ourselves with catching a number of small bonefish on my 6weight rod great fun , but not a permit that evening , there was much discussion of knots and tactics rett foster , of clayton , ny , extolled the action imparted to the fly by a loop knot and i agreed next day , when juan called out two nice permit way up the flat , i had tied on my crab fly with a loop i reached out as far as i could cast with my 10 weight and led the fish he tipped down on the fly his mouth opened i struck , felt momentary resistance , and that was all that fish took your fly , juan assured me , let me have a look at the hook would n't you know it \? i got a permit to eat and the point of the hook caught in the loop that i had neglected to tie small enough we had other permit shots that day , but none so much in our favor and we finished up with another half dozen bones on our final day , josh cast to a fine threesome of permit and his line tightened he smiled like a man drinking a glass of ice water on the hottest day of the year but where was the screaming reel and the slashing run of the permit \? within a minute we had our answer an opportunistic bonefish had swiped josh s fly then it was my turn on the bow and in a shallow , clear backwater we came upon two tailing fish i let go a long and what i would call exceedingly moral cast ie , one that should have been rewarded with the two permit converging on the fly but they kept wiggling their tails wantonly i cast again , and again , never scaring them but neither did i entice them as for catching permit , i did have my chances , which is all you could ask for when we returned to the dock , an older fellow helped us tie up he looked familiar did you used to like johnny bench \? i asked in spanish s , mucho , he answered photos cathy beck casts on the flats , left richard stuhr with his permit , caught at boca paila in 2000 \( photographs by barry and cathy beck \)
kandahar , afghanistan , aug 3 the assassination , witnesses said , was trademark taliban two men on a motorbike , the passenger opening fire with a kalashnikov rifle , the driver making a quick getaway but the choice of victim signaled a new turn for the taliban , the fundamentalist islamic movement that was ousted from power and has been running a campaign of attacks against foreign and afghan government troops in southern afghanistan for months this time , the assassinated person was maulavi abdul manan , known as maulavi jenab , a member of the local district religious council , shot as he left his mosque last week he was the third senior muslim cleric killed by taliban assassins here in the last 40 days in addition , the head of kandahar s ulemaushura , or clerics' council , maulavi abdul fayaz , narrowly escaped death when a bomb exploded in his mosque as he was leading evening prayers on june 30 twentyseven people were wounded , 14 seriously , council members said since then two other clerics , also members of their district religious councils , have been shot to death one , maulavi ahmadullah , was killed two weeks ago in his district of dand , not far from kandahar in southern afghanistan on wednesday evening , another , maulavi jenab , was killed in his district of panjwai , southwest of kandahar the killings come amid increased taliban activity in southern afghanistan local officials reported capturing 20 taliban suspects in the last few days in two operations in kandahar province , one against a band of taliban who killed two government soldiers last week the authorities also caught a taliban member trying to plant a mine meant to kill the governor of oruzgan province , north of kandahar maulavi muhammad haq khattib , deputy head of the kandahar clerics' council , said the clerics had undoubtedly been attacked by the taliban according to the villagers and local elders , they had no enemies , he said in an interview in his office in kandahar it was because of their support for the government the 15member kandahar ulemaushura and its branches in the districts have been vocal supporters of president hamid karzai and have welcomed the presence of foreign troops in afghanistan appointed by the governor of kandahar , the council members are clearly allied with the government , but they are also keepers of the city s most hallowed shrines and are among the most senior tribal and religious figures by challenging the taliban movement at the core of its legitimacy its claim as a religious authority the ulemaushura has drawn direct reprisals against its members the taliban are saying they are religious people , but they are using force to get their aims and are using the cover of islam , maulavi khattib said but we say this is not islam islam does not support the use of force , and we are telling people not to fight seven months ago , the council issued a religious edict denouncing the taliban s call for a jihad , or holy war , against the americanled forces in afghanistan unlike the soviets , whose intervention here in the 1980 s was intended to occupy the country and so justified a jihad , the americanled force had come to expel terrorists and bring peace , and had united nations support , maulavi khattib said he gave other reasons that a jihad could not be called he said that the government had been elected , and that a religious council had no right to call a jihad against a government chosen by the people the ulemaushura edict , signed by dozens of clerics , says of the taliban they are saying that foreign troops have captured our country and they are calling to start a jihad against them just by using the name of jihad , they are killing as many people as they want respected muslim brothers , you know the situation you are witnesses that the president of our country is a muslim , and his vice presidents and all members of the cabinet and government authorities are muslims , the edict reads no one has said you should stop going to the mosque or stop praying , so for what reason is this a place of fighting \? the taliban have denounced the clerics' council , leaving threatening leaflets in mosques and bazaars , maulavi khattib said they wrote that people who work with the government would be harshly punished , and religious people would be doubly punished , he said but none of the clerics who were attacked had received specific threats , he said it is not clear who commands the most influence with the people of southern afghanistan there is no doubt that maulavi khattib , whose family has guarded the mui mubarak , the shrine of the hair of the prophet , and his deputy , maulavi wali muhammad whose family for 200 years has been the keeper of kandahar s most famous shrine , karqa mubarak , the shrine of the prophet s cloak are well respected they have support from the district councils and plan to open more offices in southern afghanistan but they admitted in an interview that the taliban have continuing influence in the districts in the rural areas , their propaganda is strong and the people are scared of them , maulavi khattib said even if they saw something of the murders , they would say nothing photo maulavi muhammad haq khattib of the kandahar clerics' council says the taliban have no right to call a jihad against an elected government \( photo by carlotta gall for the new york times \) map of afghanistan highlighting kandahar taliban activity is increasing in districts around kandahar
welcome to long island reads the grimecoated sign at the eastbound rest stop near exit 51 on the long island expressway , where the long island convention and visitors bureau dispenses tourist information from a dilapidated railroad car truckers who crowd into the rest stop , more interested in finding a parking space than in ocean beaches , get a distinctly unwelcoming message from the island , which depends on the goods they carry but seems to want no part of their trucks the message is to get in and out fast avoid needing sleep , food or fuel and above all , try never to come back but now , because of changed laws limiting their driving hours and just in time inventory systems that pinpoint delivery times , more and more truck drivers are pulling over on the expressway shoulders because there is no other place to park there , they pose danger to themselves and other motorists for truckers , purgatory is new york city , where the torments of tolls and traffic await only deadend long island , without even a hint of amenities for them , is worse you get stuck down here , and there s no place to go , no place to eat , no place to rest , said walter bellinger , a driver from new hampshire who was hauling bottled water on an overnight run from poland spring , me , to a distribution center in hauppauge you 'd think they would put at least one truck stop in despite its neartotal dependence on trucks , long island is indeed without a single truck stop , and maxine hicks for the new york times transferring from rail to truck a proposed railtruck freight yard at the pilgrim psychiatric center site may face opposition page 9 truckers say that legal parking remains so scarce that both local and longdistance drivers now routinely overflow from each end of the exit 51 eastbound and westbound rest stops it is , the drivers say , the sole refuge for them on the most heavily traveled section of the island s only major eastwest truck route each rest stop has room for 30 to 35 trucks based on state figures , an estimated 20 , 000 commercial vehicles cross the nassauqueens border on the expressway on a typical day the state department of transportation once proposed rebuilding the exit 51 rest stop into a turnpikestyle service area with a restaurant , bathrooms and spaces for truckers to park overnight but the plan faltered when residents of adjacent dix hills strenuously objected the department now plans a scaledback project for a rest area and tourism center on the eastbound side with space for 27 trucks construction is tentatively set for 2006 jennifer post , a department spokeswoman , said that while truck traffic was increasing on long island and elsewhere in the state , the common pattern on long island was for truckers to make their deliveries and leave without having to take a mandatory rest stop she said transportation officials did not believe an enlarged rest area was needed ms post said that while parking on the shoulders of limitedaccess highways was illegal , there were seven legal public parking areas on major long island arterials in addition to the exit 51 rest stops but except for two locations on routes 347 and 454 , the areas are far to the east , in southampton and east hampton , where truck traffic is light former rest stops near exit 66 of the expressway are now truck inspection stations ms post said truck parking was also permitted there , but no signs on the expressway say that william g joyce , the president of the new york state motor truck association in albany , said that the shortage of truck parking was acute long island is a pretty big place , and you ca n't have deliveries at 8 am and not have the guy get on long island until 8 am , especially when you consider the congestion for people coming through the city , he said the long island association , which supports rebuilding the exit 51 rest stop as a tourist center , is proposing that a fullservice truck stop be part of a truckrail freight yard at the former pilgrim psychiatric center near exit 52 there is no question that it has become an epidemic of trucks looking for a place to stop legally , and unfortunately all they can find is the rest area at exit 51 , said mitchell pally , the association s vice president for government affairs the solution is for the state of new york to build a modern rest area there for a tourism facility and to build a separate truck stop at pilgrim state ms post said transportation officials were considering the proposal in the meantime , the dingy exit 51 rest stops , which offer a few vending machines , outdoor telephones , overflowing garbage cans and portable toilets , are the extent of the services for truckers it s the only place i found where i could

san francisco , june 22 berlioz and wagner seemed to have gotten wrong directions on their way to san francisco over the weekend on friday , berlioz s damnation de faust ended up at the war memorial opera house , when it may have been more at home on the symphonic stage across the street wagner s flying dutchman , an opera put on as a concert the next night , needed all its powers of suggestion to make davies symphony hall behave like a theater of the two , wagner extracted more from his unnatural surroundings , partly because of peter mcclintock s directorial dance between the representational and the abstract , but more fundamentally because of the ingredients at hand here were six strong singers , a confident chorus and michael tilson thomas s orchestra playing with grace and power the puzzle of operainconcert as a medium solo singers and a loud orchestra competing toe to toe on a level stage is finessed at davies hall principals and chorus sing from balconies around the stage , projecting handsomely above and through the instruments below orchestra players are free to operate at full power , allowing listeners to hear better what operahouse pits so often halfdisguise stage effects were minimal a stretch of sailcloth or shifts of lighting choristers rushed in and out of the galleries above , crossing and recrossing the line between concert passiveness and operatic acting too often to my taste the question for mr mcclintock and his designers , david finn and daniel hubp , was always how far to go abstraction sets off the imagination , and when singing lovers are of a certain size , suspensions of disbelief become easier i could have done without chorus members swaying side to side , throwing confetti and winding yarn there was also the disco light show that sent the dutchman to his fate but what musical satisfactions there were mark delavan splendid in the title role jane eaglen singing senta in her big , true soprano and stephen milling as a firstrate daland eric cutler , jill grove and thomas studebaker were almost as good , and mr thomas and the san francisco symphony played with elegance and keenness of spirit not necessarily intended for the opera house in the first place , damnation on friday was a test case for opera disembodied versus opera fully clothed indeed , the thomas langhoffj rgen rose production , imported from munich , seemed to be asking at every moment whether stage pictures were adding to berlioz s dramatic music or distracting us from it a stage is set within a stage , with chorus members in evening dress sitting in rows beneath and in four tiers of boxes on either side players advanced and recessed along converging blank walls the chorus alternated between passive decorum and unruly commentary directorial fancy upstaged its object of desire lewdness without limit can make good theater , but the langhoffrose take on faust and his temptations made one wonder whether hooded , leatherstrapped , highbooted and barebottomed operatives acting out roughtrade sexual fantasies had more to do with the darker urges of the postwar german mind than with berlioz s secret groves where gentle lovers walk with their thoughts such distractions buried berlioz s theatrical music under fragrant piles of metaphor angela denoke singing marguerite s last lament would have needed only her voice and berlioz s accompaniment no stage picture could compete with the orchestration berlioz wrote for m phistoph l s s gallop into hell none of this was helped by david kuebler s misadventures in the title role , which was thinly sung and perpetually above the pitch mr kuebler s distress was heightened , set next to kristinn sigmundsson s vivid m phistoph l s and ms denoke s dignity as marguerite donald runnicles s heartfelt conducting seemed lost to the willfulness around it some patrons did not take it lying down , leaving loudly just as mr langhoff s images of backroom fornication were nearing their peak photos david kuebler and kristinn sigmundsson \( kneeling \) in san francisco opera s damnation de faust \( larry merkle san francisco opera \) michael tilson thomas leading the san francisco symphony and chorus in the flying dutchman \( kristen loken san francisco symphony \)
dayton , ohio , march 29 she can shoot , sure , but her height , 5 feet 9 inches , is ordinary so is her athleticism so just how did maria conlon get a scholarship to play basketball at connecticut and become the starting point guard as a junior \? a hardy resilience known in sports as toughness take the time she was hit in the head by a javelin this was the spring of 1997 , her freshman year of high school at track practice , someone called conlon s name and , as she turned , a javelin clipped her face near the right temple , chipping a bone and causing some permanent hearing loss she blacked out and was rushed to the hospital in derby , conn it could have struck her eye , or her temple , maria s father , tim , said she had an angel on her shoulder when kim conlon arrived at the emergency room , she found her daughter sitting impatiently , a turban of gauze on her head , not wanting stitches because she had basketball practice that night with her aau team maria agreed to stitches , but only after her mother agreed to let her attend practice she s always had a certain toughness you ca n't give someone , said chris dailey , the associate head coach at uconn \( 331 \) , which faces boston college \( 228 \) on sunday here in the semifinals of the east regional you have it or you do n't maria conlon has always had it in sixth grade , she played on a boys' team one day , her mother said , her coach designated her to set screens against the opponent , and the first time she set a pick , she lost a tooth maria gave the tooth to the coach and kept playing a second tooth was knocked out , then a third , but her insistence kept rooted she needed braces , and they were going to have to do a lot of extracting , kim conlon said with a laugh she saved me a lot of money when maria was about 10 , tim conlon built a basketball court in the backyard , arranging pressuretreated wood into a kind of parquet floor reminiscent of boston garden he loved the celtics , so he painted the court green and decorated it with a sketch of a shamrock six of maria s cousins , all boys , lived next door , so it was never difficult to find a game tim conlon traveled 40 weeks a year as a salesman of safety equipment , and basketball was a way to bond on weekends with maria and his son , also named tim two spotlights allowed them to play after dark curfew was 9 pm , so the lights would not bother the neighbors , except on memorial day , when a neighborhood twoontwo tournament lasted from 8 am until midnight we only had one rule if you played with maria , you could n't take it easy on her , kim conlon said you had to block her shot , you had to push her around in the family basement , maria sometimes dribbled a basketball as she watched television outside , her father painted a 3point line at the distance of 21 feet 9 inches , 2 feet beyond the high school and college arc i knew she would n't be that tall , he said i figured , in order to get her shot , she 'd have to shoot from deep for hours at a time , maria shot in the backyard once , in the fifth grade , tim said , she missed a crucial shot in a game , came home , shoveled snow off the court and shot long after her father grew cold and tired and went back inside at nearby seymour high school , maria led her team to a 964 record , a 62game winning streak and two state championships , setting connecticut records for 3pointers in a season \( 86 \) and a career \( 246 \) she became a local legend in the lower naugatuck valley people asked for her autograph , the school retired her jersey and her picture later began appearing in local restaurants in the rarest of honors granted an instate player , she received a scholarship to uconn in the 18 seasons that geno auriemma has coached at uconn , only a handful of his highprofile players have come from connecticut , including jennifer rizzotti , nykesha sales and rita williams auriemma blames the state high school association , which forbids girls from practicing basketball until after thanksgiving and prohibits entire teams from playing together at summer camps state officials say they are trying to avoid specialization in fall sports and to maintain competitive balance in summer camps auriemma says this hurts the development of girls statewide they do n't let kids practice enough , he said they do n't get better the current uconn roster draws from nine states , but only conlon is from connecticut she has played an important role this season , becoming a starter after nicole wolff sustained stress fractures in her feet conlon has handled the ball , freeing diana taurasi to roam , and has hit 3pointers notable less for their frequency than for their timeliness when we signed her , people were saying 'what are you doing that for \? she s not fast , quick or big enough , ' auriemma said there ought to be room for a player like that of all the contributions a lot of kids made this year , none could be bigger than hers other than diana , she s the only true ball handler she s really tough there s worse things in life than taking a kid who knows how to shoot and how to win as a freshman , conlon struggled with the transition to the college game only limited minutes were available as a sophomore in a championship backcourt that featured taurasi and sue bird last summer , realizing the opportunity available as a junior , conlon got into the best shape of her life , giving up fried food and junk food , running and lifting weights , honing her shooting and dribbling auriemma wants conlon to shoot more often and to run the team more assertively sometimes , dailey said , taurasi s teammates tend to stand and watch her as spectators instead of teammates still , conlon has been indispensable she made three critical 3pointers in a 1point victory over tennessee , delivered a careerhigh 8 assists against duke and collected a careerhigh 15 points against miami at a time when most uconn recruits arrive with allamerican credentials , conlon s presence suggests value in the less heralded , in a player who does n't need her name above the marquee , who needs only to be a part in the chorus people see me , i'm not 64 or really athletic , but i'm here and i'm doing stuff and i have a national championship , conlon said and she may soon have a second photo connecticut coaches say the junior point guard maria conlon , from derby , conn , has a toughness that ca n't be taught \( john dunn for the new york times \)
zacarias , my brother the making of a terrorist by abd samad moussaoui with florence bouquillat translated by simon pleasance and fronza woods 143 pp new york seven stories press paper , 1495 it s as if the structure of my family s past has taken on the dimensions of a mystery for me i want to see if , by examining our history , i can discover somewhere within it a key an event that might explain what produced so much loss and violence that is how mikal gilmore , living in the shadow of his older brother gary , explained his need to write shot in the heart , his remarkable 1994 memoir abd samad moussaoui , the older brother of zacarias moussaoui , the socalled 20th hijacker and only person so far charged in an american court in the sept 11 terrorist attacks , has much smaller ambitions for zacarias , my brother so here i am , a simple person , wanting to share what i know about my brother i hope i will be able to make myself understood even that humble goal eludes him in terms of narrative structure and emotional exposition the book is a train wreck but what we do come to understand is that the author s simple person selfcharacterization should be taken lightly , and that sharing zacarias s story , or even defending his brother , is the least of his aspirations plenty of memoirists would give anything to have had abd samad s youth the sublime dysfunction of the family , with its driving , rejecting mother and absent father , the upbythebootstraps strivings of two bright boys , the brothers' concurrent awakenings to two very different paths of islam so perhaps the most remarkable thing is that none of the project s four collaborators moussaoui , his coauthor florence bouquillat , a french television journalist , the translators simon pleasance and fronza woods seem able to make the characters or the story the slightest bit interesting nor can abd samad , who lost contact with zacarias in 1995 , paint more than a generalized picture of what turned his brother into an extremist still , the numbing recountings of street beatings , job denials and academic obstacles are a reminder that the reality of living under racism is death by a thousand slights but there is little point in judging the book on literary grounds it was n't meant to be a memoir rather , it s an exercise in damage control not for his family or his brother instead , abd samad has appointed himself spin doctor to islam his religion is innocent of all this fanaticism and all this terror adherents of the severe wahhabi brand of sunni islam , perpetrators of a sham set on brainwashing harmless young men of arab descent adrift in the sea of european secularism , are blamed for any violence in the name of allah quite by chance the novice may stumble upon an extremely vitriolic book , he tells us , and the trap is sprung yet the problem with these texts seems to be less that they advocate murdering infidels than that they call for the destruction of traditional sunni islam and what is this wahhabi heresy s most potent tool \? why , the west , of course , is the oilrich wahhabists' enabler in this recounting , the terrorist groups are successful because young arabs raised in countries like france have been corrupted by the western reflex , by which anyone who appropriates concepts of reform and reformism is elevated wahhabism feeds on a misguided desire to get muslim society to set aside traditional religious institutions , in the same way the europeans have managed to oust the church in other words , wahhabis simply are n't real muslims but i'm afraid it s simply not that easy any more than roman catholics can just pretend that the defrocked child molesters were n't real priests to say that terrorists be they al qaeda , hezbollah or jemaah islamiyah in southeast asia draw on islam is not to tar it as a religion of hate rather , these groups are a tumor on islam but the question of how to excise that tumor holds little interest to the abd samad moussaouis of the world for those of us who want to believe that all the talk of a clash of civilizations is so much ivorytower hooey , zacarias , my brother is dispiriting , to say the least
washington no one expected a breakthrough in the talks in beijing last week among the united states , north korea and china on resolving the north korean nuclear problem , and none was forthcoming instead , the meetings were predictably sterile , unexpectedly truncated , and marked by the paradoxical combination of bellicose bluster and hints of possible deals we have come to expect from pyongyang but it would be a mistake to dismiss the talks as a farce or a failure , as many inside the beltway have on the contrary , the united states made important progress toward stability in northeast asia in fact , the north koreans' behavior probably alienated their previously sympathetic chinese hosts , and may have strengthened america s hand globally in the dispute in addition , secretary of state colin l powell has now revealed that north korea offered a plan to take steps in dismantling its nuclear and missile programs in exchange for economic and security benefits in no event did the talks change any of the fundamentals that is , north korea still requires urgent and sustained attention , and the range of options for dealing with it remains unappetizing the current crisis began last october when north korea admitted that it has a program to produce highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons in doing so , it tacitly confessed that it had been cheating on the socalled agreed framework of 1994 in the ensuing weeks , north korea took increasingly provocative steps , including expelling the international inspectors who were monitoring its nuclear facilities , restarting a nuclear reactor that could produce more plutonium , and withdrawing from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty with each step , it moved closer to becoming a fullfledged nuclear weapons state the united states has responded by asserting that it wants to resolve this increasingly dangerous situation through diplomacy if possible , but repeatedly noting that it has not taken any options off the table it has also insisted that it will not pay blackmail that is , it will not reward north korean cheating by offering inducements for pyongyang to come back into compliance with its existing obligations put differently , paying for a return to the terms of 1994 agreed framework is not an acceptable option finally , the united states has maintained that any engagement with north korea must be multilateral , and explicitly ruled out direct , oneonone talks with pyongyang up until the beijing talks , the other concerned parties particularly south korea , japan and china had been urging the united states not to let form get in the way of substance , and had been pressing washington to agree to direct talks the united states resisted , insisting that any lasting solution to the north korean problem could be achieved only if pyongyang s neighbors were involved in talks it has also been urging the chinese to use their influence to get north korea to halt \( and , ideally , reverse \) its march down the nuclear road , and also to agree to multilateral talks considered against this backdrop , the talks in beijing should be chalked up as a success for the american approach , and a testament to effective american leadership most important , the chinese role has changed in response to united states requests , china has gone from its more familiar posture of sitting on the sidelines of controversial international security issues to playing an active and constructive role indeed , there is little doubt that the north koreans would have refused to come to the table had the people s republic not all but directed them to do so , a point the chinese underscored by suspending critical fuel shipments to north korea for several days \( there also are reports that beijing told pyongyang not to cross the red line of reprocessing its spent fuel to extract more plutonium \) and the chinese did not simply convene the meeting , but participated actively , making the talks multilateral in fact as well as form moreover , the decision by china to play host to the talks gave it a major stake in a resolution of the issue , and the north koreans' behavior during those meetings which deeply embarrassed the chinese improves the odds that beijing will continue to use its leverage on the north these developments are significant , not least because it is difficult to imagine any lasting resolution of the north korean problem that does not involve china , as well as south korea and japan at the same time , we should not lose sight of two key points first , the beijing talks shed little light on whether north korea would be willing under any reasonable set of circumstances to abandon its programs in nuclear weapons and missiles to deliver them second , it remains in the american interest to pursue multilateral engagement with north korea to try to find out the answer united states objectives likewise remain the same we will not pay blackmail , and we will not buy the same horse twice but we do want to stop north korea from being a threat to peace and security in northeastern asia and a supplier of weapons of mass destruction elsewhere to realize these goals , we must dismantle the north korean nuclear and missile programs in a way that is realistically irreversible and verifiable in return , we should be willing to join with others in providing credible assurances to north korea that it need have no concern about its own security , so long as it does not threaten others we should also make clear that we would be prepared to take a leading role in ending north korea s political and economic isolation such a proposal would be a deal about a whole new horse , going far beyond the 1994 agreed framework as for north korea s intentions and objectives , the beijing talks offered confusing and contradictory hints only when there are serious negotiations to make clear both what we and the other concerned parties require of north korea , and what we are prepared to do in return , will we get to the bottom line the united states accordingly should make clear that it is prepared to continue its policy of engagement with the north \( to be expanded as soon as possible to include south korea and japan \) with a view to negotiating a peaceful resolution this willingness , however , will be predicated on a freeze in north korea s nuclear and missile activities we can press the case that if the north koreans are serious about putting those programs on hold , we would reciprocate with respect to our military forces in and around the korean peninsula but if north korea continues to expand its nuclear activities and , in particular , if it pursues the reprocessing of its spent fuel rods , the united states will have no choice but to fundamentally reassess its commitment to a diplomatic resolution there is no assurance that pyongyang will respond positively to such an approach , much less that negotiations will be successful on the contrary , history gives rise more to pessimism than hope but even if that pessimism proves warranted and north korea shows itself to be more interested in nuclear proliferation than in guaranteed security continuation of washington s goodfaith effort will put it in an immensely stronger position internationally to deal with the threat drawing \( stephen

los angeles , nov 11 the bookshelves in gov gray davis s los angeles office are bare , stripped of his books , photographs , mementos the traces of his three decades in public life are boxed up and headed for storage the painters are in the hallway sprucing up the governor s suite in the ronald reagan state office building here , the fumes seeping under the office door a reminder of the unusual change of tenancy that will take place next monday that afternoon , mr davis will turn over the governorship of restless , striving california to arnold schwarzenegger , and for the first time in 30 years mr davis will be neither in elected office nor otherwise employed in government whatever else historians conclude about his career , one fact will stand out he was the first governor of california and only the second governor in the united states , after lynn j frazier of north dakota 82 years ago to be recalled from office in an hourlong interview , the 60yearold mr davis blamed for his fate the convergence of a faltering economy , the candidacy of a hollywood megastar and his own shortcomings as a politician and public leader he betrayed no bitterness at the sudden and humiliating end of his term , but he could not resist a bit of wistfulness am i a little sad about leaving this job \? he said with a smile that looked more like a wince sure but i'm entering a new chapter of my life , and i'm looking forward to it he said that he intended to work on education issues at a private foundation and that he might also practice law \( he has a law degree from columbia \) he also did not rule out another run for elected office the governor said that he believed he could have beaten any contender other than mr schwarzenegger in the recall election last month , but that the actor and former bodybuilder had presented too much of a challenge all the other candidates were mere mortals , he said but arnold schwarzenegger is well known , he s well liked , and he s wealthy that s a potent combination in california politics mr davis , a secondterm democrat , said he believed that the recall would not have succeeded without the money of representative darrell issa , a republican who paid nearly 2 million to collect the signatures needed to put the question on the specialelection ballot but , he said , the state s economic and budget problems fueled the dissatisfaction that cost him his job the governor recognized the volatility of california voters after his reelection in 2002 , a victory he achieved with a surprisingly narrow margin over bill simon jr , a political firsttimer i just felt we were on borrowed time , he said so he was not surprised when in february he received notice of the intent to try to recall him that had happened twice early in his first term , when the california economy was booming , but neither effort qualified for the ballot it s a pleasure to govern in good times , he said it s a bummer to govern in bad times mr davis does not question the wisdom of the recall provision in the california constitution , which was put there in the early 20th century at the initiative of progressive party leaders who then governed the state he does , however , think the threshold for signatures 12 percent of the number of those who voted in the most recent election for governor is too low in the age of the internet and paid signatureharvesters but while mr davis attributes his ouster largely to the economy and a wellfinanced opposition , he does not spare himself a part of the blame i did n't stay in touch with the people , he said that s clearly my biggest regret voters are the source of all wisdom you have to conduct an ongoing dialogue with them mr davis spent much of his first term in sacramento wrangling with legislators , cutting deals with lobbyists and soliciting money from political donors he neglected his base in the democratic party and spent little time traveling around the state listening to voters his image as an aloof technocrat was well earned he tried to undo that reputation during the recall election campaign , with a calculated personality transplant he conducted numerous town hall meetings and talked more openly than he ever had about his personal life he brought in the democratic party s most charismatic leaders to vouch for his virtue and warn of the dangers of throwing out an elected leader but none of it worked the recent wildfires in southern california , after the recall , afforded mr davis a last opportunity to display the leadership qualities that had eluded him his performance was an exercise in ubiquity , in which he visited two or three scenes of devastation a day while the fires raged , offering governmental assistance and personal comfort to officials and victims he says he hopes people will remember all that as they weigh his service to the state over three decades i had a chance to focus on helping people , he said of his activity during the fires that s why i ran for office in the first place mr davis has devoted much of his time since the recall election to overseeing the transfer of power to mr schwarzenegger by all accounts , the transition has been a model of civility and grace in the interview , mr davis praised mr schwarzenegger s initial steps and early appointments the governor and his wife , sharon , invited mr schwarzenegger and his wife , maria shriver , to dinner last week at a los angeles restaurant there , he said , he told the governorelect to expect to come under extreme pressure from members of his own party and from interest groups that have five years of pentup demand for policy changes mr davis recalled that shortly after he himself took office in 1999 , succeeding a republican governor , he complained to his wife about the incessant demands , but that she replied snap out of it you spent your whole life wanting to be governor you should enjoy every moment mr davis said that although he and mr schwarzenegger disagreed in many policy areas , they shared one thing a terror of mr schwarzenegger s motherinlaw , eunice kennedy shriver he said that the night before jimmy carter s inauguration as president in 1977 , he and gov jerry brown , to whom he was then chief of staff , stayed at the shrivers' home in washington he and mr brown rushed off the next morning to attend a preinaugural breakfast with senator edward m kennedy and did not see the shrivers again that day years later , he ran into mrs shriver and asked if she remembered him from their earlier meeting of course i do , she said icily you left without saying goodbye and you left without making your bed mr davis admitted sheepishly that it was true he added , arnold shared some similar incidents , which i wo n't relate photo gov gray davis of california attributes his recall partly to a faltering state economy it s a pleasure to govern in good times , said mr davis , who gives up office next monday , but a bummer to govern in bad times \( photo by ann johansson for the new york times \)
hanover , germany , jan 30 the poster says , choose peace , and it shows chancellor gerhard schr der next to sigmar gabriel , the candidate for mr schr der s social democratic party in a local election campaign viewed here as a referendum on the national government the poster goes on to say , with your vote for the sdp , you will give a clear no to war , an obviously intentional reminder of the national election mr schr der won in september , when he squeaked into office by campaigning against american policy on iraq but if opinion polls and commentators are to be believed , the peace appeal is not working this time around , not in a state that has one of the highest unemployment rates in germany , even though mr schr der is a favorite son , having served as the state s chief minister for eight years before becoming the national chancellor lower saxony is one of two states where local elections will be held on sunday hesse is the other and , while polls can always be wrong , the broad expectation is that mr schr der and his party are going to come out embarrassingly badly in both for that reason there has been much talk that losses in hesse and lower saxony would amount to a kind of vote of no confidence in mr schr der , and that he could even resign as a result strictly speaking , what is at stake for mr schr der are seats in the upper house of parliament , which is already controlled by the opposition , so there would be no fundamental change in the balance of power in germany and mr schr der would have no obligation to step down few people now think he would step down nonetheless , election losses would seriously erode his authority and prestige only four months after he began his second term , promising to reinvigorate the economy by a series of creative reforms there s a long history of lastminute swings in germany , said helmut jung , a political researcher at the society for market and social research in hamburg , allowing for the possibility that the social democratic party will benefit from a large undecided vote but the voters of lower saxony seem to be saying it s time for a change this is schr der country , mr jung said of lower saxony its loss would present a great psychological problem for schr der , a symbolic defeat lower saxony is one of the industrial heartlands of germany , a state that has six volkswagen plants a local expression has it that if volkswagen sneezes , lower saxony catches pneumonia and it currently has an unemployment rate of 8 percent it is also the kind of place that shows how quickly the political mood can change , and how quickly it has changed for mr schr der , whose approval ratings have gone down to about 25 percent in recent days if we fail in this election it will not be our failure , said rainer brenker , a spokesman in hanover for the social democratic party s campaign it will be because of the general mood in germany mr brenker was speaking in the party s drafty hanover campaign headquarters , decorated with color posters of the candidates running for the state legislature a politics for reality , says one campaign poster another , with a picture of mr gabriel , says simply , the right one , a slogan seen all over this city what people here in both major parties the leftofcenter social democratic party and the rightofcenter christian democratic union agree on is that the economy , especially unemployment , has taken over from the conflict with iraq as the issue of the moment mr brenker said that while the iraq question which to the fury of american policy makers probably saved mr schr der in the national election might still have emotional grip for some people , especially ardent social democrats , it had lost its power for a majority of the electorate the psychological effect of a loss of lower saxony if , in the end , the social democrats lose the state would be intensified by the fact that mr gabriel , 43 , has for a couple of years at least been presented as a prot g of mr schr der , 53 , and even as a possible successor he even looks a bit like mr schr der and has some of the same mannerisms as the campaign has unfolded in the last two and a half weeks , it has taken on a conspicuous edge of nastiness christian democrats here , clearly expecting a victory on sunday , say that shows the social democrats' desperation to find an issue with some emotional traction one social democratic newspaper advertisement reads , the cdu would treat your children as criminals , a reference to a christian democratic proposal to allow judges to take dna samples of criminal suspects and then there is a poster asking people to declare a clear no to war by voting for the social democrats , as if a vote for the opposition would be a vote against peace none of this seems to have worked for mr gabriel or his party , and a poster seen all over hanover rubs it in this time cdu , it says facing defeat , they started the iraq theme in the last 10 days , said david mcallister , the christian democratic manager in lower saxony and a candidate for the state legislature they tried it unsuccessfully the last time , but we 're all talking about all sorts of other things now mr mcallister , a german whose father was scottish , continued , our approach is that things are so rotten in germany that they can only get better with the cdu a small sample of local residents , taken in the last couple of days in the pedestrian mall in hanover s center , reflected the social democratics' problem the main complaint seemed to illustrate the sentiment , reflected in national opinion polls , that mr schr der s government has been drifting we have a choice between cholera and cancer , said erich schwarz , 72 , a retired builder who said he

president bush sought to revive a sense of national resolve last night with a state of the union address that readied the country for a showdown with iraq and demanded another huge tax cut for wealthier americans no one watching the somber mr bush s delivery could doubt his determination but the combination created far too mixed a message it was hard to reconcile the president who vowed not to pass along our problems to other congresses , to other presidents and other generations with the one whose fiscal policies have helped create gigantic deficits for taxpayers of the future still , anyone who had forgotten the president s compassionate conservative agenda was reminded last night of his ability to create bold and surprising initiatives that breach the gulf between left and right there were some of those ideas in his agenda , particularly the most welcome proposal to spend an additional 10 billion over the next five years fighting aids in africa and the caribbean though mr bush reserved his passion for the topic of iraq , he opened with his domestic agenda , an attempt to reassure nervous voters that his concentration on foreign affairs has not made him forget the problems back home the big idea unveiled last night was a muchanticipated plan to begin offering politically popular prescription drug benefits to the elderly the catch in this proposal is that it would make drug coverage available only through private health plans , not the feeforservice medicare , and he will need to make a strong case why drug coverage should not be provided through both systems the president reintroduced his 670 billion taxcut plan , including a proposal to eliminate dividend taxes that even many of his loyal supporters have declared dead on arrival the plan is tilted toward the wealthiest americans and has very little that would stimulate the economy at a time when the country may be taking on the expense of an overseas war and is continuing the fight against domestic terrorism , this is radical rightwing economics , dogma mr bush cannot keep peddling if he hopes to unite the country behind his foreign agenda he also said nothing about help for the states and localities struggling under the burden of the stagnant economy for all his talk about the need to cut taxes , the bush administration seems indifferent to the fact that local property and sales taxes are soaring all around the country the very levies most likely to discourage consumer spending the possibility of war with iraq overshadowed the president s other themes mr bush has always done a good job of arguing that saddam hussein is dangerous , and he did so again last night he methodically recounted all the good , though circumstantial , reasons the administration believes the dictator of iraq is not disarming he is deceiving , and the welldocumented evidence that mr hussein is a cruel despot who uses torture against his own citizens your enemy is not surrounding your country , your enemy is ruling your country , he told the iraqi people but the president has never been as effective in making the case for immediate intervention or for going to war absent broad international support while there is a natural fear that iraq might give arms or biological weapons to terrorists , the administration has not been able to connect those dots , or even to demonstrate that iraq has a history of aiding terrorism as clear as that of some american allies in the region we welcome the president s decision to bring the question of iraq s conduct back to the united nations next wednesday and to provide new intelligence that will bolster the administration s case more troubling was his threat to attack iraq even without security council support mr bush s language and his intensity left little doubt that his path was set , no matter what the rest of the international community decides mr bush s personal popularity hinges on his obvious sincerity and determination to show leadership in fearsome times he has lost none of the daring and conviction that got him where he is today a man who enjoys political power matched by few presidents in american history but as he heads into his own reelection cycle with a war plan at the top of his agenda , the state of the union that the president leads is clearly laced with anxiety and doubt
fairport , ny , april 9 at school district headquarters here , superintendent william cala s desk is strewn with congratulatory phone messages , letters and email messages hundreds in all , they praise him and the fairport board of education for taking a stand against a state government that has not passed a timely budget in 19 years and that they see as dysfunctional editorials and oped articles have praised the courage of fairport s school officials for telling albany that they are fed up with late state budgets that make a mess of local spending plans and state regulations that force districts to spend money on things they do not think they need fairport s rebellious resolution , unanimously passed last month , cast the school administration as david taking on the state s goliath when dr cala arrives at mcardle s restaurant , one of his regular lunch spots in this prosperous rochester suburb bisected by the erie canal , the hostess bows deeply from the waist , as if greeting royalty strangers and friends crowd around his table , offering highfives or picking up his tab maureen n nupp , the board president , meets similar acclaim at a funeral mass she attended this week , the priest clapped her on the back with a hearty go get 'em so , too , did a fellow board member , joyce kostyk her postman recently backed up his truck and said , give 'em hell john q public gets it , dr cala said it s the bureaucrats who do n't the state education department , for sure , has not taken kindly to fairport s civil disobedience , detailed in a threepart resolution first , the district has postponed a vote on its school budget , required by state law on the third tuesday in may , until the state approves its own budget second , it has asked for relief from costly state requirements that must be paid for locally unfunded mandates , as they are called and third , it has announced plans to send ungraded assessment tests to the education department because correcting them would cost 30 , 000 that the district would rather spend elsewhere the department , in a letter from its legal counsel , warned that flouting state education law is grounds for removal of the board and the superintendent only one such housecleaning has ever happened in new york , state education department officials say in roosevelt , on long island , after decades of fiscal mismanagement the education department distributed the threat letter , as it is known in fairport , to the 700odd school districts not titfortat , a department spokesman , tom dunn , explained , although fairport had earlier sent out 700 letters of its own encouraging other districts to break the law it was only fair , mr dunn said , to inform them of the sanctions they would face as lawbreakers in all the nasty backandforth between fairport and the education department , new york s education commissioner , richard p mills , has been silent the law is clear , mr dunn said , so mr mills had no option but to inform fairport it was out of line the commissioner and his counsel would not comment i do n't think they 're required to speak here , mr dunn said the distribution of the department s warning letter dashed fairport s hopes that other districts would step forward and adopt its resolution many individual school board members from other districts have communicated their support to dr cala but have said they were unwilling to join fairport s risky rebellion several districts put the resolution on their agendas , then removed it robert destefano , a school board member in liberty , ny , sent a blunt letter to the department , with a copy to ms nupp you are clearly out of your mind , it began , characterizing fairport s action as the equivalent of the american revolution as it pertains to school economics mr destefano asked if our board and all the boards in the state follow suit will you dismiss us all \? liberty s board has taken no action thus far words of support have also come from superintendents , among them michael mcgill in scarsdale i share their frustration and anger at the state s inaction , said dr mcgill , a comrade of dr cala in their dislike of standardized testing it s more than a little hypocritical that fairport has to obey the law while the state gets to disregard its april 1 budget deadline but for me it does n't rise to a level of moral injustice that justifies breaking the law , dr mcgill said dr cala and board members are disappointed , to put it mildly , at the cold shoulder from other districts since they say they doubt that mr mills could withstand the public outcry if he started dismissing boards and superintendents all over the state i'm stunned that other districts wo n't do it , ms kostyk said we never thought that there would be none , especially when the emails started rolling in but they are heartened by other developments tom golisano , a failed third party candidate for governor and a local business tycoon , says he will pay the legal bills for dr cala and his board if the state makes good on its threat to remove them and they want to challenge the dismissals assemblyman steve sanders of manhattan , who is chairman of the education committee , told the times union of albany that it was not out of the question to amend the budget schedule for districts , although he proposed no legislation
of all the challenges we face , none is more troubling than the fact that thousands of oregonians many of them children do n't have enough to eat oregon has the highest hunger rate in the nation gov ted kulongoski , in his state of the state address those who still believe that the policies of the bush administration will set in motion some kind of renaissance in iraq should take a look at what s happening to the quality of life for ordinary americans here at home the president , buoyed by the bountiful patronage of the upper classes , seems indifferent to the increasingly harsh struggles of the working classes and the poor as mr bush moves from fundraiser to fundraiser , building the mother of all campaign stockpiles , states from coast to coast are reaching depths of budget desperation unseen since the great depression the disconnect here is becoming surreal on thursday the national governors association let it be known that the fiscal crisis that has crippled one state after another is worsening , not getting better taxes have been raised services have been cut and the rainy day funds accumulated in the 1990 s have been consumed if help does not materialize soon in the form of assistance from the federal government or a sharp turnaround in the economy some states will fall into a fiscal abyss that already seems to be happening in places like california , which has been driven to its knees by a twoyear 388 billion budget gap , and oregon , which has seen drastic cuts in public school services and the withholding of potentially lifesaving medicine from seriously ill patients most states have been unable to protect even the most fundamental services from damaging budget cuts few states have succeeded in exempting highpriority programs such as k12 education , medicaid , higher education , public safety or aid to cities and towns , according to the compilers of the fiscal survey of states , a report produced jointly by the governors' association and the national association of state budget officers scott pattison , director of the budget officers' group , said , if economic conditions remain stagnant or worsen , and if budget shortfalls continue next year , the states will have exhausted many of their options for countering a weak economy the budget crisis in california , where an unpopular democratic governor is politically paralyzed and the republicans in the state legislature refuse to consider raising taxes , is potentially catastrophic jack kyser , a public policy economist in los angeles told the associated press people are nervous there s a real chance for a meltdown that could have rippling effects throughout the nation this is something of a different magnitude than we 've seen before the governors' association called the fiscal survey the most accurate gauge of the health of state budgets its discouraging findings were released as the president was preparing a fundraising swing that added millions more to his campaign stockpile , and as the internal revenue service was reporting that the nation s richest taxpayers were accumulating an even greater share of the nation s wealth some americans are missing meals and going without their medicine , while others are enjoying a surge in already breathtaking levels of wealth so what are we doing \? we 're cutting aid to the former while showering government largess on the latter there s a reason those campaign millions keep coming and coming and coming a times article last week noted that the wealthiest 400 taxpayers accounted for more than 1 percent of all the income in the united states in 2000 , more than double their share just eight years earlier the influence of the wealthy has always been great , but it has n't always been so cruel especially in the past six or seven decades there were many powerful political and civic leaders who looked out for the interests of the less fortunate and pressed their claims for treatment that was reasonably fair that s changed the bush juggernaut , at least for the time being , is rolling over everything that dares to get in its way and fairness is not something it is concerned about
washington , june 26 some social conservatives expressed whitehot fury today over the supreme court s 6to3 ruling striking down a texas sodomy law and expanding the rights of gay men and lesbians this has not been a good week for social conservatives , said jay a sekulow , the legal director of the american center for law and justice , a conservative legal advocacy group founded by pat robertson both the affirmative action and the gay rights decision reflect a political approach to the law that we deplore , mr sekulow said , referring to a court decision on monday allowing universities to use narrowly tailored affirmative action in admissions programs but we all were especially surprised by the scope and breadth of today s opinion it was a grandslam homer for the other side while the affirmative action decision angered many conservatives , today s ruling on the texas statute cut far deeper , especially for groups that view issues like sexual conduct as freighted with profound moral and religious significance the rev jerry falwell , an evangelical leader , said in an interview that this is probably as bad a day as the court has had on social issues since roe v wade , the 1973 ruling that first found a constitutional right to abortion the court , mr falwell said , had put the right of privacy ahead of respect for community standards of morality which have prevailed for many years ken connor , president of the family research council , characterized the decision as classic judicial activism arrogance mr connor said that none of the rights the court enunciated today were found in either the text of the constitution or the history of the nation like many other critics of today s ruling , he cited justice antonin scalia s dissent , in which justice scalia suggested that the ruling opened the way for judicial sanctioning of other sexual activities that have traditionally been outlawed by states this opens the door to bigamy , adult incest , polygamy and prostitution , mr connor said if the hallmark is privacy and consent , as long as you have those two , the court is saying you have no basis for legislating to the contrary notwithstanding the public health issues involved when you have sexual relations , for example , between a mother and an adult son senator rick santorum of pennsylvania , third in the senate republican leadership , found himself the center of a debate last month after the associated press reported that he had warned that if the court did not uphold the texas sodomy statute it would mean you would have the right to bigamy , you have the right to polygamy , you have the right to incest , you have the right to adultery you have the right to anything robert l traynham , mr santorum s spokesman , said today that the senator would not be interviewed on the subject mr falwell also said that the ruling could set the nation down a slippery slope in which courts might approve bestiality , prostitution and the use of narcotics it s a capitulation to the gay and lesbian agenda whose ultimate goal is the legalization of samesex marriages , he said mr falwell asserted that a clear majority of americans oppose samesex marriages , but polls show that an increasing number of americans do not oppose the legalization of sexual relations between consenting adults of the same sex a gallup poll last month showed that 60 percent thought such relations should be legal 35 percent were opposed a poll asking the same question in 1977 found 43 percent in favor and 43 percent opposed mr falwell said he did not disagree with all of the court s decisions this week he praised an opinion on monday that requires public libraries to install antipornography filters on computers providing internet access as a condition of receiving federal money phyllis schlafly , president of the eagle forum , a conservative group based in st louis , tried to leaven her anger today by finding an admittedly unlikely silver lining well , the good news is that it opens the door to reversing roe v wade , mrs schlafly said if the court can overturn a decision made 17 years ago , they can now overturn roe , she said in reference to bowers v hardwick , a 1986 ruling that said there was no constitutional right to engage in homosexual relations in private mrs schlafly said , as did many other conservatives this week , that recent court rulings demonstrated a need to press president bush to name a reliable conservative candidate when a vacancy opens on the supreme court tom minnery , vice president of focus on the family , a social conservative group based in colorado springs , said , with today s decision , the court continues pillaging its way through the moral norms of our country gary bauer , a former republican presidential candidate and the president of american values , said , once again , an activist supreme court has substituted its judgment over the decisions of the citizens of texas , who , through their elected representatives , had made a moral and legal judgment about behavior

the criminal trial of frank p quattrone , a former star investment banker at credit suisse first boston , began in federal district court in manhattan yesterday with lawyers on both sides trying to identify which speech therapists , nurses or economists might be the most dangerous jurors mr quattrone , whose demeanor was upbeat in the courtroom , faces charges that he tried to hinder investigations by a federal grand jury and by securities regulators into first boston if convicted , he could be sentenced to as much as 25 years in prison the trial of mr quattrone is taking place just blocks from another prominent case , the trial of tyco international s former chief executive , l dennis kozlowski , whose companyfinanced parties have become the stuff of corporate myth he faces charges that he looted the company and investors of 600 million both cases have come to symbolize the government s effort to crack down on corporate excesses of the 1990 s the two cases have also assumed importance as some of the first criminal actions against individual executives in other cases , those charged with criminal wrongdoing have pleaded guilty , avoiding the spectacle and risk of a trial but mr quattrone s case will take place under the eyes of a small army of reporters eager to describe every twist and turn zachary w carter , a former united states attorney who is now a partner at dorsey whitney , remarked you guys in the media , and the general public informed by you folks , find it difficult to imagine that people with this kind of access to wealth feel a need to go a bridge too far and to commit what appear to be unnecessary violations of law to increase their wealth , which was beyond most of our wildest dreams that s what captures our imagination like the trial of the accounting firm arthur andersen last year , this case will probably have effects far beyond mr quattrone , said sheldon t zenner , head of the whitecollar practice at katten muchin zavis rosenman in chicago critical in the case against mr quattrone will be whether an email message he endorsed , directing department members at first boston to follow the firm s documentretention policy , constituted an effort to obstruct a government investigation mr zenner said that investment bankers would be much more careful about which documents they got rid of and which ones they destroyed when , as well as about what they told employees to do with documents you can fairly look at what happened in the arthur andersen case and what is going on in this case , he said , and presume that it is going to have an impact and cause people to be extremely cautious in how they respond in similar situations prosecutors contend that mr quattrone authorized the sending of the email message to members of the firm s technology group in december 2000 , reminding them to comply with its document retention policy , and that by doing so he encouraged them to destroy evidence sought by the securities and exchange commission and a grand jury prosecutors have not filed charges based on other assertions that mr quattrone rewarded favored clients with access to hot stock offerings , for example that are the subject of regulatory actions mr quattrone s lawyers are expected to respond that he was unaware that the investigations extended to his unit of first boston they are expected to argue further that the email message only advised employees to comply with first boston s document retention policy , not to destroy documents lawyers did not get to these arguments yesterday , as judge richard owen , prosecutors and defense lawyers tried to identify suitable jurors to hear the case jury selection is scheduled to resume this morning the process was not helped when early in the day it became clear that none of the potential jurors in the courtroom were included on the list of names provided to the judge that problem was quickly resolved and then began a long process of questioning potential jurors , asking about their work experience , dealings with the federal government , investment practices , even their hobbies and reading interests while many said they read both the new york times and the wall street journal , almost none said they knew of mr quattrone , who has been the subject of numerous articles in those and many other publications the defense team wants to find rugged individualists cowboys , said patricia mcevoy , a partner at zagnoli mcevoy foley , a communications firm that specializes in litigation support who will not be bullied by other jurors to convict mr quattrone , all members of the jury would have to agree by cowboys , i mean people that are n't plugged into the status quo , ms mcevoy added , and who would be willing to hang the jury
two days after the boston red sox acquired curt schilling to bolster their starting rotation , the yankees were poised to make a series of freeagent acquisitions they had zeroed in on the righthander tom gordon to be a setup man while closing in on gary sheffield to play right field neither player had agreed to a contract as of last night , their agents said , and discussions with the two could still reach an impasse , but negotiations were said to be close to a conclusion schilling agreed to a twoyear contract extension with the red sox on friday , completing a trade from the arizona diamondbacks and giving boston perhaps baseball s deepest starting rotation baseball executives said yesterday that the yankees might be waiting until sunday to sign sheffield in case the atlanta braves , his team last season , offered arbitration if the braves do offer arbitration and another team signs him , or if sheffield signs elsewhere before that deadline , the team signing him will forfeit a firstround draft pick for the 35yearold sheffield if the braves do not offer sheffield arbitration , the yankees can sign him without surrendering a draft pick either you have a deal or you do n't , and we do n't have a deal right now , sheffield s agent , rufus williams , said last night williams said he was still speaking with more than one other team and that none had dropped out of negotiations or had indicated they would wait until sunday to sign sheffield sheffield could sign within the next few days , williams said gordon was negotiating solely with the yankees to be a setup man to closer mariano rivera , said dan horwits , one of his agents horwits said they were discussing a twoyear contract for the 36yearold gordon , who had 12 saves for the chicago white sox last season we 're close , but nothing s official , horwits said last night of gordon and the yankees an announcement could come in a couple of days , he said if they sign gordon before sunday , the yankees will surrender a draft pick the yankees also hope to resign starting pitcher andy pettitte and acquire either javier vazquez from the montreal expos or sign the free agent bartolo col n inside pitch kazuo matsui , the freeagent infielder from japan , said saturday that he was seeking a city comfortable for his wife and daughter , with his preference being the east or west coast because of the large number of japanese communities there matsui told reporters in japan that he was seeking an environment where my family feels safe and where i can focus on playing the mets have expressed interest in matsui , preferably to play second base but possibly shortstop , with jos reyes moving to second the yankees and the los angeles dodgers are also believed to be seeking matsui , who could be persuaded to play second base matsui said his agent , arn tellem , told him 10 teams were interested
east rutherford , nj , dec 17 in the first game since they criticized byron scott and his coaching staff , jason kidd and kenyon martin pointed a finger back at themselves and gave scott , their embattled coach , some breathing room if the nets have quit on scott , they gave no indication wednesday night no matter what the players told scott during their locker room blowup saturday in memphis , they delivered a much different message to the utah jazz , winning , 8774 , at continental arena the nets \( 1212 \) have captured five of their last six games , though the loss will be remembered more than all the victories combined the meltdown in memphis included an embarrassing 47point defeat and an ugly postgame scene , with kidd and martin yelling at the staff in front of the entire team against utah , they turned their frustration elsewhere and gave fitting performances martin scored a gamehigh 22 points and added 11 rebounds kidd scored 19 points and had 8 assists whatever happened saturday is over , martin said it s behind us kidd ducked out of his postgame news conference for the first time this season on saturday , kidd and martin expressed concern that the staff was failing to prepare the players but scott said before the game that he still had control of the team , and the nets somehow erased the problems that plagued them in the first meeting with utah , a 9184 loss on dec 1 this time the nets outscored the jazz by 200 on the fast break and by 4218 in the paint this week , scott came down with a stomach virus and martin also said he was ill during the game here , martin had cramps , kidd injured his foot slightly and aaron williams , the backup center , pulled his left groin muscle none of that bothered scott we had a lot of energy from beginning to end , he said i'm very , very pleased i had a feeling we 'd bounce back the nets outscored utah by 139 in the secondlowestscoring first quarter since the inception of the 24second shot clock in 195455 the game was slowed even more as 60 fouls were called , but at the end , the nets were not complaining they have done quite enough of that photo jason kidd blocking a shot by jazz forward matt harpring , right , in the first half last night in new jersey \( photo by john marshall mantel for the new york times \)
well , it was a good try but it was impossible to listen to days of recent testimony on school union contracts before the city council s education committee without thinking that the most potentially revealing witnesses were missing the mayors , chancellors and city and school negotiators of times past they are the ones who gave new york the contracts that tie the schools in knots , from the wedo n'tdorugs custodians' deal to the united federation of teachers pact that grew from 42 pages in 1962 to 204 pages today \( not counting 800 pages of side contracts and links to state law \) there s no other contract like it in the city , said james f hanley , commissioner of labor relations he places the blame on the quasiindependent board of education , a bastion of union power that has given way to a system of mayoral control led by a chancellor , joel i klein , who is intent on breaking with old patterns but others were equally intent , including mayors who ran for office promising to rein in the powerful union and did not if you are saying none of the city governments , mine included , going back to bob wagner and up through giuliani , did n't do all it should , you are absolutely right , former mayor edward i koch said in an interview this week the contract is the union s life s blood with every union , all they have to worry about is how do we do less work with more payment the primary issue for the mayor , particularly when things are bad , is how to keep the city s expenses down , not we need this hour back or whatever it is did the union put a few over on the city over the years \? no question about it , mr koch said randi weingarten , president of the teachers union , testified last thursday that the union was not the only party at the negotiating table true but those negotiating teams were clearly not evenly balanced and so the giuliani administration , negotiating a contract in 1996 that froze wages for two years , gave the teachers a sweetener that critics now consider the scourge of the schools circular six , named for the implementing memo it allows school aides to replace teachers patrolling cafeterias and hallways , and frees teachers from jobs like grade adviser , in exchange for an extra period of loosely defined professional development but many teachers use the time as they wish , and principals complain of lost control mayor rudolph w giuliani lauded the provision as a major productivity gain , leading critics to accuse him of ignorance of how schools work , or to denials from his aides of doing a political favor for a union leader who supported his campaigns now the city blames us , ms weingarten complained , and went on to employ some creative statistics , never yielding in testy exchanges with eva s moskowitz , the education committee chairwoman for instance , ms weingarten noted that though contractual rules give teachers with seniority first dibs on transfers into vacant teaching positions without so much as an interview with a principal , such seniority transfers account for less than 10 percent of each year s 9 , 000 vacancies but she left out that those 600 teachers overwhelmingly fill the most desirable vacancies , which are far fewer than 9 , 000 so the seniority transfers have a significant impact on weak schools with a disproportionate share of inexperienced teachers another example principals say that removing unsatisfactory teachers is such a long and cumbersome process taking up to three years that they often just let poor teachers move on the records of those teachers stay untarnished by a u for unsatisfactory rating , and the next school suffers anthony lombardi , a queens elementary school principal , said unapologetically that he manipulated the system to benefit his school , knowing he perpetuated the problem ms weingarten protested that the removal process now takes an average of only 65 days that s about right counting from the day charges are filed against a teacher but those charges are typically filed after years of paperwork and grievance procedures maybe the wheels could turn faster , and theoretically charges could be filed earlier but it just does n't work that way , not when the starting point is a toxic layer cake of a contract that as ms weingarten often and accurately notes city and school officials signed how to begin to change a contract that covers 106 , 000 people and goes back 41 years and traditions just as entrenched \? slowly , is probably the answer which has to get a u from parents with students in school right now
it s called america s greatest sporting event but is the ncaa men s basketball tournament sporting in the sense of , or having to do with sports \( per the first entry in webster s new world college dictionary \) or sporting in the sense of sportsmanlike fair , as in a sporting chance \( per the third entry \) \? how many of the 65 teams invited to the tournament have a sporting chance to win \? it has been said that most of the teams in the tourney have about as much chance as custer at the little big horn , but that s blatantly unfair to the sioux most historians place the odds against the seventh cavalry anywhere from 10 to 1 to about 5 to 1 if you 're a 16thseeded team in the ncaa s , playing a no 1seeded team , the odds are well , astronomical since 1985 , when the tournament was expanded to 64 teams , no 1seeded teams are 720 versus 16thseeded teams with an average margin of victory of 256 points you may have heard that , but it gets worse if you take all the games that matched no 1seeded teams against teams seeded from nos 16 to 9 , the record is 127 victories and 3 losses if given the opportunity to choose between the two , custer might have thought he was getting the better deal statistics are said to be dull , but in the case of the ncaa tournament , they are terrifying taken together , the record of no 1 and no 2seeded teams versus all other seeded teams down to no 11 is 1625 sporting indeed the washington generals have had more success against the harlem globetrotters talk about competitive imbalance where s bud selig when we really need him \? now , when you get down to the socalled sweet 16 or at least the elite 8 , you do have great basketball , but by then , the tournament is as competitive as the postseasons of the professional sports why , then , did the ncaa decide that it takes a tournament of 64 or 65 teams to decide the champion of men s college basketball \? who really thinks that there are that many teams whose regularseason performance merits a shot at the national title \? the answer is that there are n't the point of the ncaa tournament as it is now structured is not so much to deliver a national champion no more than 16 teams are needed to settle that question the ncaa s purpose is to create a cash cow that cements its relationship with scores of small colleges or big colleges with weak basketball programs in 1977 , the ncaa lost the right to negotiate college football television deals when a handful of major powers formed the college football association , kicking the ncaa out of the bargaining procedure such a thing could never happen with basketball because the major powers have long schedules to fill , and they must fill them with weaker programs that are very grateful for those bonus checks from the ncaa none of this was envisioned by a journalist and fanatical basketball fan named ned irish when he organized the first national college basketball championship playoff , the national invitation tournament , in 1938 for a couple of decades , the nit was all anyone needed , offering participants media coverage and money from ticket sales through the shrewd and innovative use of television , the ncaa built its power base and lured the top teams away from the nit by decentralizing the playoff system and having several games going at once , the ncaa s became sport s equivalent of a threering circus within half a century the relationship between the ncaa s and the print media reversed itself , and the tournament reached its primary audience through tv and the internet sports pages became dependent on the ncaa s television spectacle to attract readers the spectacle , of course , is exactly what many fans love about the ncaa tournament in its current form , and many of them are willing to tolerate any number of horrendous mismatches \( at least , presumably , when they do n't involve their school \) but the steady decline in ratings over the last few years , particularly in the early rounds , indicates that at least the real basketball fans are beginning to tune out it s probably true that most sports fans are still willing to accept the ncaa men s tournament as america s greatest sporting event increasingly , though , that belief seems to be based on whether they accept webster s first or third definition of sporting
three finance professors have devised a new mutual fund rating system that appears to do a better job of separating managers whose performance reflects genuine ability from those whose results depend on luck alone at its core , the new system assumes that a manager s ability can be detected by comparing his portfolio with those of other fund managers and not by looking at his own past performance if the stocks he currently owns are also owned by managers with stellar records , for example , then the odds are high that he is a good manager in contrast , he probably is not worth betting on if he holds only stocks that are primarily owned by managers with awful records the idea is a significant departure from traditional approaches to rating mutual funds under the new system , a fund with a dismal record may receive a high rating , provided that its current holdings overlap with those of portfolios with good records the ratings system of morningstar inc is similar in some ways , because it judges a fund s record in comparison to other funds that have a similar style but unlike the new system , morningstar s would never give a higher rating to a fund whose performance was inferior to others in its category the authors of the research , randolph b cohen and joshua d coval of the harvard business school and lubos pastor of the university of chicago graduate school of business , use a basketball analogy to illustrate their reasoning imagine a 10shot freethrow contest between two players , one who shoots with one hand and the other who shoots with both hands which player would you bet on if , at the halfway mark , both players had made all five of their shots \? if you rate basketball players by their records , you have no preference but what if you find that , across the league , twohanded shooters make a much higher percentage of their free throws \? the intelligent bet would then be on the twohanded shooter , because luck probably played a larger role in the onehanded shooter s good record in other words , technique matters yet current systems focus on results alone they overlook a wealth of information that can give insight into managers' ability to show how much technique matters , the three professors constructed an elaborate rating system in which a fund s score is a function of the track records of all other funds that hold any of the same stocks the highestrated funds will be those whose stocks are primarily owned by marketbeaters , while the lowestrated will hold stocks that are mostly owned by losing funds the new system is superior in two ways to approaches that focus only on results first , there is a higher degree of statistical confidence in its conclusions from four to eight times higher , according to the professors , depending on how those traditional approaches adjust performance for risk consider funds that have been around for less than five years a group that , according to lipper inc , now contains 55 percent of all united states diversified and sector equity funds according to professor cohen , a focus on track records alone for such funds can be quite misleading because there is not enough data to have much confidence that winning managers have genuine ability or that losers were not just unlucky the professors largely sidestep this difficulty even a young fund typically owns several dozen stocks , providing many data points generally , confidence levels increase as more data becomes available the second advantage of the new system is its better ability to identify funds that will outperform the market had this system been used from april 1977 to december 2000 , investors who followed it would have made as much as 1 percent more per year than they would have by relying on ratings systems that focus on track records alone though this new research has not yet been published , it has been the subject of nearly a dozen graduate school seminars over the last few months it is available at http ssrncom abstract id 353620 one early criticism concerned the professors' treatment of windowdressing the endofthequarter tendency to buy stocks that have performed the best during the quarter and to sell losers windowdressing makes managers look like shrewd stock pickers would n't the new system erroneously conclude that such managers have great ability , because their portfolios now hold stocks that are owned by topperforming funds \? in response , the professors modified their system , so that it now also looks at when a manager buys or sells it gives a higher score to a manager whose timing of transactions more closely matches that of other managers with good track records to be sure , funds do not divulge the precise dates on which they buy or sell stocks but one can get a good idea by comparing their endofthequarter reports but how can the new system accurately rate an innovative manager one whose stocks are not held by any other fund \? to return to the basketball analogy , imagine that one of the two contestants in the freethrow contest was rick barry , who was famous in the 1960 s and 70 s for his unique underhand freethrow technique and for having one of the higher freethrow percentages in professional basketball since there were too few other professional players with whom to compare his technique , how could the professors' system recognize his abilities \? the professors do not deny the theoretical possibility of a rick barry in the mutual fund arena but they do minimize the probability according to lipper , there are 6 , 843 united states diversified or sector equity mutual funds , more than twice the number of publicly traded american companies with market capitalizations of at least 100 million because the average fund owns several dozen stocks , the odds are very small that none of a fund s stocks will be owned by any other fund the professors do not yet know the answer to one question can their rating system be improved further by combining it with more traditional approaches \? consider two funds that hold stocks that are also owned by topperforming funds is the one that has made the most money a better bet for future performance \? professor cohen says research on that issue is just beginning unfortunately , the mathematics and data needed to replicate the professors' new system are beyond most individual investors' capabilities our best hope of taking advantage of this new research is that a major fund rating service will incorporate it chart according to plan a new mutual fund rating system compares each fund with all other funds that own any of its stocks in tests based on historical data , funds rated most highly by this system outperformed the market , while those rated at the bottom underperformed graph tracks fund performance relative to stock market \( lowest 10 to the highest 10 \) fund s rank based on quarterly application of this rating system from april 1977 to december 2000 and a valueweighted composite of the entire united states stock market \( sources profs randolph b cohen , joshua d coval and lubos pastor \)
online tax preparation services are starting to show signs of significant growth , thanks in part to a strategic move by the internal revenue service the bush administration sent waves of dread through the tax advice industry last year when it suggested that the irs needed to do more to encourage online tax filing a suggestion industry executives feared would prompt the irs to offer free internet taxpreparation service to compete with paid services from companies like intuit and h r block but even without going into the business , the irs managed to get a favorable deal from the industry online taxpreparation companies agreed to offer their services without a fee to millions of taxpayers on the irs web site qualifying for the free service depends on various factors , like income or age the companies providing those services say the exposure they get from the irs web site \( www irs gov \) is opening up what they think will be a larger , profitable market this may have diminished our revenue growth , but it s also served as a catalyst for introducing millions of people to this , said mark ciaramitaro , vice president for h r block s esolutions team , which oversees the company s online tax service he added that block is hoping to develop a longterm relationship with people who have used its online tax system at the irs web site online taxpreparation services are nearly identical to the desktop software programs on which many are based taxpayers typically answer a series of questions about their finances , and the programs calculate taxes owed and send the return electronically to the irs along with the taxpayer s credit card payment the services typically cost 8 to 40 , depending on the complexity of the return in the arrangement with the irs , called the free file alliance , 17 online taxpreparation companies each agreed to offer their services without charges to certain segments of the population , provided that each company s offerings could be used by at least 60 percent of the total population of taxpayers for instance , intuit s turbotax for the web is open to people with 27 , 000 or less in adjusted gross income and those who qualify for the earnedincome credit other companies are helping taxpayers with higher incomes , or those from certain states altogether , the irs said that far more than 60 percent of this year s 132 million tax returns were eligible to be prepared free on its site about 10 days before tomorrow s filing deadline , 21 million returns had been prepared free on the irs web site , and many more were expected over all , the irs said that about 14 million returns would be prepared online this year , compared with 9 million last year the emergence of online tax preparation is a boon to tax software companies it allows these businesses to reach a group of customers who , they say , are different from those who usually buy the shrinkwrapped software in retail stores retail buyers are typically middle age , more affluent and more concerned about internet privacy issues , said h r block s mr ciaramitaro , while online taxpreparation customers tend to be younger and less affluent for intuit , the online service has brought in new users with relatively few of them coming from the turbotax customer pool , which bought 55 million units from intuit last year those online customers can be more profitable than software customers , said robert sterling , an analyst with the internet consultancy jupiter research and the author of a report to be released today on online tax services mr sterling said taxpreparation software has emerged as a commodity on fileswapping services like kazaa , where consumers freely trade pirated software along with music if these companies shift consumers to the web for more tax preparation , mr sterling said , they dodge a lot of the problems with piracy because they 're charging for each return they help prepare by contrast , desktop software applications are often passed to other users after the original customer is finished , he said intuit has eliminated much of its piracy problem by including a user authentication code in this year s version of turbotax but other companies have not followed suit , citing objections by some turbotax customers , who bristled at the authentication system but even with piracy , shrinkwrapped tax software can still be competitive with internet tax services in profitability , said mr ciaramitaro , of h r block the online service , for instance , must bear the cost of maintaining an internet system able to withstand the strains of extremely concentrated peak use periods with a surge of customers arriving in february and another just before april 15 h r block currently charges 20 to those who prepare their taxes on the company s web site before april thereafter , they pay 10 more the internet can provide companies a way to enhance the software and their profit by giving taxpayers access to tax specialists by email or phone both of the leading tax software companies , intuit and block , offer this option block relies on some of its 90 , 000 tax advisers , who will review a person s online tax return for 30 , or answer email questions on a particular tax topic for 20 turbotax for the web offers a review service for 30 , with tax advice offered through advisers affiliated with keen inc , at 20 for 10 minutes on the phone none of these services is offered free on the irs web site , of course in fact , such addons are one way the companies can continue to make money through the free file alliance , even as they give away basic versions of their taxhelp packages such revenue , plus the promise of future earnings from people who have used the irs giveaway , has persuaded online tax service companies to take part in the free file alliance the alliance agreement will expire in three years , at which time the irs can either renew it for two years or offer its own online tax service according to terry lutes , director of electronic tax administration for the irs , it is unlikely that the government will try to carve out a niche in the taxpreparation industry , which executives said generates about 132 billion offline and about 500 million online mr lutes said the irs was in the midst of a 10 billion technology upgrade that is a higher priority for the agency than creating software to compete with popular commercial products he said that online government taxadvice services had not proved popular in britain and australia more than 30 states currently offer their own versions of online tax preparation , he said , but fewer than 900 , 000 taxpayers used those services last year some critics attribute the unenthusiastic responses to a lack of trust that governments would give them good advice on how to minimize their tax bills that is one reason some companies seem unworried about the prospect of the irs becoming a competitor in the next few years we expect our good relationship with the government will continue , said rick jensen , vice president for product management of the intuit consumer tax group but we 'll be able to provide a value proposition to customers regardless of who s in this space photos rick jensen , left , vice president for product management of the intuit consumer tax group , at his office in san diego above , a screen image of

a technology trade show war is about to erupt jupitermedia , which publishes technology research and runs conferences , is planning to announce today that it is starting a trade show to rival comdex just a day after the company that runs comdex , key3media group , sought to reorganize under bankruptcy protection jupitermedia has booked space at the mandalay bay convention center in las vegas next fall to run its trade show at the same time that comdex is scheduled to take place just blocks away at the las vegas convention center hoping to capitalize on the perception of uncertainty surrounding key3media s future , jupitermedia is hoping to lure away comdex s exhibitors and attendees and , if jupitermedia s chairman , alan m meckler , has his way , he will put comdex out of business that s the idea , said mr meckler , who started internet world , a trade show we 're in this to knock them out but jupitermedia may not be alone sheldon adelson , who founded comdex and is chairman of las vegas sands inc , which owns the sands and venetian hotels , plans to start his own competing trade show at the same time , according to a report in tradeshow week both jupitermedia and mr adelson would most likely have a fight on their hands under the reorganization plan that key3media filed yesterday in a delaware court , the private equity arm of thomas weisel partners has agreed to take over key3media , keeping it in business with 30 million in debtorinpossession financing if the plan is approved , key3media s financing would be strengthened by reducing its debt to 50 million from 372 million , lowering its annual interest expenses to 34 million from 38 million still , key3media s comdex show has been under pressure for nearly two years without any competition crippled by the plunge of technology industries and cutbacks in corporate travel attendance at the comdex , once one of the biggest trade shows in the world , with more than 200 , 000 visitors and some 2 , 000 exhibitors , has dropped by nearly half despite the dropoff , it is unclear whether jupitermedia will be able to attract comdex s longtime anchor exhibitors like microsoft , hewlettpackard and sun microsystems , all of which historically use comdex to introduce products while none of the companies are contractually bound to exhibit at comdex next year , most have had decadelong relationships with the trade show mr meckler said he had already received positive feedback from some comdex exhibitors about moving to his trade show , to be called computer digital expo , but refused to identify any of the companies the only thing we have working against us is inertia , ' he said using fighting words , he said that he had considered buying key3media out of bankruptcy but decided that it was a broken situation that could not be brought back from the dead frederic d rosen , chairman of key3media , simply responded , talk is cheap he must be thinking of internet world , which no longer has exhibitors , he added
washington , april 7 iraq s senior political leaders have made no effort to flee baghdad , but some appear to be frantically shifting operations to civilian buildings in residential neighborhoods to avoid american ground and air assaults , intelligence officials said today the seeming attempt by saddam hussein and his inner circle to remain in power suggests that neither he nor his chief lieutenants are ready to surrender or to direct their troops to stop fighting even as americanled forces continue armored forays into the capital , the officials said the iraqi leadership suffered a serious blow today when a bombing raid in the southern city of basra destroyed a house where a group of iraqi military and intelligence officials were staying among those believed killed was ali hassan al majid , a senior lieutenant of saddam hussein nicknamed chemical ali for using chemical weapons against the kurds in northern iraq in the 1980 s meanwhile , american intelligence officials said important military and paramilitary units in baghdad appeared to be collapsing they said the special republican guard , which had been kept in baghdad to protect the leadership , seemed to be dissolving the special security organization , a ruthless paramilitary force created to enforce the government s rule , also appeared to be falling apart around the city , the american officials said intelligence analysts said that the central leadership still appeared to be trying to exert control over the increasingly fragmented military , but that these efforts seemed to be hampered by the heavy damage inflicted on the country s communications systems american officials noted , for example , that the government issued an order sunday calling on soldiers from units that had been destroyed to join surviving units that seems like a sign of desperation , one official said in addition , the analysts said the upbeat tone of defiance and predictions of victory in many intercepted conversations seemed detached from reality in light of the rapidly deteriorating iraqi military situation the intelligence intercepts echo public statements of mr hussein s loyalists , including the iraqi information minister , muhammad said alsahhaf , who in a streetcorner news conference in baghdad today urged the world not to believe american claims of having taken important sites in baghdad do n't believe these invaders and these liars , mr sahhaf said in comments broadcast on iraqi television there are none of their troops in baghdad american intelligence officers continue to receive reports from operatives inside baghdad , which have been passed on to targetselection teams that have directed attacks on a number of iraqi military command centers with most of those locations now in ruins , including some of the underground bunker systems that lie beneath them , intelligence officials said that some iraqi leaders had moved to makeshift headquarters in private buildings that they believe will be safe from american bombs and missiles the american officials described an iraqi government that seems to be on the brink of collapse , barely existing as a relevant force in the country , undone not by the removal of its leaders but by the gradual destruction of the leadership s ability to command and communicate intelligence officials said they were unable to determine authoritatively whether mr hussein was alive , saying that his videotaped messages and taped broadcasts in recent days were significant but not conclusive proof defense secretary donald h rumsfeld , speaking with reporters today , said that if he was alive , mr hussein would soon be removed from power as his regime collapses around him , the question is asked , where is he \? mr rumsfeld said there are three possibilities , mr rumsfeld said he s either dead or injured or not willing to show himself we may not know if or where he is , but we do know that he no longer runs much of iraq , he added his forces continue to surrender and capitulate his regime is running out of real soldiers and soon all that will be left will be the war criminals as the iraqi government seemed to be nearing collapse , american forces overran salmon pak , a site south of baghdad long suspected to be a hub of activity for iraq s programs to develop unconventional weapons and a training facility for terrorist operations intelligence teams will search that and hundreds of other similarly suspect sites
washington the two fateful questions of russian history are , what is to be done \? and who is to blame \? now , almost four years into the presidency of vladimir putin , who came into office asserting that russia needs a dictatorship of law , russians are asking a new question what is to be done with those who are to blame \? black humor has long been part of the russian character , of course but events of recent weeks have caused this question to be considered with a new seriousness with the arrest last month of mikhail khodorkovsky , the former chief executive of russia s largest oil company and russia s richest man , mr putin has at last given his own answer the arrest of mr khodorkovsky is not about money though the state would enjoy controlling the oil company , yukos instead , with parliamentary elections on dec 7 and the presidential election next march , this is a battle for the right to set russia s course mr putin is expected to carry the duma and to win reelection but in moscow , unlike in washington , the fight for the spoils starts before an election , not after the siloviki the men who , like their boss , ascended to the kremlin from the security services have won this round they have taken mr khodorkovsky captive in their eagerness to please their leader , however , they have undermined mr putin in the days since the arrest of mr khodorkovsky , mr putin has watched the stock market tumble , his chief of staff quit and his loyal prime minister break ranks for the first time since he was appointed acting president by boris yeltsin , mr putin has heard his compatriots , whether critics or champions , debate his chances for survival none of this needed to happen the stock market was among the world s hottest , the central bank s reserves were up and moscow brokers basked in a sense of tranquillity that almost rivaled geneva s the current offensive has put the lie to the notion , popular in washington and moscow , that mr putin s rule , whatever its faults , guarantees political stability only the siloviki , in their heavyhanded prosecution , could have turned mr khodorkovsky into a prisoner of conscience once the bad boy of russian business , in recent years he had morphed into its poster boy the birth of yukos , after all , was a rather untidy affair in 1995 mr yeltsin handed over to the oligarchs russia s most valuable assets the state monopolies in oil , metals and other sectors in exchange for bankrolling his reelection in an auction run by his own bank , mr khodorkovsky paid only 309 million for the controlling stake in yukos earlier this year , after yukos merged with sibneft , it boasted a market value of 45 billion and was the world s seventhlargest oil company mr khodorkovsky , who is the son of factory workers and grew up in a communal apartment , had come a long way he had weathered the crash of 1998 , when russia overnight devalued the ruble and defaulted on its debt he had survived the scandals a year later , when american investigators alleged that as much as 10 billion had been laundered from russia in particular , from his bank , menatep through the bank of new york he had hired a corps of publicists and lawyers , lobbyists and accountants he had shed his denim suits , clunky sovietstyle glasses and even his reclusive nature to become russia s brightest star on the global finance circuit he learned to speak with ardor of corporate governance , transparency and shareholder rights mr khodorkovsky also had an insurance plan a krysha a term from the soviet era that literally means roof and gives one protection , in his case from the government mr khodorkovsky s mistake , however , was that he dared to imagine he could build a stronger krysha than anyone in russia a western krysha his quest led him from moscow to houston and new york and , eventually , to the white house in 2001 , yukos set up a foundation \( mr khodorkovsky called it the open russia foundation , an echo of george soros s open society institute \) for the board mr khodorkovsky enlisted henry kissinger , lord rothschild and a former united states ambassador to the soviet union then , last summer , mr khodorkovsky courted exxon mobil and chevrontexaco , hoping to sell a large chunk of yukos the deal , for as much as 20 billion , would have ensured the company s future it would have also made russia one of the west s primary sources of nonarab oil washington took the bait in september , george h w bush came to moscow to give a speech at a dinner held by the carlyle group , one of the world s richest private equity funds rumors still swirl as to the real reason behind the dinner , but this much is known mr khodorkovsky , who now sits in moscow s matrosskaya tishina prison , also sits on a carlyle advisory board with the secretary of state under mr bush , james a baker iii at the same time , mr khodorkovsky went on a charitable spree in washington some recipients now prefer anonymity , but a partial list of his beneficiaries ranges from foundations to think tanks to the library of congress in 2002 , the national book festival , beloved project of laura bush , received a 100 , 000 donation from the foundation along the way mr khodorkovsky met condoleezza rice and vice president dick cheney and even had his photograph taken with the president and first lady for the men in the kremlin who came of age coveting east german suits and bulgarian holidays , this was too much to bear it was time , the siloviki calculated , to act although the siloviki are usually portrayed as men of the kgb , in truth they represent a greater range of the old order they come from the armed forces the generals responsible for the blood bath in chechnya from law enforcement , from the tax police under mr yeltsin , the oligarchs and organized crime authorities had privatized entire units of these state servants under mr putin , with loyalty and duty the new coins of the realm , for the siloviki , no matter the uniform , there is one ultimate krysha the kremlin mr khodorkovsky s current residence is seen by many as proof that the siloviki are in control nothing could be further from the truth just as mr yeltsin s reliance on the oligarchs to bankroll his reelection in 1996 laid bare the bankruptcy of the state and the impotency of the president , so mr putin s turn to the siloviki reveals his weakness the khodorkovsky case is only the latest round of the state campaign against the oligarchs there may well be more , as oligarchs like vladimir potanin , owner of the norilsk nickel metals conglomerate , know well but the assault has reached a precipice mr putin is above all a believer in the state over the individual he may well see the khodorkovsky case not as another arbitrary abuse of the law , but a leveling of the playing field he may genuinely wish to rid russia of its oligarchy but the current offensive may come back to haunt him in 1996 , at the economic conclave in the swiss resort of davos , the oligarchs called a truce in the face of a communist revanche , they united around mr yeltsin to ensure his second term now the surviving oligarchs , numbed and fearful , are already talking of another meeting not to field a candidate for next spring s presidential election , but to search for vladimir putin s heir drawing \( drawing by wesley

now that investigators are scrutinizing mci over its reported tactics for avoiding paying network access fees to local telephone companies , some analysts and executives are suggesting that it is also time to look more closely at the access charges themselves mci is accused of disguising longdistance calls as local calls to avoid paying these charges to local phone companies it is also accused of shunting calls destined for areas with high access costs to some small canadian phone companies , which then passed them to mci s biggest rival , att , making it pay the access charges what is striking is that industry executives , including some at the companies accusing mci of wrongdoing , generally agree that the rules the company is said to have abused can seem like relics of another era mci pays about 1 billion a month in access charges to other phone companies for its conventional longdistance calls but such calls represent a declining share of the communications universe , as more and more people use cellphones , cable television networks or broadband computer connections to make longdistance voice calls , rather than the traditional telephone at the same time , millions of americans have cut back on making voice calls in favor of email and instant messaging the newer forms of communication incur lower access charges , or none at all , for using the same switches in local phone company offices and wires into the home that the oldfashioned longdistance call uses the access charge system is a tax on the old way of doing things , said joel lubin , vice president for government affairs at att it distorts the marketplace there is little agreement , though , on how or whether to update the rules the federal communications commission announced in 2001 that it would look at ways to update and rationalize access charges and the bewildering array of other regulated or partly regulated payments between communications companies the agency envisioned an overarching system that would not unfairly subsidize , or penalize , a particular group of users or communications technology but experts say they see little evidence of progress my sense is that they 've come to the view that it s just too complicated to try to fix it comprehensively , said philip l verveer , a lawyer in washington who specializes in antitrust and regulatory issues once upon a time , the longdistance access charges made more sense the heavily regulated monopoly known as ma bell was happy to go along with the public policy of forcing longdistance rates to subsidize the cost of local telephone service it seemed a relatively simple way to tap businesses and wealthy customers the ones most likely to make longdistance calls in support of the goal of providing affordable phone service across the country the strategy helped pay the cost of wiring rural areas and putting a phone into virtually every home in the nation it also provided the basis for negotiating payments to the hundreds of small local nonbell companies for completing longdistance calls into their territory the payments helped them survive and smoothed att s relations with state regulators , who wielded considerable control over ma bell s takehome pay within the bell family and in relations with the smaller companies , managers rarely disputed anyone s reporting when it came time to account for longdistance traffic and apportion the payments when everyone had their own local monopoly , it was much easier to be a gentleman , said leon kestenbaum , a former deputy chief of the common carrier bureau at the fcc , who later was vice president for regulatory affairs at sprint , before retiring in 2001 but that world began to change in the 1970 s , as mci helped lead the drive to deregulate the industry it ended for good with the breakup of att in 1984 , when the fcc first began applying the term access charges to the payments that longdistance companies like att , mci and sprint made to the bells and other local phone companies modernizing the access charge system might be relatively straightforward if the fcc were the only regulatory body involved but state regulators control longdistance rates for intrastate calls , and phone companies must negotiate with them to set the terms under which local service is provided congress has also inserted itself by exempting from access charges any communications that travel in digital form over the internet because access charges are such a big component of longdistance costs , industry analysts and executives assume that efforts to find legal means of avoiding them , including the use of network management plans , may become a major activity at longdistance companies for some time to come and mci is not the only company accused of going too far others , when they send traffic breakdowns to the regional bell companies that complete their calls , have illegally exaggerated how much originated out of state that reduces the intrastate access bill , which reflect rates set by state regulators and are on average nearly quadruple the interstate charges most such cases have been settled privately but they sometimes end up in court who loses when longdistance companies dodge access charges , whether legally or illegally \? the obvious loser is the local phone company when it completes a longdistance call disguised as a local one the local company also suffers if companies underreport the proportion of intrastate longdistance calls they send the local company in theory , local customers might also suffer in the long run if the local phone company s financial condition deteriorates in part because of lost access charges , it might get permission from state regulators to raise rates in reality , though , competition frequently curbs a company s appetite for seeking rate increases some phone company executives say the real problem with hanging on to the old access charges is that they hold back the economy by distorting investment incentives if you want a strong economic engine called telecom , mr lubin said , then you cannot have a set of rules born in a monopoly era still , with no new rules on the horizon , the old ones might outlive their critics drawing \( drawing by igor kopelnitsky \)
washington , may 5 charitable solicitations that include deliberate misrepresentations about what proportion of the money raised will go to the beneficiaries can be prosecuted as consumer fraud , the supreme court ruled unanimously today the decision , awaited anxiously by charities and state regulators , came in a longrunning case that the illinois attorney general brought against a telemarketer that raised 7 million ostensibly on behalf of a charity for vietnam veterans while keeping 6 million for itself under the terms of its contract the illinois supreme court had dismissed the attorney general s complaint on the ground that the first amendment s guarantee of free speech prevented the government from deeming any particular level of fundraising expenses to be unacceptable in overturning that dismissal , the court today agreed with the illinois court that wrongdoing could not be inferred from high fundraising costs alone but the first amendment does not shield fraud , justice ruth bader ginsburg wrote for the court states may maintain fraud actions when fundraisers make false or misleading representations designed to deceive donors about how their donations will be used in limiting its focus to misleading affirmative representations , the court issued a rather narrow ruling that avoided the more difficult constitutional questions posed by solicitations that are merely suggestive without being flatly misleading by her careful approach , justice ginsburg managed to extract unanimity from a court that appeared far from unanimous when the case , illinois v telemarketing associations inc , no 011806 , was argued two months ago the decision set a high burden that states must meet to prove fraud in charitable solicitations a false statement , standing alone , does not amount to fraud , justice ginsburg said rather , the state must show that the solicitor deliberately made a false statement with the intent to mislead the listener , and succeeded in doing so as an additional safeguard , she said , appellate courts may make their own independent review of the trial court s findings , as the supreme court has required in certain libel cases these safeguards were required by the first amendment , justice ginsburg said then she added , what the first amendment and our case law emphatically do not require , however , is a blanket exemption from fraud liability for a fundraiser who intentionally misleads in calls for donations by not addressing subtler forms of misleading comeons and sales pitches , the decision was unlikely to allay fully the public concerns about aggressive fundraising tactics but it was likely to strengthen the hand of state regulators by making clear that three decisions the court issued in the 1980 s to protect charities from intrusive regulation should not be understood by state courts as a bar against attacking outright fraud those rulings invalidated state laws that prohibited charitable solicitations that did not return a certain percentage of receipts to the charities the supreme court s decision to hear the illinois attorney general s appeal in this case alarmed the charitable sector by raising the prospect that the justices might revisit those precedents and treat certain percentages as presumptively unreasonable the attorney general had attacked the contract between a charity called vietnow and its fundraiser , telemarketing associates inc , which provided that 15 percent of receipts would go to the charity in briefs to the supreme court , charities argued that expenses that sometimes seemed unreasonably high could be necessary to start a charity or build public awareness of an issue the decision today put the initial fears to rest pat reed , a vice president of independent sector , a national coalition representing 22 , 000 charities , said the group was pleased with the decision because in limiting itself to real fraud , the court had not retreated from its position that high costs alone could not be treated as fraud fraud hurts all of us , ms reed said how you deal with cases of real fraud without infringing on the rights of charities and nonprofits to reach out to the public is a tough line to draw , and the court did an excellent job at getting us closer to it one state regulator , assistant attorney general william josephson of new york , called the decision a warning shot to the professional fundraising industry that they ca n't simply assume a blanket exculpation under the first amendment new york state has never considered any particular fundraising percentage to indicate fraud , mr josephson said , relying instead on disclosure to alert consumers how their charitable dollars are used the figures posted annually on the attorney general s web site show that on average , 30 percent of the money raised for charity in new york actually goes to the charities the national committee for responsive philanthropy , which describes itself as a national watchdog group , called the decision a victory for accountability and truth in fundraising illinois filed its complaint against telemarketing associates in 1991 and will now be able to take its case to trial the state s complaint included affidavits from one woman who said she was told that 90 percent of her contribution goes to the vets and from another who said she was told that none of her donation would be used for labor expenses but the state s allegations of fraud remain to be proved when the case was argued in march , the telemarketing company s lawyer , eric copilevitz , told the justices that under its contract , the company spent some of the money it retained on educational activities on the charity s behalf justices antonin scalia and clarence thomas filed a concurring opinion they said that donors could be presumed to understand that expenses , even high ones , will be deducted from their contributions but this case concerned a solid core of misrepresentations that placed it in a different category , they said
the ball shot down the leftfield line , and the yankees' speedy second baseman , who had singled in the inning , raced toward third base with two outs in the eighth , the yankees down by 32 and the ball caroming off the outfield wall , the thirdbase coach faced a decision on which the season would turn should the runner try for home \? then the professor stopped the vcr this has become an annual ritual in a graduate school class at the university of chicago taught by richard thaler , an economist widely considered to be a serious candidate for a nobel prize thaler plays a videotape of game 2 of the 1980 american league championship series , stops it during the crucial sequence and asks the students to weigh all the information before making their own decision be it at chicago , duke , harvard or the university of california at berkeley , some of the nation s top economists , psychologists and statisticians are coming to see sports as a subject that requires their attention trying to understand human decisionmaking , they are writing papers about such choices as when to punt , or when to take out a basketball player in foul trouble about 25 of them gathered in the spring for a twoday academic conference in arizona , where they went to a spring training game once their work was done their research is quickly leading to a theory that will resonate with any fans who have ever screamed for their team to go for it on fourth down the professors say that managers , coaches and players are often far too cautious for their own good teams are averse to going for all or none , said steven j sherman , a psychology professor at indiana university , who came up with the idea for the conference with thaler when they were having dinner in an afghan restaurant in chicago last year teams do n't want to do something that puts the game on the line right now they intentionally walk barry bonds even though statistics offer a clear argument for pitching to him giving him an automatic place on first base usually leads to more runs in the inning than one of his atbats does behind by 2 at the end of a basketball game and playing a superior team , coaches generally do not attempt a 3point shot yet that shot often offers a better chance of winning than the combined odds of making a 2pointer at the buzzer , then winning in overtime in football , unless the head coach of the team on offense is named bill parcells , fourth down almost invariably leads to the appearance of a kicker but having studied about 700 nfl games , david romer , an economist at berkeley , argues that teams would fare better by going for first down far more often than they do much of the professors' interest in these question stems from the simple fact that they are sports fans romer began his research after his skepticism had been piqued one sunday afternoon while he was driving to home depot and listening to a raiders announcer expound upon the obvious virtues of the field goal at the conference in arizona , bill james , a baseball writer recently hired by the boston red sox as a consultant , was a bigger attraction than any of the intellectual stars in attendance , a few professors said all of the academics in the room were jealous of bill james , said thaler , an energetic man who is quick to make selfdeprecating jokes he had the job they really want adviser to the red sox but there is also a more serious undercurrent to the work in recent years , economists and psychologists have become increasingly interested in the ways that people do not act rationally known as behavioral economics , the field examines why stockmarket bubbles happen and why many people do not save enough money for retirement , among other things sporting events , which are played out step by step in the most public of settings , allow the researchers to determine the precise moment that somebody veers from good sense my justification for doing this is that it s the one really highstakes activity where you get to watch all of the decisions , thaler said if bill gates invited me to watch all of his decisions , i 'd talk more about that the professors say that coaches and managers often go awry when faced with a decision involving an obvious , yet ultimately sensible , risk they seem to focus too much on the worstcase scenario the bonds home run , the gameending brick , the failed fourth down travelers who drive hundreds of miles because they are afraid of a plane crash make the same mistake in the most recent super bowl , the oakland raiders' coaching staff sent in the punting unit when faced with fourthand4 on the buccaneers' 45yard line during the first quarter going for the first down , after all , would have risked giving the tampa bay buccaneers excellent field position that decision may indeed have been the correct one , given the strength of tampa bay s defense , but punting on fourthand4 from just past midfield , which teams do , is usually a mistake , according to romer s research the chance to keep a drive going when a team is so close to fieldgoal territory is usually more valuable than the 30 or so yards of field position the team gains by punting or imagine a basketball player who makes about 50 percent of his 2point shots and 40 percent of his 3pointers if his team is down by 2 in the final seconds and he takes the 3pointer , the team has a 40 percent chance of winning if the coach instead designs a play that gives him a 2point shot , the team has only about a 25 percent chance of winning the 50 percent chance that he will tie the score multiplied by the roughly 50 percent chance that the team will win in overtime so far , the professors acknowledge , their work has had little impact but they have been heartened by the willingness of a few teams , including the red sox , the oakland a s and the dallas mavericks , to use statistical analysis in new ways it has to be the case that sound knowledge will win out eventually , thomas gilovich , a psychology professor at cornell , said but the path is tortuous and slow one big reason is the consequence that can greet a risk gone bad , even a sensible one in the spring , after thaler stopped the videotape on the 1980 yankees game , his students argued overwhelmingly in favor of sending home the runner , willie randolph thaler agreed there were two outs , and the kansas city royals' fielders would have to make two excellent throws to get randolph out at the plate many yankees fans know how the story ends , however mike ferraro , the thirdbase coach , waved randolph home willie wilson of the royals played the carom in left field cleanly and threw to third baseman george brett , who relayed the ball perfectly to catcher darrell porter randolph was out the yankees lost george steinbrenner made sure that ferraro was no longer coaching third base the next season photo intentionally walking barry bonds can lead to more runs than allowing him to hit

new orleans , feb 17 mark hernandez said it took him just a couple of weeks to learn to cut corners in his new job at the nasa plant here his task was to apply insulating foam to the 15story external fuel tanks built by lockheed martin that help power nasa s space shuttles an older worker soon showed him how to mix the foam s base chemicals in a cup and brush the mixture over scratches or gouges in the insulation without reporting the repair , mr hernandez said from 1981 , when he started at the michoud assembly facility , to 1999 , when he quit because of disputes with managers , mr hernandez repaired small defects in the insulation hundreds of times without filling out the required paperwork , he said the practice was so common among employees pressed to work quickly , he said , that it had a name unauthorized rework some supervisors even encouraged it , he added i'm guilty of it , mr hernandez , 40 , said in an interview i never justified it saying it was the right thing to do i wanted to get the job done after the shuttle columbia broke up over texas on feb 1 , attention quickly focused on whether a piece of hardened insulating foam that had fallen off the external tank at liftoff on jan 16 might have caused damage that ultimately killed the seven astronauts aboard some aerospace experts speculate that the debris , about the size of a briefcase , could have critically damaged the left wing other experts have said the fatal damage might have been caused by a small meteorite striking the spacecraft or something else entirely a participant in working group briefings last friday at the johnson space center said that while attention was focused on two likely entry points for the superhot gases that appear to have entered the shuttle , one of them the leading edge of the wing was definitely deemed less likely than the other the area around the wheel well nasa officials have not identified exactly where the foam debris separated from the external fuel tank some officials have suggested that the debris may have been from foam applied during a final touchup procedure at cape canaveral in florida , instead of at the michoud plant here after the shuttle disaster , nasa officials quickly shut down parts of the michoud plant , which is operated by lockheed martin , though some places will reopen on tuesday investigators are scrutinizing the areas where the foam is mixed and applied to the 43 million fuel tanks one worker said that at least two foam workers have been questioned and that paperwork on the production of the columbia s external tank and eight other tanks now in storage were under review members of the independent investigative panel looking into the disaster are expected to return to michoud this week after an initial visit last saturday in interviews , mr hernandez and five other former and current employees described a work environment where shortcuts were occasionally taken because of pressure to meet production deadlines or please managers inspectors sometimes failed to visually check whether workers properly cleaned the tank s surface before applying bonding agent and foam , mr hernandez said a program that in the 1980 s paid workers hundreds of dollars for finding defects has been watered down , probably because of budget squeezes , workers said the key thing is schedule 'hurry up and get it done we do n't want to get behind , ' said george roberson , a sheet metal worker of 29 years who is on medical leave for a back injury but when you 're hurrying , sometimes that causes problems none of the workers interviewed suggested that mistakes or shortcuts at the plant could have been the root cause of the columbia accident they all said the work was generally of high caliber but there were practices that weakened quality control and worker oversight , they said marion lanasa , a lockheed spokesman , said that the assembly process has more than 47 , 000 inspection points and that workers and inspectors take their jobs seriously without personal accountability , we ca n't be successful , he said the external tanks are assembled vertically in a 20story building , where most of the foam insulation is sprayed on by computercontrolled guns then the tanks are laid on their sides , other parts are added and more foam is put on by hand that was where mr hernandez and his coworkers came in in the final stages of assembly , they touched up epoxy primer that bonds the foam to the parts just added , then sprayed on the foam in the process , they would often find scratches or small holes in some of the surrounding foam or come across areas where there was no primer , mr hernandez said this was not out of the ordinary , he said , and company policy dictated that workers write up these findings in what are called discrepancy reports after the paperwork wound its way through the proper channels , an order would come down usually several hours to a day later to fix that area but most of the workers decided to bypass that and patch up the foam or the primer themselves , mr hernandez said they did it when inspectors were not around , sometimes with colleagues serving as lookouts he added that some supervisors also discouraged discrepancy reports because of the delays the current and former workers said managers are paid bonuses based on performance reviews that are determined partly by meeting production schedules
in iowa , howard dean is widely known as an antiwar candidate for president , whose swift denunciation of president bush s iraq resolution set him apart in the democratic field and established him as potentially strong contender in next year s iowa s presidential caucuses gordon fischer , the state democratic chairman , said that he expected many caucus voters next year to be war opponents and that dr dean would be in a position to pick up support from those folks but it has become increasingly clear in recent days , as the white house has stepped up its case for war against iraq , that dr dean is not exactly leading the antiwar brigade for the democratic presidential candidates in contrast to most of his opponents , dr dean said the case that secretary of state colin l powell made to the united nations for moving against saddam hussein was not convincing but dr dean said in an interview that he would support a united states invasion of iraq if it was approved by the united nations action with the un is where we should be aiming at right now , dr dean said we should be going back and set a timeline with the un for absolute disarmament i 've chosen 60 days and then there would be military action and dr dean said that he supported the central goal of many of the supporters of action against iraq look , saddam has to be disarmed , he said in the interview everybody has to understand that dr dean emphasized that he did not support unilateral action against iraq but he acknowledged that unilateral action was unlikely given the support the white house has rounded up among other nations for moving against mr hussein where dr dean does seem to differ from the other democratic contenders is on whether the united states should proceed against iraq with a multinational force even if it fails to win united nations support he said the united states should not unless it found there was an imminent threat dr dean is in the tradition of a long line of presidential candidates who have garnered warm early news notices by coming across as alternatively charming and iconoclastic not surprisingly , some of his opponents have complained about what they described as the free ride dr dean has gotten , particularly as other democrats notably senator john kerry of massachusetts have shifted back and forth as they have tried to express their position on iraq in boston last night , senator kerry sought to clarify his stand on iraq , declaring that he viewed mr hussein as a threat and that the united states , working with other nations , should move to disarm him or remove him from power in a speech last month , mr kerry , who voted in favor of the iraq resolution sought by mr bush last fall , urged the president not to rush into war there s no lack of clarity in the position , folks none , mr kerry told reporters it s consistent with what i 've said since last summer saddam hussein is a threat he needs to be held accountable mr kerry , along with representative richard a gephardt of missouri and senators joseph i lieberman of connecticut and john edwards of north carolina , said that they found mr powell s argument convincing and that the united states should move against iraq even if the united nations refused to countenance an action among the democrats , the rev al sharpton of new york is the most unambiguous in his opposition to the war
detroit , april 21 federal prosecutors here indicted an immigration official at the department of homeland security and two other people today , accusing them of conspiring to smuggle 130 illegal immigrants into the country from lebanon and yemen over five years immigration fraud cases like this potentially pose a threat to national security , said jeffrey g collins , the united states attorney for the eastern district of michigan , and that s why we are vigorously prosecuting the case , including prosecuting an employee of the entity that was supposed to protect us mr collins said that more than half of the illegal immigrants had been found and that none of those had been determined to have discernable connections to terrorism they entered the united states between 1998 and october 2002 there was little clarity , though , regarding those illegal immigrants who had not yet been found federal agents are looking for them , mr collins said , adding that prosecutors would make a determination on a casebycase basis whether or not they should be criminally charged or be removed from the country janice halstead , 59 , of detroit , was indicted for bribery , two counts of conspiracy to smuggle illegal immigrants into the united states , and several counts of attempted alien smuggling ms halstead , who worked for the immigration and naturalization service and then for the department of homeland security when the immigration agency became a part of it , received 3 , 000 to 5 , 000 in cash , a bedroom set , jewelry and other gifts , the indictment and mr collins said the overall value of the goods and cash was not disclosed ms halstead , reached at home after being released on bond , said she was not guilty she has not formally entered a plea i think i probably made the wrong person mad , she said , adding that she did know one of the other defendants , zoha madarani , but not the other , salah alsolihi ms madarani , 38 , of dearborn , mich , and mr alsolihi , 45 , of new york , were indicted for conspiracy to smuggle illegal immigrants into the united states and charges related to immigrant smuggling ms madarani and mr alsolihi could not be found , and officials did not say if they were citizens or foreigners the indictments , which were unsealed today , stem from two similar cases involving federal grand juries in detroit and flint , both part of the eastern district of michigan ms madarani was indicted in federal court in detroit , and mr alsolihi in flint both grand juries indicted ms halstead in the case from the flint grand jury , mr alsolihi is accused of instructing foreigners to obtain false passports with false names ms halstead is accused of validating them with an official stamp , while mr alsolihi is accused of sending them overseas , where they were used by foreigners to enter the country in the case from the detroit grand jury , ms madarani is accused of providing ms halstead with the names and photographs of people living outside of the country who were not eligible to enter legally the indictment says the two women conspired to provide the inadmissible immigrants with false documents ms madarani owns a consulting business that helps potential immigrants , according to the indictment the case is very disturbing because it represents a violation of public trust , mr collins said edward dyner , special agent in charge of the justice department s office of inspector general , said in a statement department of justice employees are not for sale the inspector general s office takes seriously any allegations against department employees and will thoroughly investigate them if convicted , ms halstead faces up to 22 years in prison and 750 , 000 in fines from the detroit case and up to 65 years in prison and 15 million in the flint case ms madarani could receive up to 20 years in prison and a 750 , 000 fine mr alsolihi faces 65 years in prison and 15 million in fines
park city , utah , jan 22 after last year s sundance film festival , when the crowds were sparse and the films were wanting , this year s installment has been a boisterous , trafficchoked return to the days when sundance epitomized a certain kind of raw , scruffy cool at the same time , it also showed signs , troubling to many sundance veterans , of becoming an increasingly important hollywood marketing tool acquisitions activity , in which distributors of independent films bid for the festival s hottest movies , has been brisk , although none of the films as yet have drawn the 5 million or 10 million that some did at earlier festivals most noticeably , though , there has been a surge in the numbers of two groups of people bigname celebrities including dustin hoffman , jane fonda , al pacino , kevin spacey , salma hayek , sean penn and even britney spears and the people who have come to park city just to gawk at them ticket sales are way up , about 10 percent for packages of tickets and more than 50 percent for single tickets i do n't know why they call it park city , said steven friedlander , executive vice president of distribution for fine line features i ca n't ever find a place to park two factors are drawing more hollywood celebrities here once a festival where unknowns came to be discovered and hungry agents scoured the field for the next big thing , sundance has gradually become as much of a launching festival as a film market , the sort of event at which a distributor might unveil a film coming out in the next few months in hopes of attracting attention and publicity this was definitely the reason tom ortenberg , president of lions gate films , brought confidence , a drama about con men starring dustin hoffman and ed burns the film is not the kind of classic sundance indie that , if it s lucky , will get a limited release in a handful of theaters confidence will be a wide release for lions gate in april , and mr ortenberg said the studio chartered a private jet and booked suites at the fancy stein ericksen lodge for mr hoffman and his entourage to make sure the film got as splashy a launching as possible it might have cost around 100 , 000 , but it will prove worth it , he said a similar introduction for miramax s people i know brought mr pacino to park city bob dylan was set to arrive at midweek to help unveil masked and anonymous , in which he stars and the bigstar events draw the crowds and the scenes the second trend is that as hollywood moves toward making more sequels and franchise pictures oriented toward teenagers , actors who want to do more serious , stretching work even some of the biggest stars will have to migrate to independent film already in that position , of course , are the stars with fading careers they are hoping to regenerate with an eyecatching role in a sundance hit more troubling to the people who run sundance which prides itself as being an egalitarian refuge for people who love film , not a haven for preening stars is that for the first time this year some of the visiting big names have begun to act as if they were at the golden globes i like it when the stars show up , said geoffrey gilmore , the festival s director what i do n't like is the scene when they arrive , and it s not just the six stars in the movie but a dozen other celebrity friends and their celebrity girlfriends , and there s all this strutting and posing for hundreds of photographers i do n't want this festival to become cannes , where you ca n't walk down the street i do n't want women in bikinis on the beach bikinis on the beach are quite out of the question , of course , in these snowy valleys high above salt lake city but one gets the idea when hundreds of pedestrians surge onto main street and bring the already slowmoving traffic to a standstill just because someone has spotted jennifer lopez emerging from a vehicle , and the flashbulbs and screeches reach a delirious cacophony , it seems not so far a leap to topless beach bunnies indeed , mr gilmore said , some of the scenes he has witnessed this year have left him a little disgusted as soon as the 10day festival ends this weekend , mr gilmore said , he intends to get the staff working on plans to tone down the celebrity entourages and paparazzi scenes filmmakers have been lavish in their praise of the upgraded technical capabilities at the festival s screening sites , where a few years ago it was sometimes hard even to hear what the actors were saying on the screen and by most accounts , the festival s new headquarters were a distinct improvement the consensus is that this year has seen a strong lineup of films , especially among the documentaries , though perhaps not as strong as two years ago , when in the bedroom , the deep end and memento were shown although some , like the singing detective , a fresh version of dennis potter s british television classic , and quattro noza , set in the world of illegal street racing , fell flat with festival audiences , others were embraced
philadelphia , nov 4 in an emotional finish to a controversyridden campaign , mayor john f street won a second term on tuesday , beating his republican opponent , sam katz , an executive who lost narrowly to him four years ago with more than 90 percent of the ballots counted , mayor street had an insurmountable lead of 58 percent of the votes , the associated press reported , to 42 percent for mr katz in his victory speech , the mayor said , this victory today is a very impressive one , and i will be the first one to admit that when we started this campaign , it would not have crossed my mind that i would be standing here today with the margin of victory that seems apparent here today mr street may owe his victory , at least in part , to a scandal that many philadelphians believed , just four weeks ago , would end his 25year political career a listening device was discovered in the mayor s city hall office early last month , and investigators from the fbi then disclosed that mr street was a subject in a corruption investigation the mayor and his allies deftly turned the incident to their advantage by suggesting that the investigation was engineered by the republican party in an effort to discredit a black democrat the accusations , which fueled widespread racial and partisan rancor , energized voters in this heavily democratic city , whose black population is roughly equal to that of whites national democratic figures came to town to stoke the flames of suspicion former president bill clinton and former vice president al gore spoke at rallies for mr street over the weekend mr street narrowly trailed mr katz in some polls in september , but heading into the election , he held a doubledigit lead , having gained support from blacks , who believed the investigation was racially motivated , as well as from white democrats determined to take an early stand against republicans before next fall s presidential election the acrimony that has built over the past few weeks boiled over on on tuesday on the streets near city hall throngs of people wearing sam katz tshirts chanted campaign slogans at passing drivers while waving posters that read honk for sam katz nearby a group of young men , who had parked their black pickup truck on a median in the road , held up a sign that read , katz bush ashcroft both campaigns sought and received court orders against the other for voter intimidation a katz supporter was charged with illegally asking voters in north philadelphia , which is heavy with backers of mr street , to present identification , though none is required a street supporter hit a katz supporter in the face in an altercation over campaign posters it was a nastier campaign this time , no question , said j whyatt mondesire , president of the philadelphia chapter of the naacp street backers were predicting victory early in the day in a longtime election day tradition here , democratic party officials and city leaders gathered for lunch at the famous 4th street delicatessen in south philadelphia just after noon , mr street pulled up in a red and green trolley , staying for more than an hour of selfcongratulatory chatter with highpowered supporters it s a chance for us to pat ourselves on the backs , said thomas paine cronin , president of district council 47 , a union of whitecollar municipal workers that endorsed mr street mr katz stopped midafternoon at the palm restaurant for an interview with a talk radio program , broadcasting from the restaurant he criticized what he called the blatant voter intimidation tactics of the street campaign and repeated his belief that the corruption investigation was an outgrowth of philadelphia s entrenched pay for play political system do i think there is fire behind the smoke of this investigation , he said to the radio audience and a crowd of diners , reporters and onlookers yes , i do many voters carried their resentments to the polls there are a lot of bad feelings that have built up , said ashley simon , 20 , a bank teller on her way into a polling station to vote for mr katz i just do n't like street and so many things that he s done other voters said they had grown tired of the backbiting it does n't make either one of the candidates look good , and it makes the whole city look bad , said tawanda townsend , 32 , who said she had just voted for mr street at the m hall stanton elementary school in north philadelphia
mosul , iraq , april 14 last week , lt gen tahaseen rafan was an iraqi domestic intelligence official running a network of spies in kurdishcontrolled northern iraq today he is frightened , alone and in hiding , one of thousands of members of saddam hussein s security apparatus who have abruptly gone from predator to prey early this afternoon , general rafan and five midlevel iraqi military and intelligence officials arrived at the makeshift united states military base here to negotiate their surrender and ask for protection from revenge attacks none of the men are on the list of 55 senior iraqi officials wanted on war crimes charges , but the group hinted that their surrender was being closely watched by more senior officials now in hiding military intelligence and mukhabarat , general rafan said , referring to the country s military and secret police services all of them will come if they know i am here and i am protected the seriousness of the men s offer was difficult to gauge all across iraq , former baath party officials , opposition figures and tribal leaders are exaggerating their influence and jockeying for power in postwar iraq but american and kurdish officials seem to be taking general rafan and his colleagues seriously their offer is tempting because it is being made in mosul , a stronghold of sunni arab nationalism and the hometown of scores of senior baath party officials izzat ibrahim , vice chairman of saddam hussein s revolutionary command council and the overall military commander in northern iraq , and sultan hashim ahmed , the iraqi defense minister , are both natives of this city and are rumored to be hiding here both men are on the united states list of iraqi officials wanted on war crimes charges the delicate negotiations began today in a barren former iraqi airlines office at mosul s airport , which has been turned into a base for american special operations forces the six iraqi officials sat in a close circle with lt col robert waltemeyer , the american commander the most sensitive thing after every conflict is this point , colonel waltemeyer said , as the officials listened intently our intent is not for reprisals or to settle any scores the colonel quickly made his priorities clear information about unconventional weapons , terrorism and senior officials all the officials denied knowledge of unconventional weapons or terrorism that was the responsibility of the commanders of special military intelligence , general rafan said in a later interview the americans were also eager to learn more about the iraqi army s v corps , a unit of tens of thousands of soldiers that simply melted away after iraqi forces withdrew from the front lines in the north general rafan said the soldiers had returned to their home cities the american colonel ended the meeting by saying he would give the iraqis some time to think , and he made a clear pitch to other officials in hiding one of the things i can promise is that if they come forward there will be a process for justice , colonel waltemeyer said later interviews with general rafan and another iraqi intelligence official who attended the meeting offered a window into the workings of mr hussein s police state the second intelligence official , nashwan fateh ismail , was the head of security at the university of mosul in other words , he spied on students and professors he said his job was to track all political activity on a campus of 5 , 000 students and block any references to nonbaath political parties under mr hussein , all other political parties were banned mr ismail said he had a network of about 50 agents on campus , including four professors and four or five students who worked for him full time he also had professors on his payroll at a university in erbil in kurdishcontrolled northern iraq sometimes i got information about some political movements and mainly about teachers traveling to the north , mr ibrahim said but honestly i never submitted a report about any of them internet access was strictly controlled by one professor , who monitored each web page a student visited any student receiving letters from the united states was expected to report their arrival i knew maybe every fact about their lives , mr ismail said , referring to certain people he spied on but i never submitted them asked if he felt that someone was watching his own work , he said yes and added , i do n't want to talk about that general rafan was far more circumspect about the details of his work a 20year veteran of iraqi intelligence , he fondly recalled traveling to different countries as a security agent on iraqi airlines planes england , france , taiwan , thailand , japan , he said , ticking off the places he visited i was sent to some places on a visit for a week and some countries 20 days he said each flight carried 18 security agents to protect against hijackers , and he said neither he nor the other agents engaged in espionage in his latest job , he said he had many agents in kurdishcontrolled areas , including some he had never met and could not identify he played down his power , but dressed like someone who had enjoyed the high life he wore a gold wristwatch and a large ring that appeared to be studded with diamonds general rafan , an ethnic kurd , seemed haggard and rundown he said he feared retaliation from kurds who were gassed , expelled and brutalized by mr hussein s government he said he had no choice but to remain loyal to mr hussein his family had been under constant threat , he said , and he felt he could not have defected without risking their lives the negotiations today were organized by farhan sharafani , a kurdish tribal leader general rafan said he considered trustworthy the general complained that the united states was not moving quickly enough in protecting him and other officials in hiding he warned that if american officials did not act , former iraqi intelligence and military officials could remain in hiding or even eventually take up arms photo lt col robert waltemeyer , center , met yesterday at the mosul airport with iraqi military and intelligence officials who wanted to negotiate their surrender but were also seeking protection from revenge attacks \( ruth fremson the new york times \)
most wall street firms and their executives , embarrassed by details in the industrywide settlement on how they duped investors to keep their corporate clients happy , have either kept quiet or issued statements of contrition for the lapses that occurred during the stock boom of the 1990 s then there is philip j purcell , the chief executive of morgan stanley according to mr purcell , morgan stanley and its clients should not be disturbed by the firm s activities during the bubble addressing an institutional investor conference in new york yesterday , mr purcell said , i do n't see anything in the settlement that will concern the retail investor about morgan stanley his remarks to a packed ballroom at the pierre hotel lasted about 15 minutes taking questions , mr purcell appeared to contradict directly the regulators' findings that morgan stanley had failed to disclose to investors that it had paid 27 million to other wall street firms to publish research on companies whose shares morgan stanley had underwritten when a reporter asked about the 27 million in payments , mr purcell said that everything about them had been disclosed and he said that the firm was simply doing what its customers had wanted the issuer asked for it so that they could get more coverage , he said the 27 million went to pay firms for independent research we did n't make the decision mr purcell s comments came as a surprise to eliot spitzer , the new york attorney general , whose office investigated morgan stanley we believe , he said , that the allegations set forth in the morgan stanley document establish a record that should deeply trouble retail investors because the document reflects that supposedly neutral analytical work was indeed subservient to the investment banking needs of the company moreover , the process of making payments to third parties for supposedly neutral research is entirely unacceptable and intolerable when asked about the apparent discrepancy in mr purcell s remarks , ray o'rourke , a morgan stanley spokesman , said mr purcell was clearly and only referring to the fact that as the sec s complaint states , the issuers' registration statements and other offering documents disclosed both the other banks as part of the underwriting syndicate and as receiving payments what the complaint charged was that payment for research was not specifically disclosed under the terms of the settlement , all the firms that signed it , including morgan stanley , neither admitted nor denied the accusations made by regulators if a firm engages in denying the settlement terms , it s risky business , said christine bruenn , president of the north american securities administrators association and one of the regulators that investigated the wall street firms a firm who does deny the settlement terms once they have settled risks the ire of the 50 states , the two selfregulatory organizations and a contempt order from a federal judge according to regulators , five of the large firms included in the settlement paid other firms to issue research on stocks that the big firms had underwritten to the public but none of the payments were disclosed in company documents , so investors did not know that the additional firms issuing upbeat research had been paid to do so in some cases , the socalled research guarantee fees paid by morgan stanley to other firms exceeded the amount the other firm that provided research earned as part of the group selling the shares to the public one company that morgan stanley helped to bring public and that it paid other investment banks to provide research on was ibeam broadcasting , an internet broadcasting company whose shares began trading in may 2000 wedbush morgan securities , an investment bank in los angeles that is not part of morgan stanley , earned 24 , 150 in underwriting fees selling ibeam stock , but it collected 42 , 000 in research guarantees paid by morgan stanley ibeam filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in october 2001 , 18 months after morgan stanley underwrote its shares in an initial public offering that raised 110 million from investors yesterday was not the first time that mr purcell has held morgan stanley out as superior to the rest of the wall street firms it joined in the settlement in his letter to shareholders in the firm s 2002 annual report , mr purcell referred to the regulatory investigations into potential conflicts in wall street research practices morgan stanley came through the investigations relatively unscathed , he said we are the beneficiaries of our predecessors' actions over many years in putting the interests of our clients first and choosing carefully those with whom we do business indeed , morgan stanley is proud that its top analyst , mary meeker , who still covers internet companies , was not singled out by regulators in the settlement as were some other analysts , like jack b grubman of salomon smith barney and henry blodget of merrill lynch mr purcell continued to express his optimism to investors in new york yesterday so far , so good this year , we have maintained our standards in market share as well as our reputation , in my view , he said but barbara roper , director of investor protection at the consumer federation of america , said , this is a little too soon for the rewriting of the history she added , the fact that they do n't look quite as bad as some of the other firms is supposed to reassure us \? they won the beauty contest of uglies , and they think everything is ok \? photos philip j purcell of morgan stanley says he does not see anything in the settlement to concern his firm s retail investors the firm s top analyst , mary meeker , was not cited by regulators \( fred r conrad the

so what if she had limited business experience , a shoestring budget and a lowtechnology product \? in 2000 , carol skonberg thought she had struck entrepreneurial gold with her wineglass jewelry in her first year , she signed up 90 stores in texas to carry the product and racked up 35 , 000 in sales , all on an initial investment of 4 , 000 and , she believed , her product tiny sterling silver charms of everything from elephants to palm trees that hooked onto wineglass stems so people would n't lose track of their drinks had buzz everyone wanted these things , said ms skonberg , 48 , who was a houston housewife and parttime piano teacher when she came up with the idea for them at a winefueled bridge game with friends in 1999 not for long , though almost overnight , orders for her wine jewels dried up as rival companies offered similar products with names like wine charms and that wine is mine at lower prices we were sick to our stomachs , said ms skonberg , speaking also for her best friend and business partner , elizabeth swanstrom they disbanded their company , swasko jewels , in december 2001 ms skonberg believed that she was the first to come up with the winejewelry concept and was incensed at what she viewed as theft of intellectual property but that attitude just shows how amateurish her initial venture into the entrepreneurial world was , smallbusiness experts say whether or not the winejewelry inspiration was original with her and others say they had it before she did does not really matter if she did not have a patent , they say and , generally speaking , jewelry ca n't be patented besides , to think that deeperpocketed , more established companies would not leap in to grab the prize from her betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of how the market works , they say the inventor always thinks his idea is the best and the world will come to his door and he s going to be rich and famous , said jere ross , a lawyer with bush ross gardner warren rudy in tampa , fla , who specializes in corporate and tax law what he learns to his chagrin is unless he has the money and strategy to develop the idea into a marketable product or process he wo n't be able to accomplish anything if something is selling , it will be knocked off instantly , not just in the united states , but all over the world , thanks to the internet some of ms skonberg s competitors certainly were able to make a go of it a company called davelle specialties inc in fort myers , fla , came on the scene in late 2000 with silver and gold wine charms called stemmies and had sales of 90 , 000 in the first year , said tina matte , its chief executive after sales fell to 75 , 000 the next year in a saturated market , she said , davelle began aiming at colleges , offering charms of their sports mascots , and corporations , with representations of their logos that sales effort began only a few months ago but is already showing positive results , she said her success , though , pales next to that of ellen petti , who says she came up with the idea for wine jewelry on a trip to the california wine country several years ago and started that wine is mine inc in centennial , colo , in 1999 sales surged from 250 , 000 the first year to 6 million in 2001 before falling to 45 million in 2002 she and her business partner , derri greene , sold the company to wine things unlimited in may for an undisclosed price that ms petti said made them very happy so what did ms petti do that ms skonberg did n't \? though ms petti s initial investment of 8 , 000 was also quite small , she and her partner set up a national network of sales representatives and got their product in national catalogs , while ms skonberg stuck mostly to texas they consulted a lawyer right away , who told them the idea could not qualify for a patent , and then they got a trademark for the product logo and a copyright for the design ms skonberg , by contrast , saw a lawyer only after noticing all the copycat products and then got a trademark but not a copyright aware of their vulnerability to bigger competitors , ms petti and her partner also concentrated on getting their business up and running fast and strong so they could capitalize on name recognition they also hired assemblers to keep up with demand and a company to handle shipping thinking big was crucial to their success , smallbusiness consultants say if you want to sustain a business concept , you have to go national , start huge , said barbara bird , chairwoman of the management department at the kogod school of business at american university in washington get the firstmover advantage by branding the product , get some star quality to this getting a trademark for the name or logo is crucial , she said lawyers say that a patent is the best form of protection for an invention and that a copyright is best for a concept or design , but getting either can be difficult the fact that something is unique does n't qualify it for patent protection , said marc p misthal , an intellectual property lawyer at the new york firm of gottlieb , rackman reisman it has to be nonobvious for information , entrepreneurs can check out the government web sites www copyright gov for copyrights and www uspto gov for patents and trademarks none of this is to suggest you should not make a play for the local market quite the contrary , says rich sloan , a smallbusiness expert and venture capitalist in birmingham , mich , who with his brother jeff advises entrepreneurs on www startupnation com sponsor local events , get fashion leaders to utilize your product , do appearances on tv and radio creating a personality associated with your product , he said so how has ms skonberg fared since her wine jewels fiasco \? quite well she has pulled herself up and plunged into the market again in her first venture , she confesses , i did everything wrong , neglecting to create a brand , build a manufacturing network or protect her design this time is different , she says in may 2002 , she started a company called hipice to make jean jewelry bejeweled thin chains that look like necklaces and are draped over people s hips thanks to j lo , the rear end seems to be the thing , she said , referring to the singer and actress jennifer lopez on her second try , however , she is n't trying to do all the legwork herself she raised more than 30 , 000 in startup capital , trademarked the name hipice , filed for copyright protection for the design and hired a public relations firm to promote the jewelry and she is focusing on getting national exposure , spending much of her time hawking the product to the national press and showing it off in new york , including an accessories show at jacob k javits convention center in may and a show at henri bendel , the highend manhattan store , in august ms skonberg has also sent her hipice jewelry , which retails from 36 to 138 , to national fashion magazines and to celebrities like britney spears , mariah carey and the american idol winner kelly clarkson in the hopes they will wear it so far , she has placed her jeans jewelry in 40 boutique stores across the country , she says , with sales now at 3 , 000 a month and growing she predicts 500 stores will carry it by next summer and monthly sales will reach 20 , 000 she is on the right track , in the view of jeff sloan of startupnationcom the strategy of being aggressive out of the box by doing things like utilizing celebrities and promoting the product nationally , he said , are triedandtrue strategies photo i did everything wrong , carol skonberg says of her first venture her new company , hipice , is doing better \( photo by marilynn k yee the new york times \)
washington , feb 3 the democrats had stockpiled red ink to dramatize the record deficits in president bush s 2004 budget , and within hours of its release the printers on capitol hill were churning out crimson charts and the incendiary statements the most fiscally damaging budget in us history , said representative john m spratt jr of south carolina , the ranking democrat on the house budget committee president bush is leading the most fiscally irresponsible administration in history , said senator tom daschle of south dakota , the senate democratic leader , calling the proposal a budgetbusting epic disaster but the volume of the democratic blasts was in inverse proportion to the party s power because the republicans who now control both houses of congress plan to use the administration s spending plan as the foundation for next year s government although some acknowledged that not all of the 62 proposed tax cuts or credits in the plan would be approved , party leaders gave the weighty budget books a warmer reception than any submission has received in years in this budget , president bush charts a straightforward course for peace and prosperity for america , said senator charles e grassley of iowa , chairman of the finance committee that includes defeating terrorism , creating jobs and dealing with looming shortfalls in entitlement spending nonetheless , the republicans seemed to acknowledge tacitly that even they may find it difficult to vote for each and every tax cut demanded by the administration if the result is an unending prospect of deficits having spent years accusing democrats of driving the government into the poorhouse , many republicans confined their praise to the president s ceilings on spending , without mentioning the deficits at all senator bill frist of tennessee , the republican leader , took pains to note that spending grew by about 4 percent , the same as the average american paycheck but dr frist s statement did not mention the record 307 billion deficit for 2004 , an amount that would grow to 21 trillion over 10 years if all of the administration s tax cuts were enacted none of the republican leaders who spoke today made a firm commitment to passing all of those proposed tax cuts , aware that a newly influential group of moderate republicans will not go along with the full package the chairman of the senate budget committee , senator don nickles of oklahoma , called the budget an excellent starting point , but he declined to say that he would pursue every tax cut in the plan speaker j dennis hastert said in a statement that the plan was a commonsense budget , and that it recognized that economic growth was necessary to restore balance but other republicans clearly felt obliged to address the huge gap between revenues and spending that mr bush called for the biggest challenge we will face is controlling spending while meeting all of these needs , said representative jim nussle of iowa , chairman of the house budget committee , who in previous years had singed democrats for deficit spending senator george v voinovich of ohio said some of the cutbacks in the budget would hurt his constituents certainly there are many programs , including some important to ohio , which take a hit , mr voinovich said among the most closely watched members of congress on budgetary issues are a group of moderate senate republicans who may determine the future of the tax proposals , and one of them senator olympia j snowe of maine made it clear that she was uncomfortable by the large number of minuses in the budget books we must exercise prudence and caution , senator snowe said , and balance the near term need for tax cuts to help stimulate the economy and new spending to meet pressing priorities , against the longterm goal of maintaining fiscal responsibility and balancing the budget the democrats , however , dispensed with the moderates' caution and issued some of the strongest criticisms to date of the administration s plans they expressed incredulity at the limits on spending for domestic security , education and health care , with senator edward m kennedy of massachusetts calling it a ripoff for the rich that starved vital domestic programs several democrats noted that the 56 trillion surplus of two years ago had evaporated , replaced by a 21 trillion deficit over 10 years that mr daschle called the worst fiscal collapse in our history though republicans said the proposed deficits were mild by historical standards , senator kent conrad of north dakota , the ranking democrat on the budget committee , said the deficits would be worsened by the retirement of the babyboom generation in about a dozen years i think this budget is breathtaking in its lack of fiscal responsibility , mr conrad said it s one thing to have tax cuts at a time of economic weakness to give lift to the economy that makes sense , that i would support even if we were in deficit but what the president is proposing is huge tax cuts beyond the time of projected economic weakness , at times he s forecasting strong economic growth he is digging a hole that is very , very deep for this country up close budget committees' leaders senator don nickles oklahoma republican , chairman age 54 elected 1980 assistant republican leader 1997 to 2003 member of the budget committee since 1987 named chairman in 2003 worked for a family owned business that made equipment for the oil and gas industry eventually became vice president and general manager forcefully advocates a reduced role for the government strong supporter of president bush s economic proposals , including more tax cuts senator kent conrad north dakota ranking democrat age 54 elected 1986 member of the budget committee since 1987 served

in a very old gillette plant on the south side of boston , a fairly young guy is showing off some very new technologies craig a provost , 27 , a senior industrial designer , is using a joystick to pull up a curve here , flatten one there and otherwise transform a virtual block of clay on his laptop screen into a razor when he s satisfied , he sends the digital model to another machine , which uses it as a blueprint to make a hard plastic version in just a few days , you can try out any number of different designs , see how they look and feel in your hands , mr provost said now it is the turn of colin clipstone , 60 , director of blade and razor technology his hightech toy is a camera that can capture , in very slow motion , the movement of a blade slicing a human hair that is sprouting from a block of synthetic skin the device also records the amount of force the blade applies , how far the hair bends before the blade slices through it and how sharp an angle is left on the stubble the sharper the angle , the rougher the stubble , so the machine gives a good indication of how well different razors perform we 'll put forth a theory say , that a different blade coating or cutting speed gives a closer shave and the machine can show if we 're right , mr clipstone said the men are demonstrating the techniques using existing gillette razors like the sensor3 , the mach3 and the mach3 turbo but in the laboratory down the hall a room strictly off limits to curious outsiders gillette researchers are using the same machines , and many others , to finetune a new razor that peter k hoffman , head of the company s shaving group , says will pretty much make all existing razors including gillette s obsolete he had better be right for most of its 102year corporate life , gillette was the undisputed leader in razor blades , one of the most profitable consumer products in the world its formula was simple it made good razors , sold them cheap and reaped profits year in , year out from the replacement blades that loyal customers kept buying sure , there were competitors , but none that caused much consternation until now gillette is embroiled in a nasty battle with schickwilkinson sword , which last month introduced the quattro , a fourblade shaving system \( as sets of nondisposable razors with disposable blades are called \) schick has positioned it squarely against gillette s mach3 razors this is no gentleman s duel gillette has sued schick for patent infringement , saying that the positioning of quattro s four blades is a knockoff of the mach3 s threeblade design schick , in turn , has sued gillette for false advertising , saying that the stellar performance of schick s quattro and its xtreme3 disposable gives the lie to gillette s claims that its razors provide the world s best shave this is the first credible threat that gillette has faced in the highmargin razor system business , said alison kerivan , an analyst at the investment firm david l babson the battling claims are not confined to ourt mr hoffman says that sales of gillette s venus razor system for women increased steadily even after intuition , a competing schick product , hit the market last spring that , he says , is proof positive that consumers are sticking with venus joseph e lynch , schick s president , says that s hogwash , and that intuition is gaining more ground all the time edward f degraan , gillette s president , contends that gillette s manufacturing technology gives it a competitive edge mr lynch says his company s equipment and processes are equally world class , and anyone who says otherwise is just trying to trash the competition mr hoffman says that an independent firm is now conducting a consumer comparison test between the quattro and the mach3 turbo , and that the mach3 turbo is sure to win we 've already done our smallscale tests and , i'm telling you , quattro is n't as good , mr hoffman said not surprisingly , schick s tests have yielded the opposite conclusion the tests have provided us with the backing for several claims we can make in future ads , said w alvin robertson , schick s chief marketing officer this is war , and gillette is firing as many types of ammunition as it can the company has splashed world s best shave on its packages and in its commercials and offers full refunds to customers who disagree it has stepped up the number of mach3 turbo razors it sends to consumers who do not now use a gillette product gillette just introduced mach3 turbo champion , a bright red and black razor that , not at all by coincidence , is packaged to look like a highspeed sports car and is clearly aimed at a young , macho type of guy champion was supposed to come out next year gillette rammed it through

the dvd player is the fastestgrowing consumerelectronics product in history , and the pace is not slowing down since it came on the market six years ago , americans have bought 61 million players , almost onethird of them this year alone , and that s as of the week before thanksgiving more than 36 , 000 films are now available on dvd and nearly half of those were released in just the last two years so why , among this vast stockpile , is there not a single marx brothers comedy or astairerogers musical \? dvd s scheduled for release next month include cabin fever , american wedding , and 2 fast 2 furious why do n't they also include white heat , the magnificent ambersons or ninotchka \? studio executives , most of whom insisted on anonymity , say that most of these films and many other longawaited classics are being prepared for dvd right now , and that they will hit the bins in the next year or two but why have they taken so long \? there are , of course , distinctions here it should be no surprise that few films by uzo , visconti , mizoguchi or bresson have shown up on dvd they 're coming , but slowly demand is limited but firsttime dvd shoppers might be shocked to learn there s no bringing up baby , the african queen or duck soup duck soup is an instructive case in 1997 , universal studios , which owns the film , leased the dvd rights for it and two other marx brothers comedies horse feathers and animal crackers to image entertainment , which released all three in a boxedset edition that was the first year of the dvd nobody knew whether the format would succeed the lease lasted three years when it expired in 2000 , universal resumed ownership , and the image box went out of print \( it has since become a collectors' item , with some stores selling the few remaining copies for 229 , more than five times the original price \) meanwhile , one studio executive said , universal has quietly been assembling a respectable new dvd creating a new negative \( the original nitrate negative no longer exists \) and searching the archives for bonusfeature material 'duck soup' is a special movie , said the executive , who asked not to be identified because universal has not yet announced the reissue we want to treat it specially the executive also said universal would soon release several w c fields comedies two other missing marx brothers films , a night at the opera and a day at the races , were owned by ted turner , who in the mid1980 s bought the film libraries of mgm , rko and pre1949 warner brothers in the age of beta and vhs , turner home video put many of those movies out on videotape with the big media mergers of the 1990 s first warner brothers and time , then timewarner and turnercnn the libraries passed back to warner brothers for the last five years , frustrated cinephiles have wondered when warner home video would start making dvd s from even a few of the 3 , 000 films that it inherited from turner warner was , at first , a slow adapter its early dvd s were disappointing in quantity , visual quality and bonus features but in the last few years , the company has transformed itself its dvd s are plentiful their visual quality is consistently good , often stellar and now , finally , the company is dipping into the turner archive they have announced that gaslight , goodbye mr chips and days of wine and roses will be released in january and february unofficially , one executive said , they are preparing , for release in the next year or two , top hat , meet me in st louis , death in venice , the damned and several newly restored chaplin films the confustion brought on by media mergers and acquisitions has been a common cause of dvd delays for example , mgm home entertainment , oddly , owns no mgm films made before 1986 \( they were bought by turner \) , but over the years it has bought the film vaults of united artists , orion , embassy and polygram one year before it was purchased , polygram acquired the holdings of epic , which owned the films of several studios that had gone bankrupt when we deal with a film that polygram actually produced , like 'fargo , ' it s fairly easy to make a dvd , said scott grossman , mgm s vice president for technical operations but if a film came from epic , which polygram s people did n't have time to sort through , we have to dig through 30 or 40 or 50 years of archives to figure out where everything ended up in other words , in many cases , the company that owns the film does n't know where the film is when we did the dvd for 'escape from new york , ' which was an embassy title , mr grossman said , it took us two years to find the original negative they finally found it inside a mismarked film can sometimes , ownership is in dispute last february , a new video company , kochlorber , announced that one of its first dvd s would be la dolce vita by fellini the company had bought the rights from a small company called international media films , which claimed it owned the movie but paramount pictures claims that it owns la dolce vita a legal battle is brewing kochlorber s dvd has been delayed paramount , meanwhile , is reportedly preparing its own dvd other films are simply being withheld none of harold lloyd s silent comedies are on dvd , for example , because lloyd s granddaughter , who owns them , wo n't lease or sell the rights the avidly awaited , definitive version of ridley scott s sciencefiction classic , blade runner , wo n't be out on dvd anytime soon for stranger reasons
chicago , june 17 rents are falling , vacancies are rising and the economy remains in the doldrums normally , this would not be looked on as the most opportune moment to commence construction of millions of square feet of new downtown office space but that has not deterred two major chicago developers from starting two highprofile office buildings totaling more than 28 million square feet of space the buildings are the hyatt center and 111 south wacker the first is being developed by a partnership consisting of the pritzker family and higgins development partners while the second is being constructed by the john buck company both buildings broke ground in the last six months with the hyatt center expected to be finished in late 2004 and 111 south wacker in mid2005 in addition , a third developer , hines interests of houston , has announced a tentative starting date later this year for a third highrise why build now \? why add 28 million square feet of space 36 million if the hines building is included in the calculations to the more than 20 million square feet currently sitting vacant \? if they were driven by economics , says stephen smith , managing director of jones lang lasalle , a large real estate investment and services firm with headquarters here , none of these buildings would be happening indeed , the fundamentals of the downtown office market are not very encouraging the overall vacancy rate including space available for sublease stands at about 16 percent two years ago , the rate was about 10 percent in addition , the rate is expected to increase to about 18 percent over the next year the crucial real estate measure called absorption the net of space that has become vacant and space that has been leased in a given period is also lagging we 've had negative absorption for five straight quarters , said john o 'donnell , vice chairman and chief financial officer of john buck and mr smith of jones lang lasalle said , no one has been able to identify the next tech trend that is going to drive growth a result is that rents are dropping after a runup in the late 90 s when they briefly peaked at just over 30 a square foot a year for class a space , the most modern in the best locations right now , landlords are doing whatever they need to do to lease space , said john goodman , executive vice president and regional manager for julien j studley inc , a national tenant representative firm with offices here he added that for class a space , the current net effective rental rate is 17 to 22 a square foot that s where deals are being done , he said the problem is a lack of tenants , at any price we 've had almost no real growth except for bankruptcy firms and law firms among typical users , said john f mckinney , president of jf mckinney associates , a large leasing firm that is handling leasing at hyatt center paul beitler , codeveloper of dearborn center , a new 18millionsquare foot building at the corner of dearborn and adams streets , said , we have n't signed a lease in two years the building , which was finished earlier this year , is 30 percent vacant , mr beitler said essentially , ever since 9 11 , there has been no leasing the attacks on the world trade center and fears of future terrorism are also having a negative impact on the city s ultimate trophy building , the 110story sears tower , the tallest in the united states before 9 11 , we had gotten to a point where we were commanding some really strong rates for a class a building , said stephen budorick , senior vice president of new yorkbased trizec properties inc , which has a controlling interest in the 34millionsquarefoot building afterwards , we were 25 percent off that the building has had several high profile defectors in recent months , the most notable being goldman , sachs company goldman , which occupies 245 , 000 square feet on a longterm lease that does not expire until 2011 , is leaving for smaller about 200 , 000 square feet space at the new hyatt center according to andrea raphael , a goldman vice president and spokeswoman , the reasons for the move are strategic we wanted to consolidate and get an amount of space that was more efficient for us , she said trizec properties and much of the local real estate community here has a different interpretation the factor that put them in the market , mr budorick said , is 9 11 whatever the reason , goldman s decision reflects the leasing strategy of the new buildings , which is to entice existing downtown companies to leave their current space with promises of being in new , technologically uptodate buildings on one of chicago s premier business streets wacker drive , home to the hyatt center and 111 south wacker , as well as the sears tower , is a broad boulevard that parallels the chicago river on the north and west sides of the loop business district over the last decade , as development has spread west , wacker has challenged lasalle street as the city s financial center of gravity

said zoe daffern , 41 , of kentfield i do n't think we 're going to solve the world s problems by getting rid of suv s she certainly is not getting rid of her black chevy suburban it gives you a barrier , makes you feel less threatened , she said for all their bulk , suv s are not as safe as many owners imagine them to be , and the national highway traffic safety administration has said it might propose new standards that would force substantial design changes these include adding side curtain air bags , to reduce the risk in rollovers , and possibly lowering the profile of the biggest models , to cut the risk to cars hit by suv s and in response to tax laws that let businesses deduct 30 , 000 or more for supersized vehicles like the hummer , senator barbara boxer , democrat of california , recently introduced a bill called the suv business tax loophole closure act other gasguzzling vehicles are out there , like pickup trucks , but none as popular and as profitable one of every four new vehicles sold last year was an suv , said jeff schuster , director of north american forecasting for j d power and associates 3 , 977 , 864 in all even with the economy slumping , he said , that number is expected to rise to about 415 million this year government standards call for suv s sold in the country to average 207 miles a gallon , while passenger cars must average 275 miles the h2 , the new hummer model , weighs more than three tons and gets 11 miles to the gallon sarah jain , an assistant professor of cultural anthropology at stanford university , said that the suv a vehicle marketed for the independence it is supposed to provide even while posing serious social costs , like smog and rollovers embodies many incongruities in the culture it represents the inability of americans to make a connection between consumption decisions and their social impact , she said the war and the huffington ads are giving voice to that frustration to todd gitlin , a professor of journalism and sociology at columbia university , the biggest surprise about the suv backlash is that it took so long ms huffington pressed a button that was ready to be detonated , he said , on a topic made acute by the threat of war it is the transmutation of a big issue into a neighborhood issue the suv is the place where foreign policy meets the road the huffington commercials were financed by a 200 , 000 war chest critics have noted that the sponsors themselves have conspicuously consumed ms huffington , for instance , lives in a costly home in the brentwood section of los angeles and owned a lincoln navigator suv before buying a toyota prius , a hybrid gasandelectric subcompact csaba csere , the editor of car and driver magazine , said the vilification of suv s seemed somewhat arbitrary the gas mileage of the pickup truck is just as horrendous as any suv s , he said i do n't see how commuting to work in a 5 , 000pound pickup is any less sinful than a 5 , 000pound suv , he added i hope arianna huffington never gets into a limousine it s a very fuelinefficient vehicle the image of the suv taps into deepseated yearnings in the american psyche , said dr clotaire rapaille , a medical and cultural anthropologist in boca raton , fla with their image of strength , power and size , the suv connects to reptilian instincts that are important for reproduction and survival , dr rapaille said , disregarding the 'intellectual cortex' information that says rollovers are dangerous my theory , he added , is the reptilian always wins the issue has made for dissimilar political bedfellows , hollywood liberals and evangelical christians they might not be part of a religious organization , but many are concerned about transportation choices for spiritual reasons , said the rev jim ball , executive director of the evangelical environmental network we 've all seen the same evidence first it was human health , global warming and oil dependence , mr ball said with the middle east troubles , another cause has sprung up it s a moral issue people who love or hate suv s will probably not be affected by the advertisements , said dan becker , director of the sierra club s global warming and energy program but the people in the middle , who may have bought an suv and are now saying 'gee' are beginning to think , he said some of them will come to the right conclusion it is doubtful their ranks will include kelly kriston , 39 , who was lusting over an orange hummer h2 the other day in marin county it weighed 6 , 400 pounds and cost around 50 , 000 as mr kriston considered buying it , did he feel guilt \?

those colorful plastic bins on neighborhood curbs have become part of the local landscape and filling them part of the weekly routine long islanders do n't usually give much thought to recycling and in the last few years , statistics show that many may be giving it even less thought , throwing out more trash while recycling less overall , long island towns report recycling rates much lower than the goal set by the state department of environmental conservation , which is to recycle at least 42 percent of all solid waste many towns also report recycling less than the 297 percent of solid waste the federal environmental protection agency said was recovered nationally in 2001 the town of north hempstead s recycling rate has dropped sharply in recent years , and rates in oyster bay , huntington and islip have also decreased the north hempstead supervisor , may newburger , was at a loss to explain the dropoff in her town s recycling rate , which plunged from 37 percent in 1999 to 20 percent in 2002 i really do n't know why that is , she said we regularly send out reminders and advertise recycling i think we 're doing everything we can but in hempstead , where the recycling rate rose from 25 percent in 2000 to 30 percent last year , officials credited education efforts richard ronan , the sanitation commissioner , said the town had been conducting surveys of town garbage routes to see which homes are not putting out the green plastic buckets at least once a month those who do n't will receive new buckets , to remind them to participate in the town s recycling program the town also runs television commercials to promote its hazardous waste disposal initiative maureen wren , a dec spokeswoman , discounted the declining recycling rates reported by the long island towns and said that according to the information reported by municipalities and private firms to dec , the amount of materials recycled statewide continues to be stable lawrence swanson , director of the waste reduction and management institute at stony brook university , said images of the infamous garbage barge and the unwanted new york city trash that floated on it have long faded from people s minds , making recycling seem less urgent people are tired of it , he said you need a crisis to keep people inspired although there is no state mandate for towns to recycle at a certain rate , in the 1988 solid waste management act , the dec outlined goals for municipalities to recycle between 42 and 50 percent of their garbage by the year 2000 some long island town officials think that was a stretch and complain that the state and federal governments are not doing enough to create markets for recycled materials but dr swanson put the onus on local government the towns would like to see a continuing source for their recyclables , but sometimes they have to eat a little bit of the cost , he said residents who try to sneak tuna cans into their regular trash could be fined , but almost none are and going after individuals who fail to recycle is not the answer anyway , according to gordon gibson of huntington , executive director of citizens for a livable environment and recycling we are not what counts , he said it is the organizations in the community that counts every government office should recycle every scrap of office paper , because once they get their house in order , the whole thing follows they should account for trash the same way they account for money there are other reasons why recycling has slowed here markets for recycled products like paper and scrap metal have become saturated by the increase in supply from municipalities who have jumped on the recycling bandwagon in recent years with the smaller demand for some recyclables , it costs towns more for disposal this was the reason new york city suspended its plastic and glass recycling program last year mayor michael r bloomberg said ending this type of recycling would save the city about 40 million of course , not recycling puts that much more trash into the waste stream with most incinerators already burning as much as they can and local landfills closed , the garbage has to go somewhere much of new york city s trash goes to landfills in virginia over a million tons of long island s trash is burned at the four wastetoenergy incinerators located in babylon , east garden city , huntington and islip officials of american reffuel , which operates the incinerator in east garden city , have proposed a a similar incinerator on the site of the former shoreham nuclear plant but the brookhaven supervisor , john jay lavalle , has said he opposes the plan currently , brookhaven trucks its garbage to the nassau incinerator some recycling advocates contend that too much waste that could be used again is going up in smoke , posing a health risk mass incinerators generate extensive pollution , and it s usually very dangerous pollution , fine particulates like zinc , arsenic cadmium and lead , mr gibson said virtually everything put in a mass incinerator can be recycled
at engine company 204 in cobble hill , brooklyn , the police used two vans to cart away 12 protesters who had invaded the firehouse to keep it alive at engine company 212 in williamsburg , protesters rushed in and jammed pieces of lumber to prop open the door one man chained himself to the bumper of the fire truck , and others sat down in front of it eight people were arrested after months of debate and legal battles , the city closed six fire companies yesterday in brooklyn , queens and manhattan several of the closings went smoothly , although bitterness and sadness lingered outside the buildings' front doors but confrontations in harlem and brooklyn exposed emotions so raw that their intensity surprised the police officers and fire officials on hand to keep order on the overcast sunday morning the six companies four in brooklyn , one in manhattan and one in queens had been ordered to close down and cease responding to radio calls at 0900 hours , or 9 am the city had long argued that in these six cases , other fire companies nearby could respond to emergencies just as quickly , and the overlap of coverage was too expensive in such perilous financial times there were hugs , tears and somber goodbyes among residents and firefighters at the firehouses where the order was quietly followed at engine company 209 in bedfordstuyvesant , the closing barely interrupted the firefighters' morning coffee and treadmill workouts at engine company 36 in east harlem , however , protesters chanted angrily waving banners reading they go , we die , they lined up in front of the house and blocked firefighters from parking the fire truck inside mayor michael r bloomberg , speaking to reporters in forest hills , queens , reiterated his contention that the closings would not pose a safety threat to local residents he said that all of the firefighters were being reassigned and that the six companies had been chosen carefully by fire chiefs because all of them are reasonably close to other firehouses these were the first firehouse closings in the city in more than a decade , and the mayor faced political opposition , lawsuits and no small criticism over them but the mayor , who was lightly booed at two memorial day parades yesterday in queens , has maintained that this is a politically tough but necessary measure to balance the city s budget closing firehouses has never been easy in 1991 , four days after mayor david n dinkins ordered the controversial closing of engine company 294 , in richmond hill , queens , two brothers died in a house fire nine blocks away rudolph w giuliani seized on the issue when he ran against mr dinkins for mayor in 1993 , and reopened the firehouse shortly after he became mayor on saturday , a man rammed a white van into the front doors of four firehouses in brooklyn one firehouse door was jammed shut , preventing firefighters from responding to two calls none of those firehouses were among the ones scheduled to be closed as of yesterday , officials had not found the driver or speculated on his motive but there was talk among firefighters that the incident could have been an attempt to keep the city from closing the four brooklyn firehouses by disabling others that would assume their duties the 20 people who were arrested yesterday were charged with criminal trespassing and disorderly conduct , said firefighter robert calise , a spokesman for the department at the firehouses that drew protests , demonstrators began arriving before 8 am , carrying coffee cups , waving signs and pushing baby strollers about 200 people gathered outside engine company 204 in cobble hill there were parents , politicians , activists there was a sept 11 widow , and there was the actor steve buscemi , a former city firefighter who lives in brooklyn a handful of demonstrators began to voice outrage that the firehouse was being closed others put down their coffee and began chanting along speakers began lambasting mr bloomberg s decision , and the gathering grew heated just before 9 am , protesters linked arms in front of the building , preventing the firefighters from leaving a fire captain from the house , brenda berkman , stuck her head out a window and joined in the criticism of the mayor by 11 15 , the protesters were storming the firehouse and opening the large door so others could enter just after noon , police officers arrived and began making arrests at engine company 212 in williamsburg , there were about 100 protesters by 8 am , chanting in english , polish and spanish and setting up sidewalk barbecues to grill hamburgers two conga drummers arrived and began beating out rhythms suddenly , paul veneski , 38 , of williamsburg , an unemployed truck driver , slipped into the firehouse through an open cellar door and opened the garage s large red door other protesters among them bronislawa hupalo , a railthin 80yearold charged in and struggled to jam it open with discarded lumber mr veneski then chained himself to the fire truck his 12yearold daughter , jennifer , cheered him on later in the threehour standoff , she offered her father hamburgers through a small space in the door apparently , trying to save firehouses runs in the veneski family mr veneski s father , adam veneski , a local grocer , stormed this very firehouse when it was threatened with closing in 1975 , the family said at engine company 36 in east harlem , about a dozen protesters chanted against the closing a sarcastic for rent sign on the door listed some of the building s assets eatin kitchen , covered parking , sliding pole although unhappy to see them go , the protesters cheered the firefighters as they carried out their gear lee decker , 35 , a firefighter with engine 36 , said that many firefighters from the company , both active and retired , spent the night at the house , rehashing memories and deciding who would keep communal possessions bought with their own money , including a washerdryer , dishwasher , refrigerators , couches , televisions , stereos , vcr s and an extensive collection of exercise equipment they 're breaking up a big family here , firefighter decker said in sunset park , brooklyn , a small group of tearyeyed firefighters and residents gathered outside engine company 278 at 9 am , not so much in protest as in resignation as they hugged each other , brian horan , 48 , of sunset park , a 13year veteran with the company , loaded his belongings into his car i think it s a disgrace to the members of the force who died in 9 11 , he said it s a slap in their face the scene yesterday seemed just as poignant at engine company 261 in long island city , queens it shared a firehouse with ladder company 116 , so the house itself would be staying open at 8 30 am , a handful of firefighters there sat dolefully on the bumper of their truck and listened to local democratic elected officials criticizing mr bloomberg and gov george e pataki for cuts in financing at 9 am , deputy fire chief john acerno conducted a somber roll call , saluting their efforts and dedication , loyalty and many sacrifices by the end , some firefighters were in

in the late 1980 s , a decade before the greatest generation hysteria fully kicked into gear , the historian paul fussell , among others , was already issuing bitter complaints about how world war ii has been sanitized and romanticized almost beyond recognition channel surfers who arrive late to the new pbs documentary the perilious fight america s world war ii in color may initially feel that they 've stumbled on the ultimate insult to the actualities of that war has some blundering archivist actually thought to colorize hundreds of hours of battle scenes and other period film shots \? those channel surfers should , at least temporarily , hold their fire our collective memories of world war ii may exist almost entirely in black and white , but as this documentary makes plain , the war was the first to be recorded extensively on color film a good deal of that film has only recently been recovered as american moviegoers were thrilling to the ripe color dreamscapes in the wizard of oz \( 1939 \) , this young technology was about to be deployed on battle fronts across the world the perilous fight is not the best world war ii documentary ever made \( martin sheen s absurdly terse narration can make you wish he had aaron sorkin stenciling in his cue cards , as he does on the west wing \) it may not even be the best color documentary produced about the war but the perilous fight , a fourhour series , which will run in two twohour installments tonight and next wednesday , does present the most comprehensive collection to date of color film related to america s involvement in world war ii , and many of the scenes are stunning early in the documentary the primary colors notably the reds are the ones that hit you the hardest the red of nazi banners at the berlin olympics in 1936 and at rallies in 1937 , the red of hitler s swastika armbands , jude painted in lurid red on the windows of jewishowned businesses in vienna and the red of the congealing blood that trickles from countless bodies the color may add nothing to our understanding of this war , but there is no denying its emotional immediacy there are more shockingly vivid colors to come , notably the oranges of flamethrowers and of the explosions caused by kamikaze pilots slamming into american aircraft carriers but as the perilous fight grinds onward , it s the smaller , more subtle moments that stick with you as any devotee of the history channel is aware , most war documentaries contain more secondary , or broll , shots and aftermathofbattle scenes than actual war scenes cameramen had as little interest in being shot to ribbons on the front lines as the average gi for every shot of tracer fire ripping through the trees at close range , there are usually three of soldiers shaving , playing cards or running through drills that s the case here , too , but much of this documentary is haunting the color scenes of young men , frequently taken from home movies , underlines the essential reality that they were very young men being sent into battle the perilous fight is far from just a homely assortment of broll filler , however part 1 of the series , infamy \( 191942 \) , in addition to scenes of nazi rallies , includes some of the earliest color motionpicture images ever made , of a victory parade in paris at the end of world war i there is also film of the ruin at pearl harbor , shot by a unit working for the director john ford part 2 , battlefronts \( 194244 \) , brings wrenching scenes from german propaganda films of starving children in the warsaw ghetto as well as scenes from america s japanese internment camps part 3 , wrath \( dday and ve day \) , features film of the seizure , a few days before dday , of a german uboat that carried enigma code machines \( the captured germans stand on the decks , bearded and blinking like gerbils thrust into the light \) there are also scenes of bombing raids over germany and of the liberation of buchenwald , where german civilians are being forced to walk through the camp to witness its horrors part 4 , triumph \( the pacific , 194345 \) , imparts a strong sense of the viciousness of the fighting there throughout the perilous fight , mr sheen s narration is the glue that links together snippets from letters , journals and reports from war correspondents like ernie pyle and martha gellhorn the role of black journalists is also emphasized , driving home that the perilous fight may be among the most politically and socially inclusive fullscale world war ii documentaries yet produced close and repeated attention is paid not only to the black experience during the war there is a color training film of the black tuskegee airmen but also to the experiences of women , allied jewish soldiers and the japanese in america throughout the program viewers may have to fight a nagging sense that some of the scenes look too good , too vibrant to be true they may be in promotional material , the producers take pains to explain that none of the film has been colorized that is , artificial colors have n't been digitally applied to blackandwhite images the film has , however , been colorgraded , a process that restores the colors that were recorded on the film to their original hues for some viewers the line between colorization and colorgrading might seem to be a thin one yet with war on the horizon again , viewers may want to fight the urge to fiddle with the contrast knobs on their sets world war ii in blackandwhite documentaries can seem impossibly remote and antiquated in color the terrors of this war seem , appropriately enough , to have been only yesterday the perilous fight america s world war ii in color on most pbs stations tonight \( check local

indoor fireworks displays like the one that touched off thursday s nightclub fire in rhode island have become so common they are almost a routine spectacle at special events during the past decade , said julie l heckman , the executive director of the american pyrotechnics association , a trade group based in bethesda , md , you see that indoor pyrotechnics have been added to family bar mitzvahs , weddings , birthday celebrations , political conventions and openings of malls ms heckman said that americans' taste for indoor fireworks started in the 1970 s with big arena shows by bands like the rolling stones and had spread steadily to the grass roots while technical advances and coolerburning chemicals have allowed indoor displays to become more complex and colorful , the fireworks used by the band great white at the station club in west warwick , ri , appeared to be of the most basic type , shooting sparks from a device known as a gerb whiteburning gerbs , cousins of the handheld sparklers set off in backyards across the country , consist of little more than ground aluminum packed at high pressure into a paper tube the size of a magic marker the base of such a gerb has a filament , like in a light bulb , which heats to about 600 degrees when a switch is flipped and current passes through it , igniting the aluminum philip butler , a producer at fireworks by grucci , one of the world s leading fireworks presenters , said the type of gerb he saw on video clips of the fire yesterday probably cost less than 1 he said that many bands rig up foot switches so the musicians themselves can set off the fireworks it s simple stuff , mr butler said even the simplest fireworks , however , need to be used with a modicum of common sense and official permission , mr butler said , and he and fireworks experts who spent the day watching the sparks turn into flames on the cable news channels yesterday said that none seemed to be employed on thursday night what i saw was a misapplication of just criminal proportions , mr butler said you never display indoor or outdoor without a local jurisdictional firework permit , something that fire officials said yesterday great white and the station had not applied for you never do display indoors without the support of a sprinkler system , mr butler continued and you have to know enough to make sure that the environment around you is fuelfree the soundproofing foam near the stage that appeared to be ignited by sparks on thursday is highly flammable , mr butler said great white s leader , jack russell , said yesterday that the band had received permission from the club to set off the fireworks but the club s owners disputed this , and several owners of clubs where great white played recently said that the band had set off fireworks without warning them in advance domenic santana , the owner of the stone pony in asbury park , nj , the fabled club where bruce springsteen got his start , said that great white s tour manager mentioned nothing about fireworks in the days leading up to their show at the club on feb 14 , but they were used at the show mr santana said that fireworks are not allowed in the club mr russell said last night that the band had permission from the stone pony to use fireworks there mr santana provided the associated press with copies of great white s contract for the show at the stone pony it includes requirements such as a certain size marshall amplifier and a a large bag of potato chips in the dressing room it does not mention fireworks the stone pony s stage manager , chris glowacki , said that the fireworks great white used at the stone pony appeared similar to the ones he saw on video clips of the rhode island fire , if slightly more contained rhode island s fireworks laws , which mr butler called some of the strictest in the country , require that a permit be obtained through the state fire marshal at least 15 days in advance of any display , and that the display be operated by someone holding a state license ms heckman of the pyrotechnics association said that a license issued by the federal bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms is also needed to buy commercial fireworks it was not clear last night whether anyone associated with great white was licensed to buy or set off fireworks it s common for bands to have their own pyro , mr butler said , but it s really , truly an anomaly as far as i know for someone to do it like this photo the rolling stones helped popularize fireworks with music this is the band rammstein at the hammerstein ballroom in manhattan in 1999 \( rahav segev for the new york times \)
sacramento , nov 30 byron scott said he did n't even bother yelling at halftime he let the score scream for itself as the nets walked off the court after the first half sunday night , several players glanced up to the scoreboard in arco arena they could not believe what they saw or fathom how far they had to go in some ways , the nets might have celebrated their 10592 loss to the kings , given that they trailed by 32 points at halftime , scored only 28 points in the first half and put on one of their worst displays since trading for jason kidd three years ago it was embarrassing , scott , the nets' coach , said we were embarrassing richard jefferson said it was unbelievable i 've never seen anything like that yet the magnitude of the blowout could not have been totally unexpected the nets had won 10 games in a row last season when they welcomed sacramento to continental arena and were humiliated by 36 points since then , the nets are 3033 in the regular season given the context , they probably should have popped the corks when they cut the deficit to 12 points in the fourth quarter the nets \( 79 \) did salvage some dignity after halftime , sinking 11 shots in a row and scoring 64 points in one of their best halves of the season but none of them will remember that the nets hoped to be one of the teams that could challenge the kings \( 124 \) for the nba title , and in their first meeting they were n't just in another conference they were in a different league i ca n't explain how we came out , scott said we did n't have the effort you 'd think we 'd have we had no sense of urgency i told our guys it was embarrassing they were playing around with us the kings and the nets run the same offense , but they did not look at all similar the nets made 13 of 45 fieldgoal attempts in the first half and were 0 for 6 from 3point range on the other end , sacramento sliced the nets with repeated backdoor cuts that resulted in layup after layup , open jumper after open jumper bobby jackson s 3pointer with 30 seconds to go in the first half gave the kings a dizzying 6028 halftime lead we jumped on them from the first minute , said vlade divac , the kings' center the nets usually match up jefferson on peja stojakovic , but scott turned to kerry kittles even though he was giving up five inches by the end of the first quarter , kenyon martin was on stojakovic , then jefferson but stojakovic made four 3pointers and finished with a gamehigh 25 points although the kings lost some interest in the second half , all five starters finished in double figures the nets' leading scorer was rodney rogers , who came off the bench and provided the energy that most of the team could not , recording 23 points , his nets career high martin also played angry in the second half , finishing with 18 points and 7 rebounds my job is to come off the bench and give us a lift , rogers said i wanted to make something happen he helped prevent recordbreaking futility , but it will take much more for the nets to win a game in sacramento dating from last season , the kings have won 17 in a row at home and the nets have not beaten them here since 199798 , the last season they had a winning western road trip to go 32 on this one , the nets must beat utah on monday night in the delta center , where the jazz is 81 this season the nets might have left for salt lake city at halftime they like to compare arco arena to a rollicking college gymnasium , and for a while the nets were playing the role of a midmajor team in a nonconference tuneup but they were solid enough in the second half that scott kept the starters on the court despite a 12point deficit even though the nets have another game on this trip , scott wanted to prove to his players that they could have been competitive if they had showed more enthusiasm from the tip in the second half , we played like a team that was down , he said we would have had a good chance to win if we played with that sense of urgency but we missed everything in the first half it s a little bit of a product of not being ready scott and kidd were particularly pained by the loss , given that scott was a kings assistant for two years and kidd is from the bay area kidd once led his high school , st joseph of notre dame , to a state championship at arco arena it must seem as if that were the last game he won here photo peja stojakovic , putting up a shot in front of nets center jason collins , led the kings with 25 points last night \( photo by associated press \)
as much as topranked harvard , with three olympians on the roster , resembles a women s dream team , this season s squad may not be the best team kate stone has coached stone s 199899 crimson team had four players who had competed or would compete in the olympics that team posted a 331 record , won the ecac regularseason and tournament titles , the beanpot and ivy league championships and the national championship , which was then under the auspices of the american women s college hockey alliance this season , harvard boasts three of the top four scorers in the nation in forwards jennifer botterill \( 39 goals and 52 assists for 91 points \) and julie chu \( 353772 \) , and angela ruggiero , the topscoring defender in the country \( 204767 \) botterill was on the 1998 and 2002 canadian olympic teams ruggiero was on the united states olympic team in 1998 and 2002 chu played for the united states in 2002 on feb 22 , botterill became the leading career scorer in division i women s hockey , eclipsing the 312 points amassed by gretchen ulion for dartmouth , ending in 1994 now with 319 points \( 149 goals , 170 assists \) , botterill will most likely surpass the men s record of 324 points set by michigan state s tom ross from 197276 i really appreciate any attention i get , but honestly , that s the last focus of mine when i'm playing hockey , botterill said since i 've been at harvard , i have had the opportunity to play with so many great players when you 're around great players , you feel very fortunate records are an added bonus her coach hesitated when asked if botterill was the best female hockey player she had seen , pointing out that ruggiero was the best at her position of botterill , stone said she s the best skater in the game powerful , explosive a clutch player for four years she plays the game with such great enthusiasm a senior from winnipeg , manitoba , botterill says she will continue to play hockey after earning a degree in psychology this spring , but she is not sure she would like to follow her former canadian olympic teammate hayley wickenheiser , who recently became the first woman to score a goal in a men s professional league while playing in finland harvard \( 2611 , 1501 ecac \) has won the regularseason conference title last season , without botterill and ruggiero , who were with their national teams , and chu , who had not yet enrolled , harvard had an 18112 record it s not always easy , stone said about fielding a team with olympiccaliber players it s a great privilege to have these kids on your team , but with that comes occasional upheaval when they go away to play on their national teams or go away for a year so patience is important , and understanding that the benefits totally , totally outweigh the drawbacks' wcha colorado college \( 2455 , 1745 \) has clinched the regularseason title in the western collegiate hockey association with one week of play remaining for all except two teams minnesota statemankato and alaskaanchorage have completed their league schedules , and for alaskaanchorage the end came none too soon the seawolves \( 0226 , 1247 \) have the worst record in the wcha in more than 30 years their only victory was against alaskafairbanks of the central collegiate hockey association anchorage and fairbanks play each other in two games this weekend anchorage will face colorado college , ranked first in the nation , in the first round of the wcha tournament , which begins on march 14 the last wcha team without a victory in the regular season was colorado college in 196162 maac heard at madison square garden last saturday when quinnipiac beat connecticut , 54 , in the first division i college hockey game played there since 1977 quinnipiac coach rand pecknold on the heroes hat trophy the teams played for , honoring staten island rescue 5 firefighter joseph mascali i think it s a great tribute to everyone who lost their lives on sept 11 it means a lot to me my wife was working that day in 7 world trade center but fortunately got out ok , so i was touched deeply by the whole situation paul baxter , a former nhl player and current assistant coach for the florida panthers , was in town because florida played the rangers he was able to watch his son , marcus , a uconn freshman , play he scored the first goal of the game for his team , so that was pretty exciting marcus baxter , a 5foot9 , 155pound right wing , on scoring a goal on garden ice not bad but one was n't enough today jack mcdonald , the quinnipiac athletic director , on the turnout of 2 , 115 at the afternoon game we 're not afraid to start with small steps people thought we were nuts for coming to the garden , and i think we proved them all wrong but this is not about filling seats this is about paying tribute to our heroes and about intercollegiate athletics at the purest level mark scheerer
taking a biological approach toward detecting biological weapons , scientists at the massachusetts institute of technology have genetically engineered white blood cells from mice to light up when they come into contact with deadly bacteria or viruses it s extremely fast , much faster than the existing methods , said dr todd h rider , a senior scientist at the mit lincoln laboratory in lexington , mass , and lead author of a paper describing the new sensor technology in today s issue of the journal science the researchers said they had already developed cells that can detect a dozen different pathogens , including smallpox , anthrax , plague and equine encephalitis while fairly quick , accurate sensors exist for chemical weapons like mustard gas or sarin , reliable detectors of biological weapons have lagged accurate systems are slow , bulky and expensive , while the quick tests are prone to false positives , finding danger where none exists at this point , the false positive rate is too high , the number of agents that can be detected is limited , said dr bradley smith , a fellow at the center for civilian biodefense strategies at johns hopkins university we are in desperate need of new diagnostic technologies the defense advanced research projects agency provided most of the financing for the research detecting biological weapons usually involves two steps , latching onto the germ and reporting that it has been latched onto in a typical sensor , an antibody , which has been attached to a fluorescent molecule , hooks onto a specific protein sifting out the latchedon antibodies and then identifying them involves fairly complex chemistry dr rider and his colleagues exploited biological machinery of the immune system to perform the same tasks instead i decided to just use the system nature had designed , dr rider said the central component of the sensor , called canary , an acronym for cellular analysis and notification of antigen risks and yields , are mouse white blood cells to detect a specific pathogen , the mit researchers add to the white blood cells a gene that produces antibodies that hook onto the pathogen the researchers also added a jellyfish gene that produces a protein that glows blue when activated the joining of the pathogen to the antibody sets off a cascade of actions the antibody , changing shape , opens a hole in the wall of the white blood cell calcium ions then rush in through the hole , which activate the jellyfish proteins , and the emitted blue light is easily detected it does signal amplification for you , dr rider said white blood cells tailored for plague bacteria were able to detect as few as 50 bacteria within three minutes with a false positive rate of 04 percent the cells did not respond to other types of bacteria nor did the other bacteria interfere with the cells' ability to detect plague the canary sensors also could have medical and agricultural uses , including screening meat and vegetables for food poisoning bacteria the mit researchers produced cells that detected a virulent strain of e coli bacteria on lettuce but they wo n't light up in the presence of nonpathogenic e coli , such as the e coli that are normally found in the human intestines , dr rider said we can even differentiate between different strains of the same organism if that s desired the researchers have also shown that the canary cells can also detect chlamydia , a sexually transmitted bacterial disease , in urine mit is talking to companies that are interested in licensing the technology tests using the canary technology could appear commercially in as little as a year , dr rider said more complicated devices that could continually monitor air for biological weapons are at least several years away it is extremely intriguing work , dr duane l lindner , deputy director for chem bio at sandia national laboratories , said it s extremely interesting in a scientific sense but , he added , a big concern of this work is the transition to practical applications for example , cells are extremely fragile cells are hard to keep alive the test , while quick , also require somes preparation including treatment with chemicals and a whirl in a centrifuge given the centrifuge and all the sample prep , there s a lot of work that would have be done to turn this into an autonomous sensor application , dr lindner said dr rider , however , said the cells require little or no maintenance the cells live for a couple of days , unattended , at room temperature , a couple of weeks when refrigerated with some care , primarily feeding , the cells can live several months they can be frozen indefinitely at liquid nitrogen temperatures they have been more rugged and robust than we could have hoped , dr rider said photo dr todd h rider of mit helped to develop genetically engineered white cells from mice that detect and report deadly bacteria or viruses \( rick friedman for the new york times \)
san francisco , aug 5 gov gray davis of california , turning to one of the democratic party s traditional pillars of support , received the backing today of the aflcio in his recall election the executive council of the national labor organization , meeting in chicago , approved a resolution that opposed the recall and endorsed a central component of governor davis s strategy that no prominent democrat should run as a possible successor to him we call on all state leaders in the democratic party to stand united with the governor , and stay off the recall ballot , the resolution said the council s vote was unanimous , said one official in attendance , art pulaski , executive secretarytreasurer of the california labor federation , a group that took a similar stand over the weekend the action by the national organization followed governor davis s appearance before the group on monday the support came at a crucial time for the governor , who has been warding off critics in his party as saturday s filing deadline for candidates to replace him nears many democrats are anxious about the party s decision to stick by governor davis and not field a candidate on the portion of the ballot that will ask voters to select a successor should he lose the recall vote , now set for oct 7 united states representative loretta sanchez , a democrat from orange county , said today that democrats deserve to have a choice on the replacement ballot ms sanchez said her choice would be united states senator dianne feinstein , but if she remained on the sidelines ms sanchez would consider running it is a possibility , she said i am a very reluctant candidate i am going to be up to the last minute asking dianne to run so far , 389 people have indicated an interest in appearing on the ballot , including many democrats , but none of the state s top democratic officials has broken ranks with governor davis , according to the secretary of state in another show of solidarity with governor davis , the democratic national committee issued a letter today , signed by nine presidential candidates , opposing the recall and calling it a partisan republican effort aimed at furthering the rightwing agenda of president bush and other republicans in washington the letter called california an important democratic holdout against the republicans , sidestepping any mention of governor davis s low job performance ratings or the state s budget problems the double dose of good news pleased supporters of the governor we are delighted that labor unions and the vast majority of the democratic party continue to stand with governor davis , said peter ragone of californians against the costly recall , a committee formed by governor davis i hope the few strays out there take notice the california labor federation sent a letter on monday to the state s democratic elected officials alerting them to the unequivocal position of the labor movement on the recall i am telling people that you have to stand on your principles , mr pulaski said in a telephone news conference from chicago we are not guided here merely by the short term or practical reaction of politics , but a principle upon which we stand , that this is a hijacking of an election mr pulaski acknowledged that many californians were unhappy with governor davis and frustrated with the state s problems but he said he was confident that his members would rally around the governor once the case was made that the recall was the work of extreme members of the republican party he singled out representative darrell issa , the san diego republican who financed a large part of the signaturegathering for the recall to qualify though decisions about financial support from the unions were not made , mr pulaski predicted that it would be a significant amount supporters of the recall predicted that governor davis , even with the backing of the labor leadership , would be unable to turn the tide of discontent i think what s happening today is one last desperate attempt by davis s labor allies to hold the fort , said phil paule , director of rescue california , one of the main prorecall groups if i were labor right now , i would n't risk my future on a failed california governor mr paule said that the prorecall groups were preparing legal responses today to lawsuits challenging the election , including one filed on monday on behalf of governor davis , that are being considered by the california supreme court he said that rescue california received donations of 50 , 000 each on monday from mr issa and the actor arnold schwarzenegger to help cover the mounting legal costs it was mr schwarzenegger s first contribution mr schwarzenegger has said he will announce wednesday whether he will enter the race the columnist arianna huffington has also called a news conference for wednesday , and is expected to run

there are no planes behind the mammoth locked doors of hangar 17 at kennedy international airport instead , it hides history this is where a 100foottall by 100footwide section of the lower facade of the north tower the infamous gothic arches is kept , disassembled into 25 pieces weighing 80 , 000 pounds apiece laid out on the floor are the crumpled remains of the north tower antenna parked in one corner is an assortment of crushed fire trucks here rests the last column removed from ground zero , complete with the graffiti from firefighters and ironworkers who recovered victims and cleaned the site this is the collection of 700 or so world trade center relics that the finalists in the design competition for the trade center memorial have , for the most part , decided to ignore this too is the collection , according to some prominent conservationists , that the port authority of new york and new jersey , after going to great extremes to preserve , is now allowing to rapidly and permanently degrade because of deficiencies in temperature and humidity control rust is eating away at the twisted beams crushed fire trucks are corroding flakes are falling from the last column pulled from ground zero this is a textbook example of how bad storage conditions can affect the preservation of an object , said tom chase , president of the american institute for conservation of historic and artistic works , and a specialist in the conservation of metals it is just awful port authority officials defend the effort to preserve these objects and encourage their use in any permanent memorial or museum the objects , they say , are being treated with respect we absolutely want to preserve these objects for future generations to be able to recall what happened on sept 11 , said steve coleman , a port authority spokesman the most critical step , port authority and some museum officials in new york say , is that these items were collected and placed inside a hangar it showed great foresight to set many of those items aside , said mark a schaming , director of exhibitions and public programs at the new york state museum , which has its own much smaller collection of trade center objects they have done a great job what is unmistakable is the enormous , immutable power that emanates from these inanimate objects stored below giant american flags hung on the walls at hangar 17 it is a force that , for the rare visitor , causes almost instantaneous discomfort and reflective pause it is not just a hangar filled with stuff , said joseph galati , a heating contractor who was so disturbed by what he saw when he visited the hangar that he had to leave you can sense the people who were never found it feels like holy ground in the eyes of some prominent architects , critics and historians , the various waterfalls , reflecting pools and marble walls in the finalists' designs for a world trade center memorial carry none of the power of these raw objects the eight finalists are using materials that could be in hotel lobbies or corporate plazas , said gavriel d rosenfeld , an assistant professor of history at fairfield university in connecticut and the author of munich and memory architecture , monuments , and the legacy of the third reich when you turn to art to commemorate something this dramatic , it ends up diminishing the horror and distancing one from the actual authenticity of the event the port authority s collection has been meticulously cataloged , with the dimensions and weight of each major item recorded , and each with its own number , visible on tags in the 80 , 000squarefoot storage area b3177 is a turnstile from the world trade center path station b3101 is a motor from one of the twin towers' giant elevators that once lifted office workers into the sky f3001 is a bicycle rack , complete with seven abandoned bikes tires are blown out and rims are twisted , but a silver and blue helmet is still locked to the crossroads specialized bike at one end of the hangar , a halfdozen ladder trucks and fire engines are parked right against one another but these trucks will never roll again the front end of ladder 18 , from the lower east side , is smashed inward , its wheels are broken off their axles , its charred and twisted ladder looking like a piece of licorice miraculously , all the firefighters who arrived in this truck survived the single biggest artifact in the collection is the 25part section of the exterior wall of the north tower this is not the jagged , 240foottall section of the south tower , the freestanding section that philippe de montebello , the director of the metropolitan museum of art , called a symbol of survival it is already , in its own way , a masterpiece that chunk of the south tower was quickly demolished , as it was believed that survivors might be underneath it and the rescue workers could not approach the area without being in danger the surviving section of the north facade remained standing for months , precariously leaning on the ruins of the united states custom house , and required much study before it could be taken down given this delay , there was enough time to devise a plan to save it
los angeles , aug 18 matt leinart s college career to this point can be summed up in four singledigit numbers three snaps against colorado three garbagetime series against oregon one snap against ucla zero pass attempts that is not much of a stat line for someone who is replacing a heisman trophy winner , but the university of southern california is not asking leinart to be another carson palmer with a supporting cast that includes an experienced offensive line , two gamebreaking receivers and one of the nation s top defenses , all the trojans need is a quarterback who can run the offense , minimize mistakes and win games just like last year , we need efficiency , the thirdyear coach pete carroll said we 're not looking for biglittle you know , big play here , then a little play , and we get stuck or get sacked we do n't want that we want consistency we want rhythm to our offense we want the clock rolling we want to hang on to that football and make good decisions you know , we 're happy to punt the football and go play defense we do n't mind that at all he added that we just want to do it on the other team s end of the field , not on our end leinart , a redshirt sophomore from santa ana , calif , knows his role and clearly understands the importance of leadership last thursday , he had to leave practice after bruising his left \( throwing \) hand while blocking defensive tackle mike patterson on a reverse yet at the end of the day , when the firstteam offense lined up for a goalline drill , leinart was back under center , leading his team into the end zone a few minutes later , carroll made official what had become apparent in recent days that auditions for the starting quarterback job were over we have a starting quarterback , he said we have a no 1 guy that s not even a decision to be made right now thus ended a fiveman race that began with no clear frontrunner the redshirt junior matt cassel , who was palmer s backup the previous two seasons , was the most experienced candidate , and the true freshman john david booty arrived to a lot of early buzz the junior transfer brandon hance and the redshirt sophomore billy hart also got their shots , but none could unseat leinart , who took a slim lead for the no 1 job during spring practice and steadily distanced himself from the field to be honest , i did n't feel like i played well last year , leinart said then spring came along , and it was anyone s job and i stepped up and they named me no 1 going into camp i feel like i 've been doing well this camp and that it was my job i just want to go out there and lead the team , and i feel 100 percent confident that i can do that that confidence will be tested aug 30 when usc , ranked no 8 in the associated press and espn usa today preseason polls , opens the season at no 6 auburn it is a tall order for any quarterback , much less one who has yet to attempt a regularseason pass , but the coaches say they trust leinart and his understanding of the offense when you think about it , he s been around this offense as long as carson was , the trojans' offensive coordinator , norm chow , said when we got here , it was matt leinart , carson and cassel sitting in every quarterback meeting , so you hope they 're learning something his knowledge of what we 're trying to get done is comparable to carson s physically and personalitywise , the two quarterbacks share other similarities leinart , 20 , said that he had a close relationship with palmer , now a rookie with the cincinnati bengals as the no 1 overall pick in the nfl draft , and that they hung out and talked frequently over the last two years about a lot of things , not just football personalitywise , we 're both calm and not real talkative , leinart said we kind of like to lead by example more than by words or mouthing off as a player , he has a lot of poise and has a kind of presence about him that s what i want to have physically , like palmer , leinart is a quarterback straight out of central casting tall \( 6 feet 5 inches , 220 pounds \) and goodlooking he even has a blonde professional surfer girlfriend , veronica kay , a sportswear model and former cast member of the television series boarding house north shore , which aired in june on the wb network take it from kay , reality tv is nothing compared to the reallife game of survivor that leinart and his fellow quarterbacks have been playing i think he definitely feels the pressure , she said , but at the same time he s just tried to stay focused on himself and not worry about everybody else i think he s pretty happy he s not making mistakes and definitely has been having some good practices he s happy when it s working and he s doing a good job all leinart has to do now is deal with the lofty expectations for a team that is coming off its best season \( 112 \) since 1979 , while attempting to fill the shoes of a quarterback who set 33 university and pac10 records piece of cake , right \? i do n't feel like i have to go out and be spectacular like carson was , he said i just have to be efficient that s what they want me to be and just move the ball and help our offense score points i do n't have to be the next heisman winner or anything all they 're asking me to do is just control the offense i still do n't have it completely down , but i feel comfortable with that photo matt leinart , who is succeeding the heisman winner carson palmer , has not thrown a college pass \( photo by associated press \)
oh , they had thrown a regular fit before , had n't they , they being the critics and the architecture scholars and the rest of the international style crowd , over his american embassy building in new delhi but once they got through their yawping and muttering over the marble , the gold , the water garden , the maharajah grillwork , etc , the name edward durell stone was bigger than ever it stood for imagination , daring , aloofness from the whole cultprogrammed bunch of them they might in fact , they surely would throw another fit over his new museum for huntington hartford the tons of white marble , the precious wood veneers , the gold rugs , the red carpets , etc at the same time , they would also surely have to deprogram themselves long enough to give credit for genius where genius deserved it they were n't crazy , after all take the red carpets , for example they played an integral role in one of the most ingenious pieces of engineering ever attempted in a building that tall , 10 stories stone had divided the galleries into split levels connected by short , luxuriously wide flights of redcarpeted stairs , creating a grand central staircase with the galleries themselves serving as the landings any ambulatory person could walk from the ground floor to the topmost gallery , looking at pictures the whole way , without even realizing he 'd done it not even frank lloyd wright s spectacular spiral ramp in the guggenheim museum could compare in originality or function today there is scarcely a living soul under the age of 60 who ever set foot in the gallery of modern art during the time mr hartford owned it or has any idea of what it was once like other than from the radioactive contamination remaining from the attacks upon the museum launched even before it opened in march of 1964 if there was a single major critic that year who was not a messenger girl for international style orthodoxy , i never read her the critic who inflicted the cut that keeps on bleeding was ada louise huxtable , architecture critic for the new york times , with the nevertothisdayforgotten comment that mr hartford s museum reminded her of a diecut venetian palazzo on lollipops the lollipops referred specifically to the columns and their inset darkmarble discs , but the quip had le tout new york sniggering over the entire building the truth is , the columns constitute a highly sophisticated repetition of the arches of the loggias up above in the form of both solids \( the black marble discs \) and voids \( the arched spaces between columns \) down below the student of architecture might wish to go over to columbus circle and take a look at the virtuosity of this extraordinary interplay of positive and negative space before it is destroyed the museum s oftenderided islamic grillwork is not grillwork at all but rows of portholes letting in light at the corners the building contained no applied decoration not even stone , the avowed apostate , could get the oldtime religion completely out of his bones in launching this , the first revolt by any established modernist , against the icy grip of the french and german international style orthodoxy but none of that mattered the damnable lollipops gibe just would n't get tired and go away in fact , while researching this article , i went into a library , and the first librarian i spoke to said , oh yes , the lollipop building as a going enterprise , mr hartford s gallery of modern art lasted only five years the storm of derision in the press was a killer worse , no big donors were going to come forth to help him keep it going mr hartford was a goodlooking , wellbroughtup rich boy who had a reputation for big woolly projects that never panned out he did n't fit anywhere in the new york network of corporate moguls who underwrite and climb such approved social ladders as the metropolitan museum of art , the museum of modern art or even the whitney museum of american art , which is , hmmmm , a bit sketchy without big donors , those institutions could n't stay open 30 minutes and the gallery of modern art , thanks to the press , was beyond sketchy carrying the museum all by himself quickly became too much for huntington hartford in 1969 , he gave this historic masterpiece to fairleigh dickinson university , just to get out from under the load historic masterpiece here i take as my text dean stern on this point , too , both sides will agree robert a m stern is not only a noted architect but also the definitive historian of 20thcentury new york city architecture his gibbonscale trilogy , new york 1900 , new york 1930 and new york 1960 , is a sweeping but rigorously scholarly 2 , 684page study of the city s architecture from 1890 to 1976 in a letter in february to a civic organization s panel on whether 2 columbus circle should be declared a landmark , he wrote no one will disagree that frank lloyd wright s guggenheim museum is a masterpiece , though a highly idiosyncratic one , to say the least i bring up the guggenheim because there was a strong , mutually acknowledged kinship between frank lloyd wright and edward durell stone , whom many thought was the master s leading disciple
my moment of illumination about howard dean came one day in iowa when i saw him lean into a crowd and begin a sentence with , us rural people dean grew up on park avenue and in east hampton if he s a rural person , i'm the queen of sheba yet he said it with conviction he said it uninhibited by any fear that someone might laugh at or contradict him it was then that i saw how dean had liberated himself from his past , liberated himself from his record and liberated himself from the restraints that bind conventional politicians he has freed himself to say anything , to be anybody other candidates run on their biographies or their records they keep policy staff from their former lives , and they try to keep their policy positions reasonably consistent but dean runs less on biography than any other candidate in recent years when he began running for president , he left his past behind , along with the encumbrances that go with it as governor of vermont , he was a centrist democrat but the new dean who appeared on the campaign trail a jarring sight for the vermonters who knew his previous self is an angry maverick the old dean was a free trader the new dean is not the old dean was open to medicare reform the new dean says medicare is off the table the old dean courted the nra the new dean has swung in favor of gun control the old dean was a probusiness fiscal moderate the new dean , sounding like ralph nader , declares , we 've allowed our lives to become slaves to the bottom line of multinational corporations all over the world the philosopher george santayana once observed that americans do n't bother to refute ideas they just leave them behind dean shed his uppercrust wasp self , then his centrist governor self , bursting onto the national scene as a mysterious stranger who comes out of nowhere to battle corruption the newly liberated dean is uninhibited a normal person with no defense policy experience would not have the chutzpah to say , mr president , if you 'll pardon me , i 'll teach you a little about defense but dean says it a normal person , with an eye to past or future relationships , would n't compare congress to a bunch of cockroaches dean did it the newly liberated dean does n't worry about having a coherent political philosophy there is a parlor game among washington pundits called how liberal is howard dean \? one group pores over his speeches , picks out the things no liberal could say and argues that he s actually a centrist another group picks out the things no centrist could say and argues that he s quite liberal but the liberated dean is beyond categories like liberal and centrist because he is beyond coherence he 'll make a string of outspoken comments over a period of weeks on reregulating the economy or gay marriage but none of them have any relation to the others when you actually try to pin him down on a policy , you often find there is nothing there for example , asked how we should proceed in iraq , he says hawkishly , we ca n't pull out responsibly then on another occasion he says dovishly , our troops need to come home , and explains , fantastically , that we need to recruit 110 , 000 foreign troops to take the place of our reserves then he says we should not be spending billions more dollars there then he says again that we have to stay and finish the job at each moment , he appears outspoken , blunt and honest but over time he is incoherent and contradictory he is , in short , a man unrooted this gives him an amazing freshness and an exhilarating freedom everybody talks about how the internet has been key to his fundraising and organization nobody talks about how it has shaped his persona on the internet , the long term does n't matter , as long as you are blunt and forceful at that moment on the internet , a new persona is just a click away on the internet , everyone is loosely tethered , careless and free dean is the internet man , a string of exhilarating moments and daring accusations the only problem is that us rural folk distrust people who reinvent themselves many of us rural folk are nervous about putting the power of the presidency in the hands of a man who could be anyone
anne aghion made her first documentary , the earth moved under him a portrait of managua , in nicaragua s capital in the mid 1990 s , more than 20 years after its devastation by an earthquake smack in the center of the city was this huge lot with carcasses of buildings , little shacks and this lush tropical vegetation that had grown after the earthquake , ms aghion recalled people were living there it made me wonder , how do you go on after so many layers of destruction \? there was the somoza dictatorship , the earthquake , the sandinista revolution how do you survive \? how do you pick up after a cataclysm \? in november 2000 ms aghion went to rwanda to ask similar questions of a country of eight million people coming to terms with the 1994 genocide , which took the lives of at least 500 , 000 ethnic tutsi and moderate hutu over the course of 100 days \( alison des forges , an adviser to human rights watch and a leading expert on the killings , said that the commonly used figure of 800 , 000 deaths was too high \) ms aghion went from the capital , kigali , into the countryside of rolling green hills and subsistence farming to a gorgeous place , high up on a hilltop where nearly a thousand people had gathered for a preliminary step of the communitybased system of justice known as gacaca \( pronounced gachacha \) the word means grass in kinyarwanda and refers to the notion of justice on the grass with more than 100 , 000 cases to be adjudicated , the government had turned to a system that was used to settle disputes between neighbors in precolonial rwanda ms aghion filmed as a charismatic prosecutor with a regal bearing ran the proceedings prisoners were presented one by one anyone who had an accusation against the prisoner was invited to speak if no one spoke , the prisoner was freed at one point a woman with a baby on her back came out of the crowd and spoke to the prosecutor in a low voice , ms aghion recalled after she finished , he addressed the crowd 'this woman has allowed me to tell you that during the genocide this man sequestered her for days on end , that during the day he would go out and kill , and at night he would return to rape her' nobody gasped , ms aghion said in rwanda you can have huge crowds and silence rwandans are disciplined , respectful of authority and able to remove themselves from their emotions that s why genocide worked so well people did what they were told to do tomorrow night ms aghion s gacaca living together again in rwanda \? will be shown in manhattan at the gramercy theatre \( 127 east 23rd street \) in a weeklong series of documentaries , sundance at moma illuminated voices it will also be shown in june at the human rights watch international film festival at lincoln center gacaca was filmed largely in april 2001 in the ntongwe district , two hours by car south of kigali the film follows the prosecutor ms aghion met the previous year as he explains to groups of people how gacaca will work and presents various prisoners to the assembled crowds away from the groups , individuals speak to the camera referring to a particular prisoner s return to the community , a father asks , if he returns , can i accept him when he killed my six children \? a young man recalls witnessing his father s murder and running to the marketplace they were killing people , but i could n't find anyone to kill me euphrasie mukanwemera recounts in horrifying detail how her baby was grabbed off her back , flung to the ground and beaten to death annonciata mukanyonga s children were murdered leave her , she heard the killers say , she is sadness incarnate , she will die of sorrow ms des forges , the adviser to human rights watch and author of leave none to tell the story genocide in rwanda , said what i find extraordinary about anne s film is that she stayed around and listened long enough the kind of attention that rwanda has received after the genocide has been dominated by people who came from the outside , who formed quick judgments about good guys and bad guys gacaca has been shown in many places the kennedy school of government at harvard on french , swedish , and finnish television and perhaps most significantly in a little church in ntongwe a hundred people showed up for that screening among them was annonciata mukanyonga , the mother who was left to die of sorrow by her children s killers she was the one for whom it was most difficult to tell her story , recalled ms aghion , 43 , who lives in new york while we were filming , she kept telling us , 'come back tomorrow , come back next week' one day i more or less said to her , 'do you want to tell your story or not \? ' and she sat down and talked in the film she tells of trying to flee , of witnessing the mass killings looking out on the hills , you could think that they were just cutting banana trees , she says she speaks briefly but eloquently about the process of reconciliation , about how rwandans are already feeding and educating the children of those who killed after the screening , as annonciata was leaving the church , i went over to her and asked her what she thought of the film , ms aghion said she told me , 'it was difficult for me to talk about what happened , but now i understand why i did it' photos a prosecutor in rwanda , jean marie mbarushimana , right , asks the people if a prisoner , vital sindikubwabo , should be released the answer this day was no , he should await trial \( gacaca productions dominant 7 productions \) \( pg e3 \) prisoners in a communal lockup in the ntongwe district of rwanda are shown in anne aghion s film about genocide and a local justice system \( gacaca productions dominant 7 productions \) \( pg e1 \)
riyadh , saudi arabia , nov 9 the casualty toll leaped to 17 dead and 122 wounded on sunday in a bombing that officials attributed to al qaeda the attack against a residential compound started with two to three gunmen standing high atop the khaki desert cliffs facing the gated complex and raining bullets on the guards , officials said with the few guards either dead or pinned down by the barrage , other attackers , possibly using a vehicle and uniforms to make them look like a security team , sneaked a boobytrapped car full of explosives into the compound to devastating effect , the officials said the united states deputy secretary of state , richard l armitage , who was in riyadh for talks with crown prince abdullah and other senior officials , said he was certain al qaeda was behind the bombing late saturday night because this attack bears the hallmark of them the qaeda organization , mr armitage said at a news conference , would prefer to have many such attacks to appear bigger than they are the american embassy , about three miles from the blast , had been closed before the attack on the basis of intelligence that one was imminent the embassy will remain closed , with officials restricting themselves to the heavily guarded diplomatic quarter the police established roadblocks on freeway ramps into the zone , where virtually all foreign diplomats live , barring vehicles not on official business the initial small death toll from the blast rose steadily on sunday to 17 , including 5 children , with the discovery by search crews of 6 more bodies late in the day at least 13 were arabs , with the rest unidentified , saudi television reported , quoting an interior ministry official it was unclear if any attackers were among the dead saudi officials and western diplomats trying to analyze the choice of the obscure , slightly downattheheels compound , inhabited mostly by arab expatriates , concluded that the message was the same one that had been delivered by the suicide bombers who struck against three moreluxurious compounds last may , killing 34 people , including 8 americans the real intention of osama bin laden is here , a retired senior saudi official said the intention is to throw out the government of saudi arabia how exactly an attack on a mainly arab residential camp would accomplish that was something that saudi officials and western diplomats were puzzling over on sunday , although driving westerners from the kingdom is one of mr bin laden s longstated goals what did this accomplish \? one western diplomat asked did they attack it because it was easy \? was it because it was near the royal princes \? was it because it was near the diplomatic quarter \? the blast , which boomed across the sprawling capital , left a crater in the road 10 feet wide , leveling about half a dozen town houses on each side of the street and shattering glass in virtually all 200 homes the victims included seven lebanese , four egyptians , one saudi and one sudanese , the ministry official said the others have not been identified most of the wounded , including 36 children , were arabs four americans were among the wounded , the ministry said , but the american embassy said none had been hospitalized the embassy said it was still trying to determine the number of americans living in the compound because a number of people holding dual citizenship were involved residents were evacuated several hours after the attack but were allowed back briefly on sunday to collect belongings saudi arabia depends heavily on expatriate workers , and the more westernized prefer living in compounds where they are less bound by the strict religious rules of the country at large the area of the attack , known as the palm neighborhood , is unusual for riyadh , a city that stretches across the flat arabian sands the neighborhood is hidden in a desert valley filled with date palms the water and foliage making it slightly cooler and the extended estates of various princes the rocky hills above the entrance to a neighboring palace had been terraced , each level planted with pine trees illuminated with spotlights from underneath from the top of the cliffs , which seem to rise to 150 feet in places , the open desert stretches off , giving anyone attacking from above a relatively quick escape route prince nayef bin abdel aziz , the longtime saudi interior minister , toured the compound on sunday , saying the authorities would track down the attackers until we are completely certain that our country is free of every devil and every evil person the prince had been largely dismissive about the possibility of al qaeda s operating cells in the kingdom until the attacks in may , but a crackdown since then has left some 600 people imprisoned there have been repeated clashes with armed cells , with five suspected terrorists killed in shootouts in mecca and riyadh in the days before this attack no mercy or pity should be felt for anyone thinking of carrying out such acts , prince nayef said there has been a stream of calls for similar violence on web sites said to be visited frequently by militants , and among the thousands of messages on sunday there was gloating that a bombing had been pulled off the american , british and french embassies warned their citizens to remain vigilant about 35 , 000 americans and 30 , 000 britons live in saudi arabia a bulletin issued by the british embassy suggested that citizens maintain a high level of vigilance because the terrorist threat was still high the timing of the attack , in the middle of the holy month of ramadan , usually a quiet period when saudi arabia comes alive only at night because everyone fasts during daylight , has been the subject of much speculation to religious militants who say that they seek to emulate the prophet muhammad in virtually every detail of his life , a ramadan attack is not illogical the first major battle muhammad fought , in a village between medina and the red sea , against members of his own qureish tribe who opposed him , occurred during ramadan prince turki alfaisal , the saudi ambassador to britain and the former head of intelligence , said in london that the attack was a clear sign of a desperate group that wants to show it can do things there have been many arrests , many discoveries of arms caches , munitions and explosives , he told reuters so these people are in a desperate state one reason the ruling saud family has been seen as reluctant to confront the religious extremists directly is the concern that any assault on religion will undermine their own standing as guardians of the faith , especially the strict wahhabi brand of islam prevalent in saudi arabia but the recent upheaval in the region has prompted the kingdom to take tentative steps toward reform , cracking down on the extremists on one hand while promising more political openness through municipal elections and other measures on the other photos debris littered a saudi residential compound in riyadh yesterday after an attack saturday night that killed 17 people and wounded more than 100 \( photo by associated press \) \( pg a1 \) a bulldozer moved rubble yesterday at the site of the bombing of a residential compound in saudi arabia \( photo by associated press \) after the attack on saturday , a resident of the bombed compound held an injured child at a hospital \( photo by agence francepresse getty images \) \( pg a8 \)
nashville porushkaparanya , a traditional russian folk song , would seem an odd choice to close out the grand ole opry s late show at ryman auditorium , the mother church of country music but nashville veterans like charley pride and jim ed brown are enthusiastically tapping their toes to the dizzying banjo and fiddle riffs that transform the song into a bluegrass stomp around nashville , the seven musicians in the band bering strait are known as the russian kids after four years of struggle and broken record deals , the kids , now in their early 20 s , are on the cusp of doing something none of their countrymen have ever done make it on music row bering strait s crosscultural blend of pop rock \( reminiscent of the pretenders and 10 , 000 maniacs \) and classic country is beginning to catch on , and not only in nashville at a dressy charity benefit held at the gilded residence of the russian ambassador in washington in late november , four members of the band performed before a cheering audience full of embassy row grandees more accustomed to the dulcet strains of tchaikovsky the group s first album , bering strait , will be released on jan 14 by universal south , a relatively new and hot country label , a division of universal records next month comes the release of a documentary film , the ballad of bering strait , which lovingly chronicles the band s rocky road from a classical music conservatory in russia to the country bigtime the band is planning live appearances in new york , including one at b b king s blues club and grill on feb 12 , and a few other cities when the film has its theatrical release in manhattan on feb 7 a fullfledged tour is also in the works what sets these kids apart is what fine musicians they are , said pete fisher , the opry s general manager , who has booked them to play at the ryman and the bigger , disneyfied opryland several times but with country record labels going bust and stiffer competition for air time on the radio , it s probably tougher than ever to break through , said lon helton , the nashville bureau chief of radio records , a publication that closely tracks the music charts others in the country music world say it is vital for the band to be more than a novelty act known for its russian roots on bering strait s cd all songs but one are sung in english \( without twang \) and show virtually no trace of the group s foreign origins in some ways , the band s story compellingly captured by nina gilden seavey , who runs the documentary film center at george washington university in washington and won an emmy for a previous documentary film about polio is more distinctive than its music bering strait s obsession with country music began as the fall of communism ushered in a period when american culture , from cowboy hats to music , flooded into russia in obninsk , 65 miles southwest of moscow and noteworthy mainly as the home of the world s first commercial nuclear power plant and a city once closed to visitors , almost all the group s members shared a strict music teacher who put the band together an admirer of earl monroe and lester flatt , he taught ilya toshinsky the banjo and alexander ostrovsky the dobro , requiring them to practice 10 hours a day there is a hilarious scene in the movie where mr toshinsky plays a feisty foggy mountain breakdown on the banjo as part of his conservatory examination for a pair of somewhat perplexed professors the banjo is not really played that much in russia , mr toshinsky explained in a recent interview when bering strait was performing at a mexican restaurant in moscow in the late 1990 s , ray johnson , an american art dealer , wandered in , hoping to have dinner without being subjected to live music but when mr johnson heard bering strait s expertly played bluegrass , he was enchanted he paid for the teenagers to travel to nashville , where they connected with a longtime producer , tim dubois , now at universal south , and mike kinnamon , their manager in some ways , the person with the most riding on all this is mr kinnamon , who for years had all seven members of the band living in makeshift bunk beds at his modest threebedroom , onebathroom home outside nashville helping support the band for nearly four years has brought mr kinnamon to the brink of bankruptcy , he said during a recent interview at his home , where two members of the band still reside i 've got enough money to make it to the end of the month , but that s all , said mr kinnamon , who nonetheless helped members of the band scrape together the funds to make it back home to russia this christmas mr kinnamon , who has managed other rock and country acts , is accustomed to risk he ran away from home to join the circus when he was a boy and learned to be a tightrope walker , a skill he still performs he is a total believer in the band , talks about the members like a proud father and watches their newly produced videos in reverential silence i kept waiting for them to grow up , he said , but it s me who did he has stuck by bering strait through four previously canceled record deals because of visa restrictions , the band members cannot work other jobs more than once , he said , he and the band drove past the annual country music association awards ceremony certain that this should be our year , only to confront fresh setbacks the fouryear wait for the cd s debut took a toll on the group s homesick fiddler , sergei passov , who left the band a few months ago and returned to russia the worst part was the fear and the waiting and not knowing what would happen , said natasha borzilova , the band s lead vocalist , who like a lot of young american women is fond of changing her hair color and has gone from the brown braids she wore as a teenager to a blond punk cut to the red curls she tossed onstage at the opry last month at one point , just after three band members got their own place in nashville , their apartment building burned to the ground it is easy to see why the father of lydia salnikova , the group s keyboard player and backup vocalist , sternly cautions her in the film , musician today , unemployed tomorrow ms seavey , who shot parts of her film in russia and interviewed the band s family , teachers and friends , said that the band members still derived a lot of their cultural nourishment from home mr toshinsky said he long ago accepted that it would be impossible to support himself in russia playing country music now he and the other band members consider nashville home ms borzilova and ms salnikova are fixtures in a local yoga class they are really good musicians , jim ed brown said , watching the russian performers take their bows at the opry they could do it all they need is a hit song photos members of the russian pop rock and country band bering strait performing at ryman auditorium in nashville and , inset , visiting moscow in a scene from the documentary the

bernardsville it was a drizzly sunday evening in the gray procession that was may , and le petit chateau , with its imitation frenchfarmhouse facade of dark beams and white stucco , looked worn and faintly dispirited inside , the welcome was warm but the dining room was dim and underpopulated we wondered what we had gotten ourselves into then a waiter arrived with amusebouches , and the room lit up they were tiny china cups of wildmushroom cappuccino topped with foam and sprinkled with porcini powder the soup itself was as far from standard cream of mushroom as latesummer tomatoes are from vine ripened an intense , vivid mix of flavors and textures that went straight to that part of the brain \( the orbitofrontal cortex , i'm told \) where such things are stored forever scott cutaneo , 35 , the restaurant s chef and owner , seems to know instinctively how to deliver such experiences a former business student who wound up as a purchasing director at a hotel in new york and kept sneaking into the kitchen after hours to help with the sauces , he landed at daniel boulud s restaurant daniel in manhattan and rose through the ranks there before decamping to bernardsville in 1996 the cooking here is more mainstream than at moldbreaking places like daniel , but it is energetic and highly accomplished dishes can arrive with painful slowness , especially on a busy night still , they are almost always worth waiting for consider seared hudson valley foie gras with strawberries on brioche toast it may sound like a weird hybrid of haute cuisine and breakfast , but it works brilliantly the berries have just an edge of tartness that balances their natural sweetness and the smoky unctuousness of the liver bright , fresh m che lettuce helps keep the dish serious as well as colorful oddly , a nearly identical foie gras appetizer , this one with blueberry compote , crosses the line into frippery it is cloyingly sweet , and the fromage blanc listed as an ingredient which might have cut the sweetness is not discernible the menu and the wine list hold other blind alleys instead of the vegetable timbale listed with the veal filet mignon , we got spinach the carrots and turnips that might have made up the timbale were folded into a bed of lentils underneath the cornbread cake that was supposed to accompany braised short ribs was missing in action , as were the crisped cardoons offered with black angus filet mignon \( mr cutaneo later told me they were cooked into the roast potatoes underneath the meat i 'll take him at his word , but they were hard to find \) though the omissions were annoying , the dishes themselves were excellent and it is very hard to stay mad at a restaurant that insists on sending out an expensive bottle of wine when the first two choices are unavailable and charges the lowest price first courses come in the shape of galettes , and the round mold somehow seems to concentrate their flavors even an entrylevel green salad is made up of deliciously biting herbs and microgreens , mellowed by a honeylemon citronade a salad of lump and peekytoe crabmeat is lifted into orbit by cooling blasts of mango , cilantro and mint ahi tuna tartare , of sashimi quality , gets electric jolts from radishes , celery and a curry cream sauce two classic appetizers escargots in puff pastry with herbed butter and chive oil , and poached asparagus with fresh morels are predictable but firstrate tucked unassumingly under the big type at the top of the entree menu is a plate of glazed vegetables , at 23 the least expensive main course by far do not overlook it it includes a powerful onion confit , braised with red wine mounds of tender baby zucchini , broccoli rabe , cipollini onions , spinach and lentils , each of them perfectly cooked and full of distinct character and a small copper saucepan filled with velvety pur ed potatoes of an almost appalling richness the dish reminds me of tapas , or great antipasto though the vegetable lover who ordered that dish drew jealous stares from everyone else at our table , other main courses did not disappoint french turbot was beautifully cooked , and its potato crust added flavor to the mild fish without overwhelming it frenchcut chicken breast is a huge and tender serving of topquality bird stuffed with wildmushroom duxelles and laid over a bed of roast potatoes , cipollini onions and broccoli rabe veal filet mignon is right up there too , with or without vegetable timbale the meat two chunks of tenderloin from the saddle is remarkably tender and flavorful , and du puy lentils thickened with veal marrow and finished with sherry vinegar make an ideal partner short ribs are meaty , winy and terrific and a special , pacific ahi tuna , has a pulsequickening crust of curry , cumin and coriander , over a melting pile of braised leeks i only wish it were n't surrounded by a moat of flavored oil desserts chocolatealmond torte , grand marnier souffl , strawberry gratin , lemon tart , cr me br l e are merely pleasant , with none of the tightropewalking energy of that foie gras with strawberries on a slow night , mr cutaneo \( pronounced cootaneeoh \) will come out of the kitchen , plunk himself down at your table , ask how you liked the meal and answer your questions about it with wideranging , mileaminute monologues he is a most engaging host , a new york native with an accent out of the bleachers at yankee stadium and a gaze alight with passion for his ingredients and his cooking new jersey was lucky to land him , and with luck he will

montclair without any of her own accomplishments , she might have been a formidable figure simply as mrs steven plofker , the wife of a prominent if often controversial lawyer and real estate developer about town but more often it is mr plofker who is mistakenly called mr brown and in many ways , bobbi brown is just like any montclair mother of three she s a class mom her children go to public school she shops at the local supermarket her hair hangs down in a simple ponytail , and much of the time when knocking around the house or shopping at whole foods she does n't even wear makeup but then she s not just like every other mother in montclair for instance , mayor michael r bloomberg recently sent her his book \( bloomberg by bloomberg , john wiley sons , 1997 \) her most recent breakthefast party to end yom kippur was attended by yogi berra , a former neighbor , michael strahan of the giants , cory booker , the newark council member and former mayoral candidate , and robert torricelli , the united states senator and a lot of our jewish friends too , ms brown added quickly while montclair is filled with more than its share of prominent people , bobbi brown enjoys a singular mystique at least among the town s women it is her name , after all , that is on the lip gloss they pull out of their purses bobbi brown is not just a person , she s a brand like calvin klein , ralph lauren or gloria vanderbilt but it s more than simple name recognition she s a brand , like volvo , particularly suited to montclair the natural look , at full price montclair s upper middle class might be dazzled by her wealth alone , or by the fact that she sold her business , bobbi brown essentials , to estee lauder in 1995 for an undisclosed sum , yet still retains control over the division montclair s name droppers appreciate the fact that ms brown who developed an entire line of makeup from 10 shades of lipstick that were introduced in 1991 regularly rubs shoulders with celebrities , or that she appears on nbc s today show as a beauty expert once a month teenagers know her name and buy her makeup at hip chic , a youthoriented accessory store in upper montclair alexandra defrance , 11 , whose father cuts ms brown s hair , wrote a jingle for bobbi brown cosmetics for a school assignment women of middle age and beyond are equally smitten with the 45yearold business woman when rose cali , who helped start the yogi berra museum , invited friends to her 61st birthday a makeup party at ms brown s house they were absolutely blown away , ms cali said almost 150 women showed up in november to have makeovers by ms brown and her staff at a special fundraising event at esthetica , the bloomfield avenue salon where the makeup maven has her hair cut the money went to dress for success , a charity that helps downandout women prepare for the workforce the only people , it seems , who are not under bobbi brown s thrall are her neighbors when the plofkers recently sought a zoning variance to build a pool on their property , several showed up to complain , in vain , that it would be bad for water absorption in the floodprone neighborhood , and one complained that plofkers were already known for having loud parties another neighbor , who did not attend the hearing , explained privately that people on the block were worn out by the year and a half of noise , trucks and dirt while the plofker home was being renovated the regular presence of limousines also seems to irritate neighbors , who can sound a bit like adolescents excluded from the popular table in the school cafeteria yet close up , this fashion industry hotshot can often seem anything but glamorous i'm like the most normal person that you 'll probably meet , ms brown said in a recent interview in the living room of her oversized colonial whose rooms look like pages from a pottery barn catalogue i really cherish being a normal person although one friend , emily alter the wife of jonathan alter , a newsweek columnist and frequent television pundit has told her that other mothers at school sometimes gawk when they spot her , ms brown personally does n't see it i was n't a celebrity when i moved here , she said i was n't a celebrity when my oldest son was in nursery school even in her choice of vacation spots , ms brown claims to be down to earth she skis in telluride , colo , which is filled with hippies and cool people , she says it s the antithesis of aspen , she says you rarely see a fur coat \( ms brown herself dons north face outerwear instead of fur \) and she says she has manhattan friends who ca n't understand why she would want to live in a small town in new jersey one of them still ca n't believe that she organizes and runs her children s birthday parties herself i could afford to live in manhattan , ms brown said and i could afford to hire caterers for parties i chose montclair instead of manhattan because it s a place that lets you be who you are
a foreign tourist arrived in new york city early this month with a guidebook in hand and knicks tickets in his pocket but he did not use them because he also arrived with a suspected case of sars and spent virtually his entire vacation involuntarily detained in a hospital the tourist entered the hospital voluntarily because of a fever and flulike symptoms that met the definition of a case of severe acute respiratory syndrome but he stayed against his will because he refused to comply with the new york city department of health and mental hygiene s policy that suspected sars patients voluntarily isolate themselves for at least 10 days , depending on the course of their illness , to avoid the possibility of spreading sars to other people because the tourist had nowhere to stay in isolation for 10 days , the health department exercised its power to involuntary isolate him only once before in the last 25 years has the health department invoked this power for a disease other than tuberculosis , said wilfredo lopez , the department s general counsel the last time was in 1994 , when a traveler arrived in new york with suspected pneumonic plague during an outbreak of the disease in india , mr lopez said the health department declined to release the man s name , his nationality or the name of the hospital where he was detained because of patient confidentiality upon discharge from isolation , the tourist went directly to the airport feeling physically well , but not happy about his experience only after findings from tests on his blood and respiratory secretions will doctors know if he truly had sars , and they may not know even then such detention orders are given only when there is a public interest in a patient being cured , because your right to cough and sneeze on someone else ends when you have a dangerous communicable disease and you cannot be isolated otherwise , dr thomas r frieden , the city s health commissioner , said in an interview over the last 25 years , the health department has involuntary isolated several hundred patients who were infected with strains of the tuberculosis bacterium resistant to the drugs that can usually cure it the peak was from 1993 to 1996 dr frieden said such detention is used only after all other treatment attempts have failed , and that its use has greatly helped reduce the spread of drugresistant tuberculosis cases about six tuberculosis patients are now involuntarily isolated , dr frieden said the health department says it will quarantine healthy people who are exposed to sars patients only if necessary quarantine differs from isolation although definitions vary , and health officials apply them differently , quarantine usually applies only to healthy people who have been exposed to a highly communicable disease during the period when the agent can be transmitted isolation refers to control measures like requiring a patient with an infectious disease to stay in a room with negative pressure , which is designed to prevent the escape of germs in the air in the case of sars , the measures also call for health workers to wear masks , gloves , gowns and goggles when caring for a patient the tourist went to a hospital because he had a fever , a cough and felt slightly short of breath he said he had stopped in a sarsaffected area , hong kong , en route to new york because the man met the definition of a suspected sars case according to the centers for disease control and prevention , the doctors applied the recommended isolation control procedures and reported the case to the health department the day after he was admitted to the hospital , his fever subsided he said he felt much better and insisted on leaving to sightsee and go to the knicks game however , there was no way for doctors to know with certainty whether the man had sars or some other type of respiratory illness because there is no test for sars all that doctors can rely on is the definition of a sars case the cdc in atlanta has created two definitions the one for a suspected sars case does not include pneumonia but the cdc defines a probable sars case as including pneumonia to comply with the world health organization s definition the federal agency developed the broader classification because it does not want to miss any possible sars case in this country the tourist was classified as suspect because he did not have evidence of pneumonia , dr frieden said to help resolve the tourist s case , his doctors at the hospital called a health department official who asked the patient to stay in isolation somewhere for the advised 10day period after his temperature returned to normal but the tourist declined to cooperate , dr frieden said if the man had been a new york city resident , he probably would have been allowed to stay at home in isolation from other people the health department would have called every day to monitor his condition but the man had no residence in new york city and his hosts for the first two days he spent in the city before he went to the hospital could not provide space where he could be isolated
for more than a year , the knicks have dangled latrell sprewell around the league , looking for a taker for nearly as long , the knicks have flirted with the prospect of acquiring philadelphia s keith van horn both goals may soon be accomplished in one bold move after a week of discussions that began with the knicks and the sixers trying to work a deal and has expanded in a series of incarnations involving different teams , a multiteam trade may now be taking shape and may be completed as early as today but multiteam trades are notoriously hard to complete and this one , like others , may end up dissolving although it is clear that the knicks appear intent on reshaping their roster before the 20034 season according to two team officials familiar with the deal , the latest version would have the knicks obtaining van horn from philadelphia and sending sprewell to minnesota the timberwolves would ship terrell brandon to atlanta and marc jackson to philadelphia , and atlanta would ship glenn robinson to philadelphia although those are the key components to the deal , one nba team official said , it could eventually wind up including other players according to one eastern conference official , the key components van horn , sprewell , brandon and robinson and teams are set the deal would need more pieces to work from a salarycap standpoint , with brandon set to make 111 million this season , robinson earning 101 million , sprewell due to earn 135 million and van horn 133 million although the ofteninjured brandon has not announced his retirement , it is unlikely that he will play again a team that acquires him is clearly doing so for salarycap reasons , with his salary eventually being wiped off the books the 6foot10 , 270pound jackson could fill the sixers' need at center , which one team official said was the sticking point in any deal rumors of atlanta s involvement were denied by one team official but confirmed by two other team executives involved in the deal the dallas mavericks were said to be interested in sprewell by one official , but the mavericks' owner , mark cuban , said in an email response that while he could be interested , he was not involved van horn , 27 , originally drafted no 2 over all by the sixers in the 1997 , was traded immediately to the nets , having made it clear that he did not want to play for philadelphia in new jersey , van horn was hailed as a savior , but he did not meet the high expectations even though he produced outstanding numbers as a rookie , after sitting out the first 17 games with an ankle injury , van horn averaged 197 points and 66 rebounds he improved those numbers to 218 points and 85 rebounds the next season after posting similar numbers in his third season , injuries again caught up with him he broke his left leg during the preseason and missed the first 32 games of the 20001 season when he returned the next season , problems arose with point guard stephon marbury then , in his last season in new jersey , he sublimated his role behind jason kidd and kenyon martin after a troubling season in which his commitment was questioned by some teammates and his coach , van horn emerged as a force in the playoffs for the nets , scoring 27 points in a critical victory in game 5 over indiana in the first round but when his play fell off in the nba finals against the los angeles lakers , he was , without his name being mentioned , implicitly criticized by martin , comments that kidd agreed with van horn served as a second option to allen iverson in philadelphia last season , and although his numbers were good in the regular season , during which he averaged 159 points a game , he again lagged in the postseason , averaging only 78 points in the eastern conference semifinals against detroit his reputation , mainly among teammates with the nets and the 76ers , was that he was not tough enough to take advantage of his considerable skills with the knicks , though , van horn would provide size where there is none at 610 he would be replacing sprewell in the small forward slot playing out of position , sprewell has had to pit his slender 65 frame against 7footers sprewell s path out of new york may have been paved not by his play on the court , but in his clashes with management sprewell was suspended and forced to stay away from the team during training camp last season when he reported to the first day of camp with a broken bone in his hand that he had not informed the team about but sprewell , 32 , remained the most popular player on the team , a role he has enjoyed for years , and he averaged 164 points , although that was several points below his career scoring average while sprewell has had his problems with management in new york , often over tardiness , he drew only praise from the team s coaching staff during jeff van gundy s tenure and has been lauded by the current coach , don chaney i know there have been a lot of questions about several things , chaney said at the end of last season one is his loss of effectiveness on the floor i totally disagree with that i thought he was in a shooting slump but as far as what he contributed to the team , i felt he helped toward the winning cause he rebounded , he sacrificed his game , he passed the ball to guys , he guarded the toughest guy on the floor he did whatever it took the knicks were 17 when sprewell missed the first eight games of last season , but they were in playoff contention once he was back in place but according to several nba general managers , the knicks have openly shopped sprewell , pursuing deals at the february trading deadline and again for the second straight summer

in another blow to long island s jazz scene , the restaurant 69 wall street in huntington has scaled back the weekend jazz shows it has been featuring on its second floor for the last year and a half the restaurant is one of the few places on the island where jazz can be heard in an intimate setting the move comes as its owners try to combat the loss of business in a sour economy among the costsaving measures , begun last month , are the suspension of friday night performances and the cutting of band fees by 100 , to 300 , said kelly buffalino , who books groups for 69 wall , which is owned by her husband , chris ms buffalino added that she will try to recruit more local musicians instead of pursuing the more expensive manhattanbased bands saturday jazz performances will continue , as will 69 wall s psychic and karaoke nights ms buffalino said that despite abolishing a 7 cover charge and advertising heavily in print and radio , 60 wall was really struggling to get the people in she added we 're waiting to see how the fall season transpires if it gets busier , we might bring fridays back , but at this point we 're paying the bands out of our pockets totally this is a familiar refrain to local jazz artists bob hinz , a huntington jazz pianist and teacher , recounted when one bookstore that used to feature jazz nights began paying musicians in gift certificates instead of cash you get kind of discouraged , and you realize that it s not that you 're not making an effort , said dr hinz , who has a phd in piano performance it s that there are no opportunities , not only because there are n't that many venues , but also because the venues that are around know jazz might not provide an audience al cardillo , a mineola upright bass player , said he started a sunday jazz brunch at the paparazzi restaurant in westbury in 1996 the restaurant added a wednesday night jazz program in 1998 then , the sept 11 attacks occurred shortly after that , mr cardillo said , nobody wanted to go into manhattan he added , my business tripled but , the economy eventually took its toll , and the restaurant ended the program in 2001 steve adelson , a long beach jazz player , criticized local restaurants and clubs , saying they do not stick with the genre long enough it takes some money and advertising , he said if you have a bad week , you ca n't give it up they try it because they think it s a cool thing to do , and after two or three weeks , they see economically it s not working out , and they go back to wet tshirt night but ms buffalino of 69 wall street said her restaurant has stuck with its jazz program she said demographics , not restaurateur commitment , was to blame our crowd is middleaged and usually have kids at home , she said they ca n't stay there till 2 in the morning , she said it s not like the city where people are out bar hopping at one time , the island s jazz scene was livelier at the heart of it was sonny s place in seaford , which opened in 1972 the club is fondly recalled by many fans and musicians because it was devoted only to jazz and so could attract name acts like count basie or sarah vaughn but mr meyerowitz became ill with cancer and closed his business in 1997 he died three years later a few nightspots have featured jazz bands in the six years since sonny s place closed but local musicians say none has managed to focus on jazz like sonny s or replicate its familial atmosphere mr adelson , who plays a hybrid guitar and bass called a chapman stick , and a group of long beach jazz lovers are hoping to rekindle an appreciation for the music with the first long beach jazz festival , which begins tomorrow the festival will include films about jazz , including celebrating bird the triumph of charlie parker , at the local library and performances by local and international players at area restaurants the festival s web site is www longbeachjazzfest com it wo n't fill the gap in the sense that it s temporary , mr adelson said , but hopefully it will be an annual thing we are putting 50 musicians to work photos 69 wall street has suspended its friday night jazz performances because of a lack of business saturday night performances , above , continue at the huntington spot , which also offers psychic and karaoke nights \( photographs by john w wheeler for the new york times \)
miracles frequently follow a period of backbreaking labor , so joel klein works a 15hour day a quiet , slightly built , middleaged man who wears rimless glasses and can still daydream about being a point guard for the knicks , mr klein was mayor michael bloomberg s pick to turn the new york city public school system around the mayor pulled off one miracle by somehow seizing almost complete control of the system , which has 1 , 200 schools and more than a million students miracle number two would be to make this behemoth of a system thrive that s mr klein s job now try to imagine doing that job while dismantling fundamental classroom programs and escorting thousands of teachers to the unemployment lines with gov george pataki proposing a nearly halfbilliondollar cut in state education aid to the city , and with the city mired in deep budget troubles of its own , that unhappy \( and ultimately destructive \) sequence is what s facing mr klein and the children in his charge the schools chancellor remained lowkeyed about the governor s proposed cuts during an interview last week in his office in the renovated and stunningly beautiful tweed courthouse , which is now the headquarters of the department of education the nation may be revving up for war , and financial support for public education may be hemorrhaging , but there is still a generation of kids to be served whatever money i have , i'm going to work toward raising standards for kids , he said i'm not going to get into the excuse game but he also noted that he has already cut more than 1 , 000 bureaucratic positions from the education department , and made additional cuts at the local district level i honestly believe that we 're now at the point where significant new cuts will start to chew into the muscle of the operation , he said after we 've whittled away at the bureaucracy , we spend money principally on teachers , on professional development , on support staff and on our afterschool and summer school programs none of those things are things we need fewer of they are things we need more of the new york city school system is at an extraordinary moment in its history the levers of power have been taken over by a mayor who has staked his prestige on his ability to improve the schools , and his energetic , innovative chancellor , a former federal prosecutor who has already embarked on a toptobottom overhaul of the system if they get it right , new york will become the education model for big cities across the country , much as it became the model for urban crimefighting in the 1990 s but they cannot get it right if the system is starved of funds needed for even the most basic improvements mr klein stressed the importance of the classroom experience in the earliest grades for public school youngsters , especially those who are disadvantaged we 're always playing catchup , he said if a child s in fourth , fifth or sixth grade and is half a grade or a grade behind in reading and math , the challenge is so much greater what is potentially tragic about the pataki budget proposal is that it would wipe out support for prekindergarten programs and cripple efforts to reduce class sizes in the earliest grades in school systems throughout the state chancellor klein told state legislators last week that if the governor s proposal stands , new york city will lose 43 , 000 prekindergarten seats despite the funding problems , mr klein is moving ahead with his efforts to remake the new york city system he has established a strong new management team and is putting together a leadership academy that he hopes will result in a new generation of exceptionally wellqualified and creative principals and he holds on to the hope that somehow the funds needed for a viable school system will be found it s true that education can be expensive , said mr klein but how much more costly is ignorance \? he added there is no more important investment that american society can make than in its schoolchildren if we 're going to end these cycles of poverty and all the other 'catchup' problems that we 're trying to fix at the wrong end , we need to put our highest priority on public education so in terms of my view of social policy , i think that more resources in this system is where we should go that s one man s view
mount vernon , wash shannon minor went to the drugstore last year to buy a home pregnancy test , picked up the local newspaper and read some bad news her obstetrician , barbara pringle , was planning to stop delivering babies but not only was dr pringle giving up obstetrics , so were four other doctors in mount vernon , including dr pringle s husband , robert , and the pringles' longtime partner within a year only four obstetricians would be practicing in mount vernon , a small city in an agricultural valley of the cascade mountains , halfway between seattle and the canadian border i was so upset about it , said ms minor , 35 , who found a doctor at a hospital in everett , wash , 34 miles north of here there were hardly any doctors available when i got pregnant a second time , i just felt lost ms minor s obstetrician is one of hundreds around the country giving up delivering babies they cite the soaring cost of malpractice insurance here in washington , rates have more than tripled since 1975 , even after accounting for inflation , according to figures from physicians insurance , the state s largest insurer of doctors the pringles calculated that the annual cost of policies that would cover them for claims of up to 2 million the median jury award in lawsuits related to childbirth was about the same as the income they would lose by giving up obstetrics medical malpractice insurance rates have been rising rapidly for several years , and multimilliondollar awards against doctors have increased , putting pressure on hospitals and medical specialists and prompting calls for change but in the last year , rates for obstetricians have risen particularly high , medical experts say , leading many to leave their practices in rural areas , where there are already few obstetricians , it means pregnant women must scramble for a doctor the pringles said they had delivered about 4 , 000 babies in 20 years and had never been sued over problems in delivery but the cost of doing business was not worth continuing , they said , and they decided to be parttime gynecologists instead their decision puts them at the center of a national debate over medical malpractice insurance president bush and republicans in congress have used the plight of doctors to push for a law to cap jury awards the house passed a bill in march that would have capped the awards for pain and suffering at 250 , 000 , an amount that critics said was ridiculously low , given the possibilities for grave , lifelong harm from a doctor s mistakes but such a change in tort law has little support in the senate opponents of the cap say supporters of the change are using obstetricians to exploit public sympathy and blaming the legal system rather than the real culprits insurance and health care industries in need of overhaul there s a lot of fearmongering and overstating of the problem when you talk about obgyns , said joanne doroshow , executive director of the center for justice and democracy , a consumer advocacy group in new york city that sent people injured by malpractice to washington to lobby against the legislation but even opponents of a cap on awards acknowledge a serious problem with the availability of doctors like obstetricians it s hard to overstate the problem , said senator patty murray , democrat of washington the problem is real , but i think it s simplistic to just say the only solution is the medical malpractice bill the house passed that s where we go off track caps , alone , ms murray said , have never been proven to bring down the insurance rates ms murray added that she and two other senators were drafting a bill for federal aid for doctors facing higher insurance rates and lower medicaid reimbursement in a state like washington , with a high unemployment rate , the number of patients without insurance compounds the problem , ms murray said no one has precise figures on how many of the roughly 40 , 000 obstetricians in the united states are leaving their practices , although several surveys are under way anecdotal evidence in the pacific northwest suggests that the numbers are rising rapidly and it is easy to see why obstetricians would become symbols in a debate over malpractice insurance they pay among the highest insurance rates of doctors in the nation in many states only neurologists and neurosurgeons pay more than obstetricians for malpractice insurance , according to the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists , which recently released a survey calling the situation a crisis in 12 states , including washington , and warning that similar crises were brewing in six other states on average , obstetricians are sued two and a half times in their career , although they win a majority of the cases , legal and medical experts say in washington , the average annual premium for obstetricians has risen to about 60 , 000 for a policy that covers up to 1 million of an individual claim or a total of 5 million for all claims , says physicians insurance , which insures 70 percent of the state s doctors that is about 18 percent more than in 2002 , when the rate was 51 , 000
washington , dec 15 the supreme court agreed monday to hear an appeal by vice president dick cheney from a lower court s order requiring limited disclosure of the identities of participants in the task force that developed an energy policy under his leadership early in the bush administration more than two years after the national energy policy development group completed its work and shut down , the administration has continued to guard the secrecy of its operations , including the names of energy industry representatives who consulted with the cabinet members and other federal officials who made up the task force s official membership lawsuits filed by two organizations , the conservative judicial watch and the liberal sierra club , challenged the secrecy as a violation of the federal advisory committee act , which requires committees that meet the law s definition to conduct their business in public the question for the supreme court now is whether the vice president s office must submit to limited pretrial discovery sufficient to allow the federal district court here to decide whether the advisory committee law applies to the task force the legal question is a complicated amalgam of jurisdictional and procedural issues , but the stakes , as framed in mr cheney s supreme court appeal , are quite high his appeal argues that the district court s order for limited discovery , and a decision by the federal appeals court here not to block that order , present fundamental separationofpowers questions and threaten substantial interference with vital executive branch functions any discovery would be improper , the appeal filed for mr cheney by solicitor general theodore b olson asserts under the federal advisory committee act , committees set up by the president or by federal agencies to provide advice must generally conduct their business in public committees composed entirely of federal officials and employees are exempt from this requirement the formal membership of the national energy policy development group was composed entire of cabinet members and other federal officials , and on this basis , the vice president s office resisted making any disclosures in response to the lawsuits however , in a decision 10 years ago involving a somewhat similar effort to obtain information about the health care task force that hillary rodham clinton ran when she was first lady , the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ruled that a formal membership limited to federal officials would not necessarily entitle a task force to the exemption if other people acting as consultants or advisers were the equivalent of de facto members ruling in the cheney case in july 2002 , the district court said the sierra club and judicial watch were entitled to discovery to find out whether private people had taken part in the work of the energy task force to a degree sufficient to bring the task force within the coverage of the law the district judge , emmet g sullivan , said that if this limited discovery showed that the law did not apply , the suits would be dismissed and there would be no need to address the separation of powers or other potentially difficult issues rather than proceeding under this ruling , the vice president appealed it , arguing that complying with the order would require him to make some of the same disclosures that it was his position he should not ever have to make citing the supreme court s 1997 decision requiring president clinton to submit to discovery in the lawsuit brought against him by paula jones , the appeals court said indeed , the supreme court has consistently held that because the president is not 'above the law , ' he is subject to judicial process judicial watch , in urging the justices to reject the vice president s appeal , cheney v united states district court , no 03475 , said that through multiple appeals , the administration had succeeded splendidly in delaying the advancement of this case while the task force s proposals were being presented to congress this transparent strategy of 'running out the clock' should not be tolerated , judicial watch said these were among the other developments as the court began a fourweek recess mexican trucks accepting another administration appeal , the court agreed to review a ruling requiring an extensive review of the environmental consequences of opening all american highways to mexican trucks the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit , in san francisco , ruled last january that the administration had acted arbitrarily and capriciously by conducting only a limited rather than a full environmental impact review of the consequences of lifting a 21yearold policy that restricted mexican trucks to a 20milewide border zone the appeals court s decision blocked the change president bush had announced his intention to open the border after an international arbitration panel ruled in early 2001 that the policy violated the north american free trade agreement the environmental lawsuit was brought by a consumer and labor coalition they argued that bringing in an estimated 30 , 000 mexican trucks annually , many built with poor emissions controls , would seriously hurt air quality , especially in california and texas in its appeal , united states department of transportation v public citizen , no 03358 , the administration said the ninth circuit s decision was causing serious and ongoing harm to relations with mexico , which had brought the case under nafta the president of the united states must be able to act quickly and with assurance to implement the decisions that are entrusted personally to him , said mr olson , the solicitor general car search in a case from maryland , the court ruled unanimously that the police had constitutional authority to arrest all three occupants of a car they had stopped for speeding , after a search found five bags of crack cocaine , for which none of the three men admitted ownership one man , joseph j pringle , who had been in the passenger seat , confessed that the drugs were his , but then argued that his confession was inadmissible at trial he said the arrest had been illegal because the officers lacked probable cause to suspectcq him of owning the drugs , which were out of his reach behind a back armrest the maryland court of appeals overturned the conviction by a vote of 4 to 3 the justices in turn reversed that decision with an opinion by chief justice william h rehnquist writing in maryland v pringle , no 02809 , he said the police had acted on an entirely reasonable inference that any or all of the three might have been involved in the crime
there s something satisfying in learning from a new book that stalin may have been the last victim of his own apocalyptic killing spree all the more so if the murder weapon , as recounted in stalin s last crime , by vladimir p naumov and jonathan brent , was in fact an anticoagulant with a scifi name , warfarin after the enormous suffering and death he dealt , his death had to be bizarre this was not some tinpot duce to be dispatched with a banal bullet to the head no fifty years after his death , joseph vissarionovich stalin , son of an impecunious georgian cobbler and his deeply religious wife , has a secure place in history as a dominant figure of the 20th century with raw terror as his primary tool , he bludgeoned the soviet state into an industrial and military giant , turned back hitler s armies and confronted the west with an existential threat as many as 20 million of his countrymen perished in his camps and purges , millions more on his battlefields little wonder , then , that his name still arouses ambivalent feelings in his homeland more than half of russians believe that his role in history was great if defined as a measure of degree , and not quality , that is an understatement so absolute was his control over his people s lives , from their jobs to their thoughts , that the announcement of his death unleashed a mass hysteria for those who somehow survived three decades of purges , collectivization , labor camps , famines and war , all under the ubiquitous banner of the father of peoples and his bristling mustache , it was simply unthinkable that there was any alternative to stalin harder to fathom is a russian poll in which more than 36 percent of the respondents said they believed that on balance , stalin did more good than bad for the country the first reaction is to suspect that russia has not really turned the corner , that there is still a tough core of diehard communists who long to bring back the bad old days of informers , palisades of missiles and a ruthless khozyain , or master , at the top there are a few of those , but for the most part the attitude is not that focused russians call it the iron fist syndrome , and it existed even in later soviet times , when truck drivers would paste stalin s portrait in their windows , defying the total ban on any mention of the former leader this was really no more than a streetlevel longing for a soviet union in which workers worked , wars were won and rotten bureaucrats were shot and that s what it seems to be today in 1990 , when the communist regime was collapsing , a survey found that only 6 percent of the public approved of stalin eleven years later , it was 329 percent the suggestion was that when stalin was the symbol of a hated , repressive system , he was universally reviled but once that era was history , he returned as an expression of protest and anger , as an unarticulated longing for a simpler time i'm certain that this is a protest reaction , nothing more , sergei markov , the head of the political surveys institute , told the newspaper trud the people are tired of selfloathing they want patriotism they want to be able to be proud of their country there is nothing really wrong with this phenomenon besides , before getting too worked up about russian attitudes toward stalin , it is worth remembering that uncle joe was not always the same demon in our eyes that he is today the new york times of march 6 , 1953 , in which stalin s death got a banner headline , made no mention of the purges or the gulag but it did declare that his death brought to an end the career of one of the great figures of modern times a man whose name stands second to none as the organizer and builder of the great state structure the world knows as the soviet union eleven years earlier time magazine had named him its man of the year , noting that the trek of world dignitaries to moscow in 1942 brought stalin out of his inscrutable shell , revealed a pleasant host and an expert at playing his cards in international affairs at banquets for such men as winston churchill , w averill harriman and wendell willkie , host stalin drank his vodka straight , talked the same way the fact is that a figure whose will plays so huge a role in history cannot be reduced to a single category , not even evil among stalin s predecessors in the kremlin , peter the great also dispatched a sizable number of his subjects in pursuit of glory and power that may explain why stalin exempted peter from the ash heap to which he relegated most other czars we can hope that it is another version of peter the great the westernizing reformer whose portrait hangs on president vladimir putin s wall
houston , may 1 federal prosecutors unsealed indictments today against 11 former enron executives , including charges that the oncevaunted success of the company s highspeed internet business was largely an illusion in addition , the government charged three new defendants with participating in illegal deals with enron s former chief financial officer , andrew s fastow , using those deals both to enrich themselves and improperly manipulate the company s financial performance among those defendants was mr fastow s wife , lea , who was charged in a separate indictment with committing fraud by aiding her husband in certain schemes the unusual singleday disclosure of three distinct indictments in a related case was intended to give federal prosecutors the ability to signal significant success in their more than yearlong investigation of enron s collapse , government officials said all told , 18 people have been charged with crimes related to enron of that number , 8 were indicted for the first time today the charges paint a portrait of deception on a grand scale as described in the indictments , enron executives engaged in a series of schemes , including pumping up company profits with bogus sales of assets , lying about the state of the company s technology , enriching themselves by defrauding the company , and selling millions of dollars in enron shares as the market celebrated positive corporate news that was false there were many people at enron and other institutions who were responsible for reducing the seventhlargest corporation in america to rubble , said andrew weissmann , a federal prosecutor on the justice department s enron task force the task force is continuing to sift diligently through the rubble that was enron piece by piece , scheme by scheme and lie by lie two of the indictments unsealed today built on previous cases brought against mr fastow and against two former executives with enron s broadband division , kevin howard and michael krautz in each of those indictments , new defendants were added to the case the indictment related to mr fastow which also named ben f glisan jr , a former enron treasurer , and dan boyle , a former executive in the finance division involved allegations that were featured in the original charges last fall against mr fastow mainly that he used the complex web of partnerships in his control to enrich himself and manipulated enron s financial performance lea fastow was charged separately with fraud , money laundering and tax violations in the third indictment all of the defendants pleaded not guilty today in hearings at the federal district court here and were released on bail that totaled millions of dollars at the courthouse , lawyers for mrs fastow attacked the charges as a transparent effort by the government to put pressure on her husband to plead guilty lea fastow is innocent , said nanci clarence , a san francisco lawyer representing her mrs fastow has done nothing wrong , and she had nothing to do with the fall of enron these charges are utterly meritless the charges against the bulk of the executives all of them from the broadband division are a significant shift in the direction of the investigation until now , the criminal charges brought against enron executives related to offbalancesheet partnerships that executives used to exaggerate the company s financial situation and enrich themselves but the broadband indictment naming the division s entire senior management , including kenneth rice and joe hirko , both former chief executives portrays a more traditional fraud , accusing enron of having celebrated its creation of technology that had not yet been born , driving the company s stock price up as executives sold millions of dollars worth of shares in essence , the broadband case signals that the enron inquiry has shifted from examinations of complex accounting machinations to what , at first glance , would seem to be more easily understood concepts about truth and lies none of these activities played a role in bringing enron down rather , they helped drive up the stock price , placing it on the lofty perch from which it fell the securities and exchange commission also brought an action against the seven broadband executives the others were kevin hannon , kevin howard , scott yeager , rex shelby and michael krautz portraying the division as being built on advances that did not exist the government faces certain complexities in the broadband case , particularly in describing the technologies involved enron maintained that it had established a softwaredriven intelligent network , with software that offered advanced features like billing based on use and a function known as userdefined quality of service the network did exist , but the government contends that the special features that would differentiate it from rivals did not in public statements , enron executives represented that the system was up and running if it was not , the defense in the case would face an enormous challenge people who have spoken with the defendants said that they intended to argue that those features did indeed work in the indictment , the government said that enron changed the name of its network software to broadband operating system , or bos the government charges that enron executives referred to the bos as a system that was in use , when in fact it was in development but internal documents including a transcript from an analysts' conference in january 2000 that is central to the government s case suggest that different executives meant different things when they discussed the bos the result is that some executives including jeffrey skilling , the former chief executive refer to the bos as a product in development at the same meeting , other executives , including mr hirko , referred to it as a system that was up and running as i have learned the facts in this case , it is clear to me that there were many different understandings internally of what was meant by the bos , said lee hamel , a lawyer representing mr yeager in the end , this means that at least some of any trial will bog down on what people meant when they referred to particular systems but as the financial position of the broadband unit deteriorated throughout 2000 , the indictment said , enron executives went to enormous lengths to hide the troubles for example , the executives structured what the government contends was a bogus sale of an interest in a failing joint venture with blockbuster to provide videoondemand that deal , known as braveheart , resulted in 111 million in revenue being generated in 2001 , allowing the division to meet its projected earnings the indictment describes further deceptions ultimately , the complaint says , the enron executives portrayed the division , known as enron broadband services , as a smashing success at the january 2001 annual meeting , when in fact it was performing dismally in the complaint against mr fastow , mr glisan , the former company treasurer , was portrayed as a central participant in the wrongdoing involving the partnerships mr glisan was a recipient of more than 1 million from a 5 , 000 partnership investment provided to him by mr fastow as described in the charges , those profits came at the expense of enron and one of its banks mr boyle , a former finance executive , is described as taking part in a fake sale of nigerian barges to merrill lynch photos federal prosecutors indicted several former enron executives yesterday on multiple counts of fraud , insider trading and other charges among those appearing at the federal courthouse in houston were , at left below , kenneth rice bottom inset , ben f glisan jr and at right

nashville , dec 7 this collision between the indianapolis colts and the tennessee titans was all about control control of the division race , control of playoff seeding and control of the rivalry the way the colts defeated the titans in a 2927 victory sunday , complementing a 337 victory over tennessee on sept 14 , pushed the power to indianapolis with three regularseason games left , indianapolis is on top , tennessee is gazing up at them and both teams wonder if the order is set each entered the game with a 93 record , tied for first in the american football conference south only indianapolis left with a 103 record and first place in tow the colts did it by building a 2913 lead with 37 seconds left in the third quarter before the titans rallied with two touchdowns in the fourth quarter tennessee could not convert a tying 2point conversion attempt with 1 minute 52 seconds left , then fumbled and lost a punt near midfield in the final minute we had the momentum , erron kinney , a titans tight end , said we were together as an offensive group on the sideline going over things just before the last punt the defense stopped them and we were going to go out there as an offense and scratch and claw and go for every inch we were going to go down and get 6 or get 3 points but the titans' justin mccareins was stripped of the ball by cliff crosby , and the colts rookie anthony floyd recovered at the tennessee 40 with 36 seconds left instead of a chance for a lastsecond drive and victory , tennessee , which fell by 2417 to the jets on monday night , lost its second consecutive game for the first time in its last 25 games the titans had won 10 consecutive games at home mccareins s miscue was one of four turnovers by the titans indianapolis had none three of the titans' fumbles came on returns , and two were by eddie berlin his fumbles came during a stretch midway through the second quarter and early into the third that led to 34 consecutive plays run by the indianapolis offense and a 2210 lead that was great to have the ball like that , said colts quarterback peyton manning , who threw for 228 yards and did not throw an interception in his 34 passes we felt like we had control of the tempo you have to be able to win on the road , whether it s regular season or playoffs the 68 , 809 fans at the coliseum experienced a raw titans tease they saw manning connect with marvin harrison on a 42yard pass play late in the third quarter on which harrison made a onehanded catch leaping , corralling , rolling and holding onto the ball that set up edgerrin james s second touchdown run for a 2913 lead the fans also saw mike vanderjagt kick five field goals on the colts' first six scoring drives and then they watched steve mcnair \( 22 of 38 passing for 235 yards \) throw a 1yard scoring toss to robert holcombe with 9 24 left and a 2yard scoring strike to derrick mason with 1 52 left to cut the lead to 2927 after holcombe s score , the titans converted the 2point conversion after mason s , they did not , which made the final turnover a disaster for tennessee crosby said of his strip of mccareins since mason had scored and they did n't get the conversion , they either were going to try an onside kick or kick it away and play defense they kicked it away and stopped us , and now that it was time for the punt , we expected them to bring everybody inside and set up the return i got a good release i went down and he made a nice move toward me i could n't tackle him , so i reached out as he went by that s what we wanted to do on that punt protect against the block and make a play on the return colts safety mike doss added who would have thought we 'd win the game on the last punt \? i'm glad we did the suspense that could have happened if they had kept the ball could have led to anything as a confident defense , sure we could have stopped them , doss continued in that situation , though , who wants to find out \? tony dungy , the colts' coach , awarded one game ball to the special teams coach , russ purnell a week ago , purnell and his special teams were criticized for poor play in a close loss at home to new england this week , purnell and his group were kings we 've grown into this , dungy said we used to be a talented team that relied on its offense to get up on people and then we 'd say , 'ok , let s roll' but we were n't very good in the nittygritty games and now we 've learned how to play in them and win them our guys were ready for this they were ready to take control photo titans quarterback steve mcnair led a fourthquarter rally that almost made up a 2913 deficit against the colts yesterday \( photo by associated press \)
monaco , june 1 on his winddown lap through the luxurious neighborhoods of this principality today , juan pablo montoya joined the thousands of spectators in clapping and with good reason montoya had just won the monaco grand prix , one of the two most prestigious events in openwheel motor racing , and he also ended a lengthy period of frustration , for him and for his bmwwilliams team winning monaco is very special it is a bit like winning the indy 500 in the usa , said montoya , a 27yearold colombian who won the indianapolis 500 in 2000 the finish today was one of the closest at monaco since 1992 , when ayrton senna , driving a mclaren , won by 0215 of a second over nigel mansell , in a williams montoya finished 0602 of a second ahead of finland s kimi raikkonen , who was driving a mclarenmercedes michael schumacher of germany , in a ferrari , finished 11 seconds behind raikkonen , allowing raikkonen to increase his lead over schumacher in the drivers' standing to 4 points , 4844 montoya moved to fifth from seventh in the series , with 25 points montoya , considered one of the most promising drivers when he started in formula one in 2001 , had not won a race since his first victory , at the italian grand prix in september 2001 i had quite a few races where i had a chance to win and then threw it away , he said so there was a bit of pressure not to make any mistakes it was definitely worth waiting for the wait for another victory at monaco was even longer for the williams team , which had not won here since 1983 , with keke rosberg driving although williams is third in formula one victories with 109 , it has won only three times at monaco since the team was founded in 1977 we are relieved that the 20 long years since we last won in monaco is now firmly behind us , said frank williams , the team s owner montoya started the race from the pole last year but lost out to david coulthard on the first corner , setting up coulthard s victory last year i had seven poles and none of them converted into wins , montoya said the key today was the start montoya started third today his teammate , ralf schumacher , started from the pole and raikkonen started second schumacher led off the start , while montoya leapt alongside raikkonen while jarno trulli of italy , in a renault , attacked raikkonen from behind , montoya came out ahead of raikkonen the course , which runs through narrow , winding and bumpy city streets , is one of the hardest on which to pass so despite moving into second , once the race went beyond the first corner , montoya had little chance to pass ralf schumacher , who built a 22second lead after the first of 78 laps on lap 21 , with montoya less than half a second behind him , ralf schumacher made his first pit stop and handed the lead to montoya after making a pit stop on lap 23 , montoya returned to the race just ahead of ralf schumacher , but in seventh position raikkonen had taken the lead , but he and all the other drivers ahead of montoya still had to make pit stops michael schumacher , who was trying to equal senna s record of six victories at monaco , had qualified fifth but it was expected that his ferrari team would have a surprise race strategy , and this seemed to be the case when a series of fast laps and a good pit stop on lap 31 lifted michael schumacher to third , behind montoya and raikkonen , after the first round of pit stops if he performed as well through the next stint , michael schumacher would win the race in the end , ferrari was outperformed i might have been able to finish higher if i had not been stuck behind trulli in the early stages , schumacher said but our strategy was to go for a long first stint and that meant having more fuel , which is why i was behind him michael schumacher made his second stop on lap 59 and montoya took the lead again , with raikkonen trailing him by 11 seconds schumacher rejoined the race more than 10 seconds behind them the last 18 laps provided the most suspense montoya and raikkonen stayed within a second of each other , while michael schumacher closed in it was really just a matter of putting as much pressure as possible on him to try and force him into making a mistake , raikkonen said of his battle with montoya but unfortunately , he did n't
washington when george w bush was running for president , he was inspiring on the subject of privacy but it was not your privacy or mine he was talking about he has gone all out to keep his administration s energylegislation deliberations from public scrutiny cast your mind back to the white house task force , led by vice president dick cheney , that came up with the stalled bush oil policy democrats complained that it met frequently with enron and other energy executives but blew off environmental lobbyists bush and cheney , sensitive to charges of being too close to the oil industry , clammed up that secrecy violated the federal advisory committee act , claimed the rightist judicial watch and the leftist sierra club as they sued for access cheney s lawyers dumped 30 , 000 pieces of wastepaper on them from around the bureaucracy , but not one memo produced by cheney s group only federal officials were members of that task force , bush lawyers argued , so advice from outside consultants is none of the public s business a federal court ruled against the stonewalling , and an appeals court let the ruling to allow discovery stand but the administration escalated the case to the president s constitutional authority to gather candid advice from his advisers plus fundamental separation of powers questions up it went to the supreme court this week the justices , who apparently have nothing better to do next year , agreed to hear the cheney appeal the administration s eagerness to slam the door in the snoopy public s face will now be argued before the high court during political primaries and probably decided in july , right before the issuehungry democratic political convention are republicans out of their collective mind \? why the hots to hide \? a decade ago , hillary clinton tried to pull the same kind of wool over the people s eyes about her health care task force , but the dc appeals court ruled that her consultants were de facto members of the official group and stripped away the secrecy remember how we raised the roof about all those phony executive privilege claims as clinton lawyers tried to jam a cone of silence on top of secret service agents \? remember how we fought for the right of paula jones to subject the high and mighty to discovery \? what is sauce for the clintons is sauce for the bushies an ordinarily astute sao \( senior administration official \) assures me that no potential embarrassment is at the root of this unnecessary fight to the finish , and that it s just the principle of the thing let us assume that the court s surprising willingness to hear the case despite the appeals court s refusal to overturn the district court s discovery permission augers ill for government in the sunshine assume , too , that ted olson , the most respected solicitor general since erwin griswold , is at his most persuasive in seeking a landmark decision holding that any discovery would be unconstitutional , thereby placing the vice president high above the law the principle of the thing is wrong of course the president s cabinet and staff should be able to offer reasonable confidentiality to outsiders in return for candid advice but when it comes to domestic legislation and not sensitive nationalsecurity affairs , the names and the advice of outside consultants and lobbyists should be discoverable according to law how s this for a practical principle do n't use a sledgehammer to swat a gnat the supreme court , courageously and at some cost , did its bit for the bush administration s electoral legitimacy it should not now be called upon at reelection time to erect a high barrier to finding out who is advising whom about the public s business behind closed doors beyond this case , even when it comes to federal officials , the argument that only secrecy ensures candor is specious presidents record and blab speechwriters remember and tell all most advisers want their private advice to become known when , in a memoir , i protected a colleague by not mentioning his unpopular advice in an oval office meeting , he objected furiously to having been left out of history if freedom is the word bush and cheney want as the hallmark of their administration , they should begin with freedom of information

people always think i'm some 50yearold black woman , the singer joss stone said recently this , of course , would not be worth noting if ms stone were anywhere near 50 or anywhere near black but with her peachesandcream complexion and long blond hair , ms stone , 16 , is a lot more britney than whitney that is , until she begins to sing husky , preternaturally mature , her voice sounds as if it were bred in a black southern church , not manufactured in a studio my manager likes to play a trick on people , ms stone said , her british accent seeming decidedly at odds with her malibu barbie visage he 'll put on my cd , and i 'll hide in another room , and then he 'll bring me in , and everyone is shocked because they 're expecting me to be a black and older at this point , ms stone began to chuckle maybe i look more like a pop singer than i do a soul singer , she said i do n't know veering miles away from the sugary top 40 confections favored by many of her peers , ms stone s debut album , the soul sessions \( scurve records \) , released earlier this month , is a collection of covers , most of them obscure 1970 s soul songs like laura lee s dirty man and bettye swann s victim of a foolish heart betty wright , who had the 1971 hit clean up woman , helped produce ms stone s album the singer s backup band is made up of veterans like latimore , little beaver and timmy thomas trlbound they are not , which suits ms stone just fine i like some of the pop stuff , she said , but it does n't touch me like soul does at a recent show at joe s pub in the east village , she sang of heartache and betrayal , torrid love affairs and busted unions , experiences that ms stone , given her tender age , is expected to know little about her rendition of the 1975 isley brothers hit for the love of you prompted one audience member , karen st hilaire , to wail , sing it girl ! she sings like someone who has really experienced life , ms st hilaire later said of ms stone s performance , and it s surprising because it s like , 'what does this girl know \? ' ms stone is growing used to this reaction everyone seems to think that you have to be a certain age or come from a certain place to feel pain , she said trust me , i have emotions i'm 16 i'm a teenager emotions are so much bigger now ms stone , who was born joscelyn eve stoker in dover , england \( my label did n't think stoker was strong enough \) , recalls a notsodistant childhood filled with music , most of it american soul and rb one of the first albums i owned was aretha franklin s greatest hits , she said , beaming i played it over and over i loved it two years ago , on a whim , she auditioned for the bbc television talent show star for a night only 14 , she sang aretha franklin s natural woman and won soon after , she was signed to scurve it was all given to me on a plate that s why i feel like i was meant to do it , said ms stone , who still lives with her family in devon , england \( her mother is her comanager \) it s not that i do n't work hard , but there are people that go to audition after audition and have n't gotten to this point i know i'm blessed some have suggested that more than talent , the blessing of a face worthy of a neutrogena clean and clear campaign is what has helped propel her fledgling career girls who sing as well as she does are a dime a dozen on 'amateur night at the apollo , ' but blond hair and a british accent makes her a marketer s dream , said elizabeth mendez berry , a contributing editor at honey magazine , aimed at young black women ms stone acknowledged that her looks may have helped her along the way i suppose if i was 100 million pounds , i would n't have gotten a record deal , she said but none of that should matter it s supposed to be about the music it should n't have come to the point that everything is so visual in some ways , ms stone argued , her skin color could be viewed as a hindrance i 've had a lot of people say to me , 'you 'll never get on black radio or urban radio , ' and i'm like , 'i 'll get on every single station that i want , thank you very much , ' she said defiantly when people say things like that , it makes me want to fight even more photos from left , joss stone with betty wright and gwen mccrae of the miami soul all stars , performing at joe s pub on sept 17 \( photo by jack vartoogian for the new york times \) \( pg e6 \) joss stone , an english teenager whose musical roots are 70 s soul \( photo by michael nagle for the new york times \) \( pg e1 \)
the ailey ii company can be counted on to deliver highenergy dancing made even more electric by the push of youthful ambition and this junior troupe of the alvin ailey american dance theater delivered just that in a performance last month at aaron davis hall at city college in harlem but the most memorable moments of the evening came at the start , in opening comments by sylvia waters and judith jamison , the directors , respectively , of ailey ii and the senior company ms jamison talked off the cuff of the fierce technicians the audience was about to see and the remarkable woman who has brought out in them their sense of responsibility she was speaking , with her usual deceptively laidback cheerfulness , of ms waters , who then moved to the microphone , put on her glasses and read her welcoming comments it was quite a sight two women , one big and bold and the other small and contained , who began their association with alvin ailey many years ago as fiercely intense young dancers themselves today , they help to run one of the most successful dance companies in america , a terrifyingly efficient 155 million enterprise that is scheduled to move into a new building of its own next year but there is a poignant paradox at the heart of that success ailey , who died in 1989 , was the most unlikely of empire builders filled with a crippling sense of failure about himself and all his endeavors , he persisted somehow in creating an institution that is not only thriving but has made an unignorable case for the skill and artistry of black dancers and choreographers and for the vitality of black american cultural traditions even at the height of his fame , ailey insisted on being himself , broadcasting his selfdoubts loudly and with funny , endearing gusto one of my favorite memories of that big , immensely private yet lovable man occurred during an interview in the cafeteria of this newspaper i asked him something about revelations , which he had choreographed in 1960 , at the start of his career ailey flung his head down on the table , moaning 'oh , 'rev , ' 'rev' ! ' so loudly that heads reared and turned a little fearfully in our direction would he never be rid of the curse of revelations \? the almost immediate success of the dance , now a classic beloved throughout the world , had hung over him forever after he would never , ailey said often to whoever was listening , be able to equal that early masterwork and in many ways he did not , though even the excerpts of later works presented in the ailey ii program suggest that he came much closer than he and most recorders of dance history have suggested much of ailey s behavior , from his work in the studio to his fascination with just about everyone he came into contact with , was accompanied by such moans and groans i doubt he expected them to be taken all that seriously ailey also insisted on leading his private life as he wished , or perhaps was driven to , even when its impact on his professional life was disastrous just a few blocks away from the new ailey headquarters on west 55th street is a sterile modern apartment building in which he was essentially sequestered after an arrest and treatment for drug addiction ailey was , as the dancer carmen de lavallade put it at a memorial service at the cathedral of st john the divine , so easy to break , and yet so strong many of those in charge of the ailey empire today including ms jamison , ms waters and masazumi chaya danced long years for him but the loyalty runs deeper than gratitude for transformative roles and the ability to earn a living performing in a popular dance company why had she decided to throw in her lot with ailey , i casually asked an early company member during a shared cab ride one night alvin gave us all our chance , she murmured incredulously who else was there to dance for \? there had been other black moderndance companies , certainly , and even a few shortlived black ballet groups but none seemed to have the staying power of the ailey troupe , which came along a few years after a resurgence of black visibility in dance and theater in the 1950 s ailey was fortunate in his timing one bit of luck that helped put him on the map was being chosen , with ms de lavallade , to lead a 13week tour of southeast asia in 1962 initiated by the state department his was not the first group of black performers enlisted to serve as goodwill ambassadors in that terrible period of american social history but the tour was a tremendous success , and for many years the ailey company would be far better known abroad than at home ailey took his responsibility seriously the cultural heritage of the american negro is one of america s richest treasures , ailey once wrote in a statement that still defines the mission that has driven the ailey institution from his roots as a slave , the american negro sometimes sorrowing , sometimes jubilant but always hopeful has touched , illuminated , and influenced the most remote preserves of world civilization i and my dance theater celebrate this trembling beauty photo robert halley , foreground , and members of the ailey ii company performing the tyner project with members of the mccoy tyner quintet \( andrea mohin the new york times \)
with none of the fanfare that greeted the reopening of the nearby world trade center path station but with plenty of grateful travelers , the vesey street bridge opened yesterday at the northwest corner of ground zero the bridge , 220 feet long , offers pedestrians a new route more than 20 feet above west street , which is really more of a highway \( route 9a , in fact \) than a city street it has always been a formidable barrier between battery park city and the rest of downtown , but now it is crossed by four bridges from chambers street to rector street , a distance of less than a mile while dignitaries filled the new station , the new bridge quickly filled with walkers , joggers and tourists angling for a new elevated view of the trade center site the bridge crosses the intersection of vesey and west streets diagonally , running from 3 world financial center to the verizon building at 140 west street seen from the ground , it bristles with overlapping corrugated plates , some of them in perforated stainless steel , some in translucent plastic surprisingly , however , the inside of the walkway is reminiscent of a 19thcentury train shed , with a gently arched roof crowned by a skylight elevators and escalators to the bridge should be in place next april , said richard j schmalz , the route 9a project director for the state transportation department , which built the 15 million structure in four months it was designed by stefan dallendorfer and johan bjorkman of earth tech the bridge is expected to be up for five years , as the trade center site is redeveloped work on the other temporary bridge , at rector street , began a month after the trade center was attacked on sept 11 , 2001 built by the state transportation department and the battery park city authority , that bridge opened to pedestrians in march 2002 the bridge was probably the first structure in place to bring back some level of normalcy to residents of the area and the people who work down there , said william sharples of shop sharples holden pasquarelli , the architects the engineers were buro happold though it looks like a single structure , the rector street bridge is actually two independent box trusses side by side , wrapped in an angular skin of galvanized metal slats and a corrugated metal roof a 21stcentury descendant of the covered bridge neighbors did not want it to become a viewing platform for curiosity seekers , so the slats were arrayed randomly , with little space between them , allowing peeks but not panoramas as a result of that design , and the elimination of some lighting to save money , the bridge is fairly dark in contrast , the walkway of the tribeca bridge , at chambers street , is filled with light through glass walls and a glass roof easily the most lyrical of the west street bridges , the tribeca bridge , which is 230 feet long and opened in 1992 , is supported between parallel bowstring trusses these form a great white double arch of steel that serves as a kind of gateway to lower manhattan among the architects who worked on the tribeca bridge was david m childs of skidmore , owings merrill , who is now designing the freedom tower at the trade center site , in an onagainoffagain collaboration with daniel libeskind the south bridge , at liberty street , was built in 1984 and was once one of a pair linked to the world financial center the north bridge was destroyed in the attack and will not be rebuilt both bridges were designed by cesar pelli associates , architects of the world financial center recalling an airport concourse , the south bridge attracts crowds of people to its monumental ninepane windows , which overlook ground zero the window patterns were based on those at the world financial center , said mark shoemaker , who led the design team at the pelli office but the choice of metal paneling was intended to complement the world trade center so its silvery color is truly ghostly , reflecting buildings that are no longer there photo a foot bridge opened at vesey street yesterday , shortening the walk for those who must cross west street and offering a view of ground zero \( photo by ozier muhammad the new york times \)
the substance of style how the rise of aesthetic value is remaking commerce , culture , and consciousness by virginia postrel 237 pp new york harpercollins publishers 2495 you go to the hardware store to buy a simple drawer pull and you 're faced with 1 , 500 options you ca n't install a glass front door because your local design review board has deemed them ugly your son is struggling to master video design for his science class you 're fired because you no longer fit in with the company s aesthetic personality welcome to our aesthetic age , as virginia postrel calls it , where style matters as much as substance and a welldesigned life is no longer the province of the moneyed elite according to postrel , one of the writers of the economic scene column for the new york times , our new era of look and feel is an inevitable sequel to last century s hyperpracticality a confluence of economic and cultural factors from the profligate spending of baby boomers to the shrinking of technology to the mainstreaming of gay culture has conspired to make valuing appearances both affordable and necessary better to look good and be thought gay , she writes , than to look straight and be thought sloppy , ignorant , ugly or old yet the underlying factor , postrel argues , is biological well before botox and design districts entered our lives , we were planting flower beds and painting our nails our desire for aesthetic pleasure , postrel writes , is rooted in fundamental , biologically based human wants the substance of style is not the first book to argue that the academic left s denunciation of consumer culture as market driven has no basis in human behavior but it s the first to use our recent outbreak of aesthetic consciousness as direct evidence unfortunately , postrel is not a subtle arguer her first book , the future and its enemies , bluntly divided the world into those who embrace progress and those who impede it here , her sweeping celebration of our increasingly appearanceobsessed world refuses to distinguish the good from the bad and the ugly postrel s main argument is that surfaces are neither frivolous nor inherently dangerous but rather reactions as valid a part of our nature as the capacity to speak or reason moreover , aesthetics has enormous positive effects , from helping us reinvent ourselves to helping us relax given the battering that beauty has received in recent years , a defense of this sort is more than a bit refreshing but postrel goes on to argue that the corporate world never uses surfaces to manipulate or deceive \( exposure , not manipulation , creates demand \) and that people no longer do anything just to gain status or heed trends rather , personal expression , personal imagination and initiative motivate everything from wearing dreadlocks to buying 400 toilet brushes if only postrel seems to think that conceding a market role in consumer behavior would undermine her biological argument it would n't madison avenue best manipulates what s deeply ingrained take the recent explosion in anti aging potions and procedures biology the male desire for fertilelooking females is certainly one explanation so is advancing technology but so is an industry that has well learned how to exploit biology and feed on insecurities postrel will have none of this pesky cynicism she sees only a world getting more and more attractive so what if gallup polled people in the last presidential election on which candidate was better looking \? check out this cool limegreen pager ! in the end , postrel undermines her main argument when she shears aesthetics of objective value if you like something , she contends , then it has aesthetic value notions like good design are elitist and so last century yet if elements of aesthetic attraction are rooted in human biology , how can judgment be entirely subjective \? if psychologists have found patterns of symmetry and proportion , consistency and surprise , that cross cultures and ages , why would n't those patterns translate into basic aesthetic principles \? postrel seems to think that accepting even a few universal principles would not only bring back a single standard of beauty \( it would n't \) but also preclude individual choice , a strange idea to come from a former editor of reason , a libertarian magazine as the libertarian godmother ayn rand well demonstrated in the fountainhead , taste is subjective great taste is not the democratization of style does n't require the democratization of brilliance postrel is on a lot firmer ground when dealing with design boundaries that line where the cultural meets the political more than 80 percent of american cities and towns , for example , now have some form of design review for buildings , usually on aesthetic grounds alone in portland , ore , you can no longer build a new home whose front is less than 15 percent windows and doors or whose garage takes up more than half the facade the goal of the ordinance , a local official said , was to put a stop to the ugly and stupid houses that we see going up a couple in another city objected to a neighbors' swing set because they could see it from their bathroom window \( we like to think of your yard as an extension of ours , they explained \) as postrel says , these openended comments are a long way from seemingly legitimate rules like hide the garbage cans real design pluralism , she argues , would entail a collection of small , selfgoverning districts with their own design rules if you do n't like the rules , you can move in her final chapter , postrel hits the thoughtful tone that is sorely missing from the rest of the book the more our bodies become subject to design to willful aesthetic control rather than random chance the more responsibility we face not only for who we are and how we act but for how we appear that prospect can be scary what if standards keep rising \? are we doomed to spend all our time and energy in an impossible quest for beauty \? she thinks not the beautiful people of south beach do n't represent the future because most of us wo n't make that cost benefit calculation achieving a healthy balance between substance and style , as postrel recommends , requires more reflective guidance than this book provides but the substance of style does go a long way toward moving beauty out of the welter of political theory and into the realm of cultural reality to tweak coco chanel , while fashions \( political and otherwise \) may change , the essential elements of beauty , for better or worse , are n't going anywhere
newark , april 5 after spending half a lifetime taking care of other people s children , it was getting harder for ann worrell to take care of herself she was almost 74 as she neared the end of her third decade as a foster parent with the new jersey division of youth and family services , the state s child welfare agency and , according to medical records and interviews with friends , her ailments were many arthritis often got the best of her she needed a walker to get around she could often be confused and forgetful almost all of this was known to the child welfare agency its internal memos made that clear agency officials were so concerned about her ability to continue caring for children that they warned that no more than four children none under 6 years old be placed in her home , records show but when 4yearold shakeem spaights came to live in ms worrell s colonial style home in the south ward of newark on march 9 , 1999 , he became the fifth child , and the fourth 5 or younger , in her care thirtythree days later , shakeem was dead the boy , who had been shuttled through four foster homes in the three months before he was placed with ms worrell , had been doing back flips on a couch on a sunday afternoon when he struck his head , according to police records the other children in the home , according to investigators , later said that ms worrell had been napping when the accident happened the children told how ms worrell sent shakeem to the bathroom to vomit when he complained of dizziness after the fall , and how she asked them to help move shakeem to the sofa when she found him lying motionless near the toilet an hour or more passed before help was called , records show in that time , the children said , ms worrell cooked dinner , all the while comforting the other children , who kept insisting that shakeem , face down on the couch , was seriously hurt he s sleeping , the children later testified ms worrell had told them shakeem was cremated 13 days later , and his foster care case file , never made public , was put away but now , with the state s child welfare agency once again under fire after faheem williams , 7 , was found bruised , emaciated and dead in a newark basement in january , the details of shakeem s short life , and his agonizing final hours , lay bare the troubles plaguing perhaps the most distressed corner of the agency its foster care system new jersey s number of available foster parents , already far smaller than the need , is declining further , a state spokesman confirmed as a result , state workers themselves conceded , children sometimes remain with dangerous parents , or are routinely placed in foster homes that are less than optimal simply because of the lack of options and in those homes , the agency s records show , the rates of abuse and neglect are three times the maximum acceptable standard set by national law as a result , according to agency records , children taken into foster care , particularly those identified as having physical or emotional problems , often are shuffled through a disturbing number of homes interviews and records show that shakeem s journey through the child welfare system , beginning nearly at birth and continuing until his death , subjected him to the consequences of virtually all of the failings of the state s foster care operation the agency first gained custody of him when he was only a few months old , after his mother admitted beating him he was returned to her when he was 3 , but months later , when he complained of being sexually abused by an acquaintance of his mother , he was back in foster care he would eventually be placed in a total of eight foster homes in his four years in violation of the state s own recommendation that ms worrell care for no more than four foster children , her house became shakeem s eighth and final home the child welfare agency investigated the death , determined ms worrell had been negligent , and eventually removed her as a foster parent the essex county prosecutor s office convened a grand jury but brought no charges against her shakeem s mother has now sued the agency , and her medical experts show that shakeem s death might have been caused in part by an overdose of pain medication prosecutors , though , say there is not enough evidence to pursue overdose as the cause of the boy s death state officials cited the pending litigation and would not comment on shakeem s case ms worrell , who told investigators after the boy s death that she had acted promptly to get him help , lives in a northern new jersey nursing home friends describe her health in steep decline , and she did not respond to repeated messages passed through friends requesting an interview but to many experts , caseworkers and state officials , the details of shakeem s case pieced together through court records , grand jury transcripts , copies of police interviews , agency documents and interviews do not come as a shock a state panel appointed in 1997 by christie whitman , the governor at the time , concluded that the foster care system was deeply troubled four years later , citing little progress , children s rights inc , a national child welfare advocacy group , sued the state s division of youth and family services over its foster care bureaucracy the group is now in settlement talks with the state while gov james e mcgreevey has pledged an overhaul of the entire agency
tbilisi , georgia , nov 28 it just seemed the natural thing to do as discredited officials from the old government began leaving their posts this week , the victors in georgia s popular uprising began appointing friends and relatives to their positions a fatherinlaw of one became the tbilisi city prosecutor the brother of another leader s husband got the coveted job of customs director a crony was appointed first deputy general prosecutor that is how government jobs are distributed in georgia , and a culture of corruption this thoroughgoing is hard to uproot on the latest annual survey of 133 nations compiled by the anticorruption group transparency international , georgia was just five places from the bottom in its list of perceived corruption local goodgovernment groups were stymied under the former president , eduard a shevardnadze , who was forced to resign a week ago now they see a chance to push for change when some of these independent groups got wind of the new appointments , a delegation demanded a meeting with the three leaders of georgia s new interim government we said , 'remove them tomorrow or we 'll start a huge campaign , ' said david usupashvili , the head of an anticorruption commission 'you must not do this just after the revolution' abashed , the three leaders agreed it was , after all , these same groups that helped bring the new leaders to power a week ago mr usupashvili said he had drawn two lessons from the encounter the first was the realization that the public had gained a voice the second , he said , was , these people need to be closely watched most people here believe that although corruption under the old government was crippling , mr shevardnadze was not venal he has not been accused , for example , of hiding billions in swiss banks as other corrupt leaders have but the breadth of corruption makes the challenge of rooting it out more difficult georgians honed their black markets during the austerity of soviet times when they became skilled at beating the system , wheeling , dealing , hustling and getting rich breaking the rules was the smart thing to do it was the people who crossed at the red light who got ahead by the time it gained independence in 1991 , georgia had become a scofflaw state when he took power in 1992 , mr shevardnadze , who had been foreign minister during the last years of the soviet union , was schooled in the ways of his country according to a number of experts , he harnessed the widespread corruption as a method of government they said he apportioned favors , bought loyalty and used the criminal secrets of his associates as a sort of blackmail as the years passed , criminal syndicates flourished , and laws and regulations were ignored , those experts say , and shady deals replaced the normal workings of state , so that government institutions withered in 1999 , the united nations surveyed the nation s school system as a representative branch of government to measure national corruption , said levan ramishvili , director of the liberty institute , a local human rights group the survey found that of every 100 lari budgeted by the government , only 20 reached the intended destination \( the lari , the georgian currency , is worth a little under 50 cents \) first , the survey found , the local governor skimmed off 40 percent then the education department diverted 20 percent more then the school principal took 20 percent for himself school operations got what was left over schools are a good example of the texture of life here teachers supplement their small salaries , which often go unpaid , by requiring their pupils to take private lessons and pay for them then in the universities , which , students say , sometimes demand thousands of dollars in bribes for admission , professors insist that students buy textbooks that they have published and bring them for autographs as proof , outsiders say that s the atmosphere in the universities , which are supposed to have the highest moral standards , mr usupashvili said there s no sense in fighting against police corruption when a professor in a university is forcing students to take private lessons and to buy their textbooks if someone important calls a professor and says , this is my relative you 've got to give him special marks , mr usupashvili said , only 5 of 100 professors would refuse three years ago mr shevardnadze commissioned an anticorruption action plan that was published under his name and contained the following exhortation if we fail to avoid this national disaster , if we fail to cure the nation , public and state from the horrible , poisoning malady of corruption , georgians as a civilized nation and georgia as an independent , democratic state will have no future mr usupashvili , an author of the report , said none of its recommendations were carried out photo university students demonstrated on thursday in tbilisi , the georgian capital corruption had run so deep it included the education system \( photo by agence francepresse getty images \)
baghdad , iraq , april 12 the national museum of iraq recorded a history of civilizations that began to flourish in the fertile plains of mesopotamia more than 7 , 000 years ago but once american troops entered baghdad in sufficient force to topple saddam hussein s government this week , it took only 48 hours for the museum to be destroyed , with at least 170 , 000 artifacts carried away by looters the full extent of the disaster that befell the museum came to light only today , as the frenzied looting that swept much of the capital over the previous three days began to ebb as fires in a dozen government ministries and agencies began to burn out , and as looters tired of pillaging in the 90degree heat , museum officials reached the hotels where foreign journalists were staying along the eastern bank of the tigris river they brought word of what is likely to be reckoned as one of the greatest cultural disasters in recent middle eastern history a full accounting of what has been lost may take weeks or months the museum had been closed during much of the 1990 s , and as with many iraqi institutions , its operations were cloaked in secrecy under mr hussein so what officials told journalists today may have to be adjusted as a fuller picture comes to light it remains unclear whether some of the museum s priceless gold , silver and copper antiquities , some of its ancient stone and ceramics and perhaps some of its fabled bronzes and goldoverlaid ivory , had been locked away for safekeeping elsewhere before the looting , or seized for private display in one of mr hussein s myriad palaces what was beyond contest today was that the 28 galleries of the museum and vaults with huge steel doors guarding storage chambers that descend floor after floor into unlighted darkness had been completely ransacked officials with crumpled spirits fought back tears and anger at american troops , as they ran down an inventory of the most storied items that they said had been carried away by the thousands of looters who poured into the museum after daybreak on thursday and remained until dusk on friday , with only one intervention by american forces , lasting about half an hour , at lunchtime on thursday nothing remained , museum officials said , at least nothing of real value , from a museum that had been regarded by archaeologists and other specialists as perhaps the richest of all such institutions in the middle east as examples of what was gone , the officials cited a solid gold harp from the sumerian era , which began about 3360 bc and started to crumble about 2000 bc another item on their list of looted antiquities was a sculptured head of a woman from uruk , one of the great sumerian cities , dating from about the same era , and a collection of gold necklaces , bracelets and earrings , also from the sumerian dynasties and also at least 4 , 000 years old but an itembyitem inventory of the most valued pieces carried away by the looters hardly seemed to capture the magnitude of what had occurred more powerful , in its way , was the action of one museum official in hurrying away through the piles of smashed ceramics and torn books and burnedout torches of rags soaked in gasoline that littered the museum s corridors to find the glossy catalog of an exhibition of silk road civilizations that was held in japan s ancient capital of nara in 1988 turning to 50 pages of items lent by the iraqi museum for the exhibition , he said none of the antiquities pictured remained after the looting they included ancient stone carvings of bulls and kings and princesses copper shoes and cuneiform tablets tapestry fragments and ivory figurines of goddesses and women and nubian porters friezes of soldiers and ancient seals and tablets on geometry and ceramic jars and urns and bowls , all dating back at least 2 , 000 years , some more than 5 , 000 years all gone , all gone , he said all gone in two days an iraqi archaeologist who has taken part in the excavation of some of the country s 10 , 000 sites , raid abdul ridhar muhammad , said he went into the street in the karkh district , a short distance from the eastern bank of the tigris , about 1 pm on thursday to find american troops to quell the looting by that time , he and other museum officials said , the several acres of museum grounds were overrun by thousands of men , women and children , many of them armed with rifles , pistols , axes , knives and clubs , as well as pieces of metal torn from the suspensions of wrecked cars the crowd was storming out of the complex carrying antiquities on hand carts , bicycles and wheelbarrows and in boxes looters stuffed their pockets with smaller items mr muhammad said that he had found an american abrams tank in museum square , about 300 yards away , and that five marines had followed him back into the museum and opened fire above the looters' heads that drove several thousand of the marauders out of the museum complex in minutes , he said , but when the tank crewmen left about 30 minutes later , the looters returned
the yankees had been humbled by a pitcher making his third major league start and a team that is 32 1 2 games behind them in the american league east but rather than silence and stares , the atmosphere in the locker room was not all that different than it might be after a divisionclinching game the eight consecutive victories that preceded the yankees' 52 loss to the tampa bay devil rays yesterday at yankee stadium soothed the pain of defeat , and the rookie hazing after the game set a celebratory tone jos contreras , who endeared himself to his team and his manager while getting a nodecision with seven strong innings , wore the outfit that had been placed in his locker a white fur coat and hat over purple spandex pants that flared over zebrastriped platform shoes next to him was hideki matsui , who had played despite a painful bruise above his left knee sustained saturday and who was now decked out in a widebrimmed faux leopard skin hat , matching pants and jacket , and platform shoes with lights that blinked as he walked bernie williams , who moments before had spoken solemnly of the need to maintain intensity to the end , finished dressing in his own impeccably tailored suit and started out of the locker room before spotting contreras , stopping and smiling contreras , matsui and two other rookies , the september callups michel hern ndez and jorge de paula , were part of an annual ritual that accompanies the final road trip of the season they were paraded to the bus and sent to sign autographs for screaming fans while the veterans got it on videotape it might have been hard to picture a week ago , after the first two games of the 11game homestand the yankees were reeling after two onesided losses to the boston red sox , who were suddenly a game and a half behind them for the division lead but the yankees recovered last sunday to beat boston , won the next afternoon against toronto , then beat the detroit tigers and the devil rays three times each now the yankees are five and a half games ahead of the red sox , who also lost yesterday , with 13 games to play the yankees were able to look at the positives , contreras s pitching in particular we ca n't complain , manager joe torre said we had good starting pitching today over all , when you consider you lose the first two games of a homestand and lose the last one and you win eight in between , that s pretty good derek jeter , whose return to the lineup last sunday after missing five straight games with a ribcage injury coincided with the eightgame winning streak , said we 've been playing well , pitching well , swinging the bats we 're starting to come around we 're probably playing as good as we have been yeah , you can tighten up some things , but i think over all we 're playing well although the tigers and the devil rays have the worst records in the al , jeter said it does n't matter who you play you still have to win the yankees did not win yesterday , mainly because their bats were cooled by the righthander doug waechter waechter , a 22yearold rookie , took a 30 record into the game , including a twohit shutout in his first major league start he did not win yesterday , but he pitched five solid innings before surrendering a tworun homer to jeter contreras did better , scattering two runs and five hits over seven innings rocco baldelli hit a solo home run in fifth inning , which broke up the scoreless duel in the seventh , marlon anderson hit a leadoff double and julio lugo poked a soft line drive past a drawnin infield to tie the score at 22 the devil rays scored three unearned runs in the eighth inning against felix heredia and antonio osuna after enrique wilson s throwing error with two out and none on allowed the rally to get started the yankees pointed to contreras s pitching as what they would take away from this game he was really good , torre said it s not only that we 're finding about him he s the one that has to find out what s effective for him today should have helped him but the yankees do not want to get too content yet i 'll feel good when the regular season is over and we get a chance to play in the postseason , williams said that s when i 'll get fired up right now it s a lot of pressure we 're expected to do well it s just one of those things , you ca n't feel too good we 're starting to get some consistency out there obviously , our pitching has been great i think we 're in a pretty good position to make our run inside pitch hideki matsui , who collided with tampa bay pitcher joe kennedy on saturday , was in the lineup despite wearing a wrap on his left leg he did not score from first on a thirdinning double by ruben sierra , raising questions about his health he preserved his streak of consecutive games played , which dates from 1994 in japan and totals 149 games this season and 1 , 399 games over all photos tampa bay s lou piniella and rocco baldelli after yesterday s victory \( photo by ozier muhammad the

tom rotherham , the chief executive of the accounting firm rsm mcgladrey , calls a halt to any management meeting there if a cellphone rings he throws up his hands and demands 50 from the perpetrator everyone laughs , and i say 'i'm not kidding where s the 50 \? ' said mr rotherham , who instituted the policy two years ago at the company , which is based in bloomington , minn if you want to disrupt your life , fine but do n't disrupt everybody else s short of getting drunk at the office holiday party or whipping the boss at golf , there may be no faster way to anger a top executive these days than to let your cellphone trill during an important meeting and executives are cracking down on such interruptions , which they regard as both etiquette gaffes and as drains on time and money although many companies require employees to carry cellphones on the road , they are also curbing their use in the office nearly 60 million americans take cellphones to work , and use them for 4 of every 10 calls they make or receive on the job , according to idc , a research firm based in framingham , mass a cellphone has gone from a symbol of status to a device of scorn , said ian campbell , the chief executive of nucleus research inc , a firm in wellesley , mass , that studies technologies' returns on investment when mr campbell went on a toplevel business trip to vail , colo , recently , he ordered his staff back at headquarters to send text messages to his cellphone rather than calling him otherwise , he said , i would have been shunned by everybody in vail in three days of meetings with apparently likeminded executives , he did n't hear a cellphone ring once the cellphone revolution has ushered in daunting social challenges in 1997 , just 20 percent of americans owned a cellphone , but 51 percent , or 143 million people , do today , according to the gartner group no public place or event is safe from them , and efforts to rein them in from glares of disapproval to outright bans have had limited success in the workplace , however , senior executives have more influence , and some may be taking action because they 're old enough to remember a quieter world about 45 percent of people who are 45 and older say they are bothered by cellphone use in the office , compared with 28 percent of those aged 18 to 44 , according to a 2001 internet survey of 800 adults by the consumer electronics association gregory fitzgerald , vice president for marketing at traqwireless inc , a company in austin , tex , that tracks mobiledevice use within corporations , says 30 percent of his firm s 85 fortune 1000 clients have policies on such devices companies are trying to balance the competitive advantage of mobile communications with the disruptions and annoyances associated with them , mr fitzgerald said at rsm mcgladrey , some mobile workers are issued cellphones , and all employees are taught that responding to clients quickly is paramount still , mr rotherham does not contend that cellphone intrusions are good business it gets back to two issues , he said one is efficiency and the other is rudeness he said he collected 150 from cellphone scofflaws during the first year of his policy the money was used to buy a managers' lunch nothing was collected the second year i do n't know how you can get any work done if you 're always on call , said mr rotherham , who carries a cellphone only when he travels at what point are you so connected that you become disconnected \? his 50 fine technically applies only to meetings of the firm s seven senior managers or 35 firm managers , or those at which he is present but his unwritten policy has influenced the firm , as deborah ely lawrence , its director of corporate communications , found last july during her first month on the job when her cellphone rang during a highlevel management meeting , she recalled , participants booed and shouted , fine her 50 ! later , a colleague quietly advised her to keep her phone on vibrate during meetings sometimes now , i say to people that i may be getting a call , said ms ely lawrence , who was forgiven her first transgression but , not , she added , if i'm going to be in a meeting with my manager employees grumbled and laughed in 2000 when alan goldsworthy , chief executive of applix inc , a software maker in westborough , mass , instituted a 5 fine if a cellphone rang during a meeting and 1aminute fine for being late to one that year , he collected nearly 900 from the policy for a local group that supports abused women last year , he collected just 60 i accomplished what i was trying to accomplish , said mr goldsworthy , who has paid fines for tardiness but none for cellphone infractions i was trying to get people focused on what we were doing will restrictions work \? some workplace experts have their doubts it s sort of the wild , wild west thing , saying you ca n't bring your guns into the bar , said robbie blinkoff , principal anthropologist for the contextbased research group in baltimore , which does ethnographic research for corporations what s really needed is helping people to learn to use these technologies and as more wireless devices spread through offices , cellphones are n't the only distraction by 2010 , half of office workers will carry two or more wireless devices , according to the gartner group sometimes , silent devices can be just as distracting as beeps and rings , as mark a stiffler , chief executive officer of synygy inc , found recently mr stiffler has been so strict about banning cellphones from the offices of synygy , a software and consulting firm he founded in conshohocken , pa , that mobilephone users now step outside , pariahlike , with the smokers but a month ago , when the workplace turned wireless , mr stiffler found himself back to square 1 it was becoming an issue that people were sitting in meetings with their laptops on and doing email , mr stiffler said we just instituted a ban on using your laptop in a meeting someone has to set the standard photo tom rotherham , chief of rsm mcgladrey , an accounting firm in bloomington , minn , fines employees whose cellphones ring at meetings \( dawn villella for the new york times \)
todd zeile has heard the grumbling in dugouts around baseball the yankees get every call in yankee stadium the ball always bounces the yankees' way and every time the yankees stock up on talent during the season , you hear sarcastic shows of emotion , zeile admitted zeile is quick to add that he never indulged in those sour grapes himself , and now he has been rewarded with a tour of duty with the rich and talented and dominating and perpetual yankees he was in the lineup yesterday as the yankees beat toronto , 40 , to improve their record to 12 victories and 3 losses the yankees have not won a world series in two years now , but they are the champions all the same they have now tied the best start in the history of the club just when the underclass of the north american baseball world thought the yankee domination could not possibly get worse , this pitching staff looks like it could win , oh , let s be conservative , 120 or 130 games this season the scary part is that the yankees are not even getting much from about 50 million worth of their payroll , what with derek jeter , mariano rivera and steve karsay injured and sterling hitchcock and jos contreras hardly contributing for the yankees , 50 million is a mere offering to placate the baseball gods the yankees are loaded , in cable income and in the dugout jeter gets hurt \? erick almonte hits a home run in his first start \( the young shortstop does look a little shaky right now , but the yanks can carry him a long way \) the outfield looks a little shaky \? hideki matsui comes along with professional skills and even a wry sense of humor some starters may not last forever \? jeff weaver threw 120 pitches yesterday to show that the near future may be very much like the recent past some people think none of this is fair even some people in opposing dugouts think it is n't fair i always felt you were playing more than that particular team , said zeile , now with his 10th team , making it sound as if billy martin were chasing windblown popups and elston howard were hitting one into the gap , and so on and so on zeile and his fellow migr robin ventura say they never resented the yankees' domination when they were on the other side rather , they respected the yankees for what they were and what they did you look at them , ventura said yesterday on his day off they had a lot of players come up through the system jeter , bernie , mariano , jorge they saw something in tino to replace mattingly and a lot of it has to do with joe \( full names are not necessary for this cast of characters , now part of the everexpanding yankee legend \) ventura came along with the white sox while the yankees were down in the early 90 s by the time he got to the world series with the mets in 2000 , the yankees were back to demoralizing everybody who came along we felt we could play with them , ventura said , recalling bobby valentine s scrappy band way back when that hopeful state was dissipated in the first game the mets had a 32 lead with one out in the bottom of the ninth , and armando benitez had a 12 count on paul o'neill , who then obsessively fouled off four pitches we started to think , 'we really need to get this guy out , ventura recalled instead , o'neill walked on the 10th pitch , scored the tying run and the yankees won the world series in five games that one atbat by paul set a tone , ventura recalled they have the end result it is a collection of doing things right the yankees' new dynasty is not merely about money but about making the right choices the mets let ventura and zeile get away , spent foolishly and are now looking like 1962 ineptitude at 2003 prices meanwhile , ventura and now zeile have moved seamlessly into the yankee clubhouse , just like dozens of other lifers when they won the bronx lottery for a season or two everybody wants to wear the uniform , unless you 're a dyedinthewool red sox fan or something , zeile said you feel you are fortunate to wear the uniform most teams just ca n't break the barrier , zeile added there s a mental edge the latest example came on this homestand , now ended we were down , 50 , then it was 55 , ventura said , talking about wednesday s game the yankees ultimately lost , but yesterday they dominated it has happened before it seems to be happening again photo todd zeile \( barton silverman \)
moscow , sept 1 it was provocative , as modern art often is but few of those involved could have foreseen just how provocative it would become when the sakharov museum here opened an exhibition of paintings and sculptures in january under the title caution ! religion four days after the jan 14 opening , six men from a russian orthodox church came to the museum s exhibition hall and sacked it , defacing many of the 45 works with spray paint and destroying others sacrilege , one of them scrawled on the wall the police came and quickly arrested the men , but their actions described either as heroism or hooliganism began a highly charged debate not only over the state of freedom of expression in russia today but also over the evergrowing influence of the orthodox church priests denounced the museum named after the sovietera physicist and dissident andrei d sakharov church members began a letterwriting campaign defending the attackers somewhere along the way , the tables turned on the museum , its director and the exhibition s artists the lower house of parliament passed a resolution condemning the museum and the exhibition s organizers the criminal charges against four of the six men were dropped early on for lack of evidence even though they had been detained inside the building then on aug 11 , with several hundred orthodox believers holding a vigil outside , a court here threw out the charges against the others , mikhail lyukshin and anatoly zyakin , saying they had been unlawfully prosecuted the court made it clear that an investigation should continue not against those who attacked the exhibit , but against the museum itself the museum is now the enemy of the people , said its director , yuri v samodurov the furor over the exhibition has thrust into opposition two groups that had suffered together during seven decades of state ideology and atheism in the 12 years since the soviet union collapsed , both artists and religious believers have flourished in a new russia in this case , though , each side accuses the other of exploiting russia s new freedom to infringe on its rights this freedom opened the gates so that thick streams of dirt are flooding all around , the rev aleksandr shargunov , one of the church s most outspoken conservatives , said of the postsoviet society the church is a very narrow stream of clean water the men who attacked the exhibit are members of his church in moscow , st nikolai in pyzhi some of them work there , and father aleksandr organized the campaign for their defense and against the museum he compared the exhibition to a rape or a terrorist act for a believer , he said , this sacrilege is equivalent to the destruction of a church , which is what happened in the near past in russia the museum , dedicated to mr sakharov s legacy , regularly presents exhibitions intended to cause debate , including subjects like the soviet legacy , human rights and the war in chechnya never before has one provoked such an outcry the exhibition s works all addressed religion , but mr samodurov said the theme was not antireligious as much as anticlerical some of the artists themselves are orthodox believers , he said , and the exhibition was not meant to offend one sculpture , by alina gurevich , that offended nonetheless depicted a church made of vodka bottles , a pointed reference to the tax exemption the church received in the 1990 s to sell alcohol a poster by aleksandr kosolapov , a russianborn american whose previous work has satirized symbols of the soviet and russian state , depicted jesus on a cocacola advertisement this is my blood , it said in english another work was a large icon covering by alisa zrazhevskaya , which took its title from the second commandment , thou shalt not carve idols unto thee , and left a hole for a viewer s head , hand and bible like a carnival placard gady , or vipers , was painted on it the works are now in the local prosecutor s office , and most of the artists have been called in for questioning the exhibition s curator , arutyun zulumyan , an armenian , has gone into hiding the museum s lawyers received notice the week before last that a commission of experts had been formed to decide whether the exhibit incited interethnic or interreligious hatred , which is a crime in the russian criminal code mr samodurov said he feared that the outcome was predetermined because none of those appointed , he said , were experts in modern art if charged and convicted , the exhibition s organizers could face 7 , 500 to 11 , 600 in fines , three years of probation or two to four years in prison another artist , anna alchuk , said in an interview that her work an arrangement of four medallions she found while moving to a new apartment was intended to explore the religious belief in personal salvation she recalled that in soviet times such a theme would have been strictly forbidden she wonders whether it still is there are many things written in the constitution freedom of speech , freedom of religion but we 've seen how they exist in reality , she said aleksandr b chuyev , a member of parliament and , like mr sakharov , a dissident during the soviet period , disagreed closely allied with the orthodox church , he sponsored the resolution calling on prosecutors to investigate the museum he defended the men who destroyed the exhibition , saying they had acted within their rights to prevent a crime democracy , he said , necessitates respect for the beliefs of others there are acceptable boundaries within which it is possible to express an opinion , he said , as long as it does n't affect the rights of orthodox believers photos two of the works damaged at the caution ! religion exhibition in moscow were a icon covering , on which the word meaning vipers was painted , and a cocacola ad bearing the face of jesus at left , yuri v samodurov , museum director , next to a poster with the face of andrei d sakharov

following are excerpts from a news conference yesterday by maj gen michael c kostelnik , nasa s deputy associate administrator for the space shuttle program , as recorded by the new york times fuller excerpts are online at nytimescom columbia q general , have you found the debris in arizona , california and new mexico \? any of those reports tiles \? a it s not clear what the material is i think we have had some email correspondence that potentially looks like it could be either that or potentially wing material if it is wing material , obviously that would be very important to the investigations so without speculating precisely what it is , the sources were credible enough to cause us to send a nasa team out to take a look and i'm sure that what they find will be reported as soon as it s made available q now that you 've had a chance to take a look at massive telemetry and some of the wreckage , could you go into a little detail about what exactly you hope to learn technically from the wreckage itself \? has any of that wreckage so far included identifiable pieces of the left wing or left fuselage \? a it would be pure speculation on my part , having not been to the debris field myself and i think mr dittemore , yesterday , in his technical analysis , answered many of those questions but certainly early debris early in the flight path , would be critical because that material would obviously be near the start of the event so it would clearly be very important to see the material earliest in the sequence material on the ground toward the end obviously once the catastrophic event has occurred could be less significant to the event but at this time , when we really do not know what the cause or the failure mechanism is , it s very important to acquire as much data as we can unlike aircraft who carry crashsurvivable recorders which provides a lot of data on the ground , nasa receives , because of the instrumentation , a lot of data in flight and of course it takes time to analyze and incorporate that so tomorrow i think you can get a good sense for where the engineering team is in that process q i'm wondering if your review of the history of past flights has indicated to you whether ice or insulation were the greatest cause of debris falls from the external tank and whether you 've ever had any indication in the past of a combination of those two or a peeling of the insulation that might have allowed ice to build up \? a well , any debris , in ascent , is obviously a concern and as mr readdy pointed out yesterday , because of the fuels that are in the external tank , icing is clearly a problem , especially under adverse environmental conditions so there s very close attention paid to ice , and ice buildup of a certain percentage would obviously be a constraint to flight , and we would not launch so obviously ice is a serious problem we have had minor separations of foam in the past but there s never been a safety of flight issue from that material so it s but any type of fod foreign object damage is clearly something that we would be concerned with and we have gone to great lengths to avoid those where possible q i'm wondering if you can give us a sense of what kind of perhaps contingency planning activities the iss team the space station team is doing this week \? a well , we are starting to look at all options for how to sustain a human presence in space flight obviously as i 've mentioned , we have the consumables on board the station in terms of prop to keep the station on orbit , to life support , to provide the crew oddly enough , one of the important constraints is water on board the international space station and of course we bring this up with the progress vehicles and also with the shuttle so there is a lot of contingency planning oriented around the people people , again , as i mentioned , are a primary concern and of course the station is important but most important are the two astronauts and one cosmonaut we have on expedition six up there right now so obviously we will be looking , over the next few months , trying to get a sense when we will be able to get this problem discovered , the problem fixed and the shuttle fleet back on line supporting assembly in the interim we do have other international partner assets soyuz vehicles , progress vehicles for resupply , that could be beneficial so we will be looking at options as we get into the spring for ways to perhaps swap out the crews or relieve them or to put up a different expedition crew , perhaps through the use of a soyuz vehicle a lot of issues or concerns with that we still have some time to do that but those are the kinds of things we 're going through , different options to ensure we have the ways to keep the crew safety and as i mentioned , we will be launching a soyuz as planned in april out of baikonur and of course that will replace the crew return soyuz that is on orbit so at all times we will have a vehicle docked to the station if we ever were to decide to bring the crew home
she was in nearly every girl f scott fitzgerald ever saw in moonlight rich , beautiful , forever unattainable she was isabelle in this side of paradise , under moonlight and pale starlight , and daisy buchanan in the great gatsby , humming a melody on the steps of gatsby s mansion , sweetly , following it each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air her name was ginevra king , and she was a celebrated chicago debutante whom fitzgerald met in 1915 when she was a 16yearold at the westover school and he was a 19yearold at princeton they were smitten ginevra wrote about him in her diary , and for two years they corresponded when they broke up , fitzgerald asked her to destroy his letters , and she did but he kept hers and had them typed up and bound with the title personal letters property of f scott fitzgerald \( not manuscript \) fitzgerald died in 1940 , and some 10 years later his daughter , scottie , returned them to ginevra ginevra died in 1980 at 82 , but the letters remained in her family now her daughter and granddaughters have donated them , along with ginevra s diary and an unpublished short story written by her , to princeton , the repository of fitzgerald s papers ginevra is arguably the most important romance fitzgerald ever experienced , more than zelda , his wife , said james l w west iii , a professor of english at penn state university and editor of the ongoing edition of fitzgerald s works published by cambridge university press he lost her , but his ideal of her remained throughout his life ginevra s diary has never been seen by scholars , except professor west , an expert on fitzgerald , who is preparing an essay on the princeton donation there , she lets her emotions show , he said she says she loves scott in her letters she was more guarded he added the letters help us understand the fictional process by which he transferred this ideal creature into an interesting literary character he gave her some edge and some flaws fitzgerald s early biographers , arthur mizener and andrew turnbull , saw the letters , though they barely mention them for nearly 40 years they have been unavailable to scholars we can now examine the letters more carefully , professor west said , and we can trace details from them that fitzgerald adapted for his stories and novels the papers provide a window into the world of the wealthy elite of preworld war i america , a world of unlimited privilege and a strange innocence , of moonlit mansions , dances , football weekends through it , ginevra moved like a blithe spirit , carefree and cosseted in many ways her writings are typical teenage musings , but in them can be heard the voices of daisy buchanan , isabelle and other of fitzgerald s female characters breathy , coy , wistful ginevra was born in chicago in 1898 , daughter of charles garfield king , a wealthy stockbroker , and his wife , also named ginevra the younger ginevra darkhaired , petite , with large eyes was the third daughter in five generations named after leonardo s painting ginevra de' benci fitzgerald met her at a sledding party over christmas break in his hometown , st paul , where she was visiting her westover roommate he was one of st paul s most eligible bachelors , though his family was of modest means his father had lost his furniture business , and the fitzgeralds were supported by his mother s family but he lived among the rich on summit avenue , attending their parties , part of their world yet always outside it scott perfectly darling , ginevra wrote in her diary on jan 4 , 1915 , after meeting him am absolutely gone on scott ! she wrote the next day and the following month , i am madly in love with him her letters are filled with underlinings , exclamations , misspellings and fanciful punctuation in her first letter , on jan 11 , 1915 , she asks for his photograph i have but a faint recollection of yellow hair and big blue eyes and a brown corduroy waistcoat that was very goodlooking ! she signs it yours fickely sometimes but devotedly at present ginevra , setting the tone for their relationship in which she alternately beckoned him to her and pushed him away i know i am a flirt and i ca n't stop it , she tells him in another letter fitzgerald habitually saved letters and sometimes used material in them for his writing it appears from her responses that fitzgerald constantly begged her to reveal her inmost thoughts and details of her past he used to irritate people sara murphy , hemingway , with his insistent questions , professor west said we see it here when he was only just a teenager , the incipient writer fitzgerald s interest sometimes seems voyeuristic ginevra writes , you ask 'describe your last affair' i'm inclined to say 'none of yoyr affair' but thats too snitty ! ! the last one was let me see i dont know the last real one was last summer and then it was n't horribly heavy at another point it seems that she and fitzgerald have planned , perhaps not seriously , to elope do n't forget our plan of elopement that must n't fall through she dreams of him last night i dreamt you were calling on me , but it went off all right only you had purple hair , and would insist upon strutting around and tapping on all the walls fitzgerald it seems does n't trust her why wont you believe what i said about your standing first , she writes i cant tell you any better or any more truthfully
washington , feb 1 the budget that president bush sends to congress on monday would expand the military , create a major new social entitlement , energize the economy and , most likely , produce big deficits for the foreseeable future the 225 trillion plan would offer something for almost everybody it would provide modest tax refunds up front and much bigger tax cuts down the road it would give the elderly a permanent new right to governmentpaid prescription drugs it would provide more money for the armed forces , for domestic security , for medical research and for foreign aid not since the early days of ronald reagan s presidency has an administration harbored such bold ambitions and such a lack of concern about red ink white house officials concede that deficits could top 300 billion this year and next , and the budget will probably not project a return to surpluses in the next five years but as stark as that outlook will be , it will still leave out the costs for a long list of other measures white house officials said this week that they would propose an increase of roughly 16 billion for military spending in the 2004 fiscal year , but they also conceded that they might ask for additional billions in the months ahead even if the country does not fight a war with iraq it s possible , said mitchell e daniels jr , director of the white house office of management and budget why could it happen even if there is not a war \? the history of defense spending has been one of surge and purge , where you waste money on the way up and on the way down the president is trying to force the hard choice to maintain steady growth , mr daniels said if the country does goes to war , mr bush plans to ask congress for additional billions to cover those costs as well the president s budget will also leave out other big new liabilities linked to his tax plans the budget will include mr bush s proposal for taxadvantaged individual retirement programs but the tax cuts will not show up in his budget , which lays out costs for the next five years , because contributions to the savings plans will not cut a taxpayer s current taxes the tax cuts will only occur as people retire and start to withdraw the profits that accumulate , which will be tax free nor will the budget include the huge costs of mr bush s call to make his tax cuts from 2001 permanent the congressional budget office has estimated that cost at 785 billion over 10 years , but almost none of those costs will show up until nearly the end of the decade mr bush s democratic opponents in congress are already starting to attack the budget as reckless and irresponsible , and house democrats have calculated that the sum total of mr bush s tax plans would add 17 trillion in debt by 2011 but unlike many budgets in the past , which were torpedoed by opposition lawmakers , mr bush s plan has a very strong chance of surviving largely intact for the first time in years , republicans control not only the white house but also both houses of congress having won control of both houses in november , republicans say they will hew closely to mr bush s line and press their advantage for everything it is worth the president s budget will be one that , with very few exceptions , we have all been writing for the last six or eight years , said representative jim nussle , republican of iowa and chairman of the house budget committee so this year , you 're going to see real attention to the house version of special education , of transportation , of medicare they have consulted with us along the way most of the real haggling will take place in the senate , where republicans have a paperthin majority and where many moderate republicans have their own misgivings about major elements of the president s tax cuts even so , lawmakers and political analysts say the broad thrust of mr bush s plan is likely to survive people used to say that a president s budget was dead on arrival , said senator don nickles , republican of oklahoma and chairman of the senate budget committee that is certainly not the case now but having won the power to construct a budget with little interference , republicans can also be attacked for the deficits that ensue and democrats plan to make sure that they are now that they 're in a position to impose their own budget , they control everything , said senator kent conrad of north dakota , the ranking democrat on the budget committee the tragedy of it is that they 're using their power to take off into the deficit swamp in a major way white house officials have already telegraphed the broad parameters of their budget it would increase discretionary spending programs that are not locked in by standing legal obligations , as social security is , or that stem from interest payments on the national debt by about 4 percent , to about 790 billion defense spending , excluding the possible costs of a war , would climb about 17 billion , or 44 percent , to 399 billion domestic security programs , from the federal bureau of investigation to the customs service , would increase to 40 billion from 34 billion administration officials say that nondefense discretionary spending , which includes education , housing , environmental programs and medical research , would climb by about 3 percent that would be slightly faster than the rate of inflation , which administration officials predict will remain well below 2 percent
valhalla while doctors and nurses at the westchester medical center here work on the bodies of patients , there is another group of people the hospital chaplains who work with their spirits these are the members of the clergy who sit with transplant patients as they await the arrival of hearts and livers that may save their lives they spend hours comforting aids patients they pray with the families of young cancer victims in the pediatric oncology ward they listen to patients in pain in the burn unit and perform emergency baptisms for infants in neonatal intensive care the work is not easy chaplains see human emotions at their most raw they work with people whose bodies are ravaged some patients are atheists , while some are deeply rooted in their faith some request chaplains others are frightened by the very sight of them and it is not uncommon , these chaplains say , to see a medical crisis bring on a spiritual crisis people get very angry and want to know , 'why is this happening to me \? ' or 'is god punishing me \? said the rev douglas phillips , a presbyterian minister and chaplain who works in the emergency room in a crisis , there are theological questions early on , chaplains learn not to proselytize or offer glib answers to searching questions they are trained to listen , to be nonjudgmental , to help patients connect to their own spiritual resources and to draw on that faith the rev peter gibbons , a roman catholic priest and a chaplaincy resident , said that his training taught him a great deal about what not to say i am not going to explain why a god would take a child from a mother , father gibbons said i do n't have the answers we are trained to be a witness and a presence and to let them feel that they are not alone father gibbons said it was normal for people to rail against god when they are traumatized , and often to take that anger out on chaplains but he added that patients and families often later return to discuss their faith questions and the meaning of their experiences several chaplains said they believed there is a strong spiritual component to healing they said they think that patients who believe themselves to be connected to god or some being greater than themselves tend to have an easier time recovering from illness or trauma the rev susan lunning , the director of chaplaincy services at the hospital , supervises the clinical pastoral education program at the hospital , where clergy members are trained in the specialty of chaplaincy she calls it crisis ministry at the medical center , the chaplaincy program is somewhat complicated , because in addition to having six staff chaplains , the hospital is the host to the training program it is based on a medical residency model , and students rotate through different units they attend lectures , present anonymous case studies and have individual and group supervision there is both a residency program , which is full time and includes benefits and a stipend , and an internship program , which is part time and unpaid when they complete the program , residents , who generally already have master s degrees and considerable professional experience , receive four units of clinical pastoral education credits interns , who tend to be less established in their field , receive one while chaplains can work without any accreditation at all , ms lunning said she thinks advanced training for chaplains working at acute level medical centers is critical she said that regional trauma centers present a diversity of religions , backgrounds and illnesses because trained chaplains are taught to serve not only people of their own faith , but also people of other religions , they are able to work with a broad cross section of patients we could n't have a chaplain for the buddhists , a chaplain for the hindus , we could n't possibly hire staff to cover every need , she said but there are basic spiritual human needs , like the need for meaning , the need to reconnect and reconcile relationships , the need for community every faith values those and every faith wants to uplift those the work is varied , and chaplains report that there is rarely such a thing as a typical day anne gentile , a catholic lay person in the chaplain residency program there are currently seven lay people in the program remembered her first encounter with susan burton , 45 , of mount vernon , who , because of complications from diabetes , was about to undergo surgery to have her leg amputated ms burton was devastated by the loss she did n't want her leg to be taken , ms gentile recalled i said yell all you want it was a great prayer ms burton remembers it differently i was sedated and the last thing i heard her say was that god loves you the two have since become friends ms gentile visits ms burton often they always begin with prayer , sometimes asking god for help to deal with the pain , or giving thanks for a day without pain ms burton recently needed a second surgical procedure , and ms gentile stopped by the postoperative care unit to visit , hold ms burton s hand and again , to pray
imagine having a singer with a worldclass voice at your disposal , any hour of any day she s just standing at the ready , game to perform whatever silly song you might make up for her a ballad about her love for you , a tribute to your best friend s golf game , a stirring rendition of the evening s dinner menu close friends of madonna or mariah may already have had that pleasure , but for everyone else a new technology called vocaloid may offer the next best thing developed at pompeu fabra university in spain and financed by the yamaha corporation , the software , which is due to be released to consumers in january , allows users to cast their own \( or anyone else s \) songs in a disembodied but exceedingly lifelike concertquality voice just as a synthesizer might be programmed to play a series of notes like a violin one time and then like a tuba the next , a computer equipped with vocaloid will be able to sing whatever combination of notes and words a user feeds it the first generation of the software will be available for 200 but its arrival raises the prospect of a time when anyone with a laptop will be able to repurpose any singer s voice or even bring longgone virtuosos back to life in an era when our most popular singers are marketed in every conceivable way dolls , tshirts , notebooks , makeup lines the voice may become one more extension of a popstar brand the human voice has proven the most difficult of all sounds to synthesize digital technology can produce something clear enough to convey meaning , but only in a clipped monotone that sounds more like a robot than a real live person a convincing human voice , spoken or sung , with all its complex , flowing articulations and quivering uncertainties has been unattainable yamaha has not yet made vocaloid available for scrutiny , but judging by some early samples and demonstrations , the company seem to have made that quantum leap you can think of the software as a kind of audio font musical notation and lyrics can be translated into the chosen voice , then saved for replay , just as a word processor might translate a text into helvetica or times new roman and print it out as many times as you like these fonts are made up of a database of phonemes , the basic sounds that make up any language to create the database , technicians record a singer performing as many as 60 pages of scripted articulations \( like epp , pep , lep \) assorted pitches and techniques like glissandos and legatos are also thrown in the mix with all the combinations , the process takes a week of fivehour singing days the resultant font is reminiscent of the singer s voice , says ed stratton , the managing director of zerog limited , a londonbased company that has licensed the vocaloid technology zerog is using vocaloid to create the first of these fonts leon , described as a virtual soul vocalist , and lola , his female counterpart the digitized duo will make their debut in january at the international music products association conference in anaheim , calif the technology first attracted attention in march at musikmesse , an annual music technology conference in germany paul white , the editor of the british audio gear magazine sound on sound , was there for the demonstration a few simple tools were used to adjust inflection , tone , vibrato and so on , wrote mr white within minutes , the computer was singing like a professional ! a vocaloid version of the song amazing grace recorded with prototype technology , yet still more human sounding than any previous vocal synthesis was released on yamaha s web site shortly after the conference quickly , that sample drew links from sites in the netherlands , germany , france , japan , russia and the united states , setting internet message boards and chat rooms buzzing in the case of leon and lola , session singers were hired to record what mr stratton calls generic soulsinging voices the decision to start with soul was purely a marketing calculation mr stratton figured that the most common use of vocaloid , at least in its early stages , would be to serve as background singers with a soulful sound , the company could target a commercial market that ranges from justin timberlake to jayz but mr stratton has many more plans soon , he said you 'll buy new fonts and then any song you write , you can hear it sung a number of ways you might hear what it sounds like sung by a soul singer , and then an operatic voice or a choir boy hit music producers like dan \( the automator \) takemura \( a creator of the gorillaz , a band that appeared only in an animated form , but sold several million albums anyway \) and the matrix \( the trio of scott spock , graham edwards and his wife , lauren christy , that produced the three no 1 hits from avril lavigne s last album \) say they are likely at least to try recording with vocaloid instead of backup singers as producers , you run into some artists and oh god , it s so hard to get the right vocal , mr spock said it s intriguing , this idea of 'ok , just give me all your vowels and all your consonants and i 'll see you later'

a very winning pair of losers have moved into the harvey theater of the brooklyn academy of music , where they are bringing new refinement to the popular art of disgruntlement one , as it happens , comes from the alltoorealseeming provinces of 19thcentury russia the other from a mythical kingdom by the sea and their movements , in pursuing courtship and selfadvancement , are as different as an abject grovel and a smug strut but as represented in the compelling new productions from the donmar warehouse of london that opened over the weekend , the ambitionless title character of chekhov s uncle vanya and the ambitionriddled malvolio of shakespeare s twelfth night are both unearthing provocatively mixed layers of comedy and tragedy from what it means to be unlucky in love which might have been expected , since they are each embodied by simon russell beale , perhaps the greatest stage actor of his generation mr russell beale , 42 , who treated the academy to a defiantly unglamorous hamlet two seasons ago , is by no means the only reason to visit these exotically twinned plays , which run in repertory through march 9 the productions offer new york audiences a rare chance to see a firstrate ensemble , which also features emily watson \( of the films breaking the waves and punchdrunk love \) , working fluently in two entirely different theatrical idioms then there s the matter of the man who has overseen their performances sam mendes , the artistic director of the donmar from its inception in 1992 until december , has in that time established himself as a golden boy of film and theater , winning an academy award for american beauty and a tony for the new york revival of cabaret with this vanya and twelfth night , among the most coveted tickets in london last year , mr mendes has shaped a valedictory ode to the varied possibilities of interpreting classics his vanya is a goosebumpmaking triumph of inthemoment naturalism if the pleasures of his twelfth night are more fitful , with a production that sacrifices authentic feeling to conceptual stylishness , there s a gratifying boldness in its very differences from the vanya and mr russell beale s malvolio is one of those comic performances that by their end have turned laughter into uneasy reflection to say that mr russell beale is not the most memorable figure in uncle vanya is a compliment he and ms watson , as vanya s plain , workstunted niece , sonya , tone down star presence to create a haunting sense of people of broken confidence who seem to wonder if they are n't disappearing these portraits , etched in artful awkwardness , are no less skilled than the more conspicuously charismatic performances of helen mccrory as the languid , beautiful yelena and mark strong as the doctor , astrov , the unobtainable love objects of vanya and sonya yet there s a comparable vividness in the nominally supporting roles cherry morris s marina , sonya s old nanny david bradley s peevish , elderly professor , who is married to yelena , and anthony o 'donnell as the parasitic telegin , sonya s impoverished godfather the marvel of this deeply felt , fluid production is that nearly all the parts , as acted , seem created equal what chekhov demands and rarely receives is the sense that all his characters are trapped within the same confining element of time , that they breathe the same stultifying air , and that they they are moving slowly but inevitably toward the same final oblivion of death mr mendes elicits this democratic sense of mortality in ways that seem to come entirely from within the play the opening scene juxtaposes the restlessness of the middleaged astrov , pacing the length of the stage , with the placid immobility of marina in a complementary moment just before the end , vanya s gnarled mother , marya voynitsky \( selina cadell \) , advances haltingly on a cane toward the departing yelena , like some goyaesque emblem of the younger woman s future none of this feels less than organic , though when you stop to think about it , mr mendes has made strategic and symbolic use of the physical arrangements of the performers in the distances among them and the ways in which they linger in the isolated twilight of the edges of the stage \( hugh vanstone did the exquisite lighting , and david holmes recreated it for the academy \) what you are most conscious of , however , is the feeling of claustrophobia that comes from people sharing a house over one long summer , of the irritations of intimacy you are also achingly aware of the fragile balance of mutual accommodation these people have achieved the ritualized , vaguely sadomasochistic flirtation between vanya , whom mr russell beale endows with a sliding , selfprotective archness , and the irresistibly sullen yelena of the selfcentered , demanding fear of the ailing professor and the eroding patience of his daughter and wife these are people who have willed themselves into a kind of anesthesia , because to feel anything awakens too much pain but there are embers in this ashen emotional landscape that we have been so thoroughly prepared for the scene in which the professor unwittingly stirs those sparks into destructive flame does not diminish the anguish of what follows
the later poetry of stanley kunitz shuttles between an old man s autumnal weariness and a defiant love for a world he will not give up he writes in plainspoken confessional language that is rooted in daily life but that can coalesce at any moment to frame sudden glimpses of the infinite these qualities were made abundantly clear on monday night when the guggenheim museum presented an evening celebrating mr kunitz , who is 98 and a former poet laureate , as part of its works and process series the program featured premieres of five commissioned musical settings of his poetry by composers ranging from the oldschool modernist milton babbitt to paul scott goodman , who wrote the musical bright lights , big city mr kunitz himself took part , looking frail but dignified in his elfin eminence after being helped to the front of the stage he read five of his poems , speaking slowly and forcefully hearing his work rendered in his own voice was deeply affecting and underscored a profound lyricism less linguistic than existential that is present in his unadorned verse it was disappointing , then , that none of the composers managed truly to reach or enhance this innate lyricism instead they offered , perhaps of necessity , countermelodies to the poet s own , and some seemed at odds with the spirit of the text charles wuorinen is an excellent composer , but his signature spiky style seemed illsuited here he took the long boat , a poem full of yearning for transcendence , and broke its flow into sharp lines full of difficult leaps for mezzosoprano and english horn mr babbitt s contribution , for soprano and vibraphone , was written in his hallmark rigorous style but seemed more attuned to the whimsy of his chosen poem , the waltzer in the house dave douglas chose a prose passage because , as he commented tellingly in a panel discussion with the other composers , the poems seemed complete to him without music he set the passage for piano , bass and vocals , serving up the text in pastelcolored jazz chords and a crooning vocal line delivered by andy bey eve beglarian s piece may have struck the closest , using tenor , piccolo and electronics to convey the atmosphere and the frightening surprise at the end of robin redbreast the night came to a slightly surreal close with mr goodman s artrock yeahyeahyeah flourishes on mr kunitz s ethereal when the light falls strangely , the music may fare better next time without the poet so close his charismatic presence constantly reminded you that this was poetry that had been turned into song , not the other way around photos andy bey , at the piano , and james genus , on bass , play the tides , which dave douglas wrote for a prose passage by stanley kunitz , far left \( photographs by hiroyuki ito for the new york times \)
the los angeles county coroner s office appealed yesterday for the public s help in locating relatives of a bronx woman who was one of 10 people killed when an elderly driver plowed through a crowded farmers' market in santa monica , calif , last week the woman was identified as theresa breglia , 50 , whose last known address was 1223 boynton avenue in the bronx the authorities in california said that they were releasing her name because none of her relatives could be found the bronx address came from ms breglia s driver s license several nearby residents contacted last night said they did not know her ms breglia was among the first people struck by an 86yearold man , who the police say may have mistakenly accelerated instead of braking as he approached the market
six years ago , to the delight of downtown brooklyn residents , the city agreed to a socalled trafficcalming study to unravel gridlock it was billed as a model project that might bring zigzags and other unfamiliar traffic innovations to the clogged streets in and around downtown but in late june , at the conclusion of the 12 million study , the city s transportation department announced that essentially none of the study s major recommendations would be followed , at least until 2009 the announcement was met with disbelief and anger from brooklyn heights to carroll gardens in addition to the daily flood of inbound manhattan traffic that collects outside their doorsteps , residents argued that downtown brooklyn has outgrown its roads we 're a giant doormat that everybody steps on before they get to manhattan , said jane mcgroarty of the brooklyn heights association all of the residential brownstone streets have become alternates to the arterials city officials said the decision was not based on merit but money we understand the frustration and concern of the community , said lisi de bourbon , a spokeswoman for the transportation department however , the fact remains that we do n't have the money in our capital budget she said the department s capital budget for the current fiscal year had been cut by about 30 percent to 112 billion , from 158 billion as a result , she said , many projects had been postponed , including bridge repairs but advocates say the department was reluctant to consider trafficcalming techniques from the start the study , they argued , was foisted on the department by city hall after residents staged endless rushhour demonstrations with signs likehicks street is not the 5th lane of the bqe from the getgo , they were busy digging their heels in , said john kaehny , executive director of transportation alternatives , an advocacy group in the decade i 've been doing this work , this has infuriated me more than anything else the study itself , mr kaehny said , was flawed because of the city s unwillingness to consider proven calming devices like chicanes \( alternating curb extensions that make a slalomlike road \) the disagreement was fueled by conflicting goals residents wanted to reduce overall volume with strategic bottlenecks the city wanted to unclog traffic on major roads , to reduce spillover onto residential streets even so , mr kaehny said , the measures included in the 163page report were being tabled , with no guarantee that they would ever be tried but ms bourbon said the city was committed to the project , and was pursuing 34 interim measures that are cheaper community activists were dismissive , however , and said they were considering a new round of street demonstrations denny lee photo cars coming off the 39th street bridge face a difficult left turn at northern boulevard \( photo by jason eskenazi for the new york times \)
there is essentially one reason and it s a very good one to see the jackie wilson story , and that is the star , chester gregory ii to call a performer unique is generally to be clich d and hyperbolic , not to mention wrong , but mr gregory puts on a show of such physical and vocal dexterity that it s almost impossible to imagine that anyone else could do it as wilson , the detroit singer whose career spanned the morphing of the city s musical signature from rhythm and blues into motown and whose hits included lonely teardrops and higher and higher , mr gregory cavorts and gyrates with such gymnastic aplomb that you wonder where he stores the lung power for his potent pop tenor his presence completely overshadows the show itself , which has been imported from chicago and runs through april 27 at the apollo theater in harlem , part of a national tour the show , written and directed by jackie taylor , is problematic in almost every respect other than the star its book is awkward and full of hokey clich s , as well as being foggy on many biographical details the direction is rudimentary the tale is told by a variety of narrators , stepping up to address the audience directly and giving way usually to a song , occasionally to a scene the high schoolish sets make it obvious that the production is underfinanced and most unhappily , the sound engineering is atrocious somehow none of that really matters from the start the audience is hooked on the promise of the music and , at least at one recent performance , was eager to buy into the travails of the troubled , talented wilson , portrayed here not so much as selfindulgent and selfdestructive but as a charming , winsome and unfortunate rogue mr gregory gives the kind of overflowingly charismatic performance that has the audience eating out of and in one scene literally kissing his hand wilson s life was a melodrama a talented boxer \( and a bit of a hoodlum \) as a young man , he was persuaded by his mother played here by melba moore , who can still belt it out to give it up cocky and suave , he was a drinker , a street fighter and a womanizer from an early age he began his singing career as part of a group called the dominoes , eventually becoming their lead singer and subsequently taking off on his own his solo career , with a stage act characterized by acrobatic dancing and the kind of hip shaking and pelvis thrusting that made elvis presley notorious , was fueled by songs written by billy davis and berry gordy , before the founding of motown records wilson , though , unfortunately spent his entire career tethered to brunswick records , which proved to be mobcontrolled and involved in payola there were also huge tax problems , drug and alcohol addictions and several paternity suits in 1961 a woman , evidently an enraged paramour , shot and nearly killed him in 1975 he apparently had a heart attack onstage in a new jersey club and lapsed into a coma from which he never emerged he died in 1984 it is a shame that the jackie wilson story has n't found a more stageworthy way to dramatize these events it s all related in recitation , which turns the show into something of a televisionstyle biography , and the narration is sloppy , with the facts of wilson s business career especially difficult to track the dearth of theatrics also places a greater burden on the musical numbers fortunately , they are almost all terrific the secondary players are very good lyle miller does a remarkable imitation of sam cooke performing tennessee waltz , and valarie tekosky does a creditable etta james , performing something s got a hold on me but for the most part you are either in awe of mr gregory or impatient for his return in addition to his uptempo numbers , he croons a soul version of danny boy , belts out the heartbreaking torch song to be loved and even does a very funny brief impression of mario lanza that he does all this while doing splits , backward limbo bends and more is jaw dropping he seemed to tire at the end , but no ticket buyer would blame him the jackie wilson story written and directed by jackie taylor produced by ms taylor and brian kabatznick musical

federal regulators yesterday sued former top executives of gateway inc , accusing them of inflating earnings three years ago to meet analysts' expectations in its complaint , filed in federal court in san diego , the securities and exchange commission said the executives had improperly reduced the size of loan loss reserves , improperly claimed revenue and tinkered with accounting in other ways to meet the market s expectations in the second and third quarters of 2000 the agency contends that the principal architect was john j todd , gateway s chief financial officer at the time , who in 1997 had held the same position at boston chicken , which filed for bankruptcy protection in 1998 also named in yesterday s lawsuit were jeffrey weitzen , then the chief executive , and robert d manza , its controller at the time none of the executives are still at gateway , which said yesterday that the sec s investigation into its accounting was now closed the sec s lawsuit seeks to recover illgotten gains and unspecified civil penalties , and to bar the three from serving as officers or directors of a public company the commission continues to be absolutely committed to investigating and bringing complex financial fraud actions like this one , stephen m cutler , the sec s director of enforcement , said in a statement a fraud achieved through numerous small accounting tricks , as here , is just as harmful to investors as any other lawyers for all three executives said their clients planned to defend themselves in court their determination may be the result of the increasingly hostile environment for whitecollar defendants , said daniel j kramer , a partner at paul , weiss , rifkind , wharton garrison in new york it may be that the difference between settling and losing in a litigation has narrowed to the point where there s less disincentive to litigate , mr kramer said in a statement , gateway s founder and current chief executive , ted waitt , said , we are a completely new gateway , and bringing this issue to closure allows us to now focus completely on serving our customers a spokesman said gateway restated its financial results in february 2001 after the three executives left the company shares of the company closed at 490 yesterday , up 14 cents from wednesday s close the spokesman , bob sherbin , said that over the last two years , the company had adopted several new policies that , among other things , gave its audit committee greater independence and established additional layers of review to spot potential conflicts of interest mr weitzen s lawyer , richard marmaro of the los angeles office of proskauer rose , said his client would fight the lawsuit the sec s allegations against mr weitzen are baseless , mr marmaro said in a statement in bringing an enforcement action against mr weitzen , the sec s desire to appear to be pursuing corporate executives has for the moment trumped both the evidence and the law robert d rose , a lawyer at sheppard , mullin , richter hampton who is representing mr todd , said in a statement that the sec s lawsuit should never have been filed the enthusiasm of the sec in sending messages to corporate america has gone too far , he said james l sanders , a lawyer at mcdermott will emery who is representing mr manza , said his client denied the sec s accusations mr manza believes that at the conclusion of trial he will be found not liable on the charges , mr sanders said charles r wolf , a securities analyst at needham company in new york , said , the closing of the sec s investigation into gateway s accounting without the payment of any penalty by the company was a positive sign for the computer maker since the filing is against the individuals , i think the company is pretty much protected , said mr wolf , who added that he owned gateway shares he said the executives named in the lawsuit did not manage gateway well while they were there the company literally imploded , he said , noting that in nearly three years , gateway managed a profit in one quarter now , he said , the company is shifting from sales of personal computers to consumers to sales of electronic gadgets according to the sec s complaint , the misleading financial results reported by gateway gave the false and misleading impression that , unlike many of its competitors , it was outpacing an industry trend of decreasing sales of personal computers in fact , throughout 2000 , gateway s sales growth from personal computers was declining significantly the complaint asserted that mr todd orchestrated an effort to close the gap between the results that analysts expected gateway to report and the company s actual revenue , using improper and extraordinary transactions and sales efforts starting in the second quarter of 2000 , according to the complaint , mr todd took steps to prop up sales by extending financing to customers who previously had been denied credit and in the third quarter of that year , mr todd and mr weitzen assured analysts that gateway would meet its revenue and earnings targets , though both knew that the gap between actual and anticipated numbers would probably exceed 100 million , the sec contended photo jeffrey weitzen , former president and chief executive of gateway , in an undated company photo \( photo by bloomberg news \) \( pg c4 \)
east rutherford , nj , jan 9 the boos , a longforgotten refrain of nets fans , resurfaced just six minutes into the second half at that point , the nets were losing by only 33 points to the sacramento kings the night would spiral even further into ignominy , bottoming out at a 42point deficit early in the fourth quarter , when the sellout crowd of 20 , 049 began leaving its disgust at the exit doors what was supposed to be a possible preview of the nba finals quickly turned into a surreal nightmare for the nets , who looked like a team heading back to the lottery instead of a team hoping for its 11th straight victory the kings left continental arena marveling over their nearperfect night of dunking in the nets' dazed faces , knocking down open 3pointers and passing with dizzying efficiency all leading to a shockingly easy 11882 victory it was hard to believe that these teams came into the game with identical records of 269 the nets left the court acknowledging the humiliation , but rationalizing it , too yeah , i heard the boos , jason kidd said they had every right to boo maybe we should have started booing we had a bad performance they showed why they are one of the best teams in the league lose by 1 , lose by 40 , it s still a loss , and fortunately we 've got a game tomorrow the nets head to toronto for friday s matchup with the raptors , but it s a game that holds none of the challenges or thrills that tonight s contest promised the nets have had only two losses at continental arena , the other to the dallas mavericks , another of the western conference s top teams the kings beat the nets at their own game scoring 29 points on the fast break to the nets' 9 and snapped the nets' 10game winning streak and 13game victory streak at home the nets , who had blown out opponents by an average of 168 points at home , did their best to shrug off their first loss since dec 17 to the knicks in a way it was kind of funny , richard jefferson said we have been on the other end of these so many of these games i would n't say we were due , but you have to give them credit they came in and hit a bunch of shots it was just one of those days but the nets have not had such a day or night in a while even before kidd s arrival during the 2656 record of the 20001 season their worst margin of defeat was 34 points tonight s drubbing was not the worst loss in nets history the houston rockets defeated the nets by 52 points in 1987 it was not the worst home loss in nets history the nets lost by 49 points to the washington bullets in 1978 but it was certainly the most illtimed this game was shown on national television just one game , kenyon martin shouted to a heckling fan during the fourth quarter kidd had surmised this week that if the nets had met the kings and not the lakers in last year s finals , the series would have gone longer than four games the nets shot down that theory tonight , brick by brick , while the kings could not seem to miss we played awfully well , probably as well as we played all year , said sacramento coach rick adelman i learned a long time ago there is no perfect game , but this is as good as it gets for us the kings shot 667 percent in the first quarter and finished at 517 percent for the game peja stojakovic scored 21 of his gamehigh 24 points in the first half , when the kings took a 6941 lead going into the locker room it was the most points the nets had given up in a half this season and , likewise , the most the kings had scored the nets' unraveling happened subtly , then suddenly with 5 minutes 23 seconds left in the first quarter , a television timeout was called and coach byron scott stuck to his routine by substituting anthony johnson for kidd , as the nets' coach had during the 10game winning streak the nets were leading , 1917 that would be their last lead the kings burst out on a 130 run , led by mike bibby and stojakovic the nets missed four shots and watched their deficit mount scott kept kidd on the sidelines until the start of the second quarter , when he played with some of the second unit by that time , the nets trailed by 3423 scott wanted to stick to his routine my game plan had n't changed , he said just the fact that right after that they just seemed to get on a roll and we just never got back into the game bibby had much to do with the nets' defensive breakdowns , stimulating the kings' rapidly moving offense on which the nets' offense is based bibby played with flair against his mentor , kidd before the game , bibby said he only wished he could be as quick as kidd tonight , bibby turned into a blur , slashing through the lane and transforming his team into a passing machine he made kidd look as if he were running in mud , and made the nets' defenders seem stuck in quicksand kidd missed 8 of 12 shots in the first half and had only 2 assists he scored just 10 points , shooting 5 of 17 from the field three nets had 11 points , jason collins scoring 9 of his in the first quarter when the game resembled a contest i'm stunned , scott said i did n't expect to lose by 36 points jefferson compared it with the nets' 36point blowout of the celtics on christmas night we did n't expect that , the kings did n't expect that , he said when asked what scott could have done defensively to stop the hotshooting kings , he said the things i could have done , i could n't do it s not legal take a bat , go get my golf clubs , it s not legal instead , the fans spewed their opinion onto the court i had n't heard that in a while , lucious harris said they pay a lot of money for those tickets , they have every right kidd smiled and added we 're still the best team in the east , and that s how we have to look at it rebounds the nets activated the backup guard chris childs before tonight s game , but nets coach byron scott said he would only play him in a blowout since he did not know the offense childs got his wish , playing for the first time since the nets acquired him as a free agent this summer that might have been the only good thing that happened tonight , said childs , who scored two points in eight minutes in the fourth quarter the nets will guarantee anthony johnson s contract by the deadline tomorrow in childs s place , they put the secondyear guard brandon armstrong on the injured list , with a lower back strain the kings' vlade divac is also the president of the partizan team in belgrade , yugoslavia the nets' firstround draft pick , nenad krstic , plays for partizan divac praised krstic , a center , and said the nets should not have problems negotiating to release him from his contract photos kenyon martin of the nets trying to shoot over the kings' keon clark the nets were beaten before a sellout crowd

siem reap , cambodia forty years ago , a team of french archaeologists decided that the best way to save the baphuon temple was to destroy it they began to take apart the fragile temple block by block , keeping meticulous records of their work , planning to put it back together again as a more stable structure then came war as the communist khmer rouge approached , the restorers fled the angkor temple complex in 1972 in the chaos that followed , all their written records were destroyed when they returned in 1995 , all they found was 300 , 000 heavy stone blocks strewn among the trees the biggest jigsaw puzzle in the world it is a puzzle without a key , but it does have a solution block by block , layer by layer , the baphuon temple is rising again as one of the towering monuments of angkor when it was built in the 11th century , the multitiered sandstone pyramid was the most impressive building of its day a truly astonishing spectacle , according to a 13thcentury chinese traveler , zhou daguan like the other angkor temples , baphuon was consumed by the jungle after the great empire fell 500 years ago , and it was only in the last century that french archaeologists began tinkering with it but the baphuon , clumsily built on sand with a poor drainage system , was teetering and collapsing in chunks , too unstable to repair like its neighbors , bayon , angkor wat and others the solution anastylosis , the sort of disassembly ambitious mechanics sometimes do with car engines work began in the 1960 s half the temple was in pieces when it was abandoned , scattered across 25 acres of land like shredded documents so we have a puzzle , but we are missing the map of the puzzle , said pascal roy re , an architect who heads a team of 200 working for the cole fran aise d'extr meorient , a cultural organization with financing from the french government philippe peycam , executive director of the center for khmer studies here , said it s really crazy , this temple , so complex and baroque it s a nightmare to restore the french team was confronted with a variety of challenges that included the reconstruction of a reclining buddha that was added in the 16th century and the reinforcement of the structure with a concrete core that was begun in the 1960 s and is now considered outmoded but the most fascinating challenge came in the puzzle pieces themselves worn by centuries of sun , monsoon and jungle growth , the stones of baphuon were chipped and roughened , each slightly different from all the others without mortar to cushion the construction , each block must be returned to nestle precisely among those beside , above and below it one place for one block , one block for one place , mr roy re said that s the rule like any jigsaw puzzle , there is no forcing a piece into a place that is almost right , but not quite you 'll laugh , but if you are off by ten millimeters here , 20 meters farther along , everything is wrong , mr roy re said it happens regularly , but when it happens you know right away that s the difficulty and also the insurance against mistakes the monument corrects itself apart from the temple s own dynamic , the restorers had three things to guide them jacques dumarcay , the french architect who had worked on the baphuon project in the 1960 s , had since retired but was able to offer some institutional memory the second guide was a cache in paris of almost 1 , 000 photographs the french had taken of the temple over the years their chief value was to show which sections had already collapsed before the temple was dismantled , saving the workers from fruitless searches for missing stones third was the remaining half of baphuon , which was to be dismantled after the first half was rebuilt by studying this second half , mr roy re s team created stylized drawings of the carved profiles of the blocks in each row of each tier of the temple early on , an attempt was made to computerize these shapes and create a reconstruction model but given the eroded shapes of the stones , the computer s generalized solutions were of little use so we looked for a more simple solution , which was the manmade solution , he said in other words , memorization there are about 500 different shapes , mr roy re said , but by now nobody needs to refer to the drawings each team knows just what shapes it is looking for we have people who walk around all day , he said about 70 percent of the blocks have now been identified , and mr roy re said he was confident that none were missing at times , as with any puzzle , some small sections are fitted together on their own , and the woods are dotted with what look like minitemples awaiting their moment to be put in place this is not a hightech project , mr roy re said it s just a question of paying attention to what you do , and do n't sleep photos workers rebuilding the baphuon temple seek specific stones among the many thousands

tehran it is sometimes called iranian porn it appears on certain web sites that specialize in mocking the islamic republic s puritanism , featuring women with hair tumbling out of their head scarves or exhibiting deep d colletage at family gatherings such sites have been officially labeled depraved recently , joining a host of other political , social and truly pornographic online destinations in iran s first attempt to restrict internet access after the limitations put on newspapers and other mass media , they understand that people are looking for news on the internet , said reza parisa , the director of an association of internet service providers so of course , the government wants to limit access to the internet , too but like much of the regulation in iran , the line between what is acceptable and degenerate , legal and illegal , remains fluid , so the crackdown has prompted a catandmouse game between the conservative hierarchy and iran s younger generation , which is growing ever more technically proficient even those who support filtering internet content suspect that the effort is doomed , like earlier bans on videotapes and satellite television the government is bound to lose , they say , as the almost 50 million iranians under age 30 seek to have more fun the intention is to filter or stop sites with immoral content or that contradict our social values , said hussein shariatmadari , the publisher of the newspaper kayhan , which often reflects the views of the supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei in fact , these sites are readily available it s like removing a ladder leaning against a building so a bird wo n't fly off the roof the crackdown started this spring with the arrest of a popular internet journalist , since released on bail , and the distribution to iran s 300 or so internet service providers of three lists of sites to be blocked no service providers objected publicly to the first two lists , which contained over 100 , 000 pornographic sites originating outside iran , internet specialists said but the third list , of about 94 sites , caused a stir because it contained a number of sites from both inside and outside the country that criticize the government on political and social grounds to start with , they are focusing on pornography and web sites that speak out against islam and the mullahs , mr parisa said the government is very sensitive about that it is particularly sensitive at the moment because some officials in the bush administration and in congress have vowed to underwrite efforts to destabilize the government the ruling clerics have a history of limiting any liberalization at times when they feel threatened a sudden jump in internet access over the last couple of years is believed to have made officials here more concerned about the internet as a tool that could be used against them iran now has an estimated three million internet users out of a population of around 65 million , mr parisa said , the vast majority using it solely for email and chatting sites that mock the clergy they might refer to a leading ayatollah as his mullah highness are among the most popular here one new site , set up outside the country by an exile political party , posts photographs contrasting the somewhat glamorous court of the late shah with the drab public face of the ruling theocracy beggers servants , reads the caption of one picture of clerics before the revolution rulers and masters , says the caption underneath the current ruling pantheon there has also been an explosion of web logs service providers estimate that roughly 50 , 000 such personal diaries are published in farsi , discussing topics ranging from art and movies , to music , computers and everything else web specialists say that among the 10 most visited sites , at least 6 either feature nudity or offer links to other sites that do one popular web log , called faheshe , or whore in farsi , features the memoirs of a former prostitute detailing her downfall the site also promotes links to interviews with other prostitutes , one saying that clerics tend to frequent the same women and that some give their patronage the patina of legality by reading the vows that shiite islam provides for shortterm marriages none of the web logs have been blocked thus far the political sites are perhaps more worrisome for the government than the online pornography many of the journalists who founded liberal , reformist newspapers that have been banned by the conservativerun judiciary have started web sites that use much bolder language than the print media and have proven harder to shut down this spring , 135 members of parliament wrote an open letter to ayatollah khamenei , suggesting that it was time for iran to reform and to do more to reintegrate with the world they cited an old line from ayatollah ruhollah khomeini about drinking a cup of poison at the end of the iraniraq war in 1988 , a suggestion that trying times require distasteful , drastic measures not a single newspaper published the letter it is unclear who ordered them to refrain but it was widely available on the web when protests erupted in tehran and around the country in midjune , the newspapers offered limited coverage eventually the culture ministry even barred journalists from attending the demonstrations but student web sites kept the country informed with nearly blowbyblow accounts of events each night newspapers have reported on the rough guidelines on internet use that the justice ministry plans to promulgate a report in the newspaper iran listed 20 kinds of online activity that would be considered possible violations , including publishing articles that insult islamic values , iran s leadership , top clerics or the ideas of ayatollah khomeini , the revolutionary patriarch sites that promote gambling , smoking or drug addiction will also be outlawed , the account said , and the judiciary will create a special department to investigate and prosecute internet offenses service providers complain that they do not have the means to buy the expensive filtering equipment needed internet specialists believe that the government might have obtained some highly effective american equipment getting around the ban the united states has placed on such exports by purchasing it through european subsidiaries for reformist legislators in parliament , the sudden interest by the ruling clergy in the internet prompts concern that broader restrictions may lie ahead what is important is not to interfere with the free exchange of ideas in the society , said elaheh koulai , one of the outspoken women in iran s parliament there is a fear that this kind of filtering will expand to the circulation of information , not just limit things that go against our legal and cultural norms photo a young woman checked the internet in the nedanet cafe in the eskan tower shopping center in tehran iran s younger generation

paris , april 15 the military side of dassault aviation was having a tough time making new sales even before the war in iraq the company , france s only warplane builder , lost a 44 billion , 40jet order in south korea to boeing last spring , and in december , poland picked lockheed martin for a 35 billion , 48plane contract , again passing over dassault s mirage and rafale jets now , the war in iraq has made the odds even worse , and raised questions all over europe about the viability of its military contractors for france and germany , whose leaders directly opposed the bush administration s policy in iraq , anger in america could cut their contractors out of the immense american arms market for contractors in britain , which backed america in iraq , it may become much harder to work with european partners in the development of weapons systems that none could handle alone some industry executives sense the potential for a seismic shift is continued transnationalism a realistic future option for defense companies in light of current events \? sir richard evans , the chairman of bae systems , asked in a speech last month to industry executives musing aloud on the future , he wondered whether a realignment around different political axes as a result of the transatlantic split over iraq would have consequences what would it mean for the complex , crossindustry alliances , the product of years of mostly european collaboration \? he asked any prediction , sir richard confessed , would verge on the foolhardy yet many in the industry see potential for a lasting strategic and industrial split across the atlantic , with the british government of prime minister tony blair moving even closer to the united states and away from the continent there s a huge mountain to climb to get into the united states defense market , said gordon m adams , the director of security policy studies at george washington university and an expert on transatlantic defense issues the uphill slog that european defense contractors already faced in the united states , he said , will now be complicated by political hurdles if france and germany want to rebuild the bridge , he said , they are going to have to build more than half of it but another possibility , some argue , is that the fallout from iraq will prod europe s governments to redouble their efforts to consolidate the military equipment industry and define common goals dassault is trying to wean itself away from military contracts ten years ago , arms sales generated 70 percent of its revenue , while civilian falcon corporate jets yielded just 30 percent , according to charles edelstenne , dassault s chairman today the ratio is the reverse as far as equipment is concerned , mr edelstenne said in a recent conversation , we are not yet at a time where you have sufficient willingness to establish a european defense industry when will that time come \?

' she said they ca n't believe it s a woman the doorwomen say they have struggled with skepticism from their male colleagues you need a man s strength to help tenants with heavy bags and ward off intruders , the men say and having a woman at the door might offend the tenants' sense of decorum men are supposed to open doors for women , not the other way around , said jose peraza , a veteran upper east side doorman at 225 east 95th street doorwomen laugh those concerns off they think women are too delicate , ms alonzo said but i shovel snow , i carry three bags in each hand , i do everything it s not a problem as for security , ms estrada keeps a baseball bat in the lobby just in case anybody that messes with me is going to get hit with the bat , she said for the record , none of the doormen or women interviewed for this article had ever had a problem with intruders once a man was riding a bicycle in the driveway outside her building and behaving in a menacing way , ms estrada said she shooed him away the real reason women do not man the door , according to many in the industry , is that the jobs are passed on almost exclusively through personal connections that tends to perpetuate the status quo these are very good jobs that guys hang on to , said jim grossman , a spokesman for the realty advisory board on labor relations , which negotiates labor contracts on behalf of the buildings and their managing agents they do n't retire young and change , which generally comes slow in regard to hiring women , comes even slower in this case on account of that the doorwomen confirmed that connections mean everything in their business elizabeth fonseca , who works the door at 1225 park avenue at 95th street , is the daughter of the building s former superintendent , and she spent her early years living there ms estrada was a friend of the super at her building other doorwomen have similar stories if you do n't know someone or are not family related , you 're not going to get this job , said elizabeth floody , who has been working the door for two months at 107 west 86th street , between columbus and amsterdam avenues but some say sexism in the industry is more than just a matter of buddies hiring buddies panathy hill , a former correctional officer , filed a lawsuit nine years ago against a number of upper east side buildings and their management company , douglas ellimangibbons ives , saying the company told her it hired only men ms hill , who is black , has also accused the buildings and the firm of discriminating against her because of her race \( there are few black doormen on the upper east side , according to people in the industry , where christmas tips for doormen tend to be the highest \) according to court records filed in the case , not one of the 500 doormen working in buildings managed by douglas elliman was a woman ms hill s case is now in settlement negotiations and , through her lawyer , madeline lee bryer , she declined to comment it is hard to say whether ms hill s case , which was topic a among upper east side doormen a few years ago , will push the industry to start hiring more women some doorwomen said they had not heard of it but they all agreed that women would start lining up for the job if they knew what it was like most women do n't even think of it as something they 'd like to do , ms estrada said for me it was kind of a step down but i would n't leave this for my old job i'm so comfortable here it is true that the opportunities are limited after 30 months , doorpeople with local 32b32j reach their maximum salary of 1656 an hour , mr hamill said , just over 33 , 000 a year christmas tips can add another 5 , 000 or more to that but the health benefits and pension are good , and there is plenty of job security , he added more important , some doorwomen said , is the total absence of stress , and the feeling of warmth and camaraderie in their buildings this job is a second home for me and my family , ms alonzo said an immigrant from ecuador , ms alonzo learned english on the job with help from the building s residents she has seen the residents' children grow up , and she is trusted by the adults to watch them , walk the tenants' dogs , park cars and water plants both of her own adult children have been baby sitters for children in the building , ms alonzo said the only career disadvantage ms estrada could point to was the clothing those stiff suits and caps are n't ideal for a woman some women are turned off by the uniforms , ms estrada said but you can adjust the fashion to suit you i have mine tailor made , and the only thing missing is the polyester and that stripe down the side of the pants photos blanca alonzo has been a doorwoman for almost 10 years i carry three bags in each hand , i do everything , she said \( carol halebian for the new york times \) \( pg b1 \) blanca alonzo , a veteran doorwoman on the west side , carried a rug

las vegas , oct 7 i think they have to be the most beautiful animals on the face of the earth , rick thomas said during his magic act at the tropicana here on monday he was talking about white tigers \( he uses five in his stage show \) , the kind of animal that on friday night critically injured roy horn of the longstanding las vegas act siegfried roy but in las vegas , as on broadway , the show must go on none of the audience members interviewed after the show said they were afraid of the tigers , though the thought that something could happen did cross their minds after the attack on mr horn on tuesday he was in critical but stable condition at the university medical center here several people , like ivy carter , 34 , of washington , said they had chosen to see mr thomas s show precisely because of the tigers with siegfried roy on hiatus indefinitely , mr thomas has a monopoly on white tigers in magic shows here meanwhile , at the rio , the metamagic performers penn teller do a trick known as the bullet catch the feat , in which an illusionist seems to use his mouth to catch a bullet shot from a gun , has led to the death of at least 14 performers , said ben robinson , who has written a book on the subject the mauling of mr horn and the shuttering of the siegfried roy show signal two major changes in las vegas one is the realization that beyond the dazzle and slickness , illusion is only illusion up to a point the performers are indeed vulnerable to danger the other is the potential end of an era of familybased acts that were ushered in with the debut of the pair s show in the early 1980 s magic traditionally has always been a very dangerous form of entertainment , said tony hassini , chairman of the international magicians society , which has more than 37 , 000 members taking a lady and suspending her on the edge of a sword or cutting her in half , although it seems so simple to the audience , always has a danger , especially when a buzz saw is used siegfried roy used a buzz saw every night , and that was not a very safe trick i believe that there have been more magicians who have died on stage than any other form of entertainment the attack on mr horn , many people say , will have many repercussions for las vegas on a smaller scale , performers predicted , theaters will be reluctant to present wildanimal acts because of the liability involved , and those that do may have to erect barriers between the audience and the stage on a bigger scale , the incident comes just as las vegas seems to be snapping back to an era that predated siegfried roy part of the significance of their original show was that although they came out of the foliesberg re at the tropicana , they managed to persuade a hotelcasino , the frontier , to put on a show that did n't have topless women and appealed to children as well as adults it helped mark the changing of las vegas from a land where entertainers like frank sinatra and elvis presley come to be reborn to the capital of eyepopping , brainnumbing spectacle that it is today either directly or indirectly , the show led to a cavalcade of performances that have defined las vegas for 20 years , from knockoff shows like efx to magic acts like lance burton to more modern spectacles like cirque du soleil a combination of the huge popularity of siegfried roy shows and the chain reaction of familyoriented casinos set off by the initial success of circus circus changed the image of las vegas laura deni , who runs the web site broadwaytovegascom , said the city went from ladies in long gowns , men in tuxedos , champagne , male crooners and sophisticated sex to a land where you had to watch out where you swing your arms in the casino or you 'll hit a toddler in a stroller but that era seems to be ending , and las vegas is returning to its playgroundforadults image circus circus has been in a revenue slide for several years treasure island has removed its swashbuckling pirate show , renamed itself ti and will start a showgirl revue called sirens of ti on oct 26 other casinos that have opened in the last decade are focusing more on exclusive dance clubs , trendy superlounges and attracting touring popchart acts than on resident theater spectacles in the tradition of siegfried roy even cirque du soleil has spun off an adult cabaret show called zumanity , which opened two months ago ultimately , it seems , the casinos are realizing that the entertainers are here to please gamblers , and children ca n't gamble the pendulum is swinging back to the allencompassing motivator sex , ms deni said the style of dress may have changed , the music onstage may no longer be male crooners in tuxedos , but the buying public wants the sexy playpens and bedrooms caught somewhere between family and adult entertainment are the magic and circus shows , which , thanks to siegfried roy , have fully developed into a las vegas genre of their own magic and circus acts have always had a certain macabre appeal magicians and circus performers are often billed as deathdefying , the man on the flying trapeze is daring , according to the song , and the thrill of the animal acts was that the performer s head could be bitten off by the gaping mouth of a lion to paraphrase a quotation attributed to houdini , nobody likes to see another person get killed , but they like to be nearby
washington , dec 25 president bush s campaign has settled on a plan to run against howard dean that would portray him as reckless , angry and pessimistic , while framing the 2004 election as a referendum on the direction of the nation more than on the president himself , mr bush s aides say some advisers to mr bush , increasingly convinced that dr dean will become their opponent next fall , are pushing to begin a drive to undercut him even before a democratic nominee becomes clear but others said the more likely plan would be to hold back until after the democratic contest had effectively ended , probably no later than march as a bush strategist put it , dr dean s rivals are doing a great job for us with their increasingly tough attacks on him voters do n't normally vote for an angry , pessimistic person to be president of the country , matthew dowd , a senior bush adviser , said as he pressed the antidean theme this week in an interview at mr bush s reelection campaign headquarters they want somebody , even if times are not great , to be forward looking and optimistic as the second part of a twopart strategy , mr bush s aides said , the president will set out upbeat themes and policy ideas , starting with the state of the union address on jan 20 that would be part of a drive to buttress what polls show is a growing feeling among voters that the country is on the right track the goal , mr bush s advisers said , is to make the election more about the nation s success in confronting great challenges than about mr bush personally by depersonalizing the election at least when it comes to mr bush the white house is seeking to counter democratic efforts to play to sharp antibush sentiment among democrats dr dean , a former governor of vermont , has repeatedly said that the key to victory next year is heavy turnout among democrats alienated by mr bush dr dean s advisers rejected the bush campaign s characterization of their candidate s appeal they said dr dean had laid out a criticism of mr bush s record and an agenda for how he would manage the nation told of mr bush s strategy , dr dean s campaign manager , joe trippi , said he was skeptical that it would work that s the only shot they have , to depolarize the race , mr trippi said if the race is a referendum on bush , that s going to be very polarizing we got to where we are because the democratic field underestimated us , and the longer the bush team underestimates us , the better it is for us our opponents have been mimicking these attacks that the bush folks said they are going to use against us for a while now and where have we gone \? from zero to 31 percent in the latest abc poll mr bush s advisers said they had studied the reelection campaigns of ronald reagan in 1984 and bill clinton in 1996 , which were built around the idea of bolstering the nation s sense of hope as a way of lifting the incumbent s prospects the advisers cited as a model the sunny morning in america advertisements that were a foundation for mr reagan s 1984 campaign it is difficult for democrats if the country s direction continues to go positive , both on the economy and on the war on terrorism , mr dowd said because their rationale for a campaign has been wrong track or pessimistic making people feel bad about what s going on today instead of making people feel good about what s going on today several democrats said they were worried that a prolonged assault on dr dean from democrats and republicans most recently with the controversy over his remark that the united states was no safer after the capture of saddam hussein could pose a problem if he won the nomination dr dean has been attacked with increasing ferocity by representative richard a gephardt of missouri and senators john kerry of massachusetts and joseph i lieberman of connecticut mr bush s campaign aides left little doubt that if dr dean captured the nomination , those democratic criticisms would be put to service in republican television advertisements next year , a tactic that would fit with the white house s general goal of keeping mr bush personally above the partisan fray in discussing what they described as preliminary strategic decisions , mr bush s advisers said they were prepared to adjust to any changes in what has already proved to be a most unusual presidential election campaign although they said that most of their planning was now based on the supposition that dr dean would win the nomination , mr bush s campaign officials said they did not consider that certain the president s political team , led by karl rove , his senior adviser , is working on policy initiatives that would help build support among specific blocs of voters for the socalled investor class , the team is planning a push for private investment accounts in social security and expanded taxfree savings accounts mr bush is also developing an immigration proposal , expected to be announced early next year , that would make it easier for workers from latin america to move to the united states legally that step could help mr bush appeal to hispanics , a fastgrowing segment of the electorate and one that mr bush and mr rove have worked hard to win over given the nation s close partisan division and the president s status as the embodiment of one side of that divide , his advisers said that one key to victory was to depolarize the electorate as much as possible and draw more support than the other side from the middle they said mr bush was in a stronger position than dr dean to do that the country has been , for a number of years , politically polarized , mr bush s campaign manager , ken mehlman , said we have a demonstrated ability to simultaneously mobilize our base and also attract the support of ticket splitters and swing voters , so we can reach across that divide a little bit so far , none of the democrats appear to be doing that republicans outside the bush camp argued that it made sense for the white house to seek to take the spotlight off mr bush and shine it on dr dean make it a referendum on dean is he ready for prime time \? said mike murphy , a republican consultant who worked for senator john mccain s presidential campaign in 2000 gary l bauer , a conservative who ran for president in 2000 , said the opponent does not have the values of the american people and i'm assuming dean will be the nominee dean is so positioning himself as the angry leftwing candidate that if nominated he s going to take whole sections of the country and make them impossible to win for the democratic party but mr bush , some of his own strategists and advisers said , has a long way to go if he wants to avoid being portrayed as a divisive figure who motivates democrats to vote against him as a result , the white house is considering using the state of the union address to propose a big new national goal that would not be partisan or ideological and would help rally the country behind mr bush s leadership , an outside adviser to the administration said the possibilities floated by the white house include a major initiative for the space program or an ambitious health care goal like increasing life expectancies they want to have the president talk about an important national goal that is big and a unifying theme , the adviser said photo republican strategists are reportedly preparing to depict howard dean as reckless , angry and pessimistic he spoke monday in exeter , nh \( photo by getty images \)
baghdad , iraq , april 13 the chaos that turned baghdad into a place of nightmarish lawlessness during the past five days began today to give way to tentative signs of a city determined to begin the long climb back toward order the change came almost a week after american troops broke into the heart of baghdad and uprooted the government of saddam hussein , setting loose the demons of popular revenge almost everywhere , from the revival of some bus service in the city center to squads of iraqi volunteers venturing out into what had been freefire zones to recover the putrefying bodies of the dead , there were signs that the 45 million people of baghdad were beginning to reclaim the edges of a normal life with fires still burning in government ministries , and the national library and its centuries of archives added to the roll call of institutions ransacked and burned , the frenzies of the looters were not yet spent violence also abounded in saddam city , a large slum in eastern baghdad that is home to an estimated two million people , most of them shiite muslims long repressed under mr hussein and his ruling coterie of sunni muslims but in a break from the pattern since early wednesday , the looters were outnumbered , for the first time , by taxis , buses carrying passengers rather than plunder , street stalls selling eggs and fruit and vegetables , and enough casual motorists and pedestrians to create a distant facsimile of a normal sunday in baghdad a clear manifestation of a tightening american grip came with the appearance early today of the first american military helicopters to venture over the city center troopcarrying chinooks with gunners visible at the side and rear were flanked by deadlier apache attack helicopters bristling with rockets as they clattered low over the republican palace presidential compound that was until recently the central seat of mr hussein s power from there , the helicopters arced across the tigris river , over neighborhoods that american commanders still consider dangerous because of the armed iraqi militiamen that may still be lurking there with none of the helicopters firing , and none appearing to come under attack from the ground , the impression left among iraqis who rushed to their balconies to watch was that the american forces wanted to convey a message to wouldbe looters and hardcore remnants of mr hussein s government that message appeared to be that the united states was now the nearly unchallenged power in baghdad , as in many other cities north and south , and that time was running out for those intent on scoresettling over the brutalities of mr hussein or striking out against the american forces who toppled him general tommy r franks , the allied commander in the region , said today on on cnn s late edition that the military had divided baghdad into 55 or 60 block zones for patrolling , and that there were pockets of 5 to 25 hardcore fighters in about 10 to 15 of those zones perhaps stung by the anger of many iraqis at the americans' failure to send troops to curb the looting and burning , military commanders began accelerating plans to revive civil administration at a meeting at a sports club near the palestine hotel , the temporary marine corps headquarters in eastern baghdad , american civil affairs officers began meetings with iraqi government officials in an effort to revive essential city services , including the police and fire departments that disintegrated as the american forces advanced on monday , the americans will hold meetings at all government ministries to begin planning how , with almost all the ministries' equipment and records stolen or destroyed , government can be revived traffic flow , and in some places traffic jams , were encouraged by the american troops pulling many of their checkpoints off the streets , to be replaced by discreetly stationed tanks and other armored vehicles at the same time , some american patrols appeared to have adopted more muscular tactics in dealing with looters , after days when bands of marauders had the city s thoroughfares to themselves , assured by the americans' inaction that they could act as they pleased in one encounter beside al jumhuriya bridge on the tigris s eastern bank , a marine patrol ran into a confrontation between a group of about 30 men and a driver in a black mercedes the incident , in a neighborhood littered with burnedout cars from battles last week between american troops and government loyalists , appeared to escalate after the mercedes driver abandoned his car , and another man ran down the street with a bullet wound in his upper arm the marines immobilized the driver and two other men with plastic handcuffs and ordered about 25 others to sprawl face down on the ground while they were searched get your nose in the dirt ! one marine shouted , again and again the company commander , lt lewis langella , of new haven , said the patrol s assignment was to make a show of force in the neighborhood , after marine units in the area had come under fire overnight
the windows on one side of desiree bentsen s thirdfloor apartment overlook the hot concrete courtyard of the ocean village public housing complex in the rockaways coarse arguments , loud rap music and sometimes the sound of gunfire waft in but the windows on the other side of her apartment overlook a very different scene the atlantic ocean and a pristine stretch of beach and let in the roar of the waves , the squawks of sea gulls and the smell of salt air on thursday afternoon , it was scorching outside mrs bentsen has no airconditioning in her apartment , but the kitchen window let in a continuous cool sea breeze mrs bentsen , 47 , has lived in this spacious threebedroom apartment for seven years the monthly rent is 900 , 500 of which is covered by federal section 8 rent subsidy vouchers she has struggled to raise her four children this is the only thing keeping us here , she said , pointing out her kitchen window to the beach there s a lot here i never wanted my kids to grow up with , but i look out at that beach and i say , 'no , we ca n't leave' once you go down by that water , it s another world all the arguments and bad feelings people here have , it s all gone ocean village , in queens , is not the only public housing complex in new york with water views there are housing projects in the rockaways and coney island within sight of the ocean , but none are as close as ocean village from the front , the ocean village complex , aging beige buildings from beach 56th street to beach 59th street in the arverne section of the rockaways , looks like most blighted urban projects the residents are mostly poor , and outside the entrance , young men gather around loud radios and hold 40ounce bottles and smoke marijuana but out back , the complex abuts the boardwalk and hot concrete gives way to clean , white sand the ocean , clean and kelpy , bears no resemblance to the murkier water at popular city beaches like coney island and orchard beach a minute s walk across the sand from the complex s rear gates , the waves roll in gently and there are three lifeguard stands but most ocean village residents do not use the beach or celebrate its proximity mrs bentsen recalled the way her uncle from lefrak city would rave about her 400permonth oceanfront deal he used to come over and have a fit about the view , she said he 'd say , some people just do n't realize what they got do you realize people pay thousands of dollars to be on the beach \? ' i just chuckle at him most residents , she said , do not take advantage of the beach or even the views jonathan l gaska , district manager for the local community board 14 , said that a lot of the working poor in the rockaways do not know how to swim it s a little bizarre for an oceanfront community , he said , but it happens to be the case they do n't have a place to learn , and you do n't learn to swim in the ocean the waves can get rough hopefully , that will change , he continued , because they 're building thousands of units of affordable housing in the next five years and we 've insisted on a rec center so they can learn for now , rather than learning how to swim , the children in ocean village ov to its residents learn how to deal with trouble just across the elevated a train tracks are ocean bay houses , also known as the edgemere houses , long considered one of the city s most crimeridden projects people here got mad troubles in their life , said steven rocker , 22 , who moved to ocean village when he was 12 you do n't want to sit on no beach to relax residents smoke something or drink something for that , he said you go through your own personal hell this place is like something out of dante mr rocker never traveled to manhattan until after high school , but now he is an undergraduate at columbia university on full scholarship on thursday , he stood on a sunbaked stoop in ov keeping a sharp eye on his younger siblings and nephews he wore a dorag under his baseball hat , some jewelry , and expensive sneakers mr rocker grew up the third of eight children in a firstfloor apartment with oceanfacing windows the sea breeze , not an airconditioner , kept them cool he pointed toward the complex s centerpiece twin basketball courts you see hundreds of people watching a basketball game there and not one person down on the beach , he said it s almost like that ocean does n't exist when my friends from manhattan want to go to the beach , i say , 'come to the one at my house no one s ever on it' they 're shocked to see a housing complex on a beach he continued when i moved here , i thought i 'd be on the beach the whole time people think that just because we have it , we 're going to use it , but a lot of black people do n't swim he asked a teenage girl walking by in a fulllength sweatshirt to explain to a stranger why the kids do not use the beach it s dirty , she said without stopping one of mr rocker s younger brothers mumbled we go to the beach we swim , we get tired we stop and we come home another brother , jonathan , 21 , said that the beach had a reputation for being dirty , even though that is no longer true proving his point , nikeema perry , 12 , said , the beach is dirty , and her friend goldie campbell , 13 , added yeah , and the seaweed gets on your feet ocean village is flanked to the east and west by empty lots waiting for redevelopment the elevated a train is to the north and a rickety boardwalk and endless ocean horizon are to the south right now , schools of bluefish feed 50 yards offshore behind the complex , and large striped bass are running but there are few fishermen here the sand and water seem to be as clean as they are at long beach and jones beach to the east but even on hot summer days only a few dozen people are here sometimes the lifeguards outnumber beachgoers the lifeguards know the ov residents and keep many of them from going in past their waist one recent evening , von miles , 31 , and her sisters kiki and sunshine barbecued on the beach everyone comes to visit us here says the same thing 'i ca n't believe you 're right on the beach if i lived here i 'd be out there every day , ' said von miles and our first summer here , we did come here most every day but then it gets to be like , it s just there ms miles lives with her daughters , fantasia miles and taniqua watson kiki miles , 26 , has a balcony with a view of the ocean both kiki and von said that ocean village was inconvenient and dull , but a far cry better than the family shelters they lived in before this many young people speak of feeling trapped here they lack the money to go elsewhere and the patience for the long train and bus rides we 've always had the beach , so it s no big deal , said eddie banks , 17 , who lives in an oceanview apartment from which he can flick a cigarette butt onto the boardwalk what we really need is stores and movie theaters somewhere to go we 're stuck here with nothing to do in mrs bentsen s kitchen , her oldest son , bruce smith , 26 , made himself some chocolate milk and said he was saving money as a security guard to move anywhere else but here i would n't care if there was a beachfront casino down there , he said i would n't go but some residents still do on thursday , sean debouse , 12 , and dwayne banks , 13 , met outside the projects and ambled down to the water both dropped their pants on the beach and pulled on their bathing suits and made their way through the waves they looked back toward ov , which rises high out of the sand whoa , it s cold , said sean feels great , said dwayne photos thursday afternoon was a scorcher , but only a small group took advantage of the beach near the ocean village housing complex in arverne , queens steven rocker , 22 , below left , who has lived at ocean village since he was 12 , says

several days after lyndon b johnson trounced barry goldwater in the 1964 election , robert r mcmillan , then an ambitious young assistant to former vice president richard m nixon , accompanied his boss to a gathering of republican party leaders at the waldorfastoria in a suite on the 35th floor , mr mcmillan watched former president dwight d eisenhower thwart any move by goldwater to siphon off supporters and form a conservative splinter party eisenhower dictated a bigtent statement about party inclusiveness and sent goldwater downstairs to read it to the reporters , said mr mcmillan , recalling the event one recent afternoon in his sunny office filled with memorabilia at his melville law firm then they sent me downstairs to keep an eye on barry , with instructions to come right back upstairs and tell them if he diverged from the script which he did n't , by the way the qualities that presumably endeared mr mcmillan to the republican party chiefs diplomacy , party loyalty and attentiveness to detail , among them have served him well over the years as he built a reputation as a consummate insider and consensusbuilder beginning with nixon , every republican president has tapped him to serve on a commission or head up a task force , and so have most republican governors of new york although his own political career stalled when he lost a 1988 bid for the united states senate to daniel patrick moynihan , the democratic incumbent , he found his niche in his law practice mr mcmillan , 69 , may appear to be a throwback to civicminded lawyers of an earlier generation he devotes hundreds of hours a year to various social causes , including the long island housing partnership , which he helped found and which has built 1 , 300 units of lowcost housing on the island he has headed various foundations , answered numerous calls for probono help , and collected a stream of citizenoftheyear citations from groups like the boy scouts , helen keller services for the blind and the american jewish committee as the genial cohost of faceoff , a weekly political discussion program seen on thursday evenings on wliw , mr mcmillan is in his 10th year of taking the conservative side in his ongoing debates with lawrence levy , the newsday columnist who serves as his liberal foil and as the managing partner and chief rainmaker at mcmillan , rather , bennett farinacci , which he founded in 1991 , mr mcmillan has built up a small but respected local law firm small but respected may be fast becoming an anachronism over the winter , five of the nine partners resigned , taking along with them their billings , just over 4 million of the firm s 8 million in annual billings william cornachio and walter gumersell , both specialists in corporate transactions , went to rivkin radler in uniondale barry cohen and james rigano , environmental lawyers , departed for certilman balen adler hyman in east meadow and guy germano , who practices landuse law , left to start his own firm on march 3 , mrmcmillan announced that what was left of his firm had been acquired by fischbein badillo wagner harding of new york although mr mcmillan and three colleagues at his firm leslie r bennett , richard fogel and donald farinacci became partners in fischbein badillo , none will be a name partner we did n't sell the firm because partners had left , mr mcmillan said the plan had been to sell the firm for a while we considered several possible candidates we realized we needed to be able to offer our clients more services the transaction establishes a long island beachhead in influential manhattan legal circles , apparently for the first time richard fischbein , fischbein badillo s managing partner , said that the firm was continuing to scout for at least one additional acquisition , and possibly more we think there s great potential on the island for a regional law firm , and we are looking to expand , mr fischbein said there is an enormous amount of business that is not being covered and handled the way it should be long island is grossly underlawyered by underlawyered , mr fischbein said he meant that most long island law firms were too small to provide a full range of legal services to commercial clients with about 100 lawyers , fischbein badillo is considered a mediumsize firm in manhattan but on long island , it immediately becomes one of the largest firms , behind rivkin radler in uniondale , which has about 130 lawyers john vn klein , the chairman of the meyer suozzi english klein , the mineola law firm , said that today s sluggish economy would be conducive to more such deals the advantage the new york guys have is that they have the economic resources to make attractive offers , he said they can give stability to suburban firms , which are suffering from the economic downturn some see the spread of manhattan firms on long island as inevitable for years , manhattan law firms have been expanding north into westchester and connecticut and west into new jersey , said jerry kowalski , a manhattan consultant who brought mcmillan , rather to the attention of fischbein badillo what did not exist was a significant new york law firm with a presence on long island mcmillan , rather is a repository of really fine lawyers who were dealt a body blow with these guys walking out the door , mr kowalski said the departures will not affect the acquisition , he said the important thing is that the partners coming on board now are all players , are all well regarded they share the same view about how to conduct a successful law firm as does fischbein badillo fischbein badillo is known for its expertise in real estate law as well as for the political careers of some of its partners herman badillo , for example , is a former congressman and new york city deputy mayor james j florio was once governor of new jersey raymond b harding is vice chairman of the liberal party s new york state chapter and robert f wagner was mayor of new york city mr cornachio , who left mcmillan , rather in january , said that fischbein badillo may find its entry into the local legal services market will take longer than it seems to anticipate the long island market is based on relationships , strong personal and professional relationships , and these can take an entire career to develop , he said you ca n't just create a corporate law practice on long island by bringing in a great corporate lawyer you ca n't create the relationships , frankly , by buying law firms mr mcmillan said he was enthusiastic about the future but admitted to pangs of nostalgia for the law firm that is no more i think of what we accomplished as a law firm , he said but then he quickly added , if we had n't accomplished all we had , fischbein badillo would never have been interested in us photos robert r mcmillan s law firm , mcmillan , rather , bennett farinacci , has been acquired by a manhattan firm , fischbein badillo wagner

this year s stock market rally has added more than 100 billion to corporate america s depleted pension funds , but even that has not been enough to offset forces that continue to weaken the funds if all of america s 500 largest companies had to make good on their promises to workers and retirees immediately , they would have to plug a 259 billion gap in their pension funds , according to a study by standard poor s which will be published soon a year ago , even though stock prices were lower , the same companies were considerably closer to meeting their obligations , being only 212 billion short that is because their obligations to their workers have spiraled up at an even faster pace than stocks have risen one obvious reason for this is that as the baby boom generation ages , many more people are starting to claim their money another factor is that many pension calculations incorporate several years' worth of data , to smooth out sharp fluctuations , so the market shocks of the last three years are still working their way through the system finally , an otherwise positive economic development , low interest rates , is an albatross on the funds because they magnify the value of future pension obligations in today s dollars whatever the reasons , for the nation s corporate pension funds to have lost ground in this year s bull market suggests that the troubles that flared up in the bear market will not be easily cured , and almost certainly not by market gains alone but after more than a year s search for solutions , officials with responsibility for the 16 trillion sector remain sharply divided on what to do some companies have found ways to bring their plans up to full funding , including general motors , which started the year deep in the hole but others , like ual , the parent of united airlines , remain burdened with woefully underfunded plans and lack the cash to make even the minimum contributions required by law they are lobbying for changes in the rules most retirees continue to get their pension checks , to be sure the pension system is not out of money , nor is it expected to run out in the foreseeable future but over all , companies' pension assets are slipping further behind their obligations , renewing questions about whether enough money will be there for all of the 44 million americans who have been promised pensions sooner or later the nation s pension predicament has major implications for investors for starters , it is difficult for them to calculate how much cash any given company s pension liability will pull away from the business about threefourths of america s 500 largest corporations , as well as tens of thousands of smaller businesses , offer traditional , definedbenefit pensions and are required to set aside money to pay them while the companies are required to make good on them , these debts are rarely stated clearly on corporate balance sheets the investor has to figure out where the money s going to come from , and how it s going to affect the growth of the company , said howard silverblatt , the standard poor s analyst who is compiling the pension study the financial accounting standards board will begin requiring more disclosure of pension data starting in 2004 , but not enough to satisfy the many critics of pension accounting even if the cash problem were solved overnight , another uncertainty would remain where exactly should all the pension money be invested \? for years , fund managers have collectively parked about twothirds of their assets in stocks but with the population aging and more and more pensions coming due , some specialists say a larger share should be shifted to safer investments like bonds if that happens , the implications for the markets would be huge as for solving the current cash crunch , bush administration officials say recent events show that the current pension law is not enough in two of the most destructive recent pension failures , bethlehem steel and us airways both followed the funding rules but ended up with huge deficits anyway , costing steelworkers and pilots more than 1 billion in lost benefits when the plans finally defaulted earlier this year , administration officials pushed for an array of amendments to tighten the law they called for making companies take the looming costs of older workers into account when calculating pension debt , for example for fuller disclosure of pension information and for higher pension insurance premiums for companies with highrisk investments but none of the administration s ideas have attracted much support in congress , which must enact any amendments business groups and some unions have argued that the pension law is outdated and punitive and needs to be relaxed , not tightened unable to agree on a solution , congress let a temporary relief measure that has reduced pension obligations for the last two years expire today as a result , companies will suddenly owe substantially larger contributions about 35 billion more in 2004 , according to government projections
nelson love fame by edgar vincent illustrated 640 pp new haven yale university press 35 the terror before trafalgar nelson , napoleon and the secret war by tom pocock illustrated 255 pp new york w w norton company 2495 two hundred years ago , britain faced invasion by the french , using overwhelming force backed up by futuristic american technology by may 1803 , when the british reluctantly went to war , napoleon bonaparte had a thousand troop carriers on order , specially designed to ship a quarter of a million men across the english channel submarines and torpedoes were being secretly developed in france by the american inventor robert fulton a french cartoon shows the sea before dover swarming with landing craft and the skies above thick with military balloons while advance patrols , flown in on kitestyle parachutes , prepare the ground for the cavalry and infantry divisions advancing steadily through an early version of the channel tunnel horatio nelson was ready for them sea power was britain s only hope of repelling invaders , and admiral nelson said no girl ever longed for a husband more passionately than he desired to smash the french fleet if they are above water i will find them out , he promised his superiors never mind maneuvers , he told his captains and commanders , always go at them it took him just over two years to hunt down and confront the enemy at trafalgar a very few days , almost hours , will put us in battle , he wrote in a briefing for the prime minister it is , as mr pitt knows , annihilation that the country wants , and not merely a splendid victory honorable to the parties concerned , but absolutely useless in the extended scale to bring bonaparte to his marrow bones numbers only can annihilate nelson was one of those unlikely people like joan of arc and mrs thatcher who know what they are up to long before it looks remotely plausible to the rest of the world small , pale and puny , the sixth child of a country parson with little naval background , he insisted on going to sea at 12 in spite of family misgivings depressed by his slim prospect of promotion , he decided a few years later to bypass regular career paths by becoming a hero he appeared to be the merest boy of a captain i ever beheld , said prince william , king george iii s naval son , who , like many others , found it hard at first to take nelson seriously he is more in need of a nurse than a wife , the prince reported when nelson married at 28 in 1787 i do not really think he can live long the crowds who turned out to greet him later whenever he set foot on dry land often felt dubious at first about this stringy little fellow , 5 feet 6 inches tall , with one blind eye and only one arm his weight cannot be more than 70 pounds , a german onlooker wrote , watching nelson return home through a europe in uproar after his victory on the nile a more miserable collection of bones and wizened frame i have never yet come across bewilderment if anything increased his luster his diminutive stature reinforced britain s sentimental view of itself as plucky little john bull standing up to the mighty french dictator nelson was mobbed in piccadilly by londoners who pulled his carriage any journey through the countryside became a triumphal progress nelson s career , in short , has always looked like a publicrelations man s dream or , in 18thcentury terms , the stuff of fairy tale his decisiveness , coupled with dazzling strategic boldness and simplicity , made him seem virtually invincible at sea behind the scenes he was also pretty much irresistible gentle , modest , considerate , intuitively kind and phenomenally efficient where his great contemporaries , bonaparte and the duke of wellington , treated men and units as pieces on a chessboard , nelson made each sailor feel like an individual from the start , he knew how to restore confidence to a nervous young midshipman , disarm or immobilize an obstructive superior , win over a mutinous ship s company and energize a demoralized fleet as if by magic that magic is one of the key themes of edgar vincent s nelson , which takes apart the operational machinery that powered his subject s upward thrust , laying out and reassembling the nuts and bolts with methodical and enthralling precision nelson invented the modern system of mission command , based on consultation and coordination rather than hierarchical obedience , pioneering methods of management that are standard practice on wall street today vincent \( himself briefly a naval officer before joining imperial chemical industries and ending up an international management consultant \) draws on a lifetime s expertise to analyze nelson s style of supportive teamwork , intelligent delegation , unconditional commitment and ultimate personal reponsibility as far as his officers were concerned he had himself to exercise the broad personnel or human relations function , which would today in similarsized enterprises occupy large bodies of managers and staff and frequently be accomplished less well
london with the legendary actormanager david garrick serving as shakespeare s high priest , bardolatry swept mid18thcentury england to the point that painters , too , reproduced the words and scenes that actors portrayed onstage the artists' response on canvas , of course , was not entirely devotional prints of their paintings also earned them a pretty penny in this they were helped by the public s growing familiarity with at least a dozen shakespeare plays , notably hamlet , king lear , othello , romeo and juliet and richard iii thus images of a crazed old man on a stormy heath and of a pale young man facing a ghost on a castle rampart and of teenage lovers embraced in death were immediately recognized by london theatergoers just as two centuries later henry v might be thought to resemble laurence olivier and prospero would be imagined with john gielgud s features , garrick and other leading actors of his day came to personify many shakespearean characters to paint garrick in action therefore meant exploiting an 18thcentury star system as much as paying tribute to the playwright and garrick , for one , gleefully used prints of these paintings for his selfpromotion but the shakespeare art boom far outlived garrick , who died in 1779 shakespeare in art , an intriguing exhibition at the dulwich picture gallery in london through oct 19 , traces the fashion between 1730 and 1860 as it continually adjusted to prevailing art styles , from rococo and neoclassical to romantic and preraphaelite by the early 19th century the phenomenon had spread beyond england , with shakespeare being adopted as a symbol of the romantic movement in western europe even in france , which had long resisted the english dramatist , painters like eug ne delacroix , th odore chass riau and gustave moreau all found inspiration in shakespeare s plays and players but while the 70 paintings and drawings in this show mirror changing taste in art and theater , they also illustrate the difficulty of capturing either shakespeare s verse or the drama of performance on canvas or paper whether read or seen , shakespeare is constantly on the move frozen in an image , poignant moments risk becoming lifeless charles lamb , who with his sister mary wrote tales from shakespeare in 1807 , particularly disliked paintings of performances what injury did not boydell s shakespeare gallery do me with shakespeare \? he complained to have 'heavyhanded romney s shakespeare deafheaded reynolds s shakespeare' instead of my and everybody s shakespeare to be tied down to an authentic face of juliet ! to have imogen s portrait ! to confine the illimitable still , after decades in which many of his plays had been mutilated in the name of simplicity or happy endings , the rediscovery of the real shakespeare in the mid18th century brought a sense of excitement and even national pride that proved contagious among english painters william hogarth , that most perceptive of social observers , was among the first to respond in 1730 with falstaff examining his troops from henry iv , part ii , which can be seen here hogarth s betterknown 1745 portrait of garrick as richard iii was not lent for this show , but that play is well represented nathaniel dance s later version of garrick in the role hangs beside samuel drummond s 1814 edmund keane as richard iii and charles robert leslie s 1813 george frederick cooke as richard iii macbeth is another popular subject , with the dagger scene of act ii illustrated in johann zoffany s 1768 david garrick as macbeth and hannah pritchard as lady macbeth in 1789 john boydell , who later stirred lamb s wrath , organized a shakespeare gallery with the idea of commissioning paintings of 72 scenes from plays by the time the gallery closed in 1803 , 56 had been painted and engraved for printing some painters , though , decided to recreate shakespearean moments without reference to the stage , going directly from page to canvas some opted for poussinlike neoclassicism , as in james barry s king lear mourns the death of cordelia and dance s timon of athens but others released their imagination , none more than henry fuseli , the most bardolatrous of artists , whose 1783 weird sisters from macbeth remains one of the most striking shakespearean images in art this exhibition also includes fuseli s gertrude , hamlet and the ghost of hamlet s father and his vision of queen katherine , the moment when henry viii s rejected wife is visited by spirits this scene from henry viii , a play rarely performed today but popular in the late 18th and 19th centuries , is again evoked by william blake , whose pen and watercolor works frequently portray the supernatural in shakespeare in france , where shakespeare s work was only just making its mark in the early 19th century , painters also preferred to imagine scenes from his plays delacroix s hamlet sees his father s ghost , his death of ophelia and his hamlet and horatio in the graveyard , all drenched in romanticism , underline this artist s strong response to hamlet moreau was in turn drawn in 1851 to a sleepwalking lady macbeth emerging from bloodred drapes around the same time in england , the preraphaelite movement embraced shakespeare with renewed passion unfortunately , perhaps the single most famous shakespearean image in art , john everett millais s ophelia , has remained a few miles from here at tate britain , but millais s ferdinand lured by ariel from the tempest is on display , while other works by frederick , lord leighton and william holman hunt keep the preraphaelite flag flying also reconnecting art to the theater are scenery designs by the grieve family from the mid19th century , when theaters competed for audiences as much with the extravagance of their productions as with the renown of their actors finally , the bardolatry theme comes full circle with a section on latterday images of shakespeare himself , like john faed s 1850 shakespeare and his friends at the mermaid tavern and william blake s imaginary portrait of shakespeare but it is sir walter scott at shakespeare s tomb , attributed to david roberts , that best summarizes the exhibition the image of scott bowing before the bust of shakespeare in holy trinity in stratforduponavon well symbolizes the generations of artists who also joined the cult photos the weird sisters \( 1783 \) from macbeth in the eye of henry fuseli \( photo by royal shakespeare theater \) \( pg e1 \) johann zoffany s charles macklin as shylock \( 1768 \) , above , and at left , james barry s neoclassical vision of king lear mourns the death of cordelia \( 1774 \) \( photo by maugham collection at the theater museum \) \( photo by john jefferson smurfit \) \( pg e5 \)
warangan , indonesia on the earthen floor of a makeshift outdoor theater , high above the plains of java , two male dancers sway in increasingly frenetic steps to the clamorous beat of gongs and drums their faces are covered by outsize masks , depicting tiger heads crowned with towering sprays of green and blue peacock feathers suddenly , the masks are put aside , and the dancers fall to the ground they move on all fours , crawling stealthily , like tigers on the prowl the village spectators murmur with approval the dancers , they believe , are possessed with the spirits of the tigers this extraordinary spectacle was a rendition of the reog ponorogo , a javanese dance drama performed at important village events weddings , circumcisions and the like the tiger head and peacock feathers are combined in a megamask to symbolize the belief that in ancient times the two animals lived in harmony , working together to defend their territory the reog was one of the bestreceived pieces at the recent five mountains dance festival , now in its second year dance groups from five villages that perch on the mountains around the eighthcentury buddhist monument , borobudur , participated in a program that stretched from the heat of the afternoon into the cool evening the festival was organized in the warangan village as a way of showing that javanese dance forms have survived in situ , and are not just relics hauled out for big city shows or tourists while the reog was choreographed in a way that seemed centuries old , other dances were obviously influenced by television and american culture a presentation of the traditional topeng ireng dance \( literally , black mask \) was updated with costumes designed to resemble the gear of american indians a troupe of male dancers from the village of mendut entered the makeshift stage with headdresses of long white feathers instead of the normally bare feet of indonesian dancers , they wore kneelength soft boots adorned with feathers their faces were smothered in makeup gashes of red around the cheeks , plenty of black above the brows drums and flutes kept up a fierce , relentless beat for repetitive steps that were only a little more complicated than stomping on the earth people here like to imitate , said sutanto , a jazz musician from mendut who helped organize the festival , and who , like many indonesians , uses only one name this is the pure influence of american cowboy films of the 1950 s , he added some people say the way the dance is performed comes from the dayaks , he said , referring to an indonesian tribe in kalimantan it s not it comes directly from television one of the dancers dressed as in american indian gear said after the show that before the addition of the feathered costumes a few years ago , the troupe had worn outfits fashioned from coconut leaves the grafting of americana onto one of java s most traditional and generic dances is particularly unexpected in this part of indonesia after independence from the dutch , the communist party held sway in these mountain villages , and indonesia s first president , sukarno , was hugely popular here sukarno s affection for the nonaligned movement , an effort to find a middle ground between the soviet union and the united states , was accompanied by a commensurate disdain for all things american he disparaged the united states as a covetous imperial power warm feelings for sukarno are still evident in the area the main room in the house of one of the village chiefs here is decorated with a now rare poster showing sukarno s distinctive silhouette but since sukarno s demise in the mid1960 s , these villages have become more prosperous tobacco and flower farms bring in the relative wealth that in turn has brought in television and lately , the occasional western tourist from the nearby upscale amanjiwo hotel male dancers were dominant in all the pieces at the festival , with women performing in cameo roles or in the equivalent of a corps de ballet by contrast with the male world up here , female dancers dominate in the court dances performed in the palaces of the sultan in yogyakarta , the cultural capital of java down on the plain the prominence of male dancers in the village derives from the historical importance of warriors in java , said sardono kusumo , indonesia s bestknown choreographer many of these dances are influenced by the wars in the colonial period , he said some of them relate to the story of diponegoro , who camped out in the mountains diponegoro , a 19thcentury hero , was the first member of the javanese royal court to take up arms against the dutch he organized a guerrilla force among peasants and was eventually captured in nearby magelang one of the most appreciative members of the festival audience was eko supriyanto , 31 , a dancer who trained with sardono and in 2001 toured the world with madonna , an american who uses only one name mr supriyanto , who comes from magelang , said that many of the dances , and much of the movement , remained true to the way he danced as a child as a young boy , he said , he rode legless horses fashioned from bamboo and painted wild colors , the most common prop in javanese dances about battle the dancers , playing riders , wore kneelength britches in screaming oranges and reds in one piece called kuda lumping putra , a generic name for a dance with bamboo horses , the dancers heads were covered with black curly wigs their feet were bare , though some dancers had ankle bracelets to the beat of a gamelan orchestra gongs and drums the dancers imitated going to war the steps were high and staccato , gestures were sharp , and in their left hands , dancers carried whips with which they snapped the ground none of the dancers are professional , but earn their livings as drivers and laborers , sutanto said the javanese still keep their own distinct calendar when it is time to plant rice , harvest the crop or show fealty to ancestors , sutanto said , the men come together to perform some of these ritual dances photos dancers in the five mountains dance festival , now in its second year , in the javanese

as a saxophone s melancholy music bounced off the tile walls of the subway station at union square in manhattan last thursday afternoon , yury gitman was hunched over a laptop computer , trying a different kind of performance a thin stream of wireless internet bandwidth was trickling down the stairs to the downtown platform of the n , r , q and w lines , two levels below the street , and mr gitman was trying to get the tenuous link to send what he said would be the first email message from this deep in the new york city subway system mr gitman , an artist who is teaching a class at the parsons school of design in collaboration with eyebeam , a media arts organization , intended the stunt to be a demonstration of his magicbikes ordinary bicycles rigged with networking gear that transforms them into wireless internet access points , using the wireless fidelity , or wifi , technology now built into many laptops the bikes can connect to and amplify the signals of wifi transmitters in the vicinity or they can tap into a cellular data network , as was the case with a magicbike parked at the top of the subway stairs that bike formed an impromptu network with the magicbike on the platform with mr gitman after some snags , mr gitman and his students cheered as their holiday greetings to mayor michael r bloomberg went through just in time , too magicbikes lose their magic when the batteries die , as was starting to happen \( a spokeswoman for parsons said on friday night that the mayor had not yet responded \) free wireless internet access has proven popular in bryant park and other public spaces in manhattan a few subway patrons demonstrated curiosity , but none hauled out a laptop to use the magicbikes mr gitman insists that new yorkers need free internet access in the subway and everywhere else it s a quality of life issue , he said , and the technology is cheap and easy to set up although ads from companies like intel suggest that the world is blanketed in wifi signals , mr gitman said , coverage is in fact still limited he said he used bicycles because they blend into the urban fabric , and because cyclists tended to be socially conscious and politically active the bikes are not good at allowing the use of their wireless abilities when they are in motion , but mr gitman plans to put his class to work next semester solving that problem when this project is successful , he said people will say , 'a bicycle with internet access so what \? photo yury gitman prepares to send email wirelessly from the subway at union square \( photo by nancy siesel the new york times \)
it s like something mysterious is going on this season , like 'this ca n't be happening , can it \? first baseman carlos pena said , looking around the detroit tigers' clubhouse at yankee stadium before last night s game you have to wonder if there s some unreal power at work pena glanced about furtively , as if at any moment he would see an apparition , a poltergeist or some other unearthly character clank past the ballplayers and out to the field here are some of the stupefying moments pena and his tigers playmates have witnessed this season on a 32 pitch , a base runner attempts to steal second it s ball four , but the runner , unmindful of this , overslides second and is tagged out mike maroth has a nohitter into the eighth inning against baltimore , then loses the game it is one of his 20 defeats this season , making him the first pitcher in 23 years to lose 20 games pena hits three home runs and drives in seven runs in one game , but the tigers lose , 109 , to cleveland after blowing leads of 60 and 97 a promising rookie outfielder , cody ross , hits his first major league home run , a grand slam , in the third inning of a game , then tears a knee ligament while running out a bunt in the eighth he s finished until next spring these miscues and mishaps , multiplied over the dreary season , have resulted in the spectacular opportunity for the tigers , who are 37106 with 19 games remaining , to become the team with the most losses in major league history , surpassing the 120 losses of the amazin' mets in 1962 turns out , there were no supernatural creatures in the tigers' midst , at least none that anyone could put a finger on it seems it has all transpired from human , as it were , error last night the uninspired yankees strove to hand the tigers a victory , but detroit was having none of it the tigers allowed two runs in the eighth to break a tie and absorbed their customary defeat , this one by 42 if the season ended today , rather than in two and a half weeks , the tigers might well go down as the worst team ever , or at least with slightly baser statistics than the '62 mets \( the mets , for example , had a 240 batting average , the tigers 237 the mets had a 504 earned run average , the tigers 514 \) sure , pena continued , sometimes we hear , 'hey , you guys should n't be in the league' and then they 'll bring up our batting averages , or pitching records , just to stick it to us and , i mean , i'm talking about even in our own ballpark not only are the tigers the worst team in the american league second worst is tampa bay , with 21 more victories than the tigers they are not lovable losers , as the mets were from the standpoint of many fans and the news media the mets were an expansion team , and no one expected much , and that s what they got not much they were built with veteran castoffs from other teams and , as their manager , casey stengel , had said , the yout' of america we come in there and you never seen anything like it in your life , stengel said , a quotation that appeared in jimmy breslin s classic book on the 1962 mets and gave rise to the book s title i find i got a defensive catcher , only he ca n't catch the ball the pitcher throws wild pitch throws again passed ball throws again oops ! the ball drops out of the glove and all the time i am dizzy on account of these runners running around in circles on me and so forth makes a man think you look up and down the bench and you have to say to yourself , 'ca n't anybody here play this game \? alan trammell , the firstyear tigers manager , who played shortstop on the 1984 champion tigers , takes a different tack from stengel he seeks eternal optimism we 've lost all those games , but we 're still competitive , he said i mean , we do n't do everything bad it s just that it s hard to get everything right for nine innings we 're trying our best my motivational tool amidst all this \? i tell them we will get better and try to forget that record but , brandon inge , the team s catcher , said , it s in the back of our minds he added you come to the ballpark after a loss the night before and you try so hard to focus and win a game and get out of this hole , and then it seems something always happens to sink us back in the rut the tigers , unlike the mets , have been around since 1901 they have won a bunch of pennants and championships , and can boast hall of famers like ty cobb , charlie gehringer , hank greenberg and al kaline but their roster now seems crowded with zealous but inexperienced young fellows who have spent part of this season or last season in the minor leagues they appeared awed by the big parks , and the lights are so bright compared with class aa fields what happened to this team , which has n't had a winning season in a decade \? some blame the owner , mike ilitch , for not spending money on players some blame bad trades by general managers but the fact is , as outfielder dmitri young , their lone allstar game representative , said when we 're hitting , we 're not getting pitching and when we 're pitching , we ai n't getting hitting he added but this is no psychiatric ward here the mood is cool , like tonight we turn this thing around well , even stengel could grasp a positive straw in that wondrous season of 1962 without losers , casey theorized , where would the winners be \?

in the latest iteration of one of television s oldest preseason traditions , the actor brad garrett , of the cbs comedy everybody loves raymond , did not show up to work last week in a bid to wangle a higher salary the show went into production anyway leslie moonves , the chairman of cbs television , ordered the first script of the soontobegin raymond season to be rewritten , excluding mr garrett s character , according to executives involved with the show such is how these confrontations usually play out the actor does not come to work because he wants the show to suffer without his presence then the network orders the show to go on without him , hoping to ratchet up the pressure by proving that no actor is indispensable the networks' version of hardball has usually prevailed in recent years but this year s preseason ritual has a twist several executives at different networks said this year had seen more holdouts though the executives declined to name names , they said the networks had been more accommodating to the demands of some actors and their agents one reason for this changing balance of power the increasingly desperate desire of networks to hold on to what has become the rarest , most precious resource in television the hit comedy as warren littlefield , an independent producer who encountered dozens of actor holdouts in his eight years running nbc entertainment , put it the value of success , which is harder to achieve than ever before , is greater than ever before no new comedy has generated bona fide hit ratings in at least five years and networks are going to greater and greater lengths to keep the comedies that do perform decently the most publicized example nbc significantly increased the salaries of the friends cast members in each of the last three seasons , just as the show seemed headed for its last episode cbs is in a similar position with raymond , by far the network s bestrated comedy cbs is seeking to extend the show at least through a ninth year , which would be the 20042005 season but its star , ray romano , has already indicated that he wants this to be his last year mr romano s own contract situation ignited the present conflict he signed a oneyear deal that will pay him the biggest salary in television history , more than 15 million an episode just as the show was beginning production last week , three other members of the cast , including patricia heaton , who plays mr romano s wife , called in sick while some quiet progress has been made with the other cast members , enough to get them back on the sound stage , mr garrett went public he complained about the disparity between his salary , estimated at 150 , 000 an episode , and mr romano s in some ways , the reallife situation resembles a theme of the show , in which mr garrett plays the sad sack robert , forever jealous of his more popular brother , ray but mr garrett has some reason to be concerned before mr romano made his oneyear deal , mr garrett and the other cast members had signed new twoyear deals , with the hefty salary increases in the final year ms heaton , for example , will make from 11 million to 12 million if there is a ninth season , according to two executives who are aware of her deal her current salary puts her at about 10 million a year that second year is now at risk if mr romano walks away and he can afford to do so unlike the other cast members , mr romano is one of the show s creators and owns a percentage of the show s profits already a success in syndication , raymond is likely to generate hundreds of millions in profits for years to come even if the dispute is resolved , there could be other repercussions mr moonves had publicly speculated that he might try to keep the show going even without mr romano , perhaps as a spinoff for mr garrett but mr moonves might not want to do more business with mr garrett , who twice before has sought and won pay raises mr moonves declined to comment on the situation but cbs s hunger for a comedy hit could offset any anger that cbs executives feel toward mr garrett les may say today that this has made him lose interest in a spinoff , but if he really believes a spinoff with brad garrett will work , he 'll find a way , said garth ancier , a longtime program executive who is now with time warner as a consultant for cnn and the wb network mr ancier added that this year had been an unusually busy one for actor holdouts this is beyond anything i 've seen before , he said he speculated that the networks' huge success in the spring , when they pulled in a record total of more than 9 billion in advance sales from advertisers , known as upfront sales , had opened the floodgates of renegotiation last year the networks could say they were under economic pressure and were holding the line on raises , mr ancier said now the actors see the strong upfront and the economy recovering so they say to their agents 'let s go get that money back'
washington it was april 19 and the marine battalion i was commanding in iraq was leaving samarra to begin a long trip south through baghdad along highways we had fought on just a few weeks earlier major combat operations were coming to a close , and we were headed to the small southcentral city of diwaniyah to undertake the uncertain business of postconflict operations for most of us diwaniyah was personal the site of skirmishes we had with fedayeen , iraqi army special forces and local militias , the city represented my battalion s blooding the scene of our first important combat action and casualties by returning , we had the chance to root out remaining resistance and help restore a community wrecked by war as marines only a few days out of intense combat , it was natural for us to want to undertake the rooting out part first going after the resistance with a vengeance fortunately , our division commander , maj gen jim mattis , had a different approach he shifted our focus from conventional combat toward winning over the people in so doing , his thinking went , we could isolate the baathist insurgents and criminal elements and make them easier to detect and eliminate his guiding principle was do no harm so he detached our m1 tanks and armored personnel carriers and , together with artillery , returned them to kuwait armored vehicles are threatening by their very presence not to mention being magnets for rocketpropelled grenades general mattis believed that any engagement with remaining insurgents could be handled by dismounted infantry we also tried to be aware of iraqi sensitivities we dressed down during foot patrols , removing body armor and helmets arabs consider sunglasses distasteful , so we took off our wraparound oakleys when talking to iraqis and with varying degrees of success , we directed young marines not to look at iraqi women and teenage girls most of our efforts were straightforward we cleaned , painted and picked up trash at schools wherever we went , we used wave tactics waving at locals , especially children , and smiling at pedestrians after capturing 5 million during a raid on suspected baathists , we donated a large sum to a leading mullah for the needy who were not directly eligible for reconstruction money it seemed the right thing to do and not buying the peace and it worked the mullah became a grateful and helpful friend of the marines in our efforts to overcome rampant crime and pursue remaining baathists , we flooded neighborhoods with foot patrols , talked with townsfolk to gain information and laid ambushes in problem areas we avoided rotating companies so that each company could develop a relationship with a specific village when outofwork iraqi soldiers began staging demonstrations , we invited their leaders into our compound and listened to their grievances while offering them cold sodas by treating them as equals , we eased frustrations and countered a descent toward armed confrontation none of these techniques were particularly novel to the marines and they were practiced by our battalions across southcentral iraq to be sure , we all benefited from the shiite majority in the region , most of whom were joyous at the overthrow of saddam hussein but it is undeniably significant that in the succeeding five months of postconflict presence , not a single marine was killed because of hostile action i turned over the third battalion , fifth marine regiment last summer and headed back to the united states for a new assignment when my fellow marines return to iraq in march , they will pick up where our battalion left off and work once again to win over iraqi hearts and minds this philosophy will stand in contrast to the new gettough strategy adopted by american forces in the sunni triangle that area , north and west of baghdad , is the scene of the most intense violence against army soldiers , a dynamic much more volatile than the one we faced in southcentral iraq yet it would be a mistake to think that the lessons we learned ca n't be applied to cities like tikrit and villages like abu hishma in the spirit of reconciliation , this may be a good time to hold back the iron hammer and extend our velvet glove devising effective counterinsurgency techniques is a challenge and based on my own experience not necessarily the official marine corps position i do believe additional considerations for fighting the insurgency may be needed certainly , united states forces need to press their attacks against regime loyalists and foreign fighters but for every reported military success there are also reports of sunni iraqis who are angered by tactics like knocking down doors of houses and shops , demolishing buildings , flattening fruit groves , firing artillery in civilian neighborhoods and isolating large segments of the population with barbed wire fences whatever the shortterm tactical success of these techniques , they present several problems in america s longterm effort to win support of the iraqi people
vadodara , india , june 30 it seemed the moment of vindication had finally arrived for zahira sheikh last month ms sheikh , a 20yearold indian muslim , took the witness stand in the trial of 21 hindu neighbors whom her family accused of burning 11 muslims and 3 hindu workers alive in their family bakery the victims included her older sister , three women , twin 4yearold girls , two babies and her uncle , who was hacked to death the killings were among the most gruesome in the antimuslim riots last year in gujarat state , which killed about 1 , 000 people , a vast majority of whom were muslims in the year since , the young woman with pigtails and a primary school education has emerged as the public face of the victims in this industrial city of 15 million in western india vowing not to marry until the perpetrators were punished , ms sheikh tearfully told journalists and human rights investigators how jeering hindus , enraged by the killing of 59 hindus in another part of the state , had surrounded the family business , best bakery , and set it on fire she and her mother , brother , grandmother and sisterinlaw made it to the roof and survived but when her day in court finally came , ms sheikh said none of her neighbors had been involved , according to a lawyer present she has since disappeared she said , 'these are the people who saved me , ' said muhammad hanif sheikh , a muslim lawyer who watched the proceedings in dismay she helped the accused over the next several days , the relatives who survived with her took the stand and also exonerated the defendants by the end of the trial , 24 of the 73 witnesses had recanted on friday a judge , citing a lack of evidence and shoddy police work , acquitted the 21 defendants and set them free the verdict has drawn nationwide attention and has prompted local muslim leaders and human rights groups to accuse hindu nationalists of sabotaging efforts to prosecute hindus involved in the riots they say ms sheikh and her family were threatened , bribed or both local muslims said the faith of india s 140 million muslims in the country s commitment to equal justice was again being tested in gujarat the state s hindu nationalist rulers and the police were accused of standing by as muslims were killed during the riots now they are being accused of generating a climate of fear and skewing the judicial process hindu nationalists , who were overwhelmingly reelected to office here early this year , denied the charges and said the scale of the attacks on muslims had been exaggerated the state s population is more than 80 percent hindu they said they had played no role in ms sheikh s case madhu shrivastav , a hindu nationalist who , some witnesses said , accompanied ms sheikh to court , said he had never met her i do n't know who she is , said mr shrivastav , a burly , bearded man i never talked to zahira in a report issued today in new york , human rights watch said that 16 months after the riots , no defendant had been convicted muslims are being prosecuted under india s strict antiterrorism laws , the group said , while no hindus are the police are downgrading charges against hindu defendants , filing false charges to cover up their own role in the violence , deleting the names of the accused and failing to pursue rape cases , human rights watch said raghuvir pandya , the state prosecutor in ms sheikh s case , has been widely criticized for failing to aggressively crossexamine the witnesses who recanted the lawyer said public prosecutors could not push witnesses too hard if you put some hardness on the witnesses , he said they could complain to the government iqbal ahmed ansari , a local muslim businessman who aided ms sheikh s family before she disappeared , called for the intervention of the federal government , which is also controlled by hindu nationalists from the bharatiya janata party prime minister atal bihari vajpayee leads the largest nationalist party but is generally seen as more moderate where ms sheikh is and why she changed her story remain a mystery indian journalists are hunting for her across india one theory has it that mr shrivastav has hidden her in bombay he called those reports rubbish another involves her getting married and moving to new delhi hindu neighbors said they remembered ms sheikh as a friendly woman whose father had died of a heart attack a month before the riots piyush patel , one of the police officials who arrived after the fire , said ms sheikh had been weeping her mother , who was more composed , identified nine of their hindu neighbors as part of the mob the police did not arrive at the scene until 12 hours after the fire she used to be very angry when she would narrate the story , mr ansari said she used to be very emotional in the months after the attack , ms sheikh seemed to come into her own , he said giving interviews and testifying before various commissions , her girlish face became a symbol of the horror of the riots her family also began to benefit financially , muslim leaders said receiving aid from muslim charity groups , as well as payments from the state and national governments , they lived in various donated homes but the houses mr ansari described all sounded smaller than the living quarters that were part of the spacious threestory family bakery the charred building lies in ruins today , but it appeared to have been one of the finest homes in a lowermiddleclass neighborhood filled with nearly all hindu families today , looters have torn out every window , door and electrical cable , and a family of pigs has bedded down on the first floor on the second story , the partly melted legs of a girl s plastic doll lie on the floor a halfmile from the scorched bakery , mahender jadhav , one of the freed defendants , sat in his house today and hailed the verdict he said ms sheikh was now finally telling the truth what can i say \? these people came from outside , said mr jadhav , 26 , who owns a scooter repair shop i was at home i do n't know photo hindus attacked muslim houses and shops in gujarat state in february 2002 they were retaliating for an attack by muslims the day before on a train carrying hindu activists , in which 58 people were killed \( agence francepresse \) map of india highlighting vadodara a woman disappeared from vadodara after

to the editor i enjoyed a parrot s life for me \( aug 10 \) , paul griffiths s essay on his trip aboard the qe2 with his parrot and it made me recall my own crosscountry journey in 2001 with my precocious african gray parrot , katie , and two cockatiels , chloe and gus my family was moving , and we had our birds in the businessclass cabin with us on a flight from san francisco to boston i will never forget settling into our seats on the plane , and hearing katie start to sing her favorite song , somewhere over the rainbow , from her box , which was legally nestled under the seat in front of me the flight attendants , who had been too busy to notice the birds as we came on board , now did double takes and stopped to meet katie fortunately , the earlymorning flight was nearly empty and none of the other passengers seemed bothered by the songs , whistles and running commentary from the floor terry somerson south dartmouth , mass
even on their breaks and during lunch , the women say , they were told not to speak spanish , their first language their supervisors mimicked their accents and derided their culture , they say , and if they complained about it , they suffered even more five women who worked at a manhattan branch of the national cosmetics retailer sephora have filed a class action lawsuit in federal district court in manhattan charging the company with violating their civil rights by enforcing an english only rule the women sued for discrimination on the basis of national origin with the help of the united states equal employment opportunity commission and on behalf of hispanic workers at sephora , which is based in san francisco they would tell us , even on our lunch break , not to speak spanish , said one of the women , mariela del rosario , who worked as a sales consultant for three years in sephora s rockefeller center outlet , which closed last year that was really uncomfortable for us because it s our first language , and it is what we grew up with another woman , leydis rodriguez , who worked as a sales consultant at sephora for about three years , said that on the floor and during free time , the managers did not allow employees to speak spanish i understand on the floor , she said yesterday , but when i'm on my lunch break , do n't tell me what language i have to speak i did n't feel comfortable at all whenever they would come into the break room and say , 'whatever you have to say , it has to be in english , ' i would walk outside and have my lunch in rockefeller plaza or on the concourse and not in the store raechel adams , a lawyer with the eeoc , said none of the women currently work at sephora some quit and others were fired , she said , after complaining of harassment in a statement issued yesterday , a spokeswoman for sephora said that while the company had not seen the suit , sephora does not tolerate discrimination of any kind it continued , furthermore , we do not have , and never have had , an 'englishonly' rule in our workplace
danny boyle s arresting and terrifying new movie , 28 days later , seems to make it official microbial plagues have displaced nuclear winter in the public s mind as the way the world will end although written and produced before we had anthrax spores in the senate , national debates about smallpox vaccination , searches for weapons of mass destruction in iraq and global anxiety about sars , its release in this country at this time feeds on now routine fears of an unanticipated microbiological catastrophe mr boyle s imagined catastrophe begins with a brief and hectic scene in which animal liberationists , masked like terrorists , break into a lab and release tightly caged chimpanzees who are infected with something called the rage virus after a brief silence and an abrupt jump to 28 days later , we learn that london is deserted and eerily quiet , manchester is on fire and few remain alive anywhere in england what kind of virus is this and how could it have decimated the populace \? through the experiences of james the bike messenger who awakens from a collisioninduced coma 28 days after the animal facility breakin , then leaves his london hospital bed to wander through the nearly empty city we learn that the behavior of the virus is unprecedented and shocking transmitted by even minute amounts of bodily fluid , it unfailingly produces dramatic effects within 20 seconds , transforming its victims into enraged , wildeyed , indiscriminate killers , with superhuman athletic abilities , the capacity to survive for at least several days , and a compulsion to bite the uninfected under these ground rules , the few who remain uninfected do so only by killing any of the infected who get too close or by incarceration , as in a hospital the infected , with their surprising virusinduced hyperkinesis , are every bit as frightening as the spookily revitalized ghouls in the classic horror film night of the living dead , who were allegedly transformed by radiation from a venus space probe , an emblem of the anxieties of the 60 s what should we make of this fictional virology \? as in the tradition of horror movies , in which disbelief must be surrendered to authorial imagination , the science is far from accurate no virus of a conventional sort can act in this way viruses abide by the rules of molecular biology , and it simply takes too long for a virus to grow copy its genes , make new proteins and particles and then spread in a new host to produce symptoms so quickly and there is no known virus that causes disease in every infected individual \( the only curtsy to virological realism is the suggestion that the rage virus , like many known animal viruses , is apparently confined to a few closely related species here primates , as deduced from the robust health of gracefully flying birds and blissfully galloping horses and from the contrast with violent chimps and human beings \) the lack of microbial verisimilitude in 28 days later may surprise viewers who recall the vividly accurate depiction of heroin withdrawal in mr boyle s popular trainspotting \( 1996 \) in that film , the hero s delirium even includes a turbulent dream about a tv quiz show whose contestants provide \( correct \) answers to technical questions about the human immunodeficiency virus \( hiv \) and we are far from outbreak , another microbiological thriller , in which the offending virus behaves much more realistically , and the response is marshaled by certified federal agencies still , despite the virological liberties of 28 days later , mr boyle and his collaborators , including alex garland , who wrote the screenplay , have imbued the virus s imaginary properties with a sense of political and social purpose , giving the movie a power that exceeds what is often expected of the scifi horror genre for one thing , there are the symptoms of the infected , the rage and aggression that seem so hard to explain when they surface in real life as freeway shootouts or acts of terrorism and there is a linguistic link between this unconventional rageinducing virus and the condition we call mad cow disease a disease that , incidentally , takes years or decades , not seconds , to develop after infection with atypical agents called prions mr boyle has referred to his pathological invention as a psychological virus by this seductive but unscientific term he may have meant something akin to what happens to soldiers in battle for example , as portrayed by the facial contortions in leonardo da vinci s remarkable sketches of renaissance warriors displayed recently at the metropolitan museum of art but such psychological change does not require contact with blood or anything else in a sense , mr boyle s rage virus , with its nearly instantaneous transformation of the recipients , acts more like a powerful drug , like a poison or a narcotic but an epidemic of drugs is only a political or social metaphor lacking a microorganism s capacity to multiply , a drug would soon be diluted to the point of ineffectiveness as it was passed in blood from victim to victim mr boyle has mentioned his fascination with recent news reports that the polio virus has been synthesized in a laboratory from its chemical components but , regardless of whether such synthesis is cause for worry about terrorism , a synthetic virus would still need to duplicate in conventional ways , so it could not behave like the fictional rage virus
baghdad , iraq , may 14 the third infantry division has been told to stop sending troops home and to step up patrols , a move that reflects mounting concerns within the bush administration about security in baghdad , military officials said today with the arrival of l paul bremer iii , the new american administrator for iraq , american officials are conducting a fresh look at how many forces are needed to secure the city and the rest of the country american military officials said mr bremer was concerned that the united state does not have sufficient forces in the capital and believed that the troops need to be more active in combating disorder the push for a new security assessment comes just several weeks after american military commanders prepared a plan to sharply reduce the american military presence in iraq by the fall that approach was predicated on the optimistic assumption that security would continue to improve it also reflected defense secretary donald h rumsfeld s desire to limit the size of the postwar american troop presence in iraq but while the bush administration insists that it is making progress in stabilizing iraq , each week provides vivid illustrations that remnants of the saddam hussein government and criminal gangs are on the loose , suggesting that the pentagon s troop reduction plan may need to be rethought at the pentagon , a senior defense department official said that american commanders in iraq were reviewing the appropriate mix of forces to stabilize baghdad , and that some numbers of troops would likely have their departures affected the official said it remained unclear whether these troops would remain in baghdad for additional days or weeks or longer gen peter pace , the vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , testified before the senate appropriations subcommittee on defense that about 142 , 000 american troops are now in iraq , about 49 , 000 of them in the baghdad area there are additional troops arriving as we speak , general pace said he said the first armored division is now bringing 20 , 000 troops into iraq , adding that gen tommy r franks , the allied commander , and his top aides are reviewing the situation on the ground to see how they might reset themselves in the city to be able to provide the kind of patrolling and presence that s necessary to provide the stability they need baghdad s residents have repeatedly complained that security is poor the united states hopes a new police force can provide law and order but the effort to establish an effective police force has gone slowly just when the third infantry division will leave is unclear some units may stay longer than others after serving as the main attack in the war many soldiers hope it will not be long brig gen lloyd b austin said the deployment of the division could take a little longer the third infantry division fought its way to baghdad and sent its tanks into the center of city since the marines moved out of the capital last month , it has been the main american force stationed here the division has been preparing to transfer responsibility for baghdad security in the next weeks to the first armored division , which is being sent here from its base in germany some of the third infantry division s units have in fact already left iraq one battalion , 139 , which is equipped with the army s multiple launch rocket system , has returned to a staging area in the kuwaiti desert , a way stop on the redeployment to the united states an infantry battalion , 141 , was supposed to have left tonight but then the departure of the division s troops were abruptly put on hold after oral instructions were received from v corps , the army headquarters that oversees army forces here that none of the third infantry division s forces were to leave the change caught soldiers by surprise and caused more than a little grumbling among the troops to improve security , the division had been told by v corps to increase patrols i think we have good control , but we may need to police up some meatheads , gen austin said
in the days before 9 11 , new yorkers were regularly treated to fierce legal battles between mayor rudolph w giuliani and groups that claimed that he was suppressing their first amendment rights the range of such controversies was considerable , and involved groups like the ku klux klan , the brooklyn museum of art and new york magazine now , the bloomberg administration is preparing to defend one of the last remaining cases from that era , a trial stemming from mr giuliani s decision in 1998 to fire a police officer and two firefighters who wore blackface during a labor day parade in queens all three men have sued , saying the city violated their rights to free speech to prepare for that trial , which is scheduled to start next week in federal district court in manhattan , mr giuliani has given a 137page deposition in which he defends the city s decision to fire the men in it , mr giuliani , who is expected to be called as a witness in court , comes across as most new yorkers recall him before the terrorist attacks brought out a gentler side candid , blunt , outspoken and combative my opinion as mayor of the city , he declares , was that police officers and firefighters engaging in this kind of conduct disgrace the uniform , and make it impossible for them in the future to function in a fair and impartial way at another juncture , the former mayor seems to almost take over the deposition , reading at length from a document to support his position until one of the firefighters' lawyers asks him to stop editorializing i'm testifying , the mayor retorts , continuing to read from the document , a transcript shows a deposition is a traditional part of a civil suit in which lawyers are allowed , before trial , to question witnesses under oath a copy of mr giuliani s deposition was obtained from the new york civil liberties union , which represents the officer who was fired , joseph locurto the civil liberties union contends in its suit that mr giuliani directed the officer s firing in violation of his rights you ca n't fire someone simply in retaliation for the content of their speech , christopher dunn , associate legal director of the group , said yesterday it s our contention that that s exactly why they fired him mr dunn indicated in pretrial hearings that he might challenge the former mayor s credibility on his reasons for firing the officer we dispute his contention that he was concerned about the racial sensitivity of a police officer , he said yesterday , in light of his long history of supporting racially insensitive actions by the police department mr dunn acknowledged that mr giuliani s image had changed since the attacks , but he cited his legacy of hostility to the first amendment the city maintains that the firings of the men were permissible because their conduct would prove disruptive a lawyer for the city , jonathan pines , said through a spokesman , we feel very confident in the strength of this case , and expect to prevail in court a representative of mr giuliani , daniel s connolly , said he would not comment before trial the 1998 labor day float , titled black to the future 2098 , was part of the annual parade sponsored by the broad channel volunteer fire department and ambulance corps one participant , a firefighter , reenacted the killing of james byrd jr , a black man who was dragged to his death behind a pickup truck in texas the previous june mayor giuliani condemned the incident and said of officer locurto at the time , the only way this guy gets back on the police force is if the supreme court of the united states tells us to put him back the officer , then an offduty 30yearold patrolman , admitted participating in the float , and apologized publicly for what he called a big mistake the two firefighters jonathan walters and robert steiner denied any racist intent in the deposition , which was taken last april , mr giuliani said he believed that officers or firefighters who participated in such a vicious display of racism would become a serious liability to the city he also said that despite his assertions that the men should be fired , had new evidence turned up , the police and fire commissioners would have been perfectly free to disagree and not fire them at one point , mr giuliani was asked whether controversy over the police response to that summer s socalled million youth march in harlem , influenced his response to officer locurto s act none , absolutely none , mr giuliani said

that he had not read much about marxism beyond the introduction of the communist manifesto dashiell hammett , the mystery writer , invoked the fifth amendment they and nearly 500 others were summoned to testify in secret before senator joseph r mccarthy , the wisconsin republican whose dogged efforts to root out communist sympathizers shocked and riveted the nation 50 years ago today , the transcripts of those closeddoor sessions of the senate s permanent subcommittee on investigations were made public , shedding new light on a contentious chapter in american history all of the senators involved , and most of the witnesses a list that included mundane civil servants and army engineers as well as prominent personalities like copland and james reston , the washington bureau chief of the new york times are now dead historians who have reviewed the documents say they do not support mccarthy s theories that , in the 1950 s , communist spies were operating at the highest levels of government instead , the papers , which chronicle 161 private sessions in 1953 and 1954 , when the infamous lawmaker was chairman of the subcommittee , reveal how he used secret proceedings to weed out witnesses who could adequately defend themselves against his browbeating only those who looked weak or confused , or who cast suspicion on themselves by asserting their fifth amendment right against selfincrimination , were later called to testify in public what these transcripts show , above all , is someone who is desperately trying to push a conspiracy theory , using all the badgering , bullying tactics in private that he was known for in public , said david oshinksy , a mccarthy biographer and professor of history at the university of texas at austin who has reviewed excerpts of the papers there is no smoking gun here , and there is really nothing that will do mccarthy or his advocates any good yet there are some nuggets of news the papers reveal , for instance , that g david schine , the independently wealthy , unpaid consultant who worked for the committee because of his close relationship with its chief counsel , roy m cohn , was involved in interrogating witnesses a fact that surprised several historians oh my , said thomas c reeves , another mccarthy biographer , upon learning of mr schine s role i never heard of that the documents also provide an eerie foreshadowing of the moment that proved to be mccarthy s downfall on feb 18 , 1954 , while investigating charges of espionage within the army , the senator lashed out at gen ralph zwicker , a decorated world war ii hero , branding him as unfit to wear the uniform for his refusal to provide classified information about an army dentist who was under surveillance as a suspected member of the communist party that exchange , which occurred in private but was subsequently made public , enraged president dwight d eisenhower many historians say it signaled the beginning of the end of mccarthy s career but what historians did not know , until now , was that just before general zwicker testified , one of his subordinates , lt col chester t brown , received very similar treatment colonel brown , who never appeared in public , also refused to provide information about the dentist , prompting mccarthy to explode in rage i will listen to communists refuse to answer , the senator declared i will listen to no army officer protecting a communist and you 're going to answer these questions or your case will come before the senate for contempt , and i intend to shove it all the way through i am sick of this , sick and tired of it elected in 1946 , mccarthy first made headlines in february 1950 , when he publicly blamed failures in american foreign policy on communist infiltration of the government , particularly the state department a senate investigation later dismissed the charges as a fraud and a hoax but several events , including the conviction on perjury charges of alger hiss , a former state department official , and the arrests of julius and ethel rosenberg on charges of conspiracy to commit espionage , helped mccarthy inflame fears during the red scare in 1953 , with republicans having taken control of the senate and the white house , mccarthy was given the chairmanship of the investigations subcommittee and quickly stepped up the pace of its hearings in 1952 , the committee held six executive , or closed , sessions in 1953 , mccarthy held 117 the following year , the televised armymccarthy hearings gripped the attention of the nation for 36 days the transcripts released today were kept sealed in the national archives until 2001 , when the senate historian s office received permission from the subcommittee to begin preparing them for release experts say they portray mccarthy as a man increasingly given to believing the conspiracy theories he set out to investigate
seoul , south korea , july 25 for joo sung ro , a 72yearold veteran of the korean war , the truce that ended the conflict half a century ago heralded an age of prosperity for south korea , and an era of a divided korean people the armistice served as a bittersweet reference point for the men and women of his generation its 50th anniversary , coming sunday , made mr joo reflect on a north korea that , to him , has remained unchanged and on his own society , which seems to be changing beyond recognition we cannot resolve any problems by talking with communists that s my experience , said mr joo , a retired colonel when communists are weak , they want to talk when they are strong , they want to invade other countries there should be another war against north korea , the same way the united states succeeded in iraq and afghanistan no doubt his words would have sounded jarring in the fashion center of downtown seoul none of the young south koreans randomly interviewed had heard of the celebrations marking the anniversary of the truce they also blamed the united states , not north korea , for causing the crisis over the north s nuclear weapons program the united states is interfering too much in our relationship with north korea , said kim min jung , a 24yearold university student but we cannot help accepting the united states because it is too strong the anniversary of the armistice has exposed the deep divisions in south koreans' perceptions of north korea , the united states and the current crisis many of the divisions are generational , pitting older south koreans , who saw this country democratize and prosper under the security alliance with the united states , against younger south koreans resentful of the presence of 37 , 000 american troops here those divisions reached a peak last december as president roh moo hyun was elected amid a largescale protest movement against the american forces but they began taking shape especially under former president kim dae jung s policy of rapprochement with the north , known as the sunshine policy the sunshine policy was supposed to change north korea , said lee jung hoon , a professor of international relations at yonsei university here but it has not changed north korea at all instead , it has changed south korean society , and its attitudes toward issues like reunification , north korea and the us the truce will be commemorated sunday in panmunjom , a village near the border with the north where the armistice ending the threeyear war was signed on july 27 , 1953 officials and veterans from here and the nations that supported the south in the united nations force are scheduled to participate the commemoration , which will take place within a short distance of north korean soldiers standing watch across the world s most heavily guarded barrier , is a reminder that the armistice was never followed by a peace treaty the nuclear standoff has only emphasized the fact that the two nations are still technically at war when north korea and their chinese backers signed the armistice 50 years ago with the united states against the wishes of south korea , which wanted to keep fighting lest a truce mean the continued division of the peninsula the two koreas were not so far apart economically north korea was actually richer , more industrialized the south was largely agricultural today , in contrast to the impoverished , isolated north , the prosperous , democratic south is a society in rapid transition , a fact made clear by the different attitudes toward the anniversary of the armistice younger south koreans , having grown up in an era in which school textbooks no longer portrayed north koreans as devils with horns and tail , appear less distrustful of the north korean government at the same time , their mistrust of american motives and actions has grown chae hee byung , 37 , is chairman of the pankorean committee on the girls killed by us armored vehicles , a private group formed last year after two schoolgirls were crushed to death by a military truck and the drivers were acquitted for mr chae , the armistice has never led to a peace treaty because the unresolved conflict allows the united states to station its troops here and extend its influence in the region when we have had the chance for better relations with the north , he said , the united states has blocked it similar comments could be heard in downtown seoul s fashion area , even on a corner with a mcdonald s and dunkin' donuts , and billy joel s song uptown girl blaring out of a clothing store the united states is more dangerous than north korea , said jung hyun sun , a 24yearold store employee , wearing hiphop clothes and an earring they are actually ruling south korea with the excuse that they are protecting us to mr joo , the retired colonel who fought alongside american soldiers in the war , such ideas were incomprehensible he was a staunch supporter of united states policy toward north korea and a critic of president roh s softer approach to him , no south korean could possibly hold antiamerican sentiments they were , he said , infiltrators from the north then , amending his comment , he said of the tens of thousands who had participated in antiamerican demonstrations last year only 1 to 3 percent of the demonstrators are really antius the rest are not antius from the heart they 're just following their friends photo american soldiers took part in an exercise near the dmz that separates north and south korea the south and the united states will celebrate on sunday the 50th anniversary of the truce that ended the korean war \( seokyong lee world picture news , for the new york times \)
