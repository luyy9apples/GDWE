a gang of five robbers , evidently oblivious of the finer points of kohlrabi and fresh poblano peppers , invaded fairway fruits and vegetables , one of the culinary citadels on manhattan s upper west side , just before midnight closing time sunday night they made 40 terrified employees lie in the sawdust , forced a manager at gunpoint to open two safes and snatched up 10 , 000 but it was not just a piece of carrot cake two police officers on community patrol happened to look into the normally bustling produce market on broadway , between 74th and 75th streets , and saw an unfamiliar sight lights blazing and no one around amid the shelves of eggplant and jicama , figs , zucchini and brie as the officers called for reinforcements and approached the entrance , a white car sped away from the curb in it , three thugs escaping with the loot somehow , a fourth slipped away too , perhaps in the rush of prone employees who took heart at the sight of the officers , sprang up and made a dash for freedom but the fifth robber , armed with a submachine gun , went the wrong way , down into a storage basement cul de sac , where he encountered a dozen workers hiding and quaking behind sacks of produce trapped , he dropped his weapon and tried to mingle with the innocent when the officers ordered everyone to come out with their hands up but he was quickly pointed out and seized ah , the pleasure of doing business in new york , sighed howard glickberg , an owner of the market , which , like zabar s , balducci s and dean deluca is known to gourmets and gourmands for crowded narrow aisles where the cognoscenti contemplate banks of artichokes , illinois goat cheese , porcinistuffed pasta and sourdough baguettes but nobody got hurt that s the important thing savoring the drama the holdup was the talk of the neighborhood yesterday , as epicures and the merely curious ducked in for a glimpse of the looted safe , a whiff of north sea smoked salmon or a tidbit of gossip on who stood where or cried hysterically when the guns came out what they heard was that it happened about 11 45 pm , just as heshie hochman , the manager , was about to lock up for the night all the customers were gone , the evening s receipts were locked in safes at the front and back and 40 employees were cleaning up and stocking shelves when the robbers strode in under the blue , orange and black fairway awning they brandished guns and ordered everyone down onto the floor , mr hochman recalled , adding , they spoke only in profanities and told the people to get down on the floor and open the safe most of the workers obeyed the order to get down , but about a dozen ran to the back and down to the basement to get away from the waving guns opening safe under pressure with an automatic to his head and a submachine gun at his back , mr hochman opened the safe at the front , but the robbers apparently well informed about the cash if nothing else knew there was another safe in the back and ordered the manager to go back and open it when we got to the back , i said i did n't have the key it s up front , mr hochman related they said , go get it i told them to go up front and get the key themselves i suppose it was n't very smart , but they went up and got the key themselves the robbers were about to leave when officers timothy mcpartlin and nick antonelli of the 20th precinct , who were on community foot patrol on broadway , happened by as they approached , they realized something was wrong , said detective joseph mcconville , a police spokesman they knew the store was usually bustling with employees cleaning and stocking the shelves just before closing instead , they saw nobody around the store was open but empty call for reinforcements the officers radioed for reinforcements for a holdup with dozens of hostages a call that brought 40 to 50 officers from the 20th , 24th and 34th precincts , emergency service units with shotguns and flak jackets , special weapons and tactics teams and even hostage negotiators but before the police arrived in force and surrounded the store , four of the robbers escaped , three in a car and a fourth apparently hidden in the first rush of hostages to freedom the fifth robber , armed with the submachine gun , retreated into the basement this guy ran downstairs , and the only way to get out of there is through the store , mr glickberg said the gunman , finding himself with a cluster of people hiding among the crates and sacks , grabbed one , hugo nunez , who works in the delicatessen , put the gun to his head and demanded to know the way out mr nunez pointed to a door in the dimness at the front of the basement by the time the gunman discovered the door led nowhere except a vaultlike room under the sidewalk , the swat team was at the top of the stairs , calling to everyone to come out with hands over heads all the help came out with their hands up , and the cops do n't know who s who , mr glickberg said but as soon as they got upstairs , they pointed this guy out the suspect , keith mcphatter , 32 years old , of 497 dean street , brooklyn , was charged with robbery and criminal use and possession of a weapon the police found the submachine gun in the basement , but a more thorough search , using a dog , turned up no more suspects or weapons and none of the missing cash photo five robbers held up the fairway fruits and vegetables market on the upper west side before midnight on sunday night police surrounded the market as dozens of hostages were released four of the robbers escaped the fifth

washington , july 13 ten days after the coast guard stopped three ships trying to smuggle 659 chinese into california , senior officials in the clinton administration continued to argue over solutions none attractive to the increasingly difficult and embarrassing situation as the united states continued to press the mexican government to accept the refugees , the crowded , fetid ships remained about 100 miles southwest of san diego , surrounded by coast guard cutters the ships represent the first test of the clinton administration s vow to crack down on illegal immigration , a vow made after another smuggler s ship , the golden venture , spilled nearly 300 illegal chinese immigrants onto new york s shores last month even as it wavered over action on the three ships , the administration said today that it would back tough new legislation on asylum seekers ejected the same day the measure will allow quick and summary hearings for people who request asylum at airports and other ports of entry , and would stiffen penalties against alien smugglers government officials and others familiar with the plan say it includes charging alien smugglers under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act as a result it will allow federal prosecutors to seize the assets of smugglers , including ships like the golden venture under the bill , a corps of immigration officers will screen aliens caught trying to enter the country without proper documents to determine if their asylum claims are worthy to be heard by an immigration judge those whose claims are deemed frivolous could be placed on airplanes and sent back to their country of origin on the same day they arrived in the united states under current immigration law , an alien s statement that he has a wellfounded fear of persecution is generally sufficient to allow him to be scheduled for a hearing the hearing process can take years , during which the applicant is generally allowed to stay in the united states immigration experts say that in 1992 about 14 , 000 people tried to enter the country without documents or by using fraudulent documents and then claimed asylum a sizeable percentage of them turned up at kennedy international airport in new york , the experts said unpleasant alternatives the bill , which is to be announced when president clinton returns to washington , was drafted by congressional staffs and an interagency task force made up of officials from the justice department , the state department , the office of management and budget and the white house for the last 10 days , senior officials of the departments of state , defense , justice and transportation and the central intelligence agency have been struggling with the problem of the three ships off mexico the officials are considering these alternatives , immigration officials said allow the refugees into the united states and hear their pleas for political asylum state department and immigration service officials vow they will not let that happen dragoon the refugees onto a united states navy vessel and ship them back to china but the navy wants no part of that plan , immigration officials said force the home nation of the freighters to take their human cargo no one is sure of the ships' true flags two of the ships claimed taiwanese registry , an assertion the government of taiwan denies 'usa i love you' the united states imposed a news blackout on the ships today , keeping the faces of the chinese passengers waving signs usa i love you and bread we want , freedom we want off television and out of the newspapers no responsible official would comment publicly on the stranded refugees , the sofar fruitless talks with the mexican government or the implications for the new policy of preventing boatloads of immigrants from applying for political asylum the state department spokesman , michael mccurry , said it was obvious that this is a sensitive matter of diplomacy he also said it was being addressed with urgency on the part of the officials here in the united states that are dealing with it , and added , we remain in contact with the mexican government on the issue of mexico s accepting the refugees such contacts were at best strained senior mexican officials insisted that they would not take on the immigration problems of the united states , and expressed fury at the way the situation has been handled a backlog of applications simply put , the administration wants to prevent the chinese refugees aboard the ship from applying for political asylum in the united states the system has dueprocess requirements and legal protections that can take months and years to fulfill it is hardpressed to handle its backlog of applications 10 , 000 new requests a month , and 300 , 000 people on a waiting list the united states also wants to prevent a repeat of the june 6 wreck of the golden venture , in which 10 chinese died trying to swim ashore all but 14 of the 301 illegal immigrants who survived the beaching are still being detained in immigration and naturalization service prisons in pennsylvania and louisiana , an ins spokeswoman said yesterday by intercepting the three ships at sea , the united states aims to send a signal that might stop tens of thousands of chinese people from paying smugglers tens of thousands of dollars apiece to take them to the united states in the filthy holds of freighters
los angeles , jan 22 by sunday , most of official washington and the news media had already dismissed the problems with zoe baird s nomination as attorney general but anyone listening that morning to susan estrich s talk show here on kabc radio knew the nomination was in deep trouble over ms baird s hiring of illegal aliens as household help the phones went crazy , said ms estrich , who was the presidential campaign manager for michael s dukakis in 1988 and now teaches law at the university of southern california that s the only thing people wanted to talk about i found a fire already raging , just looking for a house to burn down over the next few days , as washington insiders scratched their heads in bafflement , public fury over ms baird reached a boil on radiotalk shows from boston to san diego , in bars in new orleans , in the remote reaches of west texas the more exposure she got , people would say , 'look at this , ' said roy markey , owner of markey s bar in the workingclass lower ninth ward of new orleans isolation of washington by early today , the uproar forced president clinton to withdraw the nomination demonstrating both that there is often an enormous gulf in political sensibilities between washington and the general populace and that a new means of communications are giving new political power to the public the anger rose on a crest carried by a new generation of talk shows , cable television and other programs that mr clinton used to win election but that has now come back to haunt him these media have made for the direct exchange of ideas and emotions , shortcutting traditional news outlets it was also , to be sure , an issue that resonated powerfully in families searching for solutions to the problem of raising children and earning a living and it hit particularly hard here in economically battered california , where illegal aliens are increasingly perceived as a drag on state and local government services and as taking jobs away from legal residents for 57yearold shirley e roth of fountain valley in orange county the blood began to heat a week ago thursday when she first read in the orange county register that ms baird had hired a peruvian couple who were in this country illegally anger turned to outrage in the next two days when that newspaper and the los angeles times endorsed ms baird s nomination taking jobs away ms roth , who moved here from rochester with her husband , an engineer , and four children 17 years ago , wrote letters to the editor of the register , to her congressman and the senators from california , dianne feinstein and barbara boxer , both democrats our concern was that she was taking meaningful employment away from american citizens , ms roth said today citizens ca n't compete with illegals for a living wage , and that makes for a volatile environment , especially here in california the telephone lines at the local offices of senators feinstein and boxer were overwhelmed on thursday by callers who complained that ms baird broke the law and that illegal aliens were taking away jobs the senate hearings shown on cable television fueled the complaints john de roo jr , a 72yearold retired school administrator who lives in the uppermiddleclass granada hills area of the san fernando valley , watched senators questoin ms baird on thursday he said he was struck that ms baird did not seem to grasp what was wrong with hiring illegal aliens we 're facing tremendous problems in southern california , he said dianne feinstein pointed that out in her questioning yesterday that she did n't seem even aware that this was such a tremendous problem like many who watched the hearing , muriel north of hackettstown , nj , felt that the senators on the judiciary committee were not sufficiently tough on ms baird , a corporate lawyer who had failed to pay the social security taxes of the peruvian couple , then dismissed them after the clinton victory i got so upset over the hearings and i thought they were missing the point , said mrs north , 90 , who called her representative , marge roukema , a republican i was watching the whole day getting madder and madder no one was saying the big thing , which was that she was very unethical she is probably brilliant and capable , but to live in a democracy you 've got to be honest and ethical in garden city , kan , roberta renick , a retired drugstore owner , called the office of senator nancy landon kassebaum , a republican she complained that the senators were too generous to the nominee mrs renick said she had never hired anyone without paying for social security i think everyone should do it if that s the law and she knew what was right and what was wrong , she said at kprcam in houston , jon matthews s talk show has been swamped with calls about ms baird there was not great sympathy for her , he said people were perplexed here s someone with half a million in income who has no problems it s hard to identify with somebody who has that type of income and assets breaking the law people read a lot of arrogance into that hundreds of miles west , in the ranch country of west texas , where mexican immigrants have long been employed and exploited , there was consternation , too bill young , a retired air force master sergeant in san angelo , complained to his congressman , lamar smith , a republican i'm tired of people being so darn greedy and grabbing , he said in an interview today we 're the ones at home sacrificing to keep them up there the mood was no different half a continent away in politically liberal boston , where callers would talk of nothing else on marjorie clapprood s morning talk show on whdh this is a big reaction , said ms clapprood , who likened the furor to that over the testimony of prof anita f hill at the clarence thomas hearings it really touched a chord i think twothirds of my calls were from women who 've been through the rigorous process of finding day care and they were having none of it at the harvard medical school , patricia thomas , editor of the harvard health letter , said that sentiment turned against ms baird as her allfemale staff listened to the hearings this is an office where everyone wore buttons that said , 'vote for hillary s husband , ' she said first people were saying , 'what woman does n't have problems with child care \? ' but then as time went on , people thought , 'if this woman is such a good lawyer and her husband is a constitutional law expert why did they knowingly do something against the law \?

completed an observation trip to minnesota and wisconsin , said , it s been greatly accepted by the coaches and that stands to reason because we have fewer penalties being called , less violence the principle is simple two referees , with the right to call penalties , can see more than one can , especially behind the play of the puck the players , says holden , know they cannot get away with illegal stick work against an opponent that s the biggest difference , he said sticks are down the nofighting rule has helped too one punch and you 're gone , disqualified , said holden besides there

defense lawyers , legal scholars and some municipal court judges are beginning to say that the wellintentioned attempts by lawmakers and judges to rid the state s roads of drunken drivers are undermining the constitutional rights of many defendants in such cases they say that over the last decade or so the courts and the legislature have systematically and intentionally eliminated nearly all the defenses once available to those charged with drunken driving these include the right to challenge the accuracy of machines used to measure bloodalcohol content and the right to a jury trial , the critics assert new jersey already has one of the toughest laws in the nation to punish drunken drivers the penalties for even firsttime offenders include about 3 , 500 in fines and surcharges , a minimum of six months' revocation of driving privileges , a mandatory 12 hours' detainment in an intoxicated driver resource center and up to 30 days' imprisonment officials of the state attorney general s office deny that any constitutional protections have been eliminated , intentionally or otherwise , and say that the increasing rate of convictions for drunken driving is the result of better police work and more efficient handling of court cases but the critics say there is evidence to the contrary even a casual reading of dwi cases decided by the new jersey supreme court convincingly demonstrates the court s willingness to ignore due process in order to promote quick , easy and popular convictions , said martin l haines , a retired state superior court judge from burlington county the court is so under the influence of management concepts that it has trashed constitutional rights in pursuing those concepts the apparent motivation of the supreme court , he said , is the belief that the disposition of cases is the judicial system s first priority such a belief , he said , results in the courts' playing a numbers game whereby disposing of cases takes precedence over the manner in which the cases are disposed of speeding the disposition of cases anything to speed up the disposition of dwi cases appears to be justified , mr haines said , adding that such things potentially include suppression of evidence , abrogation of authority and skipping essential procedural rules that apply in every other case defense lawyers often mention that among the defenses that have been eliminated are the right to contest the accuracy of the breathalyzer machine , used to determine whether a person is considered legally drunk , and the right to prove that a person who ultimately failed the breathalyzer test might not have been drunk at the time he was driving critics also say the legislature and the courts have intentionally written and interpreted the state s drunkendriving laws to deny defendants the right to a jury trial new jersey is one of only a handful of states that maintain such a policy some defense lawyers say public outrage over drunken driving has inspired such legislative and judicial overreaction that constitutional protections are being trampled in the process my feeling is that there is such a focus on doing away with a real social evil that we 're in danger of encroaching on people s civil rights , said juan galismenendez , a union city lawyer who specializes in criminal law there seems to be an almost deliberate effort to curtail people s defenses legal scholars agree politicians are recognizing the public concern and are passing apparently popular and useful laws , said john wherry jr , associate professor of law at the widener university school of law in wilmington , delmr wherry practiced law in new jersey for 23 years before becoming a fulltime educator but what s happened is that we have this pragmatically horrible problem where the laws are inconsistent and are creating some unconstitutional consequences , he said new jersey is particularly egregious in that it has eliminated every potential defense the breath test results are the beall and endall of drunk driving cases test is given later typically , said james kane record , a lawyer with the firm of francis x moore in red bank , the breathalyzer test is given at police headquarters , some time after the person has been driving as a result , he said , the breathalyzer reading provides the person s bloodalcohol content only at the time the test is given , not at the time he was driving in the past , he said , lawyers could hire expert witnesses who would use the breathalyzer result as a starting point and then extrapolate backward , applying the person s weight , what he drank and the time that had passed since his last drink , to determine bloodalcohol content at the time of the person was driving if that amount was determined to be lower than 10 percent , the person could be acquitted the state supreme court , however , eliminated this extrapolation defense when it upheld a lower court ruling that since a breathalyzer test could not be given at the scene of the arrest , the legislature must have intended that a 10 percent bloodalcohol content at the time of the test was sufficient proof of drunken driving
lucasville , ohio , april 22 state troopers threading their way through a possibly boobytrapped cell block discovered the bodies of two more inmates today at ohio s maximum security prison as state officials organized investigations into 11 days of rioting that left nine prisoners and a guard dead niki z schwartz , the cleveland lawyer whose role as legal adviser to the more than 400 rioting inmates has been credited with helping end the siege on wednesday , said he was not certain how he would monitor future compliance by the ohio department of rehabilitation and corrections to the 21 demands it had agreed to in negotiations with inmates a weary mr schwartz , speaking to reporters early today after the five remaining hostages had been released and the inmates had surrendered , said he had yet to create a mechanism to address the problems of the inmates but given the seriousness of the rioting at the southern ohio correctional facility , the 53yearold lawyer said , he did not anticipate state officials would balk at a request for money and staff reflecting on the final negotiations that led to a peaceful end to the siege , mr schwartz said that at one point the talks had been threatened by paranoia , mistrust and racial antagonism between the mostly white guards and the prisoners , 55 percent of whom are black 'there is a lot of hate' the inmates' greatest concern was retaliation , and with good reason , i think , mr schwartz said the leadership of the department and this institution are top notch , but with the rankandfile corrections officers here there is a lot of hate you know , none of the guards said thank you to me when this ended inside the prison , ohio highway patrol officers searched the lwing gingerly because of claims by inmates who had barricaded themselves throughout the 11day siege that they had set booby traps in the process , the officers discovered the bodies of two more inmates , bringing the death toll in the rioting that began on easter sunday to nine inmates and one corrections officer a spokesman for the highway patrol would not release the names of the two dead inmates the recovery of the two bodies was difficult because investigators had to cut a path through what the spokesman described as corridors ankle deep in debris , such as mattress , pillows , doors and broken glass sharron kornegay , a spokeswoman for the ohio department of rehabilitation and corrections , said the agency had erred when it originally put the number of rioting inmates at about 450 she said a final tally showed that 409 inmates had barricaded themselves in lwing and that 407 of them had surrendered late wednesday 129 prisoners moved early this morning , 129 of the inmates who had surrendered were moved to other prisons the kwing here now houses all of the prison s remaining 1 , 034 inmates prison officials continued to withhold details about the death of robert a vallandingham , 43 , the only hostage who was killed in the sstandoff earlier , they announced only that an autopsy had disclosed that he died of strangulation but reginald wilkinson , the director of the corrections department , said his agency was still investigating the accusations by two released hostages that mr vallandingham had been killed by inmates who were angry at a prison spokeswoman who they believed had denigrated their demands and ridiculed their threats he said there was no evidence that her comments had anything to do with the officer s death as for the aftermath of the rioting , mr wilkinson said his agency would impanel two commissions to investigate the disturbance at the 1 , 819inmate prison and would address some of the concerns in the inmates' 21 demands in a statement at the end of the siege , gov george v voinovich said he would create a special committee to study the state s corrections system , which houses 38 , 593 inmates in 23 prisons , and to recommend changes guards to impanel a committee meanwhile peter wray , a spokesman for the ohio civil service employees association , the union that represents the state s 4 , 300 prison guards , said the union would also impanel a committee to make sure that other postmortems on the rioting did not gloss over what he described as chronic understaffing while the 4to1 ratio of inmates to guards at lucasville were acceptable , he said , the ratio systemwide was 87 to 1 , as against the national average of 5 to 1 with the spotlight off of the prison , we are afraid that it will be tempting to go back to business as usual , mr wray said state representative michael shoemaker , chairman of the legislature s corrections institutions inspection committee , said his panel would begin an investigation of conditions at the prison and how effectively lawenforcement agencies responded to problems many of the 21 demands deal with the inmates' concerns about transfer policies , the availability of prison education and vocational programs , the reclassification processes that determine the level of relative freedom inmates have , visitation and telephone and mail privileges in general , said shirley pope , a senior analyst with mr shoemakers s committee , the demands reflected concerns about arbitrariness and capriciousness on the part of some prison officials and staff members in enforcing the rules of the institution she said inmates who had broken laws outside of prison were sticklers for everyone doing things by the book once inside , because it was the only way they could insulate themselves from bias and from the pervasive control that prison officials had over their lives among the items that figured prominently in the list of demands was a call for an end to forced racial integration of cells photo niki z

one link at a time , the chain of clues grew first , a suspect was arrested carrying the business card of another man the suspect , it turned out , had made calls to the man from what may have been a bomb factory in jersey city the two men shared a bank account their names appeared on the same car rental agreement each clue forged a stronger link between mohammed a salameh , the initial suspect in the the bombing of the world trade center , and the man the federal bureau of investigation arrested yesterday at his suburban new jersey home , nidal a ayyad but even as the puzzle pieces of their association were made public , the mystery of mr ayyad deepened why did the 25yearold chemical engineer maintain his typically suburban routine in the wake of such a vivid trail of evidence \? version of american dream unlike mr salameh , an illegal alien who lived a shadowy life , moving from apartment to apartment in jersey city for the last five years , mr ayyad s experience seems more typical of an immigrant s version of the american dream arriving in the united states , obtaining a solid college education , then landing a good job with one of the country s largest industrial concerns he was married in december while on a twoweek vacation in jordan , and he and his wife are expecting their first child mr ayyad s father , abderrahman joseph ayyad , said last night that his son had visited him in newark on tuesday , excited about the prospect of a business trip to oklahoma he seemed happy , because that s what he wanted , the elder mr ayyad said he studied hard with the hope of getting a good job , getting married and raising a family but the head of the fbi office in newark , james esposito , while stopping short of saying mr ayyad had been the mastermind behind a bomb , said the suspect had some kind of expert knowledge and educational background that easily lends itself to this kind of crime became naturalized citizen and while two distinctly different versions of his life emerged yesterday , some basic aspects seemed unambiguous mr ayyad was born to palestinian parents in the town of silwad on the israelioccupied west bank the family moved to kuwait , and mr ayyad became the first of his eight brothers and sisters to come here , in 1985 , said his landlord , subhi badra mr badra , who lives in maryland and runs a gas station in washington , vacated the

year he graduated from rutgers university in new brunswick with a bachelor s degree in microbiology and chemistry rutgers officials said he had started at the newark campus in january 1986 and transferred to new brunswick the following january in january 1991 , he began work at alliedsignal inc in morris township he s a nice guy , said mr badra he s not even interested in politics he just concentrated on his job he just got married a couple of months ago 'he loved this country' mr badra said mr ayyad was the main support for his family and was happy to be in the united states he loved this country , mr badra said 'i'm sure about it a previous landlord , faiz bolss of bloomfield , said mr ayyad had lived in an upstairs apartment with his mother and brothers until moving out in december he s a nice fellow polite , intelligent , mrs bolss said he took good care of this family but there were always lots of people around here , day and night , and many vans parking in the driveway or on the street his friends were in business and sold things from these vans , that s what i was always told principles behind explosives mr ayyad s father said his son fasted and prayed often , and was never involved in politics i know , he said i raised him the elder mr ayyad , who is 51 , said he was born in jerusalem and came to america in 1979 he said he had been separated from his son s mother since then jeffrey l rankin , an assistant professor of chemistry and assistant dean of the department of chemical engineering , said mr ayyad was a student in two of his undergraduate courses , both theoretical and with no laboratory work asked if other courses mr ayyad took were related to making or using explosives , professor rankin said i wish the answer were no , but they were of course they were heat transfer , chemical reactions certainly it s not enough for anyone to go out and build a bomb but , yes , the courses taught the principle involved in explosions asked specifically about the study of urea , nitrates and other chemicals linked to the trade center explosion , professor rankin said no , none of these would have been part of these courses the underlying principles were taught , but not in terms of explosibility 'positive' recommendation he described mr ayyad as someone who spoke english with a marked accent and certainly struggled in classes once in a while expressing himself i would n't call him shy , not at all , he said i would n't say that he had his hand up in class all the time either , but he was not withdrawn professor rankin said he last heard from mr ayyad in september 1991 , when the former student asked for a recommendation to the rutgers graduate program in chemical engineering professor rankin said that he wrote a positive one , but that mr ayyad did not enroll alliedsignal , the morristownbased conglomerate that makes chemicals and services the aerospace and automotive industries , said in a statement that mr ayyad worked for the company as an engineer in its development laboratory in morris township entrylevel job a company spokesman , mark greenberg , said mr ayyad had an entrylevel job helping to convert lab processes to commercial uses he said mr ayyad had worked on no military contracts and had no security clearances a check by the company yesterday showed that mr ayyad had not signed out any chemicals allied said it had suspended mr ayyad without pay , pending the outcome of the investigation it also said it was cooperating with the fbi , but did not elaborate mr ayyad s home life seemed at odds with the precise world of an engineer when fbi agents armed with rifles arrived at 60 boyden avenue in maplewood at 6 40 this morning , they found a boxy , nondescript twostory house ,

one of the two secondfloor apartments , described mr ayyad as quiet and reserved we did n't see much of him , she said but yesterday morning was different it s frightening to wake up to find you 're being surrounded the fbi with rifles , guns and all more than two dozen fbi agents converged on the house they had been watching round the clock for three days shortly before 7 , mr ayyad , was led

restaurant raphael there are four steps down to restaurant raphael with each one you travel backward eight years by the time you walk in the door you have reached the 1960 s , when restaurants were polite places and noise was never a problem you ca n't help looking around raphael with a kind of wonder that little garden out back \( still green , despite the cold \) , that fireplace , the mural it is all like some cozy romantic holdover from a longgone era the room is filled with all the soft sounds good restaurants once contained the gentle clink of glasses , the whoosh of unfolding napkins , the low voice of the hostess is it cold out \? let me take your coat , she says , taking your wrap before taking you to your table are you comfortable here \? she has the same solicitous eagerness when she comes back a little later to talk about the menu , reciting each dish as if it were the seventh wonder of the world being created just for you if the welcome has the oldfashioned charm of days gone by , the food offers something different it is extremely up to date jean michel bergougnoux was chef at le cygne before it closed in 1991 , and he has kept himself abreast of all the latest culinary trends in this special terrine the chef has combined oxtails and the finest foie gras the chef has placed raw marinated scallops on a bed of seaweed salad , and topped it with some salmon roe the carrot soup has absolutely no cream , but it does have a little touch of ginger the venison comes with a beet puree in a fine red wine sauce she talks avidly of the napoleon of candied onion and says nice things about the tuna in a galette of potatoes and if you ask about desserts , she describes the warm and crusty chocolate cake in terms so delicious it is impossible to resist if the food did not live up to her descriptions , none of this would matter but the napoleon looks like a butterfly on the verge of flight , a crisp , flaky pastry filled with a sweet puree of onions and surrounded by creamy kernels of corn the terrine is a wonder , the contrast between the stringy oxtail and the smooth foie gras a silent essay on texture the scallops are gorgeous , set off by the green seaweed and the orange roe and mr bergougnoux s soups have a pure and satisfying simplicity the tuna comes very rare , snuggled inside a coat of crisply fried potatoes that gives it the air of a baby porcupine skate , the most boring of fish , is fabulous here , a thick moist slice on a disarmingly pretty plate long streamers of dried carrots emerge from a chivestrewn puree of potatoes , adding color to an otherwise white composition pairing venison with beets and red wine is a deft touch , making it sweet and sour with no cloying qualities the hostess is back dessert \?

washington , march 11 as it watches the unfolding political turmoil in moscow , the clinton administration is caught between its desire to support president boris n yeltsin and its concern that he might take authoritarian measures to stay in power in strong statements of support in recent days , president clinton has portrayed mr yeltsin as the best hope for economic and political reform in russia and has promised to do what we can to help him succeed but american officials are increasingly uncertain about mr yeltsin s future , and mr yeltsin complicated their thinking last week by telling chancellor helmut kohl of germany during a brief stopover in moscow last week that he might dissolve the russian parliament and assume emergency powers to defeat his political opponents mr yeltsin had said the same thing publicly but european officials here said that in private , he asked mr kohl whether the united states and the other major industrialized nations would support him if he were forced to take extraconstitutional action mr kohl then wrote letters to mr clinton and other heads of state from the group of seven industrialized democracies passing on mr yeltsin s position , the officials said american officials said they did not take mr yeltsin s comments as a direct threat to assume emergency powers , but viewed them as a bargaining move , perhaps intended to heighten concern for his future among his western supporters still , that put the western powers in an uncomfortable position the officials said mr clinton has not responded to mr kohl s letter , and a western ambassador said as far as i know , none of the g7 have replied to the message none of us dares to say anything we all know that the russian congress is antidemocratic and unrepresentative , but you ca n't run around saying 'let s dissolve parliament' in a whirlwind of activity in recent weeks to bolster mr yeltsin s standing , mr clinton has scheduled a summit meeting with the russian leader , offered an increase in direct american aid and called for an early meeting of the group of seven to consider new financing for russia but mr yeltsin appears to have suffered a humiliating political defeat that would strip him of much of his authority before he and mr clinton meet in vancouver next month , putting mr clinton in a situation that in some ways echoed the problem president bush faced with president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union during the campaign last april , mr clinton criticized mr bush for failing to distance himself from mr gorbachev before his fall from power , and a senior administration official said that mr clinton does not want to embrace mr yeltsin too tightly here is the dilemma we all have here , a senior administration official said obviously the previous administration got into some trouble for overpersonalizing the relationship , and a lot of people have made invidious comparisons between bush s support for gorbachev and clinton s support for yeltsin but the official added , there is no way you can divorce yeltsin as a personality from the state and future of reform in russia mr clinton himself revealed the difficult choices he faces today when , during a photo session , he praised the russian leader , then admitted that he could not predict the future asked whether mr yeltsin was going to survive , mr clinton avoided giving a direct answer he said i think that he is the duly elected president of russia and a genuine democrat small 'd' and that he is leading a country that is trying bravely to do two things , one , escape from communism into market economics , a world they never lived in before , and second , to preserve real democracy that s a tough job pretty hard to do here 'i'm not a seer' i intend to do what i can to be supportive of that process , and to be supportive of him while he serves as president of russia , he said you know , i do n't know what else to tell you i'm not a seer senior administration officials sought to play down the significance of the kohl missive , saying that mr yeltsin has already warned the russian parliament publicly that he may have to take emergency measures they said that mr kohl was not in a position to be an intermediary between mr clinton and mr yeltsin , and that the main purpose of the letter was to discuss the urgency of quick action by the group of seven to move quickly to help russia reschedule its debt yeltsin has notified the parliament of that , the world of that , said one senior official , who dismissed the threat as part of his psychological warfare the official added that the american embassy in moscow was reporting today s developments with some relief , suggesting that the confrontations may be easing a bit and that there may be a compromise in the works discussion of aid program as a direct result of mr kohl s letter , the seven g7 nations the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy and canada plan to discuss an outline of an aid program for russia at their regular meeting scheduled this weekend in hong kong , american and european officials said at the urging of the united states , the countries have invited the russian deputy prime minister , boris fyodorov , to attend in the hope that they can craft a strategy before the annual meeting of the group s heads of state in tokyo in july the current political crisis in moscow has aggravated a deep debate within the central intelligence agency and among the other american intelligence agencies on whether mr yeltsin and the entire reform movement can survive , according to senior intelligence officials the most pessimistic view is articulated in recent classified reporting by the defense intelligence agency that concludes that mr yeltsin is a cornered man who has no control over his destiny the thinking spans the spectrum , said one senior intelligence official the worst case scenario is that yeltsin is getting weaker by the day and that there is going to be a rightwing coup that will throw russia back to authoritarian rule , to the other end where people are saying , 'oh , they 're going to be able to work it out and democracy and economic reform is gaining and irreversible' new doubts in washington the cracks that have existed for some time within the intelligence agencies are beginning to be reflected albeit not as visibly among policy makers as well i still think he is going to make it , said one senior administration official , with less certainty than a few weeks ago what happens in russia is that you go to extremes before you go back to stability mr clinton so far does not face the political pressure to back away from mr yeltsin that mr bush endured but behind the official administration support is a realization that the united states , either alone or with its western partners , cannot change the course of russia s history we are not making any assumptions about what will happen , secretary of state warren christopher told reporters after the russian congress voted to eliminate some of mr yeltsin s power and canceled a national referendum he had sought to win public support it s a very dynamic situation the end of the story has not been written photo on a day when the congress of people s deputies solidified its stance against president boris n yeltsin , members huddled to plot strategy \( reuters \)
the ottawa senators are the home remedy of the national hockey league , a little hard to swallow but an allpurpose medicine that is good for what ails you they are an expansion team that has won only three times in half a season , none of them on the road and they did n't come close wednesday night when they visited madison square garden the rangers , under the psychic weather lately , defeated them by 62 in a tepid affair as sergei zubov , a rookie defenseman from russia , scored two goals mike richter made a rare appearance as the starting goalie and played well a victory is a victory , but there have been board of governors meetings in this league with more fireworks it was sort of like watching white paint dry for a while , said ron smith , the rangers' interim coach zubov said his teammates were urging him to go for a hat trick they said , 'come on sergi , come on ! ' said zubov , who finished with a plusthree for the night , plus firststar honors scattered booing for a team that led by 10 after one period and by 51 after two , the rangers heard an unusual undercurrent of booing from their fans in the first 40 minutes the pace of play was n't always brisk and crisp and perhaps there was residual resentment from the customers for the firing of roger neilson , who was replaced as coach on monday by smith the victory gave smith a record of 101 one of those booed was mark messier , the captain whose feud with neilson played a part in the coaching change while killing a penalty , messier circled out of the attack zone when he did n't have a clear scoring chance , choosing instead to carry the puck and kill time although it was the appropriate play , the fans used the opportunity to jeer him for the rangers , it was their second victory in their last eight outings for richter , it was his first victory since a 105 decision over montreal on dec 13 smith said he started richter because it was a good situation at home against a team that does n't win on the road , an added boost of confidence richter made 21 saves he said he understood the booing we were a talented team playing brutal , richter said i can understand them being upset the senators are a terrible team their power play includes mike peluso , a fighting specialist , who began the game with 9 goals , 4 assists and 152 penalty minutes in 41 games the defeat was their 10th in succession and their 14th in a row without a victory on the road , ottawa does n't have a single victory or tie in 20 games zubov got his first goal at 5 minutes and 31 seconds of the first period on a low slap shot , on the power play his second , on a deep angle from the left side , came at 13 10 of the second period and led to the replacement of peter sidorkiewicz , ottawa s starting goalie , by daniel berthiaume it was just one of those nights where they kept getting it by me , said sidorkiewicz once we get the first road win under our belt , it 'll make things easier mike gartner , doug weight , tony amonte and ed olczyk scored the others for the rangers mark freer scored for ottawa at 2 05 of the second period , only 14 seconds after gartner s goal , to cut the ranger lead to 21 and give the game a brief jolt of excitement dave archibald got the other senators goal on the power play late in the third period slap shots bob goodenow , the president of the national hockey league players association , attended the game sitting next to him was gary bettman , who takes over as commissioner on feb 1 bettman has said that his first priority is a new collective bargaining agreement with the union to replace the one that ends before next season the two men remained in their seats , after the game , chatting aleksei kovalev of the rangers was ejected at the end of the second period and given a fiveminute major for spearing chris luongo brian leetch , the ranger defenseman out since dec 17 with a stretched nerve in his neck , has resumed skating but will be sidelined at least two weeks , the rangers announced the assist by goaltender mike richter on sergei zubov s first goal gave him five for the season , tying john vanbiesbrouck s ranger record photo senators goalie peter sidorkiewicz failing to stop ranger sergei zubov s first goal last night \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg b16 \)

an 11yearold sullivan county girl who died of rabies on july 11 was infected by a strain of bat rabies , and not by a strain that originated among raccoons , new york state health officials said yesterday authorities had earlier thought that an epidemic of raccoon rabies , which emerged in new york and most of the northeast in 1990 , was the probable cause of the child s death the state health department said the finding did not lessen the threat of rabies from raccoons , which remain the largest source of infection in the state nor does it suggest an increase in the threat from rabid bats , which have have long been known to be carriers of the disease there are a lot more rabid raccoons out there than bats , said vicki fallis , a department spokeswoman in albany but the lesson today is that people who have been thinking about raccoons must also think about bats bats in attic in may the sullivan county girl , kelly anne ahrendt , of bloomingburg , was the first person to die of rabies in new york state since 1954 although state health officials said that tests of tissue samples by the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta had yielded a positive match with bat rabies , they said it was not known how she was infected miss ahrendt s family has told health authorities that they had routinely found bats roosting in their attic each may , but that the child was not known to have come into physical contact with a bat in a statement , the health department said , it is most likely she was either bitten or had direct contact with a bat another explanation is that she was infected by another animal that had been infected by a bat , the state officials said medical experts had first suspected raccoons in miss ahrendt s death because of the rapid pace of the spread of rabies among raccoons in new york state the state health department said yesterday that they had found 1 , 824 cases of rabies infection among animals so far this year , 1 , 649 of them in raccoons only 34 of the rabid animals were bats something innocuous' but while bats now pose a smaller risk than raccoons , they have been known since the 1950 s to be a source of rabies infection , often infecting other animals that then come into contact with humans according to the centers for disease control , 20 people have died of rabies in the united states since 1979 , and half of them contracted the disease in another country of those who were infected in this country , eight died of bat rabies the majority of the deaths have been just as mysterious as the one in sullivan county , said charles e rupprecht , a veterinarian and chief of the rabies section of the centers for disease control he added that it is difficult to determine the cause of rabies infection because the victims tend to be exposed to something innocuous or familiar one source of infection is pet cats , which sometimes hunt down bats even though most states , including new york , require rabies vaccination of cats , human infection can result from contact with a cat that has ingested an infected bat , he said as a precaution , he said , people who know that a cat has come into contact with a bat should have the pet examined , and its rabies vaccination boosted a peculiar threat state officials said yesterday that miss ahrendt s family kept several cats and farm animals , and that an investigation into whether any of them had been infected with rabies has not been completed but they said none of the animals had been known to die of a disease resembling rabies , and none of the animals that were still alive appeared ill unlike other animals , bats pose a peculiar threat to people because they tend to roost in attics , barns and other enclosed places experts said yesterday that people who discover a bat in a building should first make sure that children and pets do not come into contact with it , and then close doors and open windows so the bat is isolated in a single room or area , but free to fly out of the building they also said the sullivan county death underscores the need for taking precautions in dealing with all wild animals , since all are susceptible to rabies infection from bats among behavior to be avoided is touching , feeding or trying to adopt wild animals , and making yards attractive to them by leaving food or garbage exposed anyone who is bitten or scratched by a wild animal should immediately wash the wound and seek the advice of a doctor
although statistics show that violence is rising among american youths , a panel of psychologists released a report yesterday offering an optimistic view of what might be done to reverse the bloody tide the escalation in violence among young people is captured in statistics like these a 61 percent increase in the 1980 s in shootings committed by americans 15 to 19 years old , and a 1 , 740 percent rise in the number of children and teenagers treated for knife and gunshot wounds since 1986 at the children s national medical center in washington but the american psychological association s commission on violence and youth said in the report that other data found in its survey of earlier studies showed that a variety of efforts could help reverse the trend psychology has a message of hope violence is preventable , said dr ronald g slaby , a psychologist at harvard university who is one of the commission s 12 members violence is learned , and we can teach children alternatives early intervention encouraged intervening at an early age , especially from 4 to 8 , before children s habits of aggression are fixed , was among the commission s main recommendations violence is learned very early in life , and learned well , said the commission s chairman , dr leonard eron , a psychologist at the university of michigan interventions work best if they are started early the longer you wait , the harder it is to change the commission recommended efforts aimed at the family , the classroom , the community and the media the report described as particularly effective programs in the schools that teach social and emotional skills like managing anger , negotiating , adopting another child s perspective and thinking of alternative solutions to disagreements children who are already aggressive can benefit from special tutoring along these lines the report saw television as one vehicle for teaching children positive alternatives to violence it called on the federal communications commission to make license renewal for broadcasters depend in part on their providing programs that counter violence , and it asked that violence be sharply curtailed in the hours that children watch television most television has great teaching potential , dr eron said it s just been teaching the wrong things another recommendation is that laws be changed to require anyone who purchases a gun to be of voting age and pass a background check and a test on firearm safety it should be at least as hard to get a gun as to get a driver s license , dr slaby said 'not an insoluble problem' the report concluded that many of the factors that lead to violence in youth were within our powers to change dr eron said , youth violence is not an insoluble problem in tracing the many factors that could help produce a violent youth , the commission noted certain kinds of behavior by parents , especially rejection of the child , a lack of supervision and violent fights between mother and father the report singled out parents who harshly and regularly punished children physically , saying that they are only feeding a cycle of violence while such punishment might make children obedient in the short run , the report said , it led children to become aggressive themselves you first learn violence within the family , dr eron said in a 22year study of 875 boys and girls first observed at age 8 , dr eron found that those whose parents used the harshest discipline were most likely to be most violent with their playmates , starting fights and shoving for no good reason as 30yearolds , the more aggressive children had grown into violent adults with criminal records , and as parents they were also most likely to use harsh physical punishment with their children , he said no single cause is found but no single factor could be blamed for a child s turning to violence , the commission concluded youth violence is like heart disease , where many factors build to create the problem , said dr alan kazdin , a psychologist at yale university who was also a member of the commission all the factors matter , but none means a child will necessarily become violent many different paths can lead to trouble among the other factors that contribute to children s becoming violent , the report said , were learning to handle frustration by lashing out , or doing poorly in school and then feeling stigmatized as dumb , or having trouble learning social cues , leading some children to become social outcasts because they failed to pick up signals that could allow them to interact smoothly with playmates violence on television came in for its share of criticism viewing violence increases violence , and leads to emotional desensitization toward violence , the report said in dr eron s study , for example , 8yearold boys who watched the most violent television programs but were not particularly aggressive themselves at school still grew up to be as violenceprone as other 8yearolds who had been the most aggressive schoolyard bullies growing up in impoverished neighborhoods with a sense that opportunities are closed because of discrimination against one s group can also lead to violence the report said discrimination damaged children s selfconfidence and laid a foundation for anger , discontent and violence copies of the report may be obtained by writing

eight members of the martha graham dance company presented their own choreography on thursday night , and three aspects of the evening stood out sharply the first was that none of the pieces , surprisingly , resembled miss graham s own works the second was that all eight were very different last , all were sensationally performed by dancers from the graham troupe , the graham school and two guest artists overall , there was more ingenuity than genius on display , but the novice choreographer was often more interesting than the relatively experienced one craft , however , was never in short supply the program , entitled choreographers project , will be repeated at the marymount manhattan theater \( 221 east 71st street \) today at 8 pm and tomorrow at 3 pm the performance , sponsored by the philip morris companies , was essentially a workshop and not part of the graham company s own seasons , but the production values , especially the lighting by laura e glover , were on a firstrate professional level for this viewer , the revelation of the evening was sostenimiento by theresa maldonado , a simple but short lyrical trio that explored the warm relationship of three women , presumably sisters the recorded guitar music , from francisco tarrega s recuerdos de la alhambra , began only after the dancers began to move there was a sense of siesta , as the trio miss maldonado , flanked by penelope gonzalez and ruthlyn salomons faced the rear and began to stir , propelling themselves later along diagonals a sense of clan emerged from the unison work occasionally the women walked on their knees , ending with a leg extended forward but there were also fluent variations on the theme of two women supporting miss maldonado between them as she swooned on their arms at a time when the disciples of what was once a genuine dance avantgarde in the 1960 s tend to fall into sterile formal exercise , a piece like sostenimiento gives the mainstream a good name and comes as a relief another promising example of how straightforward fluency can express an emotional relationship came in waning with the moon , choreographed by kevin predmore to the first two movements of shostakovich s string quartet no 10 the sharp outline of the movement , especially in the athletic partnering , owed much to the extraordinary dancing of virginie mecene swinging her long hair into plunging fits of passion and angst as she was courted by mr predmore , miss mecene was eyeriveting and mr predmore s choreography no less so , despite a few cliches \( the heroine had the proverbial headache as the music became more jagged \) maxine sherman , more experienced , offered a delightful surprise in memory match , a stylized armwrestling match for mr predmore and mario camacho mr camacho , in a red tank suit , may have been wrestling with his memory , in black the movement was confrontational and inventive the tape of bobby mcferrin s vocalizing to yoyo ma s cello performance of an excerpt from a vivaldi concerto sounded apt mr camacho held the stage powerfully in tancredo tavares s memorabilia , a solo set to messiaen s look at the cross in this clever bit of ritualistic suspense , mr camacho warily approached a forbidden fetishlike object and then dropped it , seemingly overcome by its power kenneth topping used mr camacho as a boyish zombie in modern times , assaulted by a collage of radio fragments in automanic well structured , it was on the sketchy side , as was one of many days , an obscure ritual by duane cyrus performed by mr cyrus , lisa attles , carlton boyd , kathy buccellato , erroll fahey , andre george , clarissa newby and rika okamotol donlin foreman s field of loves was very much an exploration of love s aspects in a lyricalromantic vein , as reflected by three couples terese capucilli and mr foreman christine dakin and orlando schecker , a guest from the ballet nacional de mexico , and wen lin tsuai , from the carolyn dorfman company , with mr tavares mr foreman responded to his music , brahms s violin sonata no 2 in a minor , with splendid onrushes of kinetic passion , chiefly through virtuosic partnering of twists and tosses if these motifs looked contrived when repeated , there were nonetheless fine contrasts the slow second movement featured a sparring couple , introduced by miss dakin draped over her partner s shoulder , while miss capucilli and mr forman were more playful and compatible at the end pascal rioult s chimera was presumably more tongue in cheek david finley s lighting revealed a love triangle , one man and two women in russell vogler s seethrough victorian costumes mr rioult s character seemed to prefer joyce herring s austerity to denise vale s autoerotic fits it was hard to take the

philadelphia , sept 18 dartmouth s jay fiedler , the ivy league s premier quarterback , could n't make enough big plays today against a resolute penn defense as the quakers pulled off a mild upset by defeating the defending ivy champion , 106 , before a crowd of 13 , 488 at franklin field the victory put penn in strong position in the league race after it had been projected in the preseason to finish third behind dartmouth and princeton jim mcgeehan , the quaker quarterback who had more bad days than good ones the past two seasons , had by far the best game of this career , and terrance stokes , the new tailback , ran impressively for 129 yards , mostly to the inside but the core of the contest was what penn s defense managed against dartmouth and fiedler we did n't set up anything special , said al bagnoli , the quaker coach we just tried to keep him off balance you know how fast he can strike deep and perfect fiedler s one big strike came midway through the fourth period with penn ahead , 100 following an interception of a mcgeehan pass by joe perry , dartmouth finally had decent field position at the penn 39 on first down fiedler threw a perfect deep pass to one of two crossing wide receivers , andre grant , who scored easily the conversion kick was blocked , however , and penn led by 106 on his final two series , fiedler was pressured by penn s defense , which led to an interception by kevin allen and finally a sack on the green s last down mother nature may have been an extra defensive back for us , said bagnoli , referring to the rain , the wet balls and the slippery field fiedler slipped a few times and fumbled two exchanges from center but he relied on no such excuses they just plain beat us , he said and they had a strong pass rush john lyons , the dartmouth coach , agreed he said that his team s inability to run the ball for a balanced offense was crucial the green gained only 34 net yards rushing , 8 in the first half , and the running plays in effect merely set up the passes fiedler completed only 13 of 31 attempts , for 227 yards with one interception he has all new running backs and receivers to work with , and the breakin period seems to be taking longer than expected i thought we 'd win this game right to the end , he said we 'll be all right and we can still win the ivy championship we 'll just have to win the rest of our games in the first half , andy glockner kicked a 42yard field goal and stokes ran 19 yards for a touchdown with a pitchout from mcgeehan for all the penn points mcgeehan , operating from a nohuddle offense , was authoritative , quick and effective he passed for 166 yards with 18 completions in 31 attempts in a balanced offensive effort one new receiver , sophomore miles macik , was outstanding with 7 receptions for 60 yards extra points although freshman players are eligible in the ivy league this season for the first time , none was in evidence according to a rule , they cannot play while orientation programs for freshmen are continuing , and dartmouth s was penn s frosh were not allowed to play because the quakers would have had an advantage penn coach al bagnoli , one of the last to know about the rule , had said he might have played as many as 10 freshmen during the game photo penn s michael turner getting a hold on dartmouth quarterback jay fiedler during the first half yesterday \( associated press \)
bergen , norway , june 16 edvard grieg \( though he died in 1907 \) turned 150 on tuesday night and while the norwegian government has sponsored celebrations all over the world , the epicenter of the griegquake was here in the city where he was born , where he lived much of his life and where he died like mozart at the kitschy height of the herbert von karajan era in salzburg , austria , with composer likenesses in every shop window , grieg has been omnipresent during the 40th annual bergen international festival , which this year ran from june 2 to a gala grieg concert on tuesday night in the grieg hall , the city s concert facility the gala , which took place in the presence of king harald v , the royal patron of the grieg 150th anniversary celebrations , was telecast live to six countries and will be seen in taped and edited versions in many more it would be interesting to hear what grieg himself would think of all the hoopla his work is primarily intimate , the quiet effusions of a sensitive soul speaking through solo piano pieces , songs and chamber music his one symphony is a youthful academic exercise he never completed an opera , and his two famous orchestral scores , the incidental music to ibsen s play peer gynt and the piano concerto , have been bludgeoned through overuse into semiclassical fodder on the other hand , for all his passion for norwegian folk music , he loved the cosmopolitan life , with annual european concert tours , and he loved grand festivities at home in his honor so he probably would have been tickled salmonpink at this week s 150th birthday party not that either the bergen festival or the foundation supporting the grieg anniversary celebrations was fixated on grieg warhorses lorentz reitan , a musicologist who has directed the festival for the last four years , said that a comprehensive effort was made not only to play a lot of grieg this year , music both well known and lesser known , but also to set the composer in the context of presentday norwegian composition in that effort the festival was assisted by the foundation , which paid for the commissioning of 13 pieces by composers both norwegian and otherwise einar solbu , who runs the foundation and is also the dean of studies at norway s national conservatory , the state academy of music in oslo , said that a deliberate decision was made to promote norway through grieg the idea was to use grieg , as mr solbu put it , as the key to norwegian music and norwegian culture grieg s music is known around the world , he said from a small country s point of view , he is a very good starting point for promoting our music to that end , he said , the national government and the city of bergen combined to underwrite a foundation that will , by the time of its disbanding early in 1994 , have spent 23 million norwegian crowns \( 33 million \) to promote performances and scholarly symposiums and exhibitions about grieg and his context , past and present in addition the norwegian foreign ministry has supplied 15 million more to promote grieg abroad a lot of that effort comes as encouragement , not as complete subsidies for given projects and encouragement , in the form of small subsidies , has a way of stimulating further efforts for each dollar , i may get an effect of 3 or 5 or even 10 dollars , mr solbu said it s seed money mr reitan added that private sponsorship for this celebration had been hard to come by , partly because of the recession but mostly because corporations have preferred to promote themselves at the 1994 winter olympic games in lillehammer , norway a boon for recordings the lasting impact of this promotional effort will extend beyond bergen and even the individual international concerts major grieg recording projects have been forthcoming , including a sixcd set of his orchestral music on deutsche grammophon and an ongoing multidisk series of the complete piano , vocal and chamber works on the norwegian victoria label the peters music publishers in germany are completing this year the first complete , scholarly edition of grieg s music , in 20 volumes but this year s bergen festival remained the nerve center of grieg activity to be sure , there were the ancillary trappings of a true international festival , with opera \( the english national opera s rigoletto \) , theater \( including two versions of peer gynt , ingmar bergman s from sweden and another from norway with grieg s music \) , ballet and star turns by the likes of the everorotund sir peter ustinov but the main order of business was grieg more than half of his total output was heard here this year , including a youthful world premiere and nearly all the major works certainly a visitor to the festival s final four days could hear familiar grieg , including a lumpish account of the peer gynt suite no 1 by dimitri katajenko and the bergen philharmonic at the gala and a nicely alert , athletic account of the piano concerto \( the work that traditionally ends the festival even in nongrieg years \) by the young norwegian pianist leif ove andsnes
on march 4 , 1913 , woodrow wilson was sworn in as president of the united states eighty years later to the month , princeton university press published the final narrative installment of the papers of woodrow wilson , a 69volume documentary record of wilson s life and work none of these elegantlooking books \( each one of which costs 65 \) has ever appeared on a bestseller list none is likely to turn up on the shelves of your neighborhood bookstore any time soon yet some 95 , 000 individual volumes have been sold since 1966 , when the first one appeared virtually every american library owns a set , as do hundreds of other libraries around the world \( there are at least two sets in moscow \) initially subsidized by the woodrow wilson foundation , the papers of woodrow wilson long ago began to turn a handsome profit for princeton in fact , the publication of the wilson papers is probably the biggest success story to date in the littleknown branch of historical research known as documentary editing the publication of largescale documentary editions like the papers of woodrow wilson , which make essential primary manuscript sources readily accessible to historians everywhere , is one of the most important jobs done by america s university presses , and one of the most unglamorous documentary editing projects , like dissertations , have a way of dragging on forever many actually outlive their original editors the national historical publications and records commission , a federal agency affiliated with the national archives , is supplying financial assistance to 45 such projects , including editions of the papers of george washington , john adams , thomas jefferson , james madison , andrew jackson , ulysses s grant and dwight d eisenhower few of these projects are anywhere near completion princeton university press , for example , published the first volume of the papers of thomas jefferson in 1950 and the 25th this year , with 58 more volumes currently planned that the publication of woodrow wilson s papers was completed within a 35year span is thus remarkable enough that one man , arthur s link , edited all 69 volumes is scarcely believable \( the jefferson papers have had three chief editors so far \) the project , as mr link freely admits , was by no means a oneman show but even though he worked closely with a small group of devoted assistants , arthur link s own contribution throughout those 35 years was crucial working without benefit of modern word processing technology , he personally chose every document , wrote most of the longer footnotes and saw each volume through the press he also carried a full teaching load at princeton , published two dozen books of his own , underwent seven back operations and helped raise four children the project s associate editor , john e little , who joined mr link s staff in 1961 and stayed for 31 years , has called him the living embodiment of the protestant work ethic to know him at all was to realize from the outset that the wilson project would indeed be completed within his working lifetime it simply had to be , it would be , and that was all there was to it arthur link is dapper and compact , with white , sweptback hair and a finely lined face his soft baritone voice is tinged with the sweet cadences of virginia , where he was born in 1920 , just four years before the death of another distinguished virginian , woodrow wilson despite a childhood case of polio and a lifelong history of back trouble \( i have presbyterian disease too much backbone \) , mr link scuttles up and down the sidewalks of princeton with exhausting efficiency , cheerfully pointing out landmarks with his cane a born enthusiast , mr link loves to talk about the novels of trollope \( he calls the last chronicle of barset the greatest novel in the english language \) and the music of wagner \( you 'll find him in his fifthrow center seat at the metropolitan opera house whenever tristan und isolde is on the schedule \) he brings the same infectious enthusiasm to his scholarly work you ought to do what you want to do the worst thing to do would be to get involved with a person or subject or school that you do n't find congenial most of the hitler and stalin scholars i know are depressed people i suppose that kind of thing has to be done , but i do n't want to do it i want to have fun ironically , the young arthur link had little use for woodrow wilson i grew up in adolescence , he recalls , on what is now known as 'revisionism' we all thought the germans got a raw deal at versailles , and everybody was debunking wilson at the time , so i did n't come to him with a great deal of admiration in fact , i did n't like him at all but in 1941 , i took a course in recent american history from a teacher who was a great admirer of wilson he got me terribly excited about wilson , and i read all there was to read about him , of which there was n't a great deal we had the eightvolume ray stannard baker biography \( woodrow wilson life and letters \) , but baker was such a prude he neutered wilson took the life force away from him and outside of baker and a couple of contemporary biographies , you could have put all the wilson books available at that time on one shelf
two informers who helped the authorities quickly compile early evidence in the world trade center bombing investigation have disappeared and appear to have fled , investigators said yesterday they described the two as being among a lot of people who provided information after the arrest of the first suspect , mohammed a salameh , on march 4 , six days after the feb 26 blast they said the informers may have been involved on the fringes of the plot the presence of an informer was first disclosed monday in court papers filed by mr salameh s lawyer , robert e precht calling for prosecutors to provide additional information , mr precht cited a government affidavit claiming that an informer had accompanied mr salameh to a jersey city apartment where chemical traces were later found and that the informer had helped mr salameh learn to drive a ryder rental van the government contends that such a van was used to deliver the bomb to a parking garage under the twin towers , where it was detonated , killing six and wounding more than 1 , 000 informers possibly related investigators who spoke on the condition of anonymity said yesterday that actually two informers , possibly related by blood , were involved and that both had skipped and were being sought they insisted that none of the information constituted any warning of the bombing beforehand and that it came in only after mr salameh s arrest in his court papers , mr precht cited only a single confidential informer whose affidavit was provided to the defense by the government as backup for a search warrant of a storage locker where bombmaking chemicals were later found the authorities have maintained that what set investigators on the trail of mr salameh and six other suspects was the discovery of a fragment of the ford van s chassis bearing a vehicle identification number traceable to a jersey city rental office only then , investigators said yesterday , did those described as informers and others provide the information but it was clear that they gave their information quickly for it was used as probable cause to secure a search warrant within a day of mr salameh s arrest roles in plot unclear after the bombing , the authorities were also able to tap into a terrorist database that helped them gather information it could not be learned yesterday what role the two missing informers may have played in the bombing plot , or whether they came forward voluntarily or during questioning it was also unclear what effect their absence may have on defense motions or on the trial itself , which has been set for september the new details emerged as the justice department s office of professional responsibility , pressing an investigation into leaks about the bombing case , continued interviewing fbi agents in the new york and newark offices some have been asked to take liedetector tests
despite its recent declarations that mexico will never act as an agent of american immigration policy , the mexican government has for years been quietly deporting undocumented aliens heading to the united states for at least the last three years , congress has appropriated 350 , 000 a year to pay mexico for its costs in deporting residents of third countries passing through mexico on the way to the united states in the past , most were from central america but in april a boatload of about 300 chinese bound for san francisco made it to an inlet near ensenada , mexico , where mexican authorities found them locked in a smuggler s safe house delayed flight back home using the money provided by the united states , mexico chartered a plane to repatriate all but six of the chinese a united nations official determined that the six had valid claims of political asylum the united states , however , refused to grant the plane landing rights to refuel in alaska because officials feared that the chinese would claim political asylum on american soil while the issue of landing rights was debated , about 100 of the chinese escaped from a crowded hangar at the airport in mexicali , about 80 miles northeast of ensenada on the united states border all but a few were caught by american officials and detained the remaining chinese , about 200 , were returned to their homeland after the mexican plane secured permission to refuel in europe rift in diplomacy the quiet but rocky arrangement between the united states and mexico was noisily thrust into the open in the last week mexican officials learned from american newspapers , rather than through diplomatic overtures , that the united states wanted them to accept and then deport 659 chinese who had been intercepted at sea by the united states coast guard and escorted to within 60 miles of ensenada it was a breach of protocol , and mexican officials publicly took offense , defending their country s sovereignty of all the countries to ask to do this , mexico must be the least appropriate , a senior mexican foreign ministry official said i do n't think it is mexico s place , nor do i think anybody reasonably expects mexico to become an arm of the us immigration service victor spencer , a spokesman for the mexican foreign ministry , said yesterday that the ministry had no immediate comment on its stance on accepting american financing american immigration officials prefer to prevent boat people from landing in the united states because once in this country they have the right to pursue claims of political asylum that can take years to resolve federal law and an international treaty to which the united states is a party prohibit the deportation of aliens without a hearing on their claims mexico has never signed the international treaty and advocates for refugees charge that the mexican government , which has historically prided itself on an openarms policy toward refugees , has recently treated many potential applicants for asylum , particularly central americans , summarily , even abusively moreover , these advocates have been alarmed by the agreement between the united states and mexico we have been paying and continue to pay for deportations from a country that does n't show any respect for the basic human rights of refugees , said bill frelick , senior policy analyst with the united states committee for refugees , an advocacy group based in washington in addition to mexico , the clinton administration has enlisted the cooperation of other foreign governments in keeping potential applicants for political asylum from reaching the united states in april , for instance , a boatload of chinese bound for the united states was intercepted by the coast guard 200 miles off honduras the boat , registered in honduras , was allowed to land in honduras , and two lawyers from the immigration and naturalization service flew there to interview the chinese the lawyers determined that five of them were political refugees , a former government official deeply involved in immigration matters said , and that about 40 others had claims worth pursing but united nations officials in geneva , who had final say in the matter , determined that none of the chinese qualified as political refugees , and honduras returned them to china at american expense crucial court ruling immigration experts expect that the united states will continue to seek other countries' cooperation in helping to process and repatriate illegal aliens bound for the united states indeed , a new administration policy calls for the interdiction and redirection of boats smuggling aliens the supreme court ruled recently that federal and international laws prohibiting the summary return of aliens do not apply to those stopped in international waters or outside the united states and immigration experts believe that ruling has emboldened the administration some humanrights advocates are concerned that the government is pushing the limits of its powers in seizing and redirecting foreign vessels the united states , through a treaty with the haitian government , has permission to interdict only haitian boats in the latest case , a state department official , joseph snyder , said one boat captain gave the coast guard permission to take control because the other boats were believed to be registered in taiwan , the government asked the taiwan government for permission to board them taiwan officials said they could not confirm that the boats were indeed were sailing under a taiwanese flag but that they had no problems with the coast guard boarding and inspecting them , mr snyder said lucas guttentag , an immigration expert at the american civil liberties union , questioned the government s actions of the past week is the us government obfuscating or blatantly violating the international law of the seas \? he asked this would seem to come perilously close to piracy
aids is now the single greatest cause of death in the new york state prison system and the only comfort in that for evelyn valentine , as her life ebbs from the disease at the age of 27 , is that she has finally been let out to die at home , back in a lower east side project with her mother and baby , not inside the prison infirmary she came to fear i'm a little afraid , ms valentine admitted , bedridden but in her best dress for visitors i'm not getting better her darkeyed stare of confusion brightened at the sight and grasp of george , her 18monthold son , as she gratefully indulged the free time extended to her under a new state parole program for the terminally ill critics already complain that the early release program is being set at a cruel trickle rather than some larger , more merciful flow needed to deal with the prisons' appalling rise in aids fatalities so that more felons might die at home surrounded by family but state officials starting up the program insist that , because of security and medical concerns , they can only manage an annual release of perhaps 25 of their dying aids prisoners a small part of the current , steadily rising toll of 18 deaths a month from aids , which kills more prisoners than all other causes combined so far only six inmates have been paroled earlier than normal under the program , which began last summer after approval by the legislature i ca n't walk and i'm going to get weaker , said ms valentine , free after serving 18 months of a drugdealing sentence of two to four years and it s bad that i ca n't help my baby , she said , studying him , her speech slurred by complications from a case of syphilis but , oh , i love my baby he s wonderful he s negative ! she said , speaking of his blood tests in a toycrammed room that includes a print of an idealized infant under the proclamation a baby is god s way of saying the world should go on watching george , herman baron , one of a new breed of parole officers who specialize solely in aids cases , kept his doubts private the little boy s blood will have to be monitored for the rest of his life because the virus s congenital factor is so unpredictable and the child could suddenly shift from hivnegative to positive i just filed away seven or eight death certificates quite a way to keep your caseload tidy and this whole thing gets more and more alarming , said mr baron , driving to his next case , ana martinez she proved to be a busy , lively 35yearold exconvict who vows to extend her aidsshrouded days mightily in behalf of her three daughters and five grandchildren i never think about aids , said ms martinez in her apartment near the drugmart streets of washington heights in manhattan what time i do have goes to my kids ms martinez is one of about 200 exconvicts with active aids in the city now getting visits at home and in hospitals and help from eight specialized officers of the state division of parole s returnees assistance program almost all these cases are parolees released in the normal process , like ms martinez , who fulfill their minimum sentence but subsequently suffer active aids and need extra help of the six inmates paroled earlier than normal under the terminally ill release program , ms valentine is the sole survivor at least three more are in the paperwork pipeline that has inmate families and prison critics complaining and contrasting the state program with a more established compassionaterelease program run by new york city critics like nancy mahon of the correctional association of new york , a private prison monitoring agency , note that 15 state prisoners died during the application process more than have made it outside to die she complains that dozens of inmates' families want to use the program , but that the early pace is evidence of the state s determination to let out only a token few prisoners to minimize the risk someone might rebound enough to rise from his deathbed and commit a crime unfulfilled promise only the sickest of the sick are getting out , and sadly the law s promise has not been fulfilled , ms mahon said by law , the program bars murderers , sex offenders and other violent criminals from consideration and requires elaborate medical and security certification of a lowrisk , terminal situation these people pose no danger to society , said assemblyman daniel l feldman , a brooklyn democrat and chairman of the corrections committee but the program is moving incredibly slowly the problem so far is people die by the time you process the paper startup problems are conceded by thomas a coughlin 3d , the state commissioner of corrections , but he says the legislature s conservative approach must be reflected in the program it was never intended as a way to let all the people go who are hivpositive and are going to die of aids some day , he said ms mahon , however , insists that of the more than 200 inmates who die of aids in new york state prisons each year , more than half could be released if the program were properly administered 'adjourned pending death'
to the editor i was astonished by john mueller s review of my book noel and cole the sophisticates \( june 6 \) more than that , i was mystified at the unsupported reference to my careless way with facts , as mr mueller put it , especially his mention of at least six errors in the two and a half pages devoted to the musical play the gay divorce and the film version of it since the book was vetted and approved by those in charge of both the coward and porter estates , i can only assume mr mueller must have information that none of us possesses i would ask him to share his scholarship with all of us in these columns stephen citron new milford , conn john mueller replies for the record , six errors , and more 1 the title of the play is gay divorce , not the gay divorce 2 the fred astaire character in the play does not come to interview the leading woman , but comes across her by accident he is not a reporter in the play , and there would be no reason to interview her anyway 3 astaire does not go along with the game of mistaken identity in the play he is as confused as she is 4 it is odd to suggest that night and day was written for a breathless dancer to sing , since the song was sung before the dance 5 the melody in night and day does not remain throughout in midrange 6 night and day was not outvoted by the continental for the academy award as a preexisting song , night and day was not nominated 7 the title of the film is the gay divorcee , not the gay divorcee 8 the gay divorcee was not the first of astaire s successful screen roles paired with ginger rogers the year before they had been enormously successful together albeit as chums , not lovers in flying down to rio 9 legends to the contrary , there is no record that the censorious hays office was concerned about the title of the film none of its many letters to the studio about the film mentions this issue
albany , march 11 nine years ago , spurred by public anguish over a series of national daycare scandals , gov mario m cuomo and the state legislature enacted a law requiring the state to screen the names of prospective childcare workers against computerized childabuse records now mr cuomo , in an effort to cut 1 million from his 32 billion budget , has stunned advocates of children s rights by quietly proposing to rescind the law mr cuomo s proposal is buried so deep in his executive budget page 368 of the state operations bill that was published in january that many leaders of the state s daycare organizations did not know about it until told this week oh come on , said mary kasindorf , the director of a daycare center in great neck , li , who serves as cochairwoman of the new york state association of directors of notforprofit child day care centers i think it s a big mistake if you 're going to continuously save money on the children , the bill s going to get worse in the future i'm appalled background checks if the legislature approves , new york would become only the eighth state that does not require routine checks of childabuse records for daycare workers , camp directors , adoptive parents , foster parents and others who work in childcare centers about 30 states already go much further than new york by requiring criminal background checks of prospective childcare workers given the state s record , several legislators said it seemed like political suicide to embrace any measure that could be perceived as placing children at additional risk michael j dowling , the governor s director of health , education and human services , said he could understand advocates for children s rights reacting with outrage but he said the cut was justified because the screening process had proved inefficient and ineffective only onehalf of 1 percent of the people we run through the system come out with a positive id , he said and people look at the register as the ultimate sense of protection it s a false sense of security because the childabuse registry , which catalogues allegations made to the state s childabuse phone line , contains only accusations and not proven cases , cuomo administration officials also believe the law may encourage childcare providers to reject some job applicants unfairly but while questioning the utility of the system , administration officials have not offered suggestions for improving it and their comments suggest that the proposal to repeal the law is being driven as much by fiscal concerns as by policy we just think that given the small return we get , in these tight budgetary times everything we do should be costeffective , said terrance mcgrath , a spokesman for the state social services department mr mcgrath said the department s operating budget was cut to 1128 million from 1351 million this year mr cuomo has proposed cutting an additional 28 million next year 'very shortsighted' leaders of daycare organizations and children s rights groups , while acknowledging the system s shortcomings , said this week that an imperfect mechanism for protecting children was better than none at all and they said they were shocked that mr cuomo had proposed eliminating the system to save such a small amount of money to eliminate screening to save 1 million seems to be very shortsighted , said james s cameron , executive director of the federation on child abuse and neglect it s not a failsafe but it does in some instances give you some information the childabuse issue illustrates how one year s political cause celebre in albany can become another year s budget cut in 1984 , with authorities investigating extensive allegations of child abuse at the mcmartin preschool in california and at childcare centers in other states , both houses of the new york legislature unanimously passed the daycare screening bill in urging mr cuomo to sign the bill , its prime sponsor , assemblyman paul d tonko , a democrat from amsterdam , presciently wrote while new york state has not seen an incident on the scale of the california event , i am concerned for children in our daycare centers , many of whom are too young to articulate what could be happening to them two weeks later , a major daycare scandal erupted in the bronx , where 30 children between the ages of 4 and 8 reported being sexually abused at the praca day care center by the time the scandal subsided , several employees had been convicted , new york city s human resources commissioner , james a krauskopf , had resigned , and mr cuomo had signed the daycare screening bill since then , child abuse and neglect in daycare centers have remained abiding concerns of parents around the state between 1989 and 1991 , the state received 1 , 948 reports of abuse or neglect in the 12 , 850 licensed daycare programs in the state , and about 35 percent of the allegations were later substantiated , mr mcgrath said just today , a jury in state supreme court in albany convicted a man of sodomizing a 2yearold girl at a daycare center in nearby guilderland in 1991 the most recent statistical study of new york s childcare screening system was made by the state social services department in the 198990 fiscal year of the 103 , 831 names screened that year , including prospective daycare workers , camp directors and foster and adoptive parents , only 682 , or 066 percent , had been accused in the past of child abuse or neglect weaknesses in system the system s weaknesses , its critics say , include its inability to record convictions or to track allegations made in other states officials in at least two localities , new york city and nassau county , have provided added protection by requiring fingerprinting and criminal background checks of daycare workers but the state has balked at such a requirement , at least partly because of expense in nassau county , the background checks cost the county 50 apiece a total of almost 30 , 000 in 1992 , said lynn kerschner , a county spokeswoman but she also said they have been effective we 've found daycare applicants who have been convicted of indecent exposure

tokyo , june 29 america s big pension funds , which have assumed enormous influence in america s corporate board rooms recently , decided to take on japan s corporate samurai today and they were ignored the occasion was a uniquely japanese corporate ritual 1 , 901 companies simultaneously held their annual meetings today in public halls across the land , the winds of shareholder democracy blew , giving investors a chance , in theory , to question and vote on management policies in this period of recession , falling profits and huge losses the only problem was that since the meetings were held at close to the same time , even the fleetest shareholder could attend but one or two and even those who managed to get past the phalanx of company officials guarding the meetings and got to raise questions received crisp replies where some american annual meetings can drone on for hours , on average , the meetings here lasted from 30 to 40 minutes japanese companies say they follow this practice to protect themselves against sokaiya , a kind of gangster who specializes in extorting payments from companies by threatening to disrupt the annual meetings in outsmarting the sokaiya , however , the companies also throttle legitimate questioning in addition , more than 70 percent of the shares of corporate japan are owned by other japanese companies in the form of crossshareholdings , another means that the companies use to insulate themselves against outside pressure the companies always support each others' management undaunted , a number of major american pension funds have sought to use their growing shareholdings here to influence policies a group of these institutions , ranging from the huge california public employees retirement system and state street global advisors to j p morgan investment management , did what by japanese standards is unthinkable they voted today against some important resolutions proposed by the boards of japanese companies none expected to overturn resolutions , only to send a message of dissent the pension funds voted not by attending the meetings , but by mailing their ballots nonetheless , a handful of the companies contacted insisted they had received no nay votes in fact , there were no reports today of any of the more than 200 companies to which the pension funds sent nay ballots acknowledging them that s strange , said joe lufkin , the managing director of the global proxy services corporation , a bostonbased group that handled the balloting on behalf of the pension funds i'm not sure what that means i think we 're going to send off some faxes richard koppes , the general counsel of the california retirement system , added that s very disturbing either the companies misinformed you or our votes did not make it through for some reason calpers , as the pension fund is known , has 75 billion in assets , and about 5 billion of that in japanese stocks the pension funds basically cast their no ballots on two issues , dividends and expanding board membership traditionally , japanese companies have paid a relatively paltry dividend , using profits not to benefit shareholders but to expand the companies even if the companies lose money , as some did in the recession of the last year , they tend to leave their dividends untouched thus , the pension funds objected to nissan motors and daiwa securities paying unchanged dividends although they lost money , and they objected to what they believed was the overly modest dividend paid by mitsubishi heavy industries and aoyama trading , for instance in addition , they voted against the proposal by furukawa electric to expand its board from 27 to 30 directors and against the reelection of the directors of nomura securities japanese companies have no outside directors on their boards and the unwieldy number of directors tends to insure that decisions will be made by top management alone , analysts say aim of the funds we 're not trying to change japanese culture , mr koppes said , adding that the point was to nudge the companies toward more responsible policies aron viner , executive vice president of global proxy services , said his company had brought together some of the pension funds with japanese executives so they could discuss these issues he said that it would undoubtedly take a long time to have much impact , but that the companies were starting to realize that the american institutions represented such huge sums they could not be ignored for long , at least in theory in the japanese style , the response at those meetings is always the same dead silence , mr viner said but the nature of the silence has been changing it s now an interested silence
new york city has never seemed more like a wondrous toy than in the 1944 broadway musical on the town , which follows three sailors on 24hour leave as they comb the city in search of miss turnstiles , a subway poster girl the show , which first teamed leonard bernstein with the lyricists and book writers betty comden and adolph green , originated as a musicalcomedy elaboration of the bernsteinrobbins ballet fancy free challenging to mount because of the complexity of its music and dance , the show is one long burst of intoxicating exuberance and in its mostly wonderful revival at the goodspeed opera house , in east haddam , conn , it comes to life as a brassy , sexy cartoon portrait of 1940 s new york for the revival , which is the show s first important new yorkarea production since 1971 , some notable changes have been made the original orchestral score has been reduced to just 15 pieces from more than 30 and its director and choreographer , marcia milgrom dodge , has replaced the jerome robbins choreography with her own robbinsstyle dance sequences to accommodate the goodspeed s smallerthanbroadway stage keith levenson s musical reduction is so skillful that none of the score s robustness has been compromised fifty years after it was composed , the brash bernstein dance music is still remarkably evocative of the neonlighted clamor of times square at its most innovative , it injects the blaring staccato of latin american dance rhythms into george gershwin s more impressionistic musical vision of the urban melting pot and songs like lonely town , lucky to be me and some other time have a winning simplicity and freshness that never sound cliched while lacking the audacious flourishes of jerome robbins , ms dodge s choreography still has plenty of wit and spunk and shows a confident mastery of period mood and style it synchronizes smoothly with the music and fits to a t the happygolucky tone of the show s story of hayseed sailors on the prowl for romance under ms dodge s confident direction , the production has the fluency and propulsion of a ballet , even when the performers are not dancing this lightness of touch enhances the aura of the show as a modern urban fairy tale in which three ordinary joes become prince charmings with a deadline for finding their cinderellas but it is the cinderellas , not the prince charmings , who make the goodspeed production truly memorable in the role of ivy , the elusive miss turnstiles , charlotte d'amboise steals the show with a performance that is so hot that at moments this actress and dancer seems about to jump out of her skin whether executing impossibly high flouncing kicks , or simply making fiery eye contact with her smitten suitor , gabey , ms d'amboise communicates the snap and sparkle of someone on the verge of total sensual abandon as hildy , a warmblooded cab driver who loves to pick up sailors and who can cook too , as she sings in a nearly showstopping number , amelia prentice is a swiveling lesson in how to be aggressive and cuddly at the same time donna english gives the role of claire , a prim archeology student whose libido runs rampant after a sip of champagne , a loopy charm reminiscent of madeline kahn among the three sailors , michael o steen , as chip , is the most natural and the best dancer as ozzie , the comedian of the three , frank dipasquale projects a jaunty , mugging amiability keith bernardo s gabey is the show s least satisfying performance he slides through the role wearing a vacuous prettyboy smile , as though posing in front of an imaginary mirror although stephan olson s cartoonish sets and david toser s period costumes do a serviceable job of evoking 1940 s new york , what brings on the town to life is the vitality of the music and dance , and performances that find a nearly perfect balance between comedy and romance from settings that range from a subway car to times square , and from coney island to carnegie hall , on the town conjures a vividly nostalgic picture of a younger , more innocent new york even if that city existed only in musicalcomedy myth , it sure was one helluva town on the town goodspeed opera

washington , may 20 bombarded by accusations from republicans that the white house dismissed its travel staff to reward friends and relatives , the clinton administration today disclosed that the action came after a close friend of president clinton sought white house business opportunities for colleagues in the travel business administration officials also acknowledged that the travel agency that is temporarily taking over the white house travel accounts once had business , financial and political ties to mr clinton and his associates last year , the agency helped pay off old clinton campaign debts and the officials backtracked from an assertion they leveled wednesday against the seven members of the travel staff , whom they had accused of overcharging reporters for travel on white house charters the staff , all lowlevel appointees who have worked in the travel office for at least a decade , arranges travel for news organizations covering the president and for white house staff members none of the transactions under question involved public money the dismissals set off angry denunciations from republicans , who accused mr clinton of cronyism , and left white house officials stunned that an action they characterized on wednesday as part of a routine governmentwide performance review would dominate the news today reacting sharply to the outcry , george stephanopoulos , the white house communications director , said he had no regrets about how the dismissals were handled for years , people turned a blind eye to financial mismanagement , he said we followed up on questions , authorized a proper review by an independent auditor which raised questions of serious mismanagement and we took the appropriate action for the first time in years , the white house travel office will act under a competitive bid process mr stephanopoulos acknowledged that harry thomason , the hollywood producer who is a close friend of mr clinton and owns an airplane charter company , helped spur the white house inquiry several weeks ago by complaining to david watkins , the white house management chief who handled the dismissals mr thomason said today that he was not trying to get white house business , reuters reported we 've always said since the campaign that we wo n't do business at the white house , the news service quoted mr thomason as saying but he said that he had a lot of friends in the charter industry and that they 've all complained on a regular basis , so he told the white house about it , although he did not speak to president clinton about the matter mr stephanopoulos said it was mr watkins s decision to dismiss the travel office , although the decision was made with the approval and authority of his supervisor , thomas f mclarty 3d , the chief of staff , and of the president mr stephanopoulos said mr clinton did n't know the details of the problems the white house said existed in the travel office supporters of clinton mr watkins had ties to the owner of world wide travel , a little rock , ark , agency that will handle white house travel arrangements until a permanent staff is put in place he was a longtime client of world wide , and in the mid1970 s worked in the same arkansas bank as the agency s owner , betta carney , white house aides said in addition , ms carney and her family , and world wide travel , were major political supporters of mr clinton last year , when the former arkansas governor needed to raise 100 , 000 to pay off state campaign debts for which he was personally liable , world wide travel and three carney family members each contributed 1 , 000 , the maximum permitted , to help retire the debt the accusations against mr clinton have only been intensified by the fact that catherine cornelius , a 25yearold cousin of mr clinton , will handle the daily operations of the travel office ms cornelius worked closely with world wide when she handled travel for mr clinton s campaign last year the white house was put in the unusual position today of speaking on behalf of a private company , world wide , because the agency referred all inquires to the white house press office mr stephanopoulos angrily rejected the notion that there was anything improper in the actions of mr thomason or mr watkins david watkins had no financial interest in world wide travel at all , he said thomason has no financial interest in any company bidding on any white house work either world wide was selected , he said , because it had a track record from last year s campaign possibly concerned that dee dee myers , the press secretary , had overstated the accusations on wednesday , mr stephanopoulos retreated from her remarks that the travel office had overbilled the press in booking commercial flights there is no final judgment on that yet , mr stephanopoulos said today white house officials said they asked the accounting firm of peat marwick to review the travel office after mr thomason told them that charter companies , in the words of one white house official , were concerned that there appeared to be a very cozy relationship between the office and ultrair , the charter company that transports the news media on presidential trips they also said the travel office had appeared to follow lax staffing and accounting procedures , with employees not working full work weeks and many records nonexistent
st louis , july 17 even as the mississippi river continues to swamp cropland and force thousands of people from their homes , a debate is taking shape in washington and the midwest over whether to rebuild the levees that have washed away or to dismantle some and allow flood waters in the future to cover lowlying areas , effectively turning them into temporary reservoirs two assessments by the army corps of engineers , one completed almost a decade ago and one done this week for the new york times , found that flood crests in iowa , illinois and missouri would have been two to three feet lower had the river not been confined by hundreds of miles of levees on both sides of the mississippi but the engineers who conducted the assessments also asserted that the volumes of water were so great in this flood that even with levees protecting only cities , the property damage would have been just as extensive i just do n't see the big effect that everybody thinks , said gary dyhouse , the chief of the hydrology section at the army corps of engineers district office here and the author of one assessment the levees have been breached upstream the flood plain is full of water from bluff to bluff , in some places three and four miles across , and we are still seeing a rising crest in st louis 'drag on the economy' other experts , though , have taken issue with that analysis of the levees' influence on flooding dr charles b belt jr , an associate professor of geology at st louis university , studied the last great flood that occurred here in 1973 , and concluded that the levees pushed the flood waters eight feet higher than they would have been if there had been no levees the corps argues a foot is insignificant , dr belt said in an interview here two or three feet can mean the difference in how much property is damaged it s a legitimate question whether the government should put more money into this system of flood protection should the government be subsidizing behavior that is getting more and more expensive \? as a scientist , i'm not going to answer it but as a taxpayer , i think it s a drag on the economy for weeks across this region where the mississippi river has turned onceplacid farm fields into huge and muddy lakes , the debate has been played out in real life as pressure from conservation groups and others begins to mount in washington for tearing down some levees , hundreds of residents in south st louis and farm families in quincy , ill , have been making their opinions known with shovels and sandbags as they work day and night to strengthen levees protecting their property at issue in the struggle both on the ground here and in washington is how to control the mississippi the debate will involve economic and environmental factors that played no role 65 years ago when the united states first began to develop the dams , reservoirs and levees that transformed the mississippi and its tributaries into restricted ribbons of water some see chance for change undoing parts of that mammoth plumbing system , proponents say , would enable the country to take advantage of the river s natural system for controlling floods at much less overall cost levees would not have to be rebuilt at a cost of 1 million a mile or more and flood damage in the future would be reduced , they contend neither the states nor the army corps of engineers yet know the extent of damage to the levees and the total cost of repairing them or removing some most of the levee system between st louis and rock island , ill , the region that sustained the most damage , is owned by farmers and other private interests the federal government , though , pays 80 percent of the cost of repairing private levees that fail or are damaged , and the decision of whether to rebuild all or part of the levee system rests primarily with congress and the clinton administration though conservationists and wildlife officials in several states have urged the government to refrain from rebuilding every levee and allow the energy of floods to dissipate over a wider expanse of land , such a departure in the government s longstanding response to flooding would also subject farmers to more frequent damage to their land that possibility has left farmers and their families in the upper mississippi valley not only battling flood waters but also looking ahead to a political fight none say they want in clarksville , mo , 40 miles north of here , one farmer , sarah sterne , can look from her porch on a hill and see flood water covering every square inch for miles , including almost half of her family s 1 , 000acre farm 'does n't make much sense' our family has been here farming for 50 years , she said we have had great benefit from these levees it stands to reason that if you have crops planted you want to protect them families earn their livelihoods out there tearing them down or cutting holes in them \? that just does n't make much sense to me but that is precisely what some conservationists , independent engineers and state and federal wildlife agencies are beginning to call for these experts , who include staff members of the united states fish and wildlife service , contend that the disaster in the upper mississippi valley was made worse by the government s flood control structures they argue that the levees hemmed in the river , causing more water to flow through a tighter space , thus causing flood levels to rise much higher than they would had the waters been allowed to take their natural course
kipper s game by barbara ehrenreich 310 pages farrar , straus giroux 22 it s no surprise that sciencefiction and futuristic novels are a favorite forum for social critics after all , they provide an easy means of extrapolating and satirizing the problems of the contemporary world certainly , this is what the author and magazine columnist barbara ehrenreich seems to be up to in her first novel , kipper s game , a dark , convoluted piece of apocalyptic fiction that enables her to combine her scientific training \( she holds a phd in biology from rockefeller university and a ba in chemistry and physics from reed college \) with the moral outrage she has cultivated as an essayist and observer of the american scene set in a faintly futuristic world that bears a decided resemblance to the presentday united states , kipper s game begins with a series of unsettling portents the trees in ms ehrenreich s unnamed city have been devoured by a plague of bizarre , gray caterpillars a faintly sinister preacher known as sister bertha has begun to haunt the airwaves on a pirate frequency , and hazardous wastes have begun to leak from the local human ecology complex both ms ehrenreich s main characters work at the human ecology complex , otherwise known as hec , or , as its disgruntled employees refer to it , as hell della markson , who has had to get a job after her recent separation from her husband , works as a lowlevel clerk in the office of dr hershey , a medical researcher on the trail of a mysterious and deadly new virus alex macbride , della s former professor , works there as a sort of allpurpose gofer for dr leitbetter , the head of hec and a wellknown television personality dr leitbetter , we soon learn , purveys an eccentric , new age view of science and religion he believes or says he believes that knowledge yields pleasure , that human beings have an innate drive toward knowledge and that that knowledge must be assembled and distilled in preparation for the arrival of a visitor from outer space , a superior being who will one day redeem the fallen creatures of earth dr leitbetter s latest assignment for alex is to research the life and work of an obscure physiologist from new jersey , henry relnik , who may or may not have had nazi connections in world war ii much to his dismay , alex soon discovers that mysterious others are also in pursuit of relnik s missing papers not only is his apartment ransacked , but he also receives death threats from gangsters , apparently working for an enormously powerful computer and informationgathering organization della , meanwhile , has been preoccupied with a search of her own her collegeage son , kipper , has been out of touch for a year , and when two of his computerhacker friends turn up dead , she starts worrying that something terrible has happened to him , too her search for kipper , strangely enough , begins to overlap with alex s search for henry relnik s papers both kipper and relnik , it seems , have been drawn into a utopian but diabolical quest that could save or redeem humanity although ms ehrenreich s narrative method of manically cutting back and forth between several story lines seems intended to build suspense , it has the effect of making the reader feel manipulated we suspect that information is being deliberately withheld from us to tease our curiosity and that other events have been concocted for the simple purpose of raising further questions indeed our suspicions are confirmed by the novel s contrived and overly melodramatic conclusion , an ending that lacks the organic sense of completion possessed by successful novels of suspense both the plot and conclusion of kipper s game are meant to underscore a few simplistic themes that science can be used for good or ill , that the pursuit of knowledge can be turned into a faustian bargain with nature , that madmen and philistines alike can exploit the interface between science and metaphysics unfortunately , little of the irreverent wit that animates ms ehrenreich s essays is in evidence in these pages instead of beguiling and provoking the reader , she makes her points with the solemnity and portentousness of a thirdrate preacher the novel is filled with lugubrious disquisitions on computers and informationretrieval systems , ponderous speeches about the coming millennium and ridiculous discussions about extraterrestrials where kipper s game does display flashes of ms ehrenreich s usual verbal agility is in its all too rare descriptions of ordinary life the liberating but frightening experience of driving along a highway late at night when none of the usual rules seem to hold the oddly soothing , if numbing , experience of going to a shopping mall to have a solitary meal the kafkaesque experience of working in a huge , modern building filled with dozens of identical , dimly lighted corridors and hallways it is with such descriptions of the everyday that ms ehrenreich is able to display her generous gifts as an observer one hopes her next novel does more justice to these talents photo of barbara ehrenreich
success feeds power and president clinton has little prospect of a powerbuilding success in foreign policy , one that would catapult him to new stature at home and abroad from potshots in iraq to human rights in china , from genocide in bosnia to trade negotiations with europe and japan , from propping up boris yeltsin in russia to cajoling arabs back to the bargaining table with israelis , bill clinton faces mostly quicksand and mudholes his best bet for a quick diplomatic score might be in haiti , but even there peace talks remain wobbly for 50 years , presidents have defined themselves decisively and dramatically by their actions on the world stage john f kennedy flew to the berlin wall to proclaim his solidarity with besieged berliners ronald reagan s popularity soared after he conquered grenada george bush led a world crusade against saddam hussein and instantly transformed himself into a world leader mr clinton is not likely to have such opportunities , and his foreign policy successes are likely to be much more modest in his search for postcoldwar glory , he may well have to focus less on traditional security concerns and more on international economics money lacks the sex appeal of a tidy , victorious war , but has its political attractions in times of economic distress americans would not applaud mr clinton s dragging them into military conflicts they might even be quietly grateful to him for making questionable excuses to avoid intervention but they will not show their gratitude by lifting him onto their shoulders as a nonconquering hero the new president s choices in bosnia and iraq are like president lyndon johnson s dilemma in vietnam damned if he got into an asian land war , damned if he gave the vietnamese communists a victory at the negotiating table no nation now has the stomach for another fight against saddam hussein or a new war against the serbs at the same time , none is openly willing to accept saddam s staying in power nor are american and european leaders prepared for what has become the only realistic way to stop the slaughter of bosnians trisecting bosnia among the warring factions and thereby legitimizing serb aggression and genocide dreading both war and peace , mr clinton and the others prefer the classic approach stall and pray for a miracle no miracles are needed on china policy mr clinton simply has to walk the high wire between standing up for human rights and getting along with this growing power on the asian block best for him to explain this difficult stunt forthrightly now before people start accusing him of playing games conversely , a little diplomatic sleight of hand will help mr clinton promote a syrianisraeli deal first the two sides must position themselves for agreement when the time is ripe , he has to jump in personally and powerfully mr clinton handled the vancouver love feast with mr yeltsin well , yet the russian leader still could lose his referendum later this month a yeltsin defeat wo n't destroy mr clinton , because he s worked so hard for more aid to russia but avoiding political blame for losing russia does not constitute a diplomatic triumph the us president needs to demonstrate that he knows how to orchestrate a triumph and close a tough diplomatic deal he could help reinstate democracy in haiti if he involved himself directly the man from arkansas has to keep his eye on all these political and military flash points but the real payoff for him is bound to be in the international economic arena at home and abroad , everyone wants growth and jobs , which means promoting freer trade mr clinton s first test will come on april 16 when he meets with prime minister kiichi miyazawa of japan japaneseamerican trade has gotten tense and messy the two industrial giants could slip into minitrade wars unless the two leaders signal a commitment to compromise that will require both to show some political guts it s going to be harder for bill clinton to make his mark in the world arena than it was for his predecessors but he needs to start somewhere he has to begin lining up diplomatic triumphs to prove his mettle and skill for without successes , he will lack the power to lead an unruly world
moscow , nov 26 dismembered and demoralized , unloved at home and no longer so feared in the west , the russian armed forces are the most unwieldy and troublesome legacy of the soviet empire draft evasion is rampant , and if the current callup goes as badly as some fear , officers might actually outnumber enlisted men young officers are quitting in droves , leaving behind a topheavy and hollow force by some accounts , there are more generals now on the russian general staff than there were in the soviet days , even though the russian army is less than 40 percent of what the soviet force was officers , reduced from the elite caste of an empire to an impoverished , disunited and often homeless mass , have become less the guardians of than a menace to the sovereignty of russia and its 14 new neighbors by many accounts , military support for president boris n yeltsin against the militant legislature in october was far from unified or certain new military doctrine in moscow , a new military doctrine was finally produced , grandly declaring that the russian army no longer considers any nation or bloc to be its foe and that its new mission will be to react quickly to local conflicts but interviews with russian officers , enlisted men and civilian specialists indicate that economic and political forces , rather than policy , are shaping the future of the force a shrinking military budget barely suffices to sustain the troops , leaving precious little for fuel , maintenance or the future more than 180 , 000 officers , most of them withdrawn from eastern europe and the baltic states , are without housing warships are sold for scrap metal , the mig design bureau sells rides in stateoftheart mig29 s for 8 , 000 each , and soldiers sell their weapons or serve as mercenaries in regional wars it is common to see soldiers in fatigues openly selling fuel from army tankers like 'a defeated army' a tremendous military machine , second to none , has all of a sudden found itself in the position of a defeated army , said sergei m rogov , a military specialist at the institute of the usa and canada , a moscow research organization history offered no precedent for so abrupt a collapse of an empire , virtually under its own weight the third reich fell in war , the ottoman empire slowly degenerated , britain gradually withdrew from its global empire , but the soviet union simply crumpled as its ideology ceased to hold and the cost of the ponderous instruments of security finally overwhelmed its economy perhaps the closest demobilization in recent times was when the united states reduced its world war ii force of 118 million troops so that by the korean war , only 15 million troops were in uniform but the american force reduction was one of jubilation the one taking place here is accompanied by multiple miseries paradoxically , it was in making their empire virtually invulnerable that the soviets brought about its collapse too mighty to tempt any enemy into armed attack , the military also proved too large for the soviet union to sustain i cannot think of any parallel to this kind of collapse , said richard pipes , a professor of russian history at harvard university great empires usually wear down or are defeated in war , but this kind of implosion is unprecedented but then the whole soviet experiment was unprecedented the north atlantic alliance , after four decades of grandiose spending and constant anxiety about the soviet military buildup , no longer rates moscow s nonnuclear forces even as a threat but the former members of the warsaw pact have not lost their fear of the russian forces to their east that occupied them at the end of world war ii and have been forced to leave only in the last few years for their part , many senior russian officers , humiliated by forced withdrawal from afghanistan where a sovietinstalled government was ultimately defeated and from eastern europe , do not hide their vexation at america s treatment of former soviet allies like iraq or its conduct as a selfappointed sheriff in africa or central america the unexpected depth of resistance in the military to japan s demand for the return of the kurile islands reflected a feeling that the time had come to draw the line against concessions to former adversaries at home , torn by the breakup of the soviet union into forces with conflicting missions and loyalties , many officers deplore the collapse of the superpower they served and do not accept its dismantling as final the hammer and sickle still adorn the army s seal just as the empire mentality previals you can forgive yeltsin our pauper s pay , the destroyed health of our wives and children , our eviction from warm houses virtually into open fields , said a senior officer recently withdrawn from the baltics but we cannot forgive that lands conquered by our fathers and grandfathers , and our people living on them , have been given away for less than a pinch of tobacco in many regions , russian troops have taken things into their own hands with or without moscow s blessing , they have taken sides in ethnic wars , in azerbaijan , armenia , georgia , moldova and tajikistan , usually to prevent the regions' spinning further away from moscow or to protect the interests of some 25 million russians who have suddenly become foreigners in spinoff states
to the editor permit me to add to how my aunt charlie pioneered the sitin era \( letter , oct 31 \) by barbara t wilson she is right in asserting that her aunt s sitin occurred a good 15 years before the one in greensboro , nc , at the woolworth lunch counter in 1963 , recently celebrated as the first sitin not to take anything away from her aunt s laudable and pioneering witness against racial segregation , but there was an earlier , and organized , sitin in chicago , perhaps one of the very first , in which i participated as a seminary student it took place on saturday , june 5 , 1943 , and our target was stoner s restaurant , the only one in the loop that refused to serve blacks i had joined the newly formed committee on racial equality , whose leaders , bayard rustin and james farmer , organized the demonstration about 40 of us gathered at an africanamerican church , divided ourselves into six small groups \( five all white and one black and white \) , walked in eightminute intervals to the restaurant , and entered we had been instructed to dress appropriately for a firstclass restaurant and to act with courtesy apprehensive and excited , i felt i was on the edge of dramatic change for more than an hour , we waited until the mixed group was seated in flustered desperation , mr stoner , a methodist layman , called in the police , who promptly left , saying they saw no disturbance we were all then served , but the blacks were served empty grapefruit shells none of us ate until all were properly served then our group burst into song a spiritual other patrons joined in our peaceful demonstration we were civil and broke no law was regarded as drastic in those pioneering days it had , moreover , been undertaken only after a year of friendly but fruitless persuasion , including talks with mr stoner and his pastor ten years later , on june 2 , 1953 , the supreme court barred restaurants from refusing to serve africanamericans , and 13 years later the rev dr martin luther king jr joined the civil rights movement in response to the rosa parks bus incident in december 1955 and 20 years later , in 1960 , the greensboro sitin took place with the authority of the supreme court behind it ernest w lefever chevy chase , md , nov 3 , 1993
besides blows to the head and neck , a prisoner s inability to breathe while he was trussed up and left face down on a bed for more than a half hour may have been a major factor in his death while he was in police custody last week , a person familiar with the case said yesterday many new details of the last hour of the prisoner s life emerged yesterday as the manhattan district attorney and the police commissioner promised thorough investigations , and civil rights advocates representing the dead man s family amplified on charges that the victim , a black man , had been beaten to death by white officers as they used racial epithets in another development , lawyers representing the wife of the dead man , johnny cromartie , filed a notice of claim for an 11 million lawsuit against the city , alleging his wrongful death mr cromartie , 40 , of harlem , had been arrested on a gun possession charge and was hospitalized after suffering an apparent epileptic seizure dispute over circumstances mr cromartie , an unemployed man who suffered from epilepsy and alcoholism , died at new york downtown hospital on may 25 under sharply disputed circumstances the medical examiner on thursday ruled mr cromartie s death a homicide , saying he died of repeated blows to the head , neck and trunk and of breathing problems after being restrained by officers for agitated behavior consistent with delirium tremens , a symptom of alcohol withdrawal an enlarged heart due to high blood pressure was also a factor , the coroner said but pending a grand jury finding , legal responsibility remained unclear the police said necessary force had been used to restrain a violent man trying to escape the man s mother , laura pruitt , and her lawyer , c vernon mason , said that there had been no attempt to escape , that mr cromartie was only agitated by a medical problem and that he was needlessly stomped , kicked and beaten to death yesterday , mr mason , the rev al sharpton , who is often critical of the police , and state senator david a paterson , a manhattan democrat , met separately with robert m morgenthau , the manhattan district attorney , and police commissioner raymond w kelly afterward , mr mason and mr sharpton reiterated their allegations that mr cromartie had been wrongfully killed by the police reports of a witness mr sharpton said he had spoken on wednesday to a witness , whom he refused to identify but whom he described as concerned about his personal safety mr sharpton quoted the witness as saying that there had been no attempt to escape and that mr cromartie had been beaten without provocation , apprently while suffering a seizure mr mason said the witness , a person who has not been publicly identified and whom he acknowledged he had not spoken to , was under roundtheclock police protection and had provided accounts of what happened to the district attorney and the police internal affairs division it s our understanding that the witness said that mr cromartie was beaten to death while handcuffed on the floor , literally beaten and stomped to death , mr mason said they repeatedly called him 'nigger' while they were beating him to death mr sharpton also reiterated his contention that the police were trying to cover up , and he criticized the authorities for not arresting the officers involved in the incident , who have been placed on desk duty pending the outcome of the investigations he said he would ask united states attorney general janet reno for a federal civil rights investigation and challenged mayor david n dinkins and his probable opponent , rudolph w giuliani , to take stands on the case charges about officers mr mason quoted mr morgenthau and mr kelly as having said that seven officers had been involved , not five , as originally reported by the police at least two of the officers were black , and a white sergeant supervised the group , the police said but mr mason contended that two white officers beat mr cromartie mr sharpton said that the other officers had a duty to intervene all the police in the room have some type of criminal exposure to varying degrees , he said none are innocent mr mason had previously suggested that the key witness in the case was one of the black police officers but the person familiar with the case , who provided many new details of what happened in mr cromartie s last hour , said yesterday that the witness was not a police officer it was unclear whether any hospital personnel saw the confrontation , but mr mason and mr sharpton said that doctors had been cleared out by the police and only heard a lot of what was going on mr cromartie , who was arrested in harlem three days before his death , was taken to the hospital on may 23 after suffering an apparent seizure and was admitted to the hospital the next day after another seizure episode he was held under constant guard in room 409 procedure on handcuffs the confrontation that led to his death began at 12 13 am on may 25 , just as one officer was replacing another at a change of shifts as is the practice , the departing officer removed his handcuffs from the prisoner so his replacement s cuffs could be put on according to the police version , when the first officer s cuffs were removed , mr cromartie tried to escape and was subdued and recuffed with the help of other officers who were summoned in the account of the witness who spoke to authorities , two officers kicked and beat the prisoner and used racial epithets but the person familiar with the case said it was unclear if the violence continued after the prisoner s wrists were cuffed again this person also said the bruises left by the blows were not readily visible and were discovered by the medical examiner only after detailed examination below the skin after subduing the prisoner , the person familiar with the case said , the officers placed mr cromartie face down on the bed with his wrists cuffed behind him , with a velcro wrap around his legs and with straps over his body to hold him down mr cromartie , who was 5 feet 9 inches tall , weighed over 230 pounds and had a large belly , was left for 30 to 45 minutes in a position that compromised his capacity to breathe , this person said thus , in addition to the blows he sustained , the prisoner s inability to breathe was a significant factor in his death , the person said while mr cromartie lay trussed on the bed , the police were waiting for an emergency medical service crew to take him to bellevue hospital center , which has greater security for holding prisoners the crew arrived at 1 am and soon afterward pronounced the prisoner dead in another development , joel b savit , a lawyer for mr cromartie s widow , teresa crawford cromartie , filed a notice of claim to alert the city of her intention to file a wrongful death suit mr savit said that mr cromartie had been separated for nine years from his wife , whom he married in 1980 , but that he had provided support for her

washington , may 24 supporters of allowing those infected with the virus that causes aids to enter the united states lost a final battle today as conferees from both houses endorsed continuing a prohibition on entry by infected travelers and immigrants the decision came as the conferees approved and sent both houses a bill reauthorizing the national institutes of health and authorizing 7 billion of its 10 billion budget for the 1994 fiscal year 'votes were simply not there' the bill contained a number of disputed provisions , but none was more debated than the issue of whether persons infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids , should be prevented from entering the country both dr louis w sullivan , the secretary of health and human services in the bush administration and president clinton said in campaign speeches that those with aids should not be excluded from the country but congress intervened voting 76 to 23 , the senate endorsed adding language to the health institutes bill ordering the health secretary to consider hiv infection a dangerous communicable disease of public health significance the house , in a 356to58 procedural vote , supported the same provision that would continue to prevent infected people from entering the united states , unless the traveler or immigrant won a waiver , which can be difficult or timeconsuming white house and health department officials said earlier this year that they were prepared to lift the ban a health department official who would speak only on the condition of not being named said today that secretary donna e shalala was disappointed by the congressional action to exclude those infected , but the votes were simply not there in congress public health officials have said such a ban on travel and immigration is unconscionable and wasteful , in the words of dr jonathan m mann , former director of the world health organization s global aids program he and other health officials argue that aids is not transmitted by casual contact and is not actually a contagious disease , unlike tuberculosis , for example , which is spread through the air they also say that the cost of screening travelers and immigrants would be largely wasted because the infections it is likely to prevent will be only a handful , especially when weighed against the huge number of infections occurring in the united states , which has more cases of hiv infection than any other nation among other provisions of the health institutes bill was one to nearly double the financing for breast cancer research , from about 280 million to 580 million a year another provision ends the bush administration s ban on federal financing for research on transplants using tissue from aborted fetuses the research has been banned since 1988 because , the administration argued , it might encourage abortion among women wanting to provide tissue for the research
when christopher phillips first became homeless , he spent his days riding the no 2 subway line from end to end and his nights sleeping fitfully in the clark street station in brooklyn at first , he tried to doze sitting up , he said , so people would think he was waiting for a train but the tactic was as much for his own state of mind i did n't think of myself as homeless at first , mr phillips said recently at a queens ymca , where a modest room recently became his home after nearly two years on the streets , when crack cocaine controlled his life i just started riding up and down all day because i did n't have anything else to do , said mr phillips , who is 46 years old he told himself that he could always return to the bronx apartment of his exgirlfriend s grandmother , where he had slept for several months but in more sober moments , he knew that she would n't have him back a 200aday habit mr phillips had lost his job of 10 years as head of security at a food plaza grocery store in manhattan because of crack addiction to support his 200aday habit , he began to steal , mostly from the backs of trucks as they were unloaded at delicatessens and supermarkets , a racket he had stopped dozens of times as a security guard i would steal anything , he said , lacing his fingers over his face as his voice broke anything i could get my hands on and resell cases of fruit juice , diapers , infant milk none of it was food for me it all just meant money for crack from 1991 to early 1992 , mr phillips was a textbook example of how a person can become homeless in new york city , where 86 , 000 individuals passed through public shelters last year as a result of unemployment , illness or drug use more than 5 , 600 families were housed in city shelters this year , the highest number ever , officials said mr phillips is one of the fortunate few who have managed to beat the odds with a dogged determination to salvage his life , and with a boost from the community service society of new york , one of seven charities helped by the new york times neediest cases fund , he now has a job , a roof over his head and new hope help for thousands today , the neediest cases fund begins its 82d annual appeal for donations to help people like mr phillips and thousands of others while economic pressures may be easing in other parts of the country , their effects are still being felt in new york city , increasing the demand for privately run human services as donations to charities fail to keep pace with demand the seven charities dependent on the neediest cases fund are counting more on our campaign this year than in any time since the depression , said arthur gelb , president of the new york times foundation , which administers the fund the lingering effect of the recession in the northeast is extending the need for assistance to the ranks of the lower middle class , where more and more families are requiring relief from charities faced with a dramatic drop in contributions during last year s campaign , nearly 14 , 000 donors from around the world helped raise 4 , 469 , 03447 , the secondhighest total ever but the figure represented a drop of more than 12 percent from the previous year s contributions the idea for the campaign was born during a christmas day encounter in 1911 between adolph s ochs , then the publisher of the new york times , and a destitute man , an orphan from denmark , who asked him for money to find shelter for the night mr ochs gave the man money for shelter and clothes several days later , he was given a job in the newspaper s circulation department the encounter inspired mr ochs to have a reporter write about the city s 100 neediest cases the next year the publisher saw the campaign as a way to encourage good will throughout the city and to improve understanding of the plight of the destitute the first appeal , which lasted for nine days , collected 3 , 63088 that was distributed to three charities direct aid to charities in the ensuing years , the campaign ceased to focus on just 100 cases , as poverty became too widespread to reduce to so few examples dozens of other newspapers in the united states and abroad developed similar campaigns this year s drive will run through feb 28 as in the past , the times will pay for all overhead expenses so that the contributions can be given directly to the seven charities in mr phillips s case , support from the neediest cases fund helped him to help himself when he finally decided to fight his addiction i felt like i had reached the end of my life , he said i felt awful talking to people with dirty tennis shoes and ripped pants , smelling bad i could n't look anybody in the eye once you 're taking drugs , nobody respects you , especially you although he successfully completed a drug treatment program in upstate new york , mr phillips returned to the city with no money , no place to stay and no job for several weeks he was precariously close to slipping back down the distance he had climbed having never before been unemployed , he knew nothing about the public assistance system when he went to look for a job as a hospital orderly , a bicycle messenger , a porter he was always asked where he lived i 'd have to tell them i lived in a shelter , he said i knew i would n't get the job without the job , no place to live with help from the community service society , he was able to get 215 from the city to find housing , without the usual 45day wait he was able to get a room in the ymca the society also helped him get help from an employment service and when he finally found a job , on his own , with a bottling company on long island , the society bought him the pair of black work boots that allowed him to start with no delay regaining selfrespect mr phillips said the most important thing the society helped him regain was selfrespect i was thinking no one cared no one s reaching out to help me , but they did , he said now i have money and i have a place to lay my body and i'm proud of that by early next year , he said , he expects to move into an apartment of his own for now , he is content to take each new step slowly i do n't want to hang my hat higher than i can reach it just yet , he said , smiling photo i felt like i had reached the end of my life , said christopher phillips , at a ymca in queens where he is aided by the neediest cases fund \( steve berman for the new york times \)
mexico city , july 18 in a deal that could bring the end of one company s monopolistic control over television in mexico , the government announced today that it would sell its two television networks to private investors for 641 million the investors , led by ricardo salinas pliego , the 37yearold owner of a chain of appliance and furniture stores , surprised many businessmen by outbidding two of mexico s richest industrialists and a third group that included paramount communications and capital cities abc of these four groups that entered bids on friday for a package of governmentowned properties , mr salinas s had been viewed by some analysts as the weakest nonetheless , the new owners could pose the first real challenge in years to televisa sa , the privately owned mexican broadcasting giant that has grown into the world s biggest spanishlanguage media company televisa s four networks are estimated to draw about 90 percent of the mexican television audience on average , and a similar portion of advertising revenue its empire of radio , television , magazines , newspapers and movie theaters is believed to collect roughly threefourths of all advertising revenue in the country because televisa has built its dominance on unwavering support of the institutional revolutionary party , which has governed mexico for 64 years , this sale was also the most politically sensitive in a privatization campaign that has taken in more than 22 billion in less than five years since president carlos salinas de gortari took office \( president salinas is not related to the new owner \) to judge from the politics and the plans of the leading bidders , there seemed to have been little chance that the governmentowned networks might end up in even vaguely antigovernment hands but some media analysts said that more independent news programming would be a way for the new broadcasters to compete with televisa immediately and businessmen familiar with the sale said officials of the salinas administration maneuvered intensely to try to shape the strongest bids in the investor group led by mr salinas , and by his father , hugo salinas price , and his grandfather , hugo salinas rocha , the government appeared to have handed over its precious asset to a firm ally we believe very deeply in the programs of president salinas , ricardo salinas said in an interview this afternoon sure , there are some things that are wrong , and maybe they should be pointed out but i'm not going to launch a governmentbashing tv channel why would i do that \? i believe that the things they 're doing are right unlike his competitors , who had described the government stations , channel 7 and channel 13 , as badly run , mr salinas said he planned for the time being to maintain the personnel already there he said he would seek mexican and foreign equity partners , but suggested that he would not limit the new networks by committing himself to any foreign companies as exclusive sources of programming no critics a senior government official insisted that the politics of mr salinas s group played no part in its success none of them proposed television that would be critical , the official said of mr salinas , he added , he will make changes in the stations , and he will make them with complete freedom the finance secretariat said in a statement that it awarded the media package , which also included a production studio and a chain of movie theaters , purely by the numbers at just over 641 million , the bid by mr salinas s group was about 30 percent higher than that of the closest competitor an investor group that included members of the aguirre gomez family , the owners of a national radio network and the original owners of channel 13 , came in second with a bid of 492 million the aguirres joined the group barely two weeks ago after breaking with mr salinas in a dispute over control frontrunners stumble the two groups that trailed had previously been considered the frontrunners one , led by adrian sada gonzalez , the 48yearold chief executive of vitro sa , the glassmaker that is mexico s biggest industrial company , and clemente serna , owner of a mexico city radio station and a television station in the western city of guadalajara , bid 451 million the other , headed by raymundo gomez flores , a 40yearold guadalajara industrialist who had joined with paramount and capital cities abc , bid 414 million mr salinas was 17 percent higher than the next bidder in his valuation of the television networks but what raised his offer beyond that , he said , was that he assigned a far higher value to the government s theater chain he did this after sending out managers from his appliance stores to assess the properties , something he thought his competitors did not do though mr salinas lives in mexico city , he is part of a wealthy family from the northern city of monterrey his greatgrandfather started one of mexico s leading department store chains , salinas y rocha in the 1960 s , his grandfather and father broke with their relatives and founded elektrasa , a chain that now sells major appliances , electronics and furniture from more than 280 stores ricardo salinas said the company , which had sales of about 400 million over the last 12 months and aftertax earnings of about 40 million , would go public by early next year

cezanne s still life with apples set a staggering record last night when it sold for 286 million at sotheby s auction of impressionist paintings , drawings and sculptures the price was 115 million more than any cezanne has brought before much to the shock of spectators , dealers and auctionhouse experts , the sale had moments when it seemed as if the clock had turned back to the boom of the late 1980 s , the days of bidding wars and record highs in contrast , sotheby s entire evening sale of impressionist works two years ago totaled only 18 million most of the action last night took place on the telephone rather than in the sales room six bidders vied for the cezanne , which was sold to an unidentified telephone bidder \( the last record set for the artist was 171 million for a cezanne at christie s in london in nov 1989 \) the painting was sold by george embiricos , a member of the celebrated greek shipping family , who had bought it for 252 , 000 at a sale of the celebrated jakob goldschmidt collection in 1958 at sotheby s in london before the auction , sotheby s had guardedly estimated that the painting would bring 12 million to 15 million price differentials growing great paintings always bring great prices , said a beaming a alfred taubman , the chairman of sotheby s , who made a rare personal appearance in the sales room after the auction diana d brooks , sotheby s president and chief executive , said the cezanne was the first painting to bring more than 20 million in three years david nash , the director of the impressionist and modern art department for sotheby s worldwide , said he was surprised at the enormous differential between what he called the first class and next level down , which are getting more exaggerated buyers , mr nash added , were mostly americans and mostly private collectors there was little bidding by dealers , and not a single lot was bought by a japanese the cezanne , from 189094 , was n't the only good news for sotheby s last night nine paintings sold for more than 1 million each , a stunning contrast to sotheby s sale of contemporary art just last week , when nothing hit the milliondollar mark last night s sale brought in 759 million , the highest total the auction house has seen since a single sale in autumn 1990 fetched 77 million one matisse , 143 million another hefty price was the 143 million paid for matisse s fatma , the mulatto , from 1912 the painting , which fell 200 , 000 short of a record price for the artist , also was sold to an unidentified telephone bidder one of the artist s great moroccan figure paintings , brilliantly colored and nearly five feet tall , it was sold by the heirs of josef muller , a celebrated collector from solothurn , switzerland that price also surpassed sotheby s estimate of 10 million to 13 million and was a surprising sum , since experts consider fatma more a serious connoisseur s painting than one for someone looking to decorate a livingroom wall the work was not in the museum of modern art s blockbuster retrospective , which included two far more commercial matisses , asia and harmony in yellow , which sold for 11 million and 145 million , respectively , in november another unexpected high price , 67 million , was paid for renoir s woman in a garden , from 1873 seven bidders , several in the sales room and several on the telephone , fought for the work , and john marion , the evening s auctioneer , played up the moment at one point , to move the sale along , he looked at a bidder and said , what s 100 , 000 between friends \? after the hammer went down at the final price , the room burst into applause no one clapped when braque s echo , a large painting , 51 1 4 by 63 3 4 inches , from 195356 , made 38 million , just below its low estimate of 4 million to 5 million the painting , also sold by mr embiricos , is closely related to studio viii , painted between 1952 and 1955 , which was part of a group of eight views of the artist s studio in varengeville on the normandy coast studio viii came from the estate of william a mccartycooper and was sold last may at christie s in new york for 77 million , the highest price of the season low figures at the start the sale got off to a rocky start the first 11 paintings on the block were identified in sotheby s catalogue as property of a california private foundation they were being sold by the estate of cynthia wood , a collector , horse breeder and patron of the arts from santa barbara , calif , who died in january seven of the works found buyers , many at prices below their estimates pissarro s rouen , the effect of a fog , estimated at 800 , 000 to 1 million , was sold for 690 , 000 the painting had previously been on the block in march 1976 at sotheby s in new york , where it sold for 190 , 000 also part of the wood estate was monet s yellow irises in a pink cloud , from 1918 , also estimated at 800 , 000 to 1 million bidding stopped at 550 , 000 juan gris s siphon and glass , from 1917 , which had been sold at sotheby s in 1979 for 145 , 000 , brought 717 , 500 , above its estimate of 500 , 000 to 700 , 000 no buyer for magrittes last night , a number of surrealist paintings were on the block , among them three magrittes , none of which sold \( christie s also has three up for sale tonight \) the one with the highest estimate , the schoolmaster , from 1955 , depicts the artist s famous image of the back of a man in a bowler hat estimated at 15 million to 2 million , it failed to find a buyer bidding stopped at 11 million the sale also included magritte s every day , from 1966 , expected to fetch 600 , 000 to 800 , 000 but attracting no bid higher than 575 , 000 , and life line or woman with a rifle , estimated at 800 , 000 to 1 million bidding stopped dead at 625 , 000 as was true last week at the contemporaryart auctions , sotheby s had its share of mediocre works , and some were on the block as a result of bankruptcies even japaneseowned works have crept into the auctions mondrian s composition with yellow , red and blue , from 1927 , was being sold by citibank , which is recouping a loan it made to gallery urban , the japaneseowned company that ran large galleries both in new york and paris before it went bankrupt two years ago the painting , estimated at 800 , 00 to 1 million , sold for 882 , 500 few experts had expected it to sell at all other works from urban s collection have been quietly sold off , both here and in paris , for some time dealers seemed relieved and surprised after the sale many said they were particularly stunned by the record price of the cezanne , since sotheby s had reportedly tried to sell it privately for 15 million to 18 million , with no success it shows the power of the auction room , said one dealer who spoke on condition of anonymity richard gray , a dealer from chicago , pointed out that the impressionist market has never been as volatile as contemporary art it was a structured sale with more secure players , he said tonight showed strong activity , but i had no idea the cezanne would go so high photo cezanne s still life with apples , which was sold for 286 million at sotheby s last night \( sotheby s \)
the first race at belmont on a sizzling hot day turned out to be almost too much for one bettor standing near the finish line against the chainlink fence that runs along the home stretch , he stamped his right foot furiously , punched the air with one hand and , as five closely bunched horses pounded toward the wire , screamed nonstop , a study in the more brutish emotions come on , move it ! get the lead out and move it ! do it ! this ridiculous figure was none other than myself i had never been to a race track before except for the triple crown , thoroughbred racing had seemed pointless , a small footnote to the day s sports results on the local television news , marginally more interesting than curling or caber tossing what a difference a day makes ! i walked into belmont park in elmont , li , a duffer , a lamb waiting to be fleeced , a low roller with a stake of 100 and a dream to play the ponies and win i left belmont well , to get the official result , read on knowledge is power i was determined to do research before placing my first bet , enough to make the afternoon something more than an exercise in picking horses with funny names two books seemed essential the first was ainslie s complete guide to thoroughbred racing written in a lively style , it is a sober , informed tutorial on how to handicap a race , with an indepth discussion of the jockey factor , the distance factor , the speed factor and other fundamentals , as well as simple explanations of various types of bets and betting systems the second book on my selfeducation program was a collection of damon runyon stories it seemed desirable to steep myself in the argot of the racing world , and to make the acquaintance of characters like hot horse herbie and little alfie , the guys in yellowchecked suits whom i would undoubtedly encounter at the track there are few things more pleasing to the eye than belmont park on a fine day the track encloses an ovoid eden , a lush , landscaped park with two sizable ponds and topiary bushes that are cultivated in the race track s own greenhouse highpressure spigots spray water across the grass , swathing the infield in a romantic , shimmering mist an intricately sculptured chamaecyparis bush stands to the left of the grave of ruffian , a valiant filly that perished in the line of duty specifically , she broke a leg during a match race with foolish pleasure on july 6 , 1975 , and had to be destroyed , ending a brilliant career the fourstory track building , which parallels the home stretch , is divided into grandstand and clubhouse areas to enter , visitors pay 2 and walk through turnstiles to what looks like the approach to an amusement park or zoo at several stands , vendors sell the racing form \( 285 \) and a companion belmont special , a 1 standalone guide that provides basic information on the day s nine races at a glance as well as the morning line , the anticipated odds that each horse will run at at the newsstand i went to , the vendor did n't even ask whether i wanted the belmont special he simply included it in the paper the track also sells a 125 program , post parade , that , like the racing form , has pastperformance stats on each horse running that day , as well as the morning line off to the right , just beyond the first newsstands , is the paddock , where , before each race , the horses are paraded around a small track , called the walking ring , and then saddled up in the adjacent saddling area an early look smart bettors use the paddock parade to look for disturbing signs in their favorite horse if you see a horse trying to kick his handler to death , for example , it might be wise to alter the betting strategy for that race i found it immensely reassuring whenever my picks turned out to be lean , slightly highstrung animals with good posture and what seemed like a cando attitude it s a short walk from the paddock to the groundlevel grandstand and the real business of the park , betting the atmosphere and the architecture are a little like a baseball stadium , with hotdog and beer stands scattered throughout , and even a little cart specializing in french cuisine , truly a long shot , judging by most of the clientele there are restaurants , too , but it s safe to say that most people do not come to the track with a fine meal uppermost on their minds no , the 450 overhead television monitors tell the real tale of the place , flashing a constant stream of information on the changing odds , as the minutes to post time tick away for the first time since i left high school , i felt keen regret at not having tried harder in math if only they had presented word problems in horseracing terms , with actual money on the line , rather than those bland farmers plowing fields into complicated fractions , or freight trains carrying wheat the subject takes on real urgency when you 're trying to choose between two horses and ca n't quite figure out whether 72 odds are better or worse than 41 and by how much my plight was even worse only late in the day did i discover that a 2 bet on a horse at even odds pays 4 i thought the bettor simply broke even all around me , people who did not look like college material seemed to have no trouble performing ninedigit calculations in their heads as the odds on the board changed

cannes , france the 46th cannes international film festival was formally opened at 8 10 thursday night , in french by the starlet romane bohringer and in english and serbocroatian by the parisbased bosnian director emir kusturica , who is a member of this year s jury despite an international recession , the world s premier event of its kind is bigger than ever more films are being screened this year \( some 500 , in every category , with 23 in the main competition \) , and there are more formally registered attendees \( more than 20 , 000 \) whether the festival will also turn out to be better than ever can only be answered after may 24 , when this year s installment has run its course certainly , cannes has lost none of its glamour , especially to the french public even with a threat of rain , thousands of onlookers crowded around the entrance to the palais des festivals along the cannes waterfront on thursday evening , straining for a glimpse of the parade of stars the side streets overflowed with television trucks and satellite dishes searching the overcast skies the celebration of oldfashioned pizazz remains one valuable part of what cannes is about this year s festival poster , of cary grant poised to kiss ingrid bergman , is not mere nostalgia , but a deliberate claim on the past in the states , the oscars give you the glamour of hollywood in one night , said tom luddy , a producer at american zoetrope , cofounder of the telluride film festival and the only american jury member here this year cannes lasts 12 days and is more important than ever in that sense , because of all the television coverage it s important for the survival of movies that they preserve this kind of glamour and stars and celebrities of course , the cannes festival is more than mere glamour the festival is a formidable filmbusiness gathering , not just for the sale of foreign rights to hollywood films but also as a meeting ground for the world s film industries and , one should n't forget , it can be a wonderful place for film lovers to see an amazing number of films cannes is whatever you bring to it , said annette insdorf , chairman of the film division at columbia university if you want glamour , it s here but if you want to buy or sell or just see films , you can do that , too this year gilles jacob , who has run the festival since 1978 , has chosen to open and close the festival with french films starring beloved french actresses andre techine s ma saison preferee , or my favorite season , was tonight s opener it is about a sister \( catherine deneuve \) and brother \( daniel auteil \) who confront each other in the course of deciding how to handle their rapidly aging mother the film meanders over its 124minute length , but it certainly brings out an emotional side to the sometimes glacial miss deneuve the festival will close with a vehicle for isabelle adjani called toxic affair , one of two adjani films due this year missing american films several prominent american summer films are not being shown here among them is steven spielberg s jurassic park , which mr jacob has made no secret of wishing he had won as his closing film other american films that might have been shown at cannes include robert altman s short cuts , woody allen s manhattan murder mystery , martin scorsese s age of innocence , philip kaufman s rising sun and gus van sant s even cowgirls get the blues in an interview , the evercourtly mr jacob argued that american producers with multimilliondollar investments were apprehensive about being savaged by the european press before they had even opened in america mr luddy and other american producers take a more diplomatic view i do n't think an american studio would hasten to finish a film just to get it to cannes , mr luddy said it s nice if it works out , but it s not a pressing consideration gary oldham , the english actor and another jury member , stressed the need not to rush you get to the point where you ask yourself , am i just prizechasing or do i really want to make the best film \? he said still , american films especially lowbudget independents , which can profit mightily from enthusiastic european reaction often need cannes , and cannes benefits from the glamour and energy that hollywood brings this year , sylvester stallone s latest , cliffhanger , is being shown out of competition at an aids benefit on may 20 with elizabeth taylor as host there are three american films in competition abel ferrara s body snatcher , joel schumacher s falling down and steven soderbergh s king of the hill , as well as two britishamerican coproductions from many countries otherwise , the competition films hundreds of others are shown in four secondary series as well as the freeforall international film market include three more from france , three each from australia and italy , two from britain , two from china or taiwan and one each from germany , haiti , south africa and russia of the 23 competition entries , exactly half \( counting the multilingual far away , so close ! of wim wenders as the half \) are in english , yet another blow for the francophilic french film industry this year s jury is similarly international , representing nine nationalities and including the actors claudia cardinale and judy davis its president is the director louis malle , who was the subject of a filmed tribute at the opening ceremony thursday night in his gently sexist article in the official program book , mr jacob celebrated female directors in this year s festival , although he seemed to welcome them primarily as bearers of traditionally nurturing virtues there are three women directing films in the main competition and 11 others in secondary categories even more impressive is the number of young \( 10 directors in competition in their 30 s \) and new directors \( 14 never before in competition at cannes \) gaps in this year s lineup include a slim representation from eastern europe , where the various national film industries are in sad shape , and latin america if there is an early favorite for the 1993 golden palm , it is jane campion s piano , described as a gothic romance starring holly hunter , harvey keitel and sam neill this has been prominently placed in the prefestival french press , and much mentioned as a possible firstever golden palm for a woman if that seems a stretch for an australian production by a new zealand director , the film is largely backed by the the french company ciby 2000 with 1993 being the 25th anniversary of the 1968 festival , which was shut down by student protests and nationwide strikes , questioners asked at thursday afternoon s jury news conference whether cannes should be canceled this year because of the balkan conflict a group of french film unions also chose thursday to occupy the national cinematographic center in paris to protest the threatened closing of a studio and film laboratory mr malle , while sympathetic to the unions , was hardly about to recommend shutting cannes down do n't forget , he said , deftly bringing the session to an end it s just a festival photo catherine deneuve arriving for the cannes film festival opening \( reuters \) \( pg c18 \)
washington , april 5 nine days into a filibuster and miles from any hint of agreement , senate democrats and republicans abandoned the hunt for a compromise on president clinton s economic stimulus package tonight , and decided to try again in two weeks the democratic majority leader , senator george j mitchell of maine , said he decided to stop talking and send the senate on a longpostponed vacation after republicans refused to make an opening offer to resolve differences his republican counterpart , senator bob dole of kansas , said the two sides informally discussed a settlement , but that we did n't think it was the right time to suggest a compromise time for a breather some of my members do n't want any compromise at all , he said mr mitchell put a good face on the break in talks late tonight , saying it would give mr clinton and other democrats a chance to press the case for the spending package nationwide , and provide both sides a breather in which some compromise might yet materialize but in practical terms , the delay underscored the power mr dole and the senate s 42 other republicans now hold over the package , which mr clinton calls crucial to a continued economic recovery and the republicans call both wasteful and extravagant three times in four days , including today , senate democrats have tried to break the republican filibuster against the bill , and three times they have failed to muster the 60 votes they need to end debate today , with more senators leaving town almost hourly , the vote to end debate was 49 to 29 , 11 short of what was needed debt ceiling raised the senate will meet briefly on wednesday to adjourn , then take up the debate anew when it returns on april 19 each side appears likely to offer new and competing versions of the stimulus package then , and then to make another attempt to shut off debate and conduct a final vote on the measure the lawmakers quit tonight about 11 30 after completing the only action that they could agree on a measure raising the federal debt ceiling and allowing the government to sell enough bonds to finance its operations through sept 30 treasury officials had warned that the government could go bankrupt if the measure was not passed by wednesday earlier today , mr clinton s top aides had roamed the capitol , showing new willingness to strike a deal with the republicans his budget director , leon e panetta , said after today s vote that the white house was prepared to offer whatever cooperation is necessary to see that this bill moves , and treasury secretary lloyd bentsen , once one of the senate s top deal makers , showed up later in the day to offer the democrats advice republican lawmakers said and mr mitchell and the white house later flatly denied that senate democrats had informally floated a compromise involving relatively small cuts in white house spending plans , led by a 18 billion allotted to make up deficits in the pell grant collegeaid program that money must eventually be spent , but it would create no jobs and thus is inconsistent with what mr clinton says is the overarching purpose of his bill whatever the nature of the compromise , mr dole and the republicans rejected it outright as far too small asked at midday what kind of compromise was needed to end the talks , he was succinct big one the parties are fundamentally at odds over the proposal although both sides agree it is a minuscule amount of money to filibuster over , especially compared with the 15 trillion federal budget , the specifics have been overwhelmed by political and philosophical considerations that defy easy bargaining even the cost of the package is a matter of semantic dispute democrats say , accurately , that it approves 163 billion in new spending republicans add , also correctly , that it allocates 32 billion more in road and airport spending previously authorized , but never taken out of special accounts fed by gasoline and airtravel taxes legislation at risk the filibuster calls into question the white house s early confidence that oneparty government would be a smooth affair instead , it now seems clear that any controversial legislation , including most of mr clinton s tax and spending proposals , is at risk unless it can attract 60 votes in a senate that has only 57 democrats democrats say the bill and the programs it creates are urgently needed to prop up a sagging economy , and they point to the march unemployment report , which showed a slight decrease in jobs the package would spend 4 billion for additional unemployment benefits and billions more to create jobs , most of them temporary , for construction workers , manufacturers and innercity youngsters republicans say the money would be wasted in part on lowpriority projects and political pork , including things like a 6 million proposal to capture escaping methane from landfills and cow manure and a proposed allotment for a film on early louisiana culture even worse , they argue , it would raise the deficit because none of the spending would be offset by corresponding cuts in other federal programs the administration normally might have won over some republicans with small compromises but the opposition was calcified early in the debate , when senate democrats used parliamentary tactics to prevent republicans from even offering amendments that left them with the filibuster option senator john h chafee of rhode island , one moderate republican who can occasionally be pried from his more conservative colleagues , said today that he doubted that he or other republicans could be lured to mr clinton s side this time tonight , mr dole said the republicans were insisting on a pareddown spending package that would include 4 billion in extended unemployment benefits , about 3 billion in highway and masstransit money , roughly 1 billion in summer jobs for innercity teachers and youths and 300 million for childhood immunizations even more troubling for mr clinton and mr mitchell is that the republicans want all of those programs , save the unemployment benefits , to be offset by new cuts in spending chart inside the spending package democrats say the 195 billion spending package now in the senate would give the economy a lift , creating more than 200 , 000 temporary jobs , even as it helps rebuild national assets like highways and airports republicans say the measure is laden with porkbarrel projects and that the economy does n't need a jolt of more deficit spending here are some of the programs on

london nasser d khalili wants to donate his vast collection of islamic art , which he values at nearly 15 billion , to britain but there are strings attached , and his gesture has provoked suspicion , much of it vituperative and furtively expressed mr khalili is jewish and was born in isfahan , 47 years ago \( his middle initial stands for david , the name by which his friends know him \) he left iran in 1967 and obtained a ba from queens college he began his career of collecting and dealing the relation between the two is one source of controversy in new york in the early 1970 s , building , he says , on several generations of khalili family collectors in 1980 mr khalili moved to london , and earned a phd from london university with a dissertation on islamic lacquerware he underwrote a 1 million chair of islamic art at his london alma mater and has been a generous contributor to the conservative party the source of his money , he explains , is the khalili family trust , based in switzerland and active in property and commodities as well as art a notable collection his collection consists of more than 20 , 000 pieces , stored in warehouses in several countries by all accounts , it is one of the most significant private islamic collections in the world , notable as much for its unusual breadth mr khalili says all major areas of world islamic culture over the centuries are represented , including some barely touched on elsewhere as for the richness of its stellar objects these include the universal history of rashid aldin , from 1314 , which mr khalili now values at 18 million even scholars who speak approvingly of his collection do so off the record , however others , equally anonymous , say it contains many fine items but also some of a more ordinary nature and still others of largely ethnographic interest several question mr khalili s 15 billion assessment of its value one grumbled that it had a lot of rubbish and here and there some very important objects the rubbish may also reflect mr khalili s determination , as he put it in a speech in october , to embrace not just objects made for kings and queens but also the products of craftsmen made for use in everyday life the scholars' reticence about discussing mr khalili openly may reflect an endemic secretiveness in the world of islamic collecting , but also an apprehension about offending mr khalili in the course of commissioning the editors and writers for his 30volume catalogue and related monographs , mr khalili has enlisted in his direct employ a significant number of the world s bestknown islamicart scholars and at prices , he says , that far surpass their normal fees the principal author of the first four volumes of the catalogue , a lavishly illustrated description of mr khalili s extensive collection of medieval korans , is david james mr james recently pleaded guilty to stealing 36 islamic objects , including manuscript pages razored from books , from the chester beatty library in dublin , and was sentenced to five years in jail the jameskhalili connection might seem embarrassing mr khalili did in fact buy several of the stolen objects through sotheby s and has refused to return them until compensated by the auction house but not even mr khalili s most ardent detractors have suggested a link between him and the thefts opponents' objections the opposition to mr khalili s proposed donation to britain is being led by anna somers cocks , who edits the art newsletter , a london monthly miss somers cocks s objections , first stated in an editorial in october and later amplified in an interview , are several first , mr khalili has set strict terms for his donation , similar to those by which the thyssenbornemisza collection was lent to madrid mr khalili insists upon a separate museum bearing his name , of a particular size \( 3 , 500 to 5 , 000 square yards of exhibition space \) all administrative and maintenance costs are to be borne by the host government , with the british museum providing the staff as in madrid , the collection would at first be lent , in this case for 15 years , not donated outright although mr khalili says the city to which the collection is lent will most likely take eventual possession , that is not definite in the meantime , mr khalili will retain the right to augment the collection and to tour parts of it to other countries miss somers cocks also questions the value of the khalili collection to the london community many existing british museums are desperate for additional public support the government would be mad to gamble on it without firm guarantees , one \( anonymous \) curator told the antique collector of mr khalili s proposal in her editorial , miss somers cocks refers to mr khalili s sudden and unexplained burst of prosperity in the early 80 s and to too many of his artifacts being without a provenance more generally , she questions the need for such an expensive and risky bequest when london museums already boast the finest displays of middle eastern art in the world she adds that the bequest would not be quite the boon to britain s 25 million muslims that mr khalili asserts , since the majority come from the indian subcontinent and the majority of the khalili collection is middle eastern a dealer or a collector \?
washington , dec 27 setting out to prove that there is no inherent conflict between hunters who treasure their guns and politicians who seek to curb their sale , president clinton bought a 41 maryland hunting license in annapolis today and spent two hours lying in wait for mallard ducks responding to an invitation extended several weeks ago by representative bill brewster , an oklahoma democrat who is a board member of the national rifle association , mr clinton rose well before dawn to renew his sportsman s credentials at the fruit hill farm hunting lodge on taylor s island , md mr clinton , who has campaigned for stronger controls on handguns while defending the right to own a firearm for sporting purposes , said he expected his excursion today would only strengthen his image as a gun control advocate who shot the duck \? it makes the point i 've been making all along that it does n't have anything to do with hunting , he said my policies do n't have anything to do with hunting for the record , the hunting party managed to fell only one duck in today s 16degree cold mr clinton , who was carrying a borrowed 12gauge winchester shotgun and wearing camouflage and waders , said mr brewster shot it others said the duck was felled by the president s shot , the only one he took during the hunting trip mr clinton joins a long line of presidential hunters , including george bush , jimmy carter , lyndon b johnson , dwight d eisenhower and theodore roosevelt mr bush hunted quail during christmastime trips to beeville , tex confronted on one occasion by animal rights advocates , mr bush said these are n't animals these are wild quail mr clinton has not drawn such distinctions he has frequently mentioned that hunting is part of his heritage because more than half of those who live in his home state of arkansas have hunting and fishing licenses hunting trip criticized earlier this month , mr clinton signed the brady bill , which requires a fiveday waiting period and background check on handgun sales he has since suggested that he would favor further controls , including a ban on certain classes of semiautomatic weapons and federal licensing for gun dealers his position has put him at odds with the national rifle association and with many members of congress , including mr brewster , who voted against the brady bill mr clinton s hunting trip earned him a few foes among animal rights advocates today one hunting opponent , heidi prescott of the fund for animals , a nonprofit organization opposed to trapping and hunting , trailed the presidential motorcade to the eastern shore and protested while mr clinton went to the farm but none of that seemed to stand in the way today mr brewster , who admitted that he was a little surprised that the busy president had taken him up on his offer , said they had great fun on the outing he s a wellrounded fellow , mr brewster said of the president everybody s kind of in their own position on these things , said mr brewster , who flew in from his home in marietta , okla , on sunday night for the hunting trip and flew back later today as far as the brady bill itself , if that were all some of the people were pushing for , i would not oppose it , he said i personally feel some in the debate want to remove all private gun ownership that s certainly not where the president is in his belief mr clinton has always taken pains to limit his criticism of firearms to handguns and semiautomatic weaponry that are more commonly used to commit crimes i can still remember the first day when i was a little boy out in the country putting the can on top of a fence post and shooting a 22 at it , mr clinton said during the brady bill signing ceremony this month i can still remember the first time i pulled a trigger on a 410 shotgun , because i was too little to hold a 12gauge this is part of the culture of a big part of america mr brewster said that at a social gathering some time ago mr clinton had confessed his fondness for hunting today , he said , the southpaw president did not seem one bit rusty as he handled the borrowed shotgun the president had a good time this morning , he said by most accounts , it was not a great day for hunting , and only two birds flew past while the president waited for two hours in a duck blind with mr brewster representative john d dingell , democrat of michigan , john tieder jr , who owns the farm , and patrick j raffaniello , mr brewster s administrative assistant 'the male bonding bit' it s the old camaraderie thing and the male bonding bit , said mr tieder s wife , kathy they enjoy getting together as much as they enjoy the shooting a hunt breakfast of sausage , ham , eggs and biscuits followed wayne pacelle , the national director of the fund for animals , sent a letter to mr clinton calling the entire expedition a pitiful political gesture to the national rifle association mr pacelle was especially troubled by the trip s destination a regulated hunting area in which mallard ducks are reared in captivity specifically to become targets for hunters it was a clear attempt to perhaps mend some of the wounds that had been suffered during the guncontrol battle , said mr pacelle , who spent much of the day assailing the hunting trip to reporters the problem is that he is taking on a whole new set of wounds the environmental and animal welfare communities are very disheartened by his behavior the farm s owner , mr tieder , is also an officer in a political action committee , duckpac , which raises money to support candidates who oppose tightening fish and game rules on regulated hunting areas like his mr clinton left later in the day for hot springs , ark he is scheduled to spend the week visiting friends in arkansas , where he is to attend a university of arkansas basketball game on tuesday he is then to travel to hilton head , sc , where he will participate in an annual yearend policy retreat , renaissance weekend photo

the koreanamerican grocers association of new york had a surprising guest give the invocation at its annual awards meeting last month the rev al sharpton the grocers , for whom memories of a blackled boycott in brooklyn are still fresh , have also sponsored spots on black radio stations honoring heroes like thurgood marshall the korean produce association ran a scholarship program for minority students in conjunction with the amsterdam news on another front , the koreanamerican small business service center of new york is fighting a city plan for zoning changes that would allow bigger food stores into the city , as well as lobbying the city council to crack down on illegal food vendors community relations efforts on a range of issues , korean business owners in new york are using the strength of their numbers to try to increase their political influence , improve their business opportunities and , perhaps most important , mend their often bitter relations with other ethnic groups in the city our guys are small , corner store owners , said myong y juch , president of the grocers' group but they are not small when they get together the grocers have elicited municipal help to set up a huge new food cooperative to cut their costs drastically community relations initiatives by them and others have included taking black leaders on tours of south korea and sending black students to study there and on a political level , the korean immigrants are banding together to push their concerns by voting as a bloc in this year s mayoral race mayor david n dinkins , as well as his likely challengers , rudolph w giuliani and andrew j stein , are already campaigning among koreanamericans if it s possible to get together to support one single candidate , i think it s a great idea , said bong jin sa , executive director of the korean produce association in part , the new collective efforts have been prompted by resentment and fear resentment over what the koreans see as misconceptions about them , and fear that they may be vulnerable to ethnic violence those concerns were fueled by the bitter blackled boycott of a korean store in brooklyn in 1990 , and by the antikorean violence during the los angeles riots last year they have made a collective response , said pyong gap min , a sociologist at queens college they realized they had to be united to survive for an immigrant group owning proportionately more small businesses than others , it is hardly surprising that the collective approach is centered around business concerns and articulated by businessmen in the past , the koreans have organized fierce and effective boycotts against suppliers who cheated or harassed them but this time , their emerging collective approach is necessarily more public for one thing , the organizations are trying to change the behavior of korean business people so that they are less likely to spur a negative response this has been done partly through extensive advertising in new york s four daily korean newspapers and three cable television channels , among other outlets a message repeated over and over is be a koreanamerican , not a koreankorean the business owners are also trying to reach out to other groups more nonkoreans are being employed in stores , and seminars are being offered to teach koreans to smile more frequently , something they say is rare in their culture consorting with giants we have to keep contact with our neighbors , because they misunderstand , said sang y choi , who owns a grocery store on staten island sometimes they feel korean people are angry when they 're not mr juch counts 300 , 000 koreans in the metropolitan region , a slightly higher estimate than some sources he says they own more than 10 , 000 businesses , of which 3 , 500 are groceries , delis or supermarkets these account for 15 percent of such businesses in the city their total sales approach 15 billion it was thus hardly surprising that the giants of the food industry , from anheuserbusch to general mills , streamed to the association s second annual food and trade show last month just name the company , mr juch declared all the largest ones were there , and some small , local companies , too mayor dinkins and mr stein spoke , and president clinton and gov mario m cuomo sent greetings from the corner deli to the supermarket , koreanamerican businesses play a vital role in our communities and country , the president said in his letter advice on american customs the grocers' association began in brooklyn in 1985 with 20 businesses as members , and now has 2 , 500 its first task , a continuing one , was to help grocers , most of whose english was at least somewhat lacking , adjust to american business customs new shopkeepers learn where to get plastic bags and commercial quantities of ice cream they also are repeatedly told that four or five korean grocers are killed annually , and that they must never try to resist robbers hany sal ma , an employee of a store in flatlands , brooklyn , that was held up by three armed men last week , absorbed the lesson we gave them everything that was in the register , he

port st lucie , fla , feb 25 baseball is a noncontact sport that has broken tony fernandez up pretty well his medical chart , in fact , reads like a blue crossblue shield nightmare 1977 surgery at age 14 to remove bone chips in his right knee 1984 months spent recuperating from a broken bone in his left hand 1987 a fractured bone in his right elbow is fixed , and surgery is also performed on his left knee 1989 a pitch shatters a bone in his face , requiring more surgery 1991 an operation is performed to reconstruct the ulnar collateral ligament on his right thumb all of them have done something , said fernandez , the shortstop the mets acquired from san diego last fall the question of throwing the damage has varied cecilio guante s pitch to his face on april 7 , 1989 , stole a bit of his courage , he admits bill madlock s dirty slide on sept 24 , 1987 , crushed his elbow and took some life off the shortstop s throws across the infield none of the damage , though , has been permanent , according to fernandez people think i do n't have a good arm anymore , said fernandez i 'll let the first baseman testify on that i want to play as long as my body allows me to fernandez s body remains willing because his mind has always been strong cabeza spanish for head was a nasty nickname while he was growing up in the dominican republic now for fernandez , it is said in tribute his brain is about the only body part not to suffer direct injury i think i am a conservative shortstop now , said fernandez , 30 years old and about to enter his 10th season in the majors as a younger player , i was called flashy for me , i liked to make the play as easy as possible for some , that was styling the shortstop style for fernandez today is more that of data processor , cold calculator identify the man at the plate , rifle through the brain s file to discover the tendencies effort is conserved , and runs are saved nonetheless 'i'm in my prime' you become more mature , and so you compensate , said fernandez positioning yourself is the key i believe that at 30 , i'm in my prime i can make the plays i can get the outs and at bat , he can make dozens of fewer outs than any of the other shortstops the mets have outfitted in recent seasons dick schofield hit 205 for the mets in 1992 kevin elster hit 224 during his tenure fernandez has hit 295 for his career with toronto and san diego there were his 213 hits in 1986 , his 322 average in 1987 , his 17 triples in 1990 , his 30 or more doubles in five of the last eight years an offensive force , said manager jeff torborg a complete player all of which raises the possibility that the mets can construct more of a complete batting order fernandez will hit second behind vince coleman he could hit leadoff if now do n't say when coleman is disabled the challenge for the mets is to create an environment and work schedule that maximize the chance for fernandez to appear in 150 games and hit at the same level in september as he did in last may fernandez , who hit 330 or above for most of the first half of last season with the padres , slid to 297 by the allstar game break and finished with a 275 average making vacation plans i do n't have a game plan for him yet , said torborg but it is clear we are going to have to rest him i will let him dictate the specifics of it he is a man with his own techniques , his own style and his own very prepared , very unspecific rationale for his falloff last season i had back spasms near the end , although i ca n't use those as an excuse , said fernandez to me , i was on the ball as hard as i had been , there just were n't hits people told me i had a curse on me a curse \? no scars \? yes inside pitch tony fernandez confessed that he gave terry pendleton of atlanta every chance to beat out a ground ball on the last day of the 1992 season so that the braves' third baseman might achieve his 200th hit you ca n't make it too obvious , said fernandez , who threw pendleton out all the same but i gave it a try bobby bonilla , who believed last season that umpires were overly eager in ringing him up on called third strikes , said he anticipates no lingering problems this season at least , he is sure there are no hard feelings on his end players , i think , let things go faster than other people , said bonilla dwight gooden , bret saberhagen and sid fernandez all pitched to live batters , with positive results for everyone but the players with the bats it was n't quite fair , said manager jeff torborg former manager bud harrelson has been working with the infielders this spring photo tony fernandez , who reported for the first time yesterday , will enable the mets to construct a more complete batting order than last season s \( r r sports group \)
los angeles , aug 2 television violence is contributing significantly to reallife violence television violence is contributing minimally to reallife violence television violence should be viewed in the context of videogame violence , movie violence and rocklyric violence television violence is a nolose cause for opportunistic politicians all these views and more , many more , were offered today as several hundred of the nation s top television executives met in a hotel ballroom here for an unusual sevenhour exercise in selfexamination if nothing else , the conference , which was carried in part on cnn , proved just how potent the issue of television violence has become although no concrete resolutions came out of the day s many speeches and panel discussions , a clear message did emerge the television industry can either reduce violence in its programming or risk stricter government regulation no one 'is losing votes' in a speech at the conference , senator paul simon , democrat of illinois , who has been one of the nation s leading critics of television violence , outlined several proposals to curb violent programming that are now before congress all or none of these may pass , he said i can tell you that none of the sponsors of these initiatives is losing votes back home with these ideas today s conference , sponsored by the national council for families and television , was scheduled months before the four major networks agreed in june to broadcast warnings at the start of particularly bloody programs on thursday , just four days before the conference , 15 cable channels , including hbo , usa , mtv and nickelodeon , announced that they would join the networks in putting on such warnings even as many television executives today called for reducing television violence , the conference still highlighted the substantial differences that separate the industry from social scientists and many citizen groups the role of baby sitter the most divisive question raised at the conference was whether television , which has served as a baby sitter for many children , should be obliged to act with this role in mind several academics who have studied the link between televised and real violence said it should in contrast , most television executives argued that parents should be the ones to determine what their children watch what is needed is parental responsibility more than anything , said jack valenti , the president of the motion picture association of america george gerbner , a professor at the annenberg school for communication at the university of pennsylvania , who has developed an index of television violence , argued , the notion of parental control is an uppermiddleclass conceit he added , passing the buck to parents is the greatest copout of this industry among academics who have studied the issue , there is a fairly broad consensus that television violence , while not necessarily causing reallife violence , does tend to make children less sensitive to its effects in this context , some researchers list saturdaymorning cartoons among the most socially destructive programs on television the coyote s comeuppance at the conference , a heated debate broke out when several researchers called the adventures of wile e coyote and daffy duck too violent for children to watch jeff greenfield , a political and media analyst for abc news , who was one of the conference s moderators , argued that wile e coyote s suffering was a just consequence of his evil plans to eat the road runner and christine hikawa , the vice president for broadcast standards at abc , said the researchers' credibility goes out the window when they equate cartoons with graphic depictions of violence several independent producers voiced concern that efforts to reduce violence would make television even blander than it already is i do n't know any writer who can write effectively with these criteria in front of them , said steven cannell , a producer whose credits include violent shows including hat squad and the ateam many conference participants voiced resentment about all the criticism aimed at entertainment television , noting that local news programs and video games are often far more explicit in their depictions of violence personally , i'm very troubled by the local news and some of the reality shows , said andy heward , the chairman of a production company , dic enterprises , that specializes in cartoons the one topic on which most conference participants seemed to agree was , perhaps not surprisingly , a topic over which the television industry has no direct authority the need for stricter gun control geraldine laybourne , the president of nickelodeon , said that before she went to the conference , she had communicated with several children about television violence through an electronic bulletin board they just wondered how come it s so easy for people to get guns in this country , she said and with that , the entire crowd broke into applause photo senator paul simon speaking at the conference yesterday on violence in television \( associated press \)
one of hugo wolf s pithiest criticisms of brahms , that he could not exult , might also have been leveled at the new york philharmonic a few years ago the orchestra could play raucously , to be sure , and with childish exuberance , but seldom with focused energy , let alone cohesive abandon wolf was wrong , of course if proof were still needed , kurt masur and the philharmonic provided it on wednesday evening with a rousing performance of the academic festival overture , to open the third and final program in their schumannbrahms series at carnegie hall and they cinched the case with the hungarian dance no 1 , played as an encore at the same time , the orchestra showed yet again how much it has grown in its two years under mr masur every phrase had life and direction , and the players showed involvement and even unabashed joy in their collective mien as well as in their performances true , this is no more than should be expected of a top international orchestra , but it is more than many new yorkers thought they would ever live to see and hear from the philharmonic the major brahms work , the violin concerto in d , came off less well , with a labored performance by the soloist , shlomo mintz mr mintz leaned heavily into his sonority in the first movement , his tuning misfired repeatedly and he tended to pull back the tempo however mr masur may have felt about this interpretation , he accompanied sympathetically the performance as a whole sounded effortful and ponderous , but at least it was unified schumann s symphony no 4 filled out the program typically , nowadays , conductors try to offset the turgidity of schumann s orchestrations with light , fleet performances mr masur went halfway , with a fleet performance that retained all the traditional weight , and made it work beautifully it was thrilling to hear the elephantine load moved along so swiftly and yet with fine interpretive nuance here , again , the orchestra responded with commitment and vigor the strings produced an attractive silky sound , with none of the hard edge they still betray with some regularity despite the improved acoustics of avery fisher hall two points for the maligned postrenovation acoustics of carnegie and two more for the stirring impact of the massed fortes in the symphony and the overture brahms was especially fond of the schumann fourth , but in its more transparent original scoring in fact , his publication of the first version caused a serious rift in his longtime friendship with schumann s widow , clara the dispute was eventually settled , and it was good to hear the friendly circle restored in the preconcert recital , with a performance of clara schumann s piano trio in g minor the work , which the selfcritical clara came to castigate as effeminate and sentimental , is in fact reasonably sturdy , and it received a spirited interpretation here by some of the fine younger players of the philharmonic , kerry mcdermott , violinist alan stepansky , cellist , and jonathan feldman , pianist
washington , sept 30 following are excerpts from the treasury department s report on the raid by agents of the the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms on david koresh s compound near waco , tex among the principals cited in the report were phillip j chojnacki , special agent in charge of the bureau s houston office , and charles d sarabyn , assistant special agent in houston although the raid on the branch davidian compound had originally been set for march 1 , 1993 , no one had even started to draft the mandatory documentation of the raid plan by feb 23 , 1993 , when acting special agent in charge dartell dyer \( kansas city \) arrived in waco and was assigned to be the support coordinator for the operation dyer s past military service led him to assume that there was a detailed written raid plan , but , when he asked the raid planners for a copy he was advised that none existed thereafter , dyer and agent william krone took it upon themselves to produce one , even though they started with little knowledge about the work of the tactical planners in a flurry of activity , the two conducted interviews , gathered information and eventually were able to generate a written raid plan due to the tight timetable , the plan did not meet dyer s standards in terms of quality , and from his perspective was still a work in progress nevertheless , the two of them had essentially finished a written raid plan the day before the raid the plan , however , remained on krone s desk it was never distributed to any agents , or relied upon by any of the planners after the failed raid , authorities began to ask atf officials for the raid plan the texas rangers were the first to ask atf s houston office for the raid plan when dyer was told of the request , he realized that the written plan had never been put in a satisfactory form he advised chojnacki and sarabyn and the three decided to revise the plan to make it more thorough and complete nowhere on the new version of the plan they crafted was there any indication that this was not the original document , or any identification of what had been added the only hint that the plan had been modified was a handwritten notation in the margin of one page that did not indicate when and how the notation was made moreover , chojnacki the agent responsible for producing it for the texas rangers never advised them that there was an original raid plan that differed substantially from the plan produced the readiness of chojnacki , sarabyn , and dyer to revise an official document that would likely be of great significance in any official inquiry into the raid without making clear what they had done is extremely troubling and itself reflects a lack of judgment this conduct , however , does not necessarily reveal an intent to deceive and , in the case of dyer , there does not appear to have been any such intent the behavior of chojnacki and sarabyn when the alteration was investigated does not lead to the same conclusion
the clubhouse door remained closed after the 108 defeat the manager was inside screaming the players , some of whom were in the showers while the manager yelled again about not going back to the old ways , finished dressing then , one by one , the culprits in the afternoon s debacle against the giants emerged and walked off without speaking chico walker , whose error in the eighth opened the way for san francisco s final three runs , came first mike maddux , who allowed four hits and three runs in one inning of work , came next mike draper , his line loaded with three hits and a run , brought up the rear single file , they left , silent and sad it was as appropriate a fourth of july parade as could be staged at shea stadium in 1993 the mets , allowing 17 hits and committing 3 errors , were embarrassed again , if embarrassment is possible at this point in a 2455 season a comeback from an early 31 deficit was among the debris a 43 lead was wasted , too the erasing of a threerun deficit in the seventh did n't last an inning the three errors , the manager said , could have been six and he would n't have argued with the official scorer going out and playing like kindergarten people , said green , after the clubhouse door finally opened his sarcastic summation was only a brief part of his latest diatribe , one typically rich in expletives but not specifics eddie murray s error with the bases loaded in the fifth accounted for two runs the veteran first baseman s misplay of a throw from the outfield helped quicken the last avalanche of incompetence in the eighth jeff kent was ejected in the third inning for arguing a called third strike , depriving his club of his bat in a game that was clearly going to have lots of runs scored howard johnson could n't handle a playable infield liner and then bumbled a grounder in the seventh as the giants scored their seventh run frank tanana , the starter who turned 40 years old saturday and pitched like he was 60 yesterday , gave up a pair of home runs in the second , one to the giants' eighth man in the order it s life in last place , said tanana said johnson it s not a lack of effort it s just not good enough it s what bad teams are green , of course , was charged with transforming this bad team it s a job he admits he underestimated , and so far it s a job that by all measurements seems beyond his ability is he to blame \? no has he been restricted by the turmoil in the front office \? yes is he accountable for some part of a tenure that has seen the mets go 1130 under his direction \? well , he s a man with a reputation for accepting responsibility i get embarrassed , and i told them that , green said we 've worked too hard to change everything about playing defense we 've worked too hard to change the image around here 'get them out ! ' green did n't necessarily help the image of the mets as a more mature outfit with his postgame dramatics he mocked a radio reporter s question he swore he declined to address a question regarding a potential roster move to give the club adequate pitching as it enters a week with a thursday doubleheader and bret saberhagen s physical condition in doubt he then ordered the club s public relations official to clear his office of reporters get them out ! green screamed green has indicated he would like to say as much to some of his players and it would have been the pitchers so ordered yesterday tanana lasted five innings , removed in the sixth after giving up his ninth hit mark carreon homered against him with one out in the second to nullify murray s homer in the bottom of the first then , with two out in the second , tanana gave up a single to andy allanson and a homer to leftcenter by mike benjamin tanana s late throw on a sacrifice , murray s first error and a pair of singles added up to three more runs in the fifth draper , sabotaged by poor infield defense in the seventh , had no one to blame but himself for will clark s runscoring double that followed maddux , as profound a bust as any met this season , did n't recover from walker s error on a royce clayton grounder leading off the eighth benjamin , darren lewis , robby thompson and clark all singled as three runs crossed the plate against maddux to leave his record in 1993 at 06 the home runs hurt , said tanana then there was the crazy inning it winds up taking the joy out of it all empty runs surely , to play without pitching and defense makes for a cruel , empty enterprise murray , who had a sacrifice fly and a tworun single to go with his homer , had a fat number in his runs batted in column and nothing to smile about johnson homered for the first time in a month and had a bloop runscoring hit as the mets erased a 74 disadvantage in the seventh , but he was left encased in ice and depression after the game jeromy burnitz , the rookie with the big bat , had a clutch single to load the bases for the mets in the eighth , but then had to witness consecutive strikeouts by jeff mcknight and vince coleman as the inning became a resounding and conclusive dud none of us should be feeling pressure , said johnson what is there to prove \? oh , we can get beat we just should stop beating ourselves the giants , actually , did a pretty good job of trying to outdo the mets in the selfdestruction category one of the best teams in baseball wound up using six pitchers and 15 players total to get the job done against the worst club in baseball we gave them everything they could handle , said green the mets , in the end , were stuck with themselves and proved too great an enemy to overcome inside pitch pete schourek will start in bret saberhagen s place tuesday charlie o'brien threw out three giants trying to steal howard johnson stole his 200th career base for the mets vince coleman is 16 for 34 over his last nine games eddie murray s 14 ground outs into double plays lead the majors the 17 hits by the giants were the most given up this season by the mets frank tanana s double in the third was the first extrabase hit of his 20year career rod beck struck out three mets to gain his 24th save photos mets' howard johnson is unable to handle a ground ball by the giants' darren lewis in the seventh inning yesterday during mets' 108 loss to san francisco \( pg 29 \) giants' dave martinez being tagged out by mets catcher charlie o'brien as he tried to score in eighth inning vince coleman is caught in rundown by giants' robby thompson after trying to steal second in fifth inning \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg 31 \)
new haven , jan 14 a gentle snow fell steadily on st ronan street today , rendering the gracious neighborhood virtually deserted save for an occasional jogger wearing a yale sweatshirt , or for people walking their dogs but genteel quiet is not unusual on this street of stately homes where zoe baird , the nominee to be the next attorney general , lives people seldom congregate on the sidewalk to share community gossip here nor do they become especially excited about the accomplishments of one another so it did not raise eyebrows unduly when ms baird was named as presidentelect bill clinton s choice to head the justice department and it did not raise eyebrows unduly today when news reports circulated that ms baird and her husband had employed as a baby sitter and parttime driver a peruvian couple who were living in this country illegally on st ronan street and other parts of the prospect hill neighborhood , there are , after all , a state superior court judge , the head of yale university s center for british art and a congresswoman , rosa l delauro there is also a generous supply of doctors , lawyers and people affiliated with yale and in this neighborhood , where both husband and wife often work at powerful jobs , few people are critical of ms baird s babysitting arrangements i find a cleaning woman and the last thing that crosses my mind is to ask if they 're citizens , said robie pooley , head of the ronanedgehill neighborhood association st ronan street , with its mix of tudorand contemporary styles , is in an affluent neighborhood that dates to at least the 1920 s in the neighborhood s heyday , said chris irwin , whose family has lived here at least since then , everyone had butlers and maids , but those days are long gone that sign of luxury has been replaced with livein caretakers , some of them immigrants who are found most often through word of mouth and local newspaper advertising , several residents said in interviews today ms baird and her husband , paul gewirtz , a yale law professor , and their 3yearold son live in a sprawling redbrick home in the quiet snow there today , several newspapers still in weatherproof packages littered the sidewalk where the lawn sloped down from the front door to the street ms pooley said today that she knew nothing of the personal life of ms baird and mr gewirtz i 've never even thought of how they take care of their child , she said it s none of my business even those who are not acquainted with ms baird and her husbandwere reluctant to criticize her , perhaps in keeping with a code of minding one s own manners it is not at all unusual for some attorneys to not be familiar with certain sections of the internal revenue code , or of the naturalization and immigration laws , said edward l walsh 3d , a trial lawyer who lives two doors down from ms baird this area has a high demand for child care , he said you have to go to work , and you have to have people take care of your children i ca n't imagine worrying about whether the person has the right papers or not but all this is not to say the neighborhood takes everything in stride it is listed in a national historic register , and residents zealously guard against the crime and poverty that seem to be engulfing some other parts of the city last year , that concern resulted in the justice department s filing a discrimination lawsuit against several residents and the neighborhood association the residents were trying to prevent a woman with 10 adopted and foster children from moving into a home on a nearby street they said she could not operate her home without receiving a change of zoning , and they sued to keep her out the justice department charged them with violating the fair housing act mrs pooley said that the case was still pending and that ms baird was not a part of either action while that incident may have cast the community in a certain exclusionary light , others say it is not at all that kind of community the neighborhood is filled with a lot of people who care about new haven , said betsy henleycohen , a business owner and neighbor of ms baird new haven has been known as one of the poorest cities in the country it s a lot easier as a professional to live in other places , but this is one of the places where those who want to stay here live ms henleycohen is also not one of those who is indifferent to ms baird s nomination i think it s spectacular that she was nominated , she said i think she s incredibly intelligent and i think she has the highest standards of personal integrity photo the home of zoe baird , attorney generaldesignate , on treelined st ronan street in new haven residents of the street and the surrounding area assume their neighbors excel at what they do \( steve miller for the new york times \)
greenwich , conn , jan 6 this elegant town , badly damaged by last month s storm , has chosen to stick to its principles and , unlike all other eligible towns in the region , is not seeking money from the federal government to fix its parks and beaches town officials said that if greenwich accepted the money , which would probably amount to no more than 250 , 000 , the government might require it to open the beaches , now reserved for town residents and their guests , to the public that view a mistaken one , federal relief officials said , since they would impose no such requirement reveals the lengths greenwich will go in defending its shoreline in the longrunning , bitter battle for the region s beaches informed that the federal government would not force the town to open its beaches , john b margenot jr , the first selectman of greenwich , said we 'd have to see in what language those guarantees are couched we have had this posture for 80 years or so , and if there were any possibility of there being jeopardy to our independence , we would eschew applying for the federal funds' plans to seek aid for roads greenwich , a tranquil town of shingled or clapboard homes , does plan to apply for federal money to repair its roads and other town property , mr margenot said he said that after past storms , greenwich did not seek federal aid because if the beaches were opened we would be overwhelmed outsiders , perhaps more accustomed to crowds , were not sympathetic to that excuse that would be a typical greenwich answer , said d w bennett , director of the american littoral society , a national coastal study group based in sandy hook , nj none of these fancy towns want the crowds , mr bennett said they want the beach , but they want it for themselves relief officials and other experts said they had never heard of a town declining assistance out of such fears that s very strange , said orrin pilkey , a professor of geology and director of the program for the study of developed shoreline at duke university he said that while the army corps of engineers requires good public access as a condition for replenishing beaches , the federal emergency management agency never does i just do n't understand that , he said of greenwich s decision i ca n't think they have a worry in the world 'we 'd move back' many greenwich residents agreed with the decision the real estate is expensive here , and one reason why is that you get the beaches and all the town services , said susan callaghan , a 36yearold housewife , as she surveyed the damage at greenwich point beach today if they took them away great we 'd move back to manhattan but others said that letting in the public could enhance their beach experience , providing more of what they go there for more babes , said robert austin , a 24yearold electrician who lives in greenwich more girls if they opened it up port chester girls , darien girls so it would be great , in that sense access is limited while the connecticut shoreline is state property up to the highwater mark , the public cannot reach most of it because it is in effect walled off by private homes or exclusive towns of the state s 78 miles of sandy beaches , the public has access to fewer than 30 miles , said arthur j rocque jr , assistant commissioner of the state department of environmental protection only a handful of towns exclude nonresidents from the beaches , but others charge nonresidents higher parking or access fees the parks at issue in greenwich are great captain island and little captain island , which have small beaches , and greenwich point , a piece of land dotted with pine trees and laced with footpaths that juts in the shape of a golf club into long island sound along the handle of the club is a halfmile beach that residents said is packed during the summer access is limited to a single road , and any person or group entering the park must stop at a sentry stand and show a permit permits are issued only to greenwich residents the two other connecticut towns that do exclude nonresidents fairfield and madison plan to seek federal aid to fix their beaches , town officials said informed of greenwich s wariness , however , thomas rylander , madison s first selectman , began to have doubts i will have to ask the town engineer to check on this , he said thanks to pressure from the state governments and courts , the public in new york and new jersey has access to a higher percentage of the shoreline than in connecticut , but visitors often have to pay parking fees , mr bennett said radios and pizza greater equality of access does come at a price , he admitted i remember the old days when i could go for a walk on the beach and take off my clothes and go for a swim , he said now there are people down there playing radios and eating pizza on long island , only smithtown reserves its beach for residents , said george stafford , director of coastal resources for the new york department of state mr rocque said that out of concern for its privacy , greenwich routinely refuses other state and federal assistance to maintain its beaches , even though no such strings are attached to that aid , either i 've heard it for years , he said wearily it s a misplaced and unrealistic fear some outsiders said that forces other than fear of crowding , like racism and snobbery , were at work a lot of the attitude is obviously racial , said ned coll , director of the revitalization corps , a nonprofit group styled as a domestic peace corps and based in hartford for more than 20 years , mr coll has dramatized the lack of access to the state s beaches by staging assaults on them by land , sea and air many years ago , he tried to bus a group of children from landlocked cities to the greenwich beaches he is not remembered fondly here they came in by busloads , and they stopped them at the gate , recalled bill wright , a 65yearold greenwich resident access 'is not a concern' relief officials , who said they knew of no other eligible town that has decided to forgo federal assistance , said they would not force greenwich to open its beaches that is not a concern , said frank haley , a spokesman for the federal emergency management agency they would not have to open it to the general public mr margenot said that , provided the town s flood insurance covers all 22 million in damage to the beaches and parks , the most the town could wind up paying is its deductible , 250 , 000 the residents of greenwich have a per capita income of 46 , 070 , more than twice the connecticut average of 20 , 189 , according to the 1990 census greenwich point is a real jewel , said robin loughman , a 41yearold freelance writer , during a pause while walking her airedale terrier , piper , through the park today ms loughman said that opening the park could lead to the exclusion of a lot of town residents and jeopardize its ecology i do n't see how they would maintain the character of this place , she said i do n't see how it could last photos defending its independent control of its shoreline , the town of greenwich , conn , has decided not to seek federal funds to repair beaches

venice venice is a moviehaunted city it is difficult to sail along the grand canal without looking over your shoulder for a sinister dwarf in a redhooded raincoat , straight from nicolas roeg s chilling do n't look now and it is impossible to walk up the steps of the opulent hotel des bains , on the seaside of the lido island , without recognizing the reallife setting of death in venice the hotel was named in thomas mann s novella and seen in luchino visconti s sumptuous film but just when you expect dirk bogarde to step out of that movie and head toward the beach , you spot a more familiar face yes , it s harrison ford on the veranda of the death in venice hotel , trailed by paparazzi as he arrives at a dinner party for the fugitive , being shown that night at the venice film festival in the background , the waiters wear trendy black tshirts with white letters that say wanted richard kimble above mr ford s mug shot this is not the elegant scene thomas mann envisioned , but mann later spent some years in hollywood , so he might have understood the spectacle that the 50th venice film festival became mr ford dropped by venice as part of a european tour to promote his hit movie s opening in france \( le fugitif \) and italy \( il fuggitivo \) his presence fit perfectly into the new profile of the festival , a 12day event that ended two weeks ago venice as a cannes wannabe , full of hollywood glitz and it suggests the primary purpose of film festivals today once , they seemed to be about making discoveries now they are about launching films commercially like most film festivals around the world , venice is in the midst of a severe identity crisis cannes has been making noise \( which no one takes seriously so far \) about moving from spring to fall to attract splashier movies the grandlynamed toronto festival of festivals , which ended last week , has become important mainly because it is so big if you show 300 films , something wonderful is bound to turn up and the new york film festival , which opens on friday with robert altman s sophisticated short cuts , has had to compete with its own golden past it has been overshadowed by the hazy memory of its glory days , when every year seemed to bring another truffaut or godard masterpiece but longing for the new new wave is misplaced , for those undiscovered gems are probably not out there the new wave and the 30yearold new york film festival were born around the same time , in a different era when movies were cheaper to make , national identities were more distinct , the entertainment media were smaller today movies are the ultimate global village , and film festivals are slowly adjusting to that change venice , however , had to do something fast known as an artistic festival , it had fallen into a state so dull that no one outside italy paid much attention to it so this year it showed out of competition jurassic park , the age of innocence , manhattan murder mystery , the fugitive , in the line of fire , dave and a handful of other american films yet the centerpiece of the festival was a highminded meeting about authors' rights , billed as an international authors' symposium , that turned into a cross between a felliniesque circus and a bad day at the united nations on a profound level , venice s floundering effort to invent a fresh identity is a representative example of the crisis many festivals are going through it is no fluke that this year s jury in venice split the grand prize , the golden lion , between short cuts and krzysztof kieslowski s three colors blue , which is also on the new york program \( mr kieslowski s double life of veronique opened the new york festival two years ago \) the jury s decision echoed that of cannes its grand prize was split between jane campion s piano , which will close the new york film festival , and chen kaige s farewell my concubine , which is also on the new york program this equivocating hints at the absurdity of awards more importantly , the winners indicate how the same films are recycled from one city to another , leaving a festival little room for surprise , much less a distinctive profile on a more frivolous level , venice is worth noticing as a carnival all its own the venetians have a long history of byzantine politics and cultural chaos , and the rest of the world will never catch up this is film festival , italian style , and it is like no other one perfect image captures the typical festival s tussle between the old and the new that of steven spielberg on stage in venice during what should have been one of the more dignified moments of his career a highlight of this year s festival was the presentation of a special golden lion for career achievement to mr spielberg , followed by a screening of jurassic park there he stood , wearing black tie and holding a red velvet box , which opened to reveal the golden lion itself an ornate statue with a 1930 s look that undeniably reveals this festival s fascist roots suddenly a man s voice yelled , steven ! steven ! and a popular italian television comedian known as gambretti ran on stage rolling a giant dinosaur egg he raced around shouting jokes in italian that the audience found hilarious mr spielberg , who had been speaking through an interpreter , looked slightly befuddled then he posed for photographers , one hand holding his golden lion , the other poised on top of the big plastic egg
gorazde , bosnia and herzegovina , march 2 the latest american airdrop of relief supplies appears to have come too late for the besieged muslim community of cerska in eastern bosnia , which was reported today to have fallen to serbian nationalist forces only hours after united states military aircraft dropped supplies to the town the report of cerska s fall came from the radio station of the bosnian government , whose forces had defended cerska since the outbreak of war in bosnia and herzegovina last april the report could not be independently verified , but senior bosnian military officers had been saying for weeks that cerska s defenders , mainly reservists with light weapons , were likely to be overwhelmed by the superior serbian forces by overrunning cerska , and stepping up military pressures on other isolated muslim communities , the serbian nationalist leaders in bosnia appeared in effect to be offering a direct rebuff to president clinton airdrop snag reported mr clinton ordered the airdrops to besieged muslim communities in eastern bosnia last week , as well as to serbian and croatian communities , in an effort to help the muslims sustain themselves against attempts by serbian nationalist forces to starve them out the united states airdrop to cerska appeared not only to come too late , but to have also gone seriously awry radio sarajevo said that the food and medicines dropped by the c130 transport planes flying from the rheinmain air base in germany fell well outside the main settlement at cerska , in an area that lay under serbian guns according to the radio , several people from the town were killed by serbian sniper fire as they tried to reach the supplies in washington , pentagon officials acknowledged that fighting in the besieged muslim enclaves made it difficult to insure that aid would land in an area where needy citizens could reach it but pentagon officials said some supplies were better than none at all the radio account said that the final serbian attack on cerska came after dawn today radio sarajevo said that serbian troops were walking freely through the area by noon by seizing cerska , the serbian leaders appeared to be signaling their intention of pressing forward with their ethnic cleansing in eastern bosnia , the practice , now nearly a year old , of shelling muslim communities , then terrorizing survivors , for the purpose of ridding the area of muslims the practice has succeeded across most of eastern bosnia , where about half a million muslims have been driven from all but three isolated mountain enclaves radio sarajevo s account said that muslims in cerska had been told to leave immediately , without their belongings , and that some had been fired on by serbian troops as they left according to united nations estimates , the population of cerska was about 20 , 000 people most , if not all , of these now seem likely to follow several thousand others from the area who fled through serbian lines in recent weeks to join the flood of more than a million muslim refugees living in parts of bosnia still controlled by the bosnian government or outside bosnia , mainly in croatia flight of others reported the serbian attempt to rid eastern bosnia of an estimated 200 , 000 muslims who still live in the besieged enclaves is part of a broader picture in which serbian forces have stepped up their pressures on muslims elsewhere in this former yugoslav republic the united nations reported today that 6 , 000 muslims from the banja luka region in northcentral bosnia , long controlled by the serbian forces , have been driven from their homes in recent days and are heading south toward travnik , a town about 55 miles northwest of sarajevo that is jointly controlled by bosnian and croatian forces a united nations relief official in zagreb , the croatian capital , told the british broadcasting corporation that 2 , 000 other muslims had arrived in recent days in turbe , west of travnik , after being driven from their homes in the region around jajce , a town between travnik and banja luka that was occupied by serbian forces in october in gorazde , the town at the center of the largest of the remaining muslim enclaves in eastern bosnia , the reported fall of cerska added to a general air of gloom with about 60 , 000 inhabitants in an 18squaremile area that lies about 60 miles south of cerska , gorazde has withstood 11 months of serbian bombardments , and every other building in the town is heavily damaged or destroyed when the fall of cerska was reported on the radio , even senior officials of the town seemed shaken can we survive \? frankly , i do n't know , a senior army officer said gorazde is on the list of towns for the american airdrops , and many people here have been staying up at night waiting for the drone of the american aircraft s engines , believing that they will herald a turn for the better here but lord owen , cochairman of an international mediation effort in the balkans , told the bbc in a radio interview in new york that he was trying to persuade alija izetbegovic , the muslim leader who is bosnia s president , that fighting on after recent reverses would doom bosnia and the muslims maps show location of cerska \( pg a13 \)
i had doubts about the clinton health plan too complicated , too much new bureaucracy , and where was the money to come from \? so i went off to a hospital to visit the expert who means most to me i made right for his bed in the ward and stood by it i did not ask how he felt i could see , by his face and the heavy body cast in which he was still lying , so many weeks in the huge room were about 50 sick men around three or four beds , curtained white screens were drawn up , all day and night they meant patient dying that was all the privacy they got from the other patients in the ward , or the patients from them two nurses moved about , trying to attend to 50 sick men i knew the story of the boy in the bed no need to wear him out with questions he was about 18 and a charity patient it said charity in the records , no euphemism that bothered him , a lot he came from a workingclass family nobody had ever taken such a thing , charity his father died falling from a scaffold five years earlier no insurance every week , as he faded , his wife and daughters scraped money together to pay the hospital no money was left when the father died the boy had none no money , not a little money but no money , a condition people used to some money often cannot grasp the hospital listed a prominent surgeon as assigned to the case , pro bono but he saw the boy only on rounds every now and then every time , he had to be reminded by the bed chart or a nurse who the boy was the boy noticed that , every time the orthopedic operations on the boy were done by residents , not the great man the boy and his family did not know , which was just as well because they had no choice the operations failed , the doctors gave up they said so , in his hearing one of them told him he might not walk again the boy cried a lot but he could not get comfort from his family because for the next two days no visitors were allowed and of course he could not get at a phone the food was awful but a young carpenter next to him got delicious italian snacks smuggled in by his family , and shared them sometimes on novisit days , a basket was thrown down to the family and hauled up to the secondfloor ward balcony then the white curtains were drawn around the young carpenter s bed other patients wished he would hurry up because he smelled so bad in his last agonies but i knew what bothered the boy as much as the smells , the unending noise and the failed operations it was that word in the records and the faraway nod when the surgeon picked up the bed clipboard sitting at his bedside , i said to the boy the president of the us just put out a new health plan it mandates doctor and hospital insurance for everybody upper class , middle , workers , and people with no money but believe me , it is very complicated and will create new levels of bureaucrats it will cost business and many taxpayers more money some jobs may be lost and the deficit increased so what do you think \? well , this is just anecdotal but the anecdotes we happen to live through add up to our lives certainly the story of that boy shaped me , because of course i was he and still am revisiting myself in my head , i knew he would have turned his face away from me for even asking if he wanted care without charity stamped on his record and soul most hospitals do not have huge charity wards anymore but they have the equivalent poor people using jammed emergency rooms as first succor they have no private doctors the hospitals including the private , starved for funds are choked , choked by the street diseases crime , drugs , guns and by aids i have problems about mr clinton , which does not seem to overwhelm him the classstruggle language and stance that pop up when he takes more of my money in taxes , could he kindly treat me as a respectworthy member of american society , not some greasy onepercent moneybag \? but however the health plan finally reads , this president , no other , has persuaded the country that like education and police protection , health care is a right , never a charity to be carefully noted on a hospital record he can hang that great achievement on the wall , right now
the united states began a lastditch effort yesterday to persuade north korea to ease a dispute over nuclear weapons by reversing its decision to withdraw from the treaty to halt their spread but a united states diplomat said his delegation had not made any significant progress during seven hours of talks in new york with its north korean counterpart another meeting is scheduled for tomorrow administration officials had signaled before the talks began that they were prepared to reward north korea by canceling highprofile military exercises with south korea that north korea regards as a threat but with the north korean withdrawal from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty due to take effect on june 12 , the officials also made clear that the united states would turn to its allies for help if pyongyang refused to back down they said the meetings that began yesterday would determine whether a threemonth standoff between the two countries will swell into a wider crisis north korea s announcement that it was pulling out of the treaty caused concern because it would end the country s obligation to open its nuclear facilities to united nations inspectors united states officials believe pyongyang is seeking to conceal evidence of a nuclear weapons program , and may already have produced enough plutonium to build a nuclear bomb before yesterday s meeting , administration officials expressed some hope that the american sticks and carrots might lead north korea to temper its defiance but even if pyongyang were to rejoin the treaty , they warned , more pressure may be required before north korea agrees to open its most sensitive facilities to inspectors after harsh words from washington in the first weeks of the dispute , the mere fact of yesterday s meeting represented a success of sorts for north korea , which had called for the talks but the united states has insisted that it is merely acting as an agent of the international community , and has said it may ask the united nations security council to impose sanctions if north korea refuses to rejoin the accord and meet its obligations the meeting , in the offices of the united states mission to the united nations , represented the first highlevel encounter since january 1991 the delegations were led by robert l gallucci , the assistant secretary of state for politicalmilitary affairs , and kang sok ju , vice foreign minister the two officials refused to speak with reporters as they entered the mission yesterday morning , but mr gallucci reported the lack of progress after the meeting ended he and mr kang otherwise refused comment on the session in disclosing that the united states would cancel this year s exercises with south korea if north korea rejoined the treaty , washington sent the clearest signal yet of a determination to give pyongyang a way out north korea regards the annual exercises as a possible rehearsal for nuclear war among other possible rewards for compliance , american and south korean officials said this week , would be a declaration by the united states that it did not intend to use nuclear weapons against north korea they said they also expected to allow north korea to inspect united states military bases in south korea to ensure that they no longer contained nuclear weapons if north korea stands its ground , it would become the first country in the 23year history of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty to renounce membership american officials are sensitive to the prospect that their response may be regarded as a precedent , and have insisted that none of the inducements being considered would represent a true concession but the officials concede privately that they are willing to go new lengths to reassure north korea if it would blunt its nuclear aspirations american officials refused to specify what steps washington would take if the position adopted by north korea is judged unsatisfactory but while the united states has in recent weeks emphasized diplomatic solutions to the crisis , they said the next step would almost certainly be to seek security council approval for sanctions
tokyo , june 24 in the samurai dramas that attract millions of japanese television viewers , crafty warriors from japan s feudal past always meet at some outoftheway inn , plotting the overthrow of their masters the modern reprise came the other night masayoshi takemura and nine colleagues in parliament slipped into a hotel near the imperial palace , took a room with a wellstocked minibar and decided that the moment had arrived to ambush the old men who had ruled japan for 38 years we were afraid to discuss it with anyone , even our wives , mr takemura recounted today up to the last minute , i thought many in our group would back out after all , he noted with some understatement , after four decades of virtually unchallenged power , the party elders know how to apply pressure until a few days ago , mr takemura was a loyal member of the ruling liberal democratic party and led its political reform committee resignations by the scores for mr takemura and a number of the younger rebels who sealed the fate of prime minister kiichi miyazawa s party that night deciding to abandon it on a vote of confidence and let the government fall this has been a wrenching week immediately after the vote they all resigned from the party , turning their backs on the mentors who had nurtured their political careers , financed their campaigns and offered them the prospect of one day dispensing extraordinary amounts of patronage thus began a mass exodus from the liberal democratic party that has cast tokyo into the biggest frenzy of political realignment in decades and brought to an end a political order that had seemed virtually invincible since 1955 we feel kind of released , but also kind of guilty , said asahiko mihara , 46 , who took part in the party coup and is now a member of a small new party , sakigake , which loosely translates as harbinger a larger splinter group of 36 liberal democrats formed another new party , shinseito , or renaissance both are likely to be involved in any coalition government loyalty vs change it is a very japanese kind of guilt , mr mihara said on the one hand we have to show our fealty to our seniors on the other hand , i felt i had to pull the trigger there needed to be reform not revolution , but a steady move forward and they would have none of it until last year , mr takemura and several other defectors said in recent conversations , they thought steady progress was being made many had come to know one another in a study group , where many political plots are bred the group came up with a list of necessary political reforms , from new restrictions on campaign financing to the establishment of smaller constituencies but last week , the members of the study group concluded that they had been betrayed mr miyazawa , who had vowed to get a reform bill through parliament , suddenly began to waver seiroku kajiyama , the secretary general of the ruling party and an avowed enemy of political reforms , told business leaders he would put the issue off until we win a victory in the upper house election two years from now he was betting that no one in the party would dare challenge him he was wrong a sense of betrayal mr takemura , 57 , with a warm smile and a reputation as a man committed to bringing japan s endless rounds of influencepeddling to an end , said he became really desperate when he discovered that the party leaders were on the other side here were our own leaders , and they were pushing the brake pedal and turning the steering wheel in the opposite direction , he said and no one in the party could stop them that was when he summoned members of his study group to the grand palace hotel , chosen because it is not usually frequented by party leaders if mr kajiyama or other party mainstays caught wind of the talk about defecting , the members of the group would first be enticed not to jump ship , then threatened we did not consult with anyone , mr takemura said we succeeded because we did not seek consensus that evening , they each signed a pledge to resign from the party but for two days they kept it secret , until just minutes before friday s vote mr kajiyama was horrorstricken none of them had any idea what was coming , said mr mihara poverty as a political plus now the young turks suddenly find themselves cast into a rainyseason campaign without an umbrella in preparation for the july 18 election , they are racing back to their districts but this time without the funds and the machine that make blanket coverage of japan s huge cities possible we have not a penny , mr takemura complained but in this election , honest poverty may be worth a thousand sound trucks the defectors all know that their greatest selling point is that they stuck it in the eye of the liberal democratic party could they ever be lured back \? i hope the ldp will change so much we would want to go back , mr mihara said but now it will be an era of allied political power photo masayoshi takemura \( associated press \)
los angeles , oct 30 they were modernday fagins , training young boys not to pick pockets , as in dickens s oliver twist , but to invade banks with automatic weapons , terrorize patrons and tellers and flee with money in highspeed freeway getaways in stolen cars there was never any physical evidence to implicate these fagins , robert sheldon brown , better known as cas on the streets of southcentral los angeles , and donzell lamar thompson , or cdog for they stayed several blocks away , supervising sometimes as many as five bank robberies a day over four years , using boys as young as 13 at just 23 years old , mr brown has been implicated in 175 bank robberies , more than anyone else in american history on monday , the two men will be sentenced in federal district court they pleaded guilty to seven bank robberies mr brown faces 30 years in prison and mr thompson , who is 24 , faces 25 years in their sentencing memorandum , two assistant united states attorneys describe the men as appalling corrupters of youth life imitates art boys do not rob banks unless someone shows them how , they write brown and thompson showed how they took disadvantaged and miserable teenagers and turned them into felons of the most serious degree dickens invented fagin as the exploiter and debaucher of youth to inspire horror and revulsion in his victorian audience brown and thompson inspire the same horror and revulsion today the difference is that fagin was only fiction the arrests appear to have put a dent in the alarming rise of brazen takeover robberies by armed bands that have helped make southern california the bankrobbery capital of the united states according to the federal bureau of investigation , 1992 saw a record of 2 , 641 bank robberies in this area , 448 of them takeovers by contrast , there were 537 robberies in the new york area last year the takeover differs from oldstyle robberies , called note jobs by the police , in which the robber tries to avoid attention by handing a teller a note and quietly exiting by contrast , the takeover robbers invade in bands of three or four , some firing weapons , others carrying pillow cases and jumping over teller booths to scoop up cash as customers and tellers cower mr brown and mr thompson appear to have applied the technique to mass production they go in with a lot of automatic weapons and they are not afraid to use them , said john hoos , spokesman for the fbi here implicated by underlings but the trouble with the brownthompson program was that their young charges were so inexperienced or frightened that they were often caught ultimately , some of them implicated the two men , members of a street gang called the rollin' sixties crips , and they were arrested last may 28 the prosecutors , john s wiley jr and michael r davis , said that the men kept far away from the scene of the crimes the two trained others to rob banks , let the others take the risk , and split their profit when the coast was clear , they wrote brown and thompson just added high powered weapons and freeway chases to the mix in an interview , mr wiley said there was no physical proof linking brown and thompson , only the testimony of the people getting caught they went through many disposable henchmen in one robbery to which mr brown pleaded guilty , three teenagers entered a wells fargo bank branch in downey , calif , on aug 14 , 1992 , while a getaway driver waited outside in a stolen car one of the boys struck a woman with his gun , and then sprayed the ceiling with bullets as the boys started to grab money , the police arrived the teenagers smashed out a window to escape , but two were caught a third fired at a police officer , who shot him to death he was 15 years old as in other cases , mr brown supervised from a safe distance in his own car and drove away when things went bad champion bank robber the police say mr brown was involved in 175 robberies in all , making him by far the champion bank robber in american criminal annals , eclipsing the previous record holder , edwin chambers dotson , the socalled yankee bandit , who robbed 64 banks in southern california in 1983 and 1984 he was easy to spot because he usually wore a new york yankees baseball cap according to william j rehder , an fbi special agent who is an expert on bank robberies , this is how mr brown and mr thompson recruited and trained their disposable henchmen the young recruits usually came from the rollin' sixties or other gangs , or were young wannabees , the teenagers who aspire to gang membership they were offered money , thrills and sometimes drugs in many cases addicts were given drugs in return for driving the getaway car , usually a stolen or carjacked vehicle dubbed the gride , for gangster ride the youngest known recruit was 13 brown used up a lot of henchmen , mr rehder wrote in an affidavit police captured his workers on a regular basis he needed steadily to replenish his supply robert brown armed boys with the latest in death technology , coached them in the fine points of bank robbery , and drove them to the scene excited boys with loaded guns and no sense of their own mortality created an unbelievable potential for violence five in one day mr brown was so brazen that he directed a team that hit five banks on one day , aug 20 , 1991 it began in los angeles with a first interstate bank on la cienega boulevard and worked its way east on the freeways , striking banks in eagle rock , pasadena , monterey park and montebello before calling it a day in all , the robbers fired shots in 20 of the robberies during the fouryear spree and assaulted 5 customers and 15 bank employees , none fatally they would usually abandon the gride a couple of blocks from the bank and switch to another car in all cases , mr brown and mr thompson stayed well clear of the scene when mr brown suspected he was under surveillance , he began using evasive measures , making abrupt stops and turns the prosecutors said mr brown has a long criminal history that began with a conviction for firstdegree burglary at age 14 he has no legitimate job , they wrote in their sentencing report for four years all he has done is to organize and pull off bank robberies with the drive of a fanatic they added , brown has a loving mother and the rest of his family lives in an intact home since the arrests , bank robberies in this area have declined according to the fbi , as of friday there were only 1 , 433 robberies this year , down 28 percent from last year the sentencing , said mr hoos of the fbi , will definitely get the word out , definitely be a deterrent
new orleans the amazing thing about alabama s winning yet another national championship was how natural it seemed this ultimate renaissance did not happen for ray perkins or bill curry they could not just drive into every small town in alabama and invoke the name of bear bryant and summon 150 superb highschool recruits to tuscaloosa and win bama s 12th national title but look what happened with a coach superficially in the image of bryant , but gussied up in 1990 s touchyfeely sensibilities gene stallings set into motion all the advantages of the university of alabama at the same time , dozens of other football schools have been sniffing out the hot young coaches , offering scholarships , building weight rooms , sweettalking parents , letting boosters do whatever boosters do yet for all their labors , these other football foundries were merely standing around in suddenly irrelevant bowls recently , watching alabama destroy miami , 3413 , in the sugar bowl there is surely no need for any elaborate playoff system when this new coalition brings alabama and miami to the same field , and solves everything in 60 brutal minutes alabama is the champ roll , tide , roll , as people were chanting in my hotel corridor well onto dawn miami has made it work four times in the last decade , and maybe the hurricanes will win four more in short order alabama was n't trying to get it wrong after bryant retired in late 1982 and died early in 1983 perkins won 32 , lost 15 and tied once , and moved on to tampa bay after 1986 curry was a good choice , too , but he went 2610 , and left for kentucky , knowing he 'd never be a bama man gene stallings was interviewing for the job at the united states naval academy when he heard of curry s retirement , as he put it he was out of a job , having been sacked by the phoenix cardinals only in america can a man be fired twice and win the national championship and be coach of the year , said stallings , who had also been dismissed at texas am , his alma mater stallings likes to recall the hard old days with the aggies , when players dropped from heat stroke i ran by one guy and asked him how i could get one of those things , stallings likes to say we do n't do that anymore we give 'em water and put 'em under a tree water under a tree stallings is tall and rangy and vaguely in the bryant image , but he does n't carry the depression desperation of bryant , not in the age of oprah and phil yesterday stallings recalled how far derrick lassic , the sunny senior running back from haverstraw , ny , had come to slash for 135 yards and two touchdowns when i came here in 1990 , derrick was hurting , stallings recalled his girlfriend was killed in a car accident , and he was a long way from home i went up to his room and he was just lying in bed before lassic was born in 1970 , black players were not recruited by alabama but in 1971 , john mitchell and wilbur jackson joined the tide , and alabama s pipeline grew even bigger i always wanted to play for alabama , lassic said i find it better here my father is from montgomery and my mother is from north carolina in the south , you know what to avoid , but up north , people say nice things to your face , but they say other things behind your back lassic had been threatened by the switch from curry to stallings , and when his friend , cherlintha miles , was killed , he was ready to leave you do n't know how many times i 've had my suitcases packed , but my father and mother told me not to quit , said lassic , who recalled the new coach comforting him in his time of pain he s a player s coach , lassic said we do n't want to disappoint coach stallings we just love him this is not a word bama players used for the formidable bear bryant respect was more like it maybe even fear but none of thishere love business , son stallings is probably a beast when angered what football coach is not \? but in public he tells more bear bryant stories than anybody he said he is respectful but not intimidated by following in the footsteps you ca n't violate the laws of nature , stallings said you ca n't jump in the water if you ca n't swim he shambled and apologized for not passing more he shuddered at what bryant would think of him not punting at fourthandone at midfield with 10 minutes left but bama made the yard bama made all the yards it seemed easy photo gene stallings after friday s victory \( associated press \)
for those who might have visions of classic courtroom drama dancing in their heads perhaps old memories of charles laughton in witness for the prosecution , or newer ones from a few good men the current trial of four men accused of bombing the world trade center is bound to fall short of expectations the case so far has been largely a painstaking , often tedious , accumulation of technical detail , at times more like a reading of the phone book than an occasion for high drama or tense political confrontation this is true even though elements in the case seem made for a higher level of theatricality the trial , after all , involves an event the prosecution calls the worst terrorist attack ever to take place on american soil , and four defendants , who , according to some of the pretrial publicity , fit the image of islamic extremism in the mold of the ayatollah khomeini an extremism motivated by a powerful , fanatical hatred of america there have been a few vivid episodes there was , for example , the moment when austin campriello , a defense lawyer in the case , told judge kevin t duffy that a juror had been weeping while looking at morgue photographs of some of the victims , leading those in the courtroom to crane their necks as they examined the faces of the jurors the next time that photos of victims were passed out and there was a moment last week when a special agent of the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms , joseph hanlin , described how , searching through the wreckage , he identified the vehicle that he said contained the bomb that killed six people this led to a test of strength between mr hanlin and hassen ibn abdellah , the most strident of the defense lawyers , as mr abdellah strove to find inconsistencies in mr the federal agent s testimony and mr hanlin , a wellcoached witness if ever there was one , resisted clubbiness of the bar but the trial has been characterized less by courtroom theatrics than by the custom of defense lawyers and prosecutors to fraternize amiably during breaks in the testimony , almost as though they were relaxing between sets in a tennis match , the sound of their laughter drifting across the legal playing field the four accused men , as they sit quietly at the defense table , dressed in conservative business suits , certainly do not fit an image of fiery and fearsome fanatics during breaks , when the jury has been led out , they continue to sit , occasionally conferring , often watching their lawyers engage in cordial conversation with the prosecutors who are trying to send them to prison for life the defendants were closely watched for their reactions when the prosecutors presented emotionladen evidence , photos of the six people who died in the blast and testimony of an assistant medical examiner who gave clinical details about the causes of their deaths none of the defendants showed any visible emotion the stuff of ennui thus the trial , as judge duffy warned the jurors at the outset , has often been an exercise in tedium the case has unfolded not in exciting spurts but in a slow , almost imperceptible , accumulation of infinitesimal forensic facts this reached perhaps a high point with the testimony on tuesday and wednesday of leslie robertson , a structural engineer who worked on the trade center towers when they were being built and who supervised repairs after the blast mr robertson was led through his recounting of the blast damage by the lead prosecutor , j gilmore childers mr childers is patient , painstaking and dry marching back and forth to the witness stand , he showed mr robertson a long series of photos , most of which , at something of a distance , seemed to be the same general scenes of underground wreckage after the explosion in february the photos prompted lengthy , matteroffact descriptions by mr robertson , with numerous references to reinforced concrete slabs , steel plates , diagonal braces and items of debris created in the explosion at one point , judge duffy interrupted mr childers to relate a story about how his granddaughter , who , asked in school to write a 3 , 000word essay , instead presented three pictures on the grounds that pictures are worth 1 , 000 words how many more \? judge duffy asked , spacing his words for effect when mr childers answered nine , judge duffy replied softly , it loses its impact the jury was not present for the exchange columns and chemicals mr childers s examination of mr robertson was followed by a crossexamination by john byrnes , a lawyer for one of the accused , mohammed salameh , who , asking about the structural columns and the spaces between them , brought out this fairly typical response from the witness the distance between this column and this column at each floor of the building is exactly or almost exactly the same , intended to be the same , but the distance between this column and this column is not the same as the distance between this column and that one , or between this column and that one it was not immediately clear what mr byrnes was trying to elicit in these questions it might become clearer as the defense s case unfolds generally , its strategy has been to try cast enough doubt on the details of the prosecution s reconstruction of the explosion to foster reasonable doubt about the overall story this appears to have had mixed results atiq ahmed , the lawyer for another defendant , nidal a ayyad , seems to have been trying to suggest to the jury that the blast might have been caused by something other than the bomb the prosecutors say caused it or that the traces of chemicals found in the investigation \( which are the same as the chemicals allegedly purchased by the defendants before the bombing \) might have already been inside the building thus , mr ahmed asked a maintenance engineer at the trade center to specify what was inside each of six storage lockers on a basement floor of the building the answer had to do with things that seemed innocuous enough , like plumbing fixtures and cleaning fluid still , he asked the witness to place a colored identifying sticker on a floor plan of the trade center to show where each of the storage lockers was a school for lawyers the trial has been so devoid of theatrics or tension that what would otherwise have been small events take on electrifying proportions these have involved admonitions against defense lawyers , several of whom have had very little trial experience , especially in the federal courts once , for example , judge duffy noted that two of the defense lawyers , robert e precht and mr abdellah , had asked a witness what he said the day before , even while they had transcripts of that day s proceedings with them at the stand a hush fell over the courtroom as judge duffy remarked , that s not the way it s done the way it s done , he said , is for the lawyer to read aloud from the transcript , not ask the witness to remember what he had previously said
berkeley , calif , feb 14 lou campanelli s postgame tirades , for mature audiences only , were ultimately what got him dismissed here last week from his job as the university of california s head basketball coach his words were perhaps no coarser than coach bob knight s at indiana but the cal athletic director , robert bockrath , inadvertently listened in on campanelli one night recently , and that made the difference in essence , campanelli was ruined by the strong acoustics of a locker room in tempe , ariz on the evening of feb 4 , after a loss to arizona state , bockrath entered a wrong door by accident , he said , and found himself only a partition away from the locker room he overheard a profane lecture by campanelli to the team bockrath once played football for bo schembechler at miami of ohio and maintains i can swear with the rest , but he found himself appalled by what he called campanelli s personal attacks on the players there were things that were unwarranted and inappropriate and inexcusable , bockrath said friday it was so incredibly bad , i said , sheesh , something must be done' the players were beaten down and in trouble psychologically every other word was a fourletter one let me tell you , if i had n't made that wrong turn , i would n't have known the fix the team was in four days later , last monday , campanelli was a deposed coach the action was a further example of what appears to be a new , lesstolerant attitude toward college coaches with severe styles just days before campanelli was dismissed , army fired its basketball coach , tom miller , for publically degrading his players even though he had been given two warnings in november , earle bruce was fired as football coach at colorado state for what school administrators called the physical and mental abuse of players bockrath said he simply would not tolerate behavior by a coach that could be considered abusive times have changed , he said the 54yearold campanelli , of course , sees the issues surrounding his dismissal very differently what you say in a locker room should be between the coach and the players , campanelli said friday no one else s business i may have used some curse words from george raveling to bobby knight to dean smith , there s not a coach in the country who does n't coaches wonder what the heck \? across the country last week , coaches concurred with campanelli if you fired every coach who swore or yelled , unemployment in this country jumps up 10 percent , said raveling , the southern california basketball coach last tuesday , knight telephoned pete newell , the eminent former cal coach , and offered his help to campanelli most of all , other coaches were concerned that bockrath , hired by cal in august 1991 after 11 years at arizona , had removed campanelli without giving him an opportunity to soften his caustic tongue he would n't have changed , bockrath , 49 , said last week if you 'd have heard him go off on these guys , you would n't have told him to lighten up , either you 'd have just wanted to put a cork in the dike campanelli said well , i did nothing immoral when you commit a crime , you at least get a trial all i got was a bullet to the head the business of winning the crux of the matter might be that campanelli , a successful head coach at james madison from 1972 to 1985 before joining cal , acted like knight but did not win like knight in his seven previous seasons here , his teams managed only one trip to the national collegiate athletic association tournament also , campanelli was n't even aware he had driven such a wedge between him and his players last monday , speaking with bockrath , he could not even accurately name his allies on the team when i told lou last monday he was fired , said bockrath , who had received reports of player dissatisfaction with the coach for several weeks , he sat in my office and said 'why \? why bob \? go ask jason kidd about me go ask brian hendrick' and i'm thinking 'lou , if you only knew jason and brian are n't for you' hendrick is the senior captain of the team , kidd its star freshman guard the discord traces to last season players say campanelli had belittled the 199192 team , which finished with a 1018 record we finally tuned him out the last two games and won them both , alfred grigsby , a starting forward , recalled friday first a loss , then the lunch boxes cal swept its first five games this season to gain a rare top 25 ranking then on dec 29 , the team lost to james madison , campanelli s previous employer in the locker room , campanelli swept the team s box lunches off a table and kicked them according to his players , the coach , who grew up in springfield , nj , said , you have embarrassed me in front of my family , and then refused to ride in the team bus we 're like , 'oh , uhhuh , he ca n't be with us now that we lost , ' grigsby said and we were like 'wow , it s starting again like last year we 're getting the blame for everything' it should be all of our faults , not just the players' fault campanelli said of the lunchbox incident i just knocked them off the table come on after the way we played back there , sure , i was upset as a result of campanelli s explosion at the meadowlands , the players were listless in a loss to cornell the next evening nobody wanted to play , grigsby recalled

san diego padre players do n't send their laundry out on road trips they do n't put payments down on condos overlooking the pacific ocean or sign longterm leases for cars not in these topsyturvy days , when the team owners are more likely to trade batting champions and potential pitching greats than not this is , after all , a team that by order of management insists its players come cheaper by the two dozens players besides tony gwynn , that is for gwynn is the one padre destined to ride out the tidal wave of salary dumping that has washed away most any player of stature , economic or otherwise craig lefferts , benito santiago , tony fernandez , gary sheffield , randy myers once major cogs in a team starting to turn heads in the national league west are all gone now next up is fred mcgriff , just another highpriced bit of trade bait being made available by economically driven edicts , division hopes and pennant races be hanged but gwynn , he stays , no matter where the salary escalator takes him even though he never coined the phrase mr padre , the perennial 300plus hitter knows that he is it and gwynn has had to decide just how comfortable or uncomfortable he is going to be in that lot gwynn , losing sight of division contenders as well as friends and talented teammates , has decided on the former the fact that we 're making some moves and doing some things that people find different , i got no control over it , gwynn said yesterday before his sixthplace club beat the mets , 20 , at shea stadium my goal was and still is to play here my whole career , and as far as i'm concerned , that has n't changed i just go out there and try to take care of business besides , said gwynn , with a wry laugh , just because he has been with the team longer than anyone else in uniform , does n't mean he carries any more weight the padres' owners have n't asked him to help figure out a better financial balancing act and he is n't so bold as to suggest one i know what my role is , said the 33yearold gwynn just because you have 12 years with the same organization , that does n't give you the right to be judge and jury they 're going to do what they have to do , and we do n't have to like it , but it does mean i still owe the organization , to go out there and give them an honest effort every day not that gwynn is cold to what happened yes , he is politically correct most of the time , he said with a boisterous laugh still , ask him a direct question and the truth will be told , in that patented tony gwynn machinegun delivery ask him about the sheffield deal , for instance on june 24 , the third baseman who threatened to win a triple crown last season was sent to the expansion florida marlins along with pitcher rich rodriguez for minor league pitchers trevor hoffman , jose martinez and andres berumen sheff was 24 and all of a sudden he ca n't play any more \? gwynn said incredulously , his voice climbing the scale it s not like he lost his baseball skills he s still one of the most talented young players in the game , one of the most talented players in the game so when you see 'em getting rid of guys like benito , who was 27 myers , who is in his 30 s sheff , who s 24 freddie , who is 29 i do n't buy the reasoning behind it our organization has n't said rebuilding one time they 've said reshaping , restructuring or whatever but that s what it is ! and i think with our ball club , if people would just say what they 're doing , just come out and say we just ca n't afford the payroll , we 've got to cut it , it s the only way we can do it if they would just be honest about it , i think people would understand and be more sympathetic otherwise , confusion reigns and lawsuits fly , too , filed by padres seasonticket holders who have questioned the truth in the padres' advertising their intent to keep a contender on the field and , not surprisingly , credibility is questioned not only by those storming the box office , but by those charged with giving 110 percent on the field they called it an oldfashioned baseball deal , said gwynn oldfashioned baseball deal \? i'm not trying to start any wars , but oldfashioned baseball deal my foot sheff made a lot of money they needed to cut the payroll down that s why they made the deal that s probably why they 're going to end up trading freddie they need to trim the payroll at that point , gwynn deescalates , reminding his listener and himself that the whys behind the trim are not his concern the owners have a better idea of why , he says his job is to solely play right field they spent a lot of money for this club , gwynn said they can do with it what they want but until the padres come within five games of first place again , as they did last season before the rebuilding began , the questions will remain is this a baseball plan or a fire sale \? was it a breach of faith , or in the best interests of baseball , to promise to remain competitive only to bail out of the upper tier of the nl west because of economics \? or put even more cynically , should the owners have ever bought a major league team if what they really wanted was a minor league payroll \? gwynn is right , though these are not questions he should attempt to answer or be made to answer nor should the former general manager , the severely disappointed joe mcilvaine , nor the new gm , randy smith , for that matter padres ownership should , even if none of the fans are willing to listen anymore photo anthony young after giving up tworun homer to padres' archi cianfrocco with two out in the eighth inning \( associated press \)
west orange , nj , april 23 there is no disputing the superiority of the penguins in their matchup with the devils , who are on the brink of being swept in the first round of the stanley cup playoffs new jersey has been found lacking in many areas , but none may be more telling than the lack of offense from the players the devils have been counting on most going into game 3 of this patrick division series , even tom barrasso , the towering goaltender of the penguins , had outscored the top two lines of the devils barrasso had two assists in the first two games , while the top lines of the devils had totaled one assist , by aleksandr semak the comparison was only slightly less embarrassing after pittsburgh s 43 victory in game 3 thursday night the devils' top two lines moved ahead of barrasso by a point because semak scored a goal thursday , on an assist from valery zelepukin the devils' next , and perhaps last , chance to improve on this sorry statistic comes sunday afternoon at byrne meadowlands arena , when pittsburgh , seeking its third consecutive stanley cup title , will be going after its 15th consecutive playoff victory productive in the past the list of players with no points in the three losses is particularly painful for coach herb brooks to read , since these players had been productive in the playoffs in previous years peter stastny , with 103 points in 84 playoff games , is followed by bernie nicholls \( 75 points in 65 games \) , stephane richer \( 60 in 79 \) , claude lemieux \( 56 in 91 \) and john maclean \( 31 in 33 \) against pittsburgh , the combined entry of these players reads 0 for 3 you must factor in the opposition , brooks said today they have the best goalie , and their defense closes the door pretty well brooks made today s practice optional , and richer was the only one among the scoreless five who attended he served as the spokesman for his fellow underachievers richer started to say it was a matter of time before the players in question began scoring , but he quickly realized the position his team is in and added , i know , we 're running out of time last loss \? march 5 the devils have until sunday to regroup against a team that is undefeated in the last 21 games \( 2001 \) pittsburgh s last came on march 5 , against none other than the rangers richer s trouble in getting the puck behind barrasso is indicative of what a difficult time the devils have had against pittsburgh richer had several good scoring chances thursday night , but he was either thwarted by barrasso or he shot wide there was n't much he could do but joke about the time he broke in on barrasso with zelepukin to his right and peter taglianetti the only defenseman back for the penguins his shot went harmlessly wide
the home shopping network , the television retailer , has formed a joint venture with telecommunications inc , the country s largest cable systems operator , to form a television shopping service to plumb international markets , the two companies said yesterday they provided few details of the venture , to be called home shopping international , declining to say where and when they planned to start it they also refused to disclose the terms of the deal and said it was subject to regulatory approval a lot of this has yet to be worked out , but we do know there is great interest worldwide in having television retailing , said louise cleary , a spokeswoman for home shopping , which is controlled by telecommunications through its liberty cable unit hard sell and whistles she said home shopping would bring to the international electronic shopping market its distinctive brand of live programming , best known for highpressure salesmanship punctuated with bells and whistles in contrast , she said , much television retailing in the rest of the world is prerecorded programming played at limited times , rather like infomercials in the united states qvc network inc , home shopping s chief rival , entered the international market last year , staking out turf in mexico and britain analysts found yesterday s announcement more interesting in terms of what it said about the relationship of telecommunications and home shopping than for what it said about the future of global television retailing , which is in its infancy it is the first overt signal that home shopping is part of the tcibell atlantic communications highway , said peter j siris , an analyst at ubs securities this gives tci a strong foothold in the door of television shopping telecommunications is in the midst of merging with bell atlantic to create a communications empire on the forefront of a technological revolution it also controls 71 percent of home shopping s voting stock through liberty cable , but analysts said the announcement was the first time telecommunications had publicly embraced that investment the relationship has heretofore been complicated by liberty s ownership of 22 percent of qvc for example , mr siris said , almost none of telecommunications' 10 million subscribers receive home shopping s programs tci was originally on the qvc team , but now the alliances are shifting , he said tci has done nothing up until now that would seem to benefit home shopping in any way qvc is embroiled in the bidding war for paramount communications inc , competing against viacom inc , and many experts have speculated that it will sever its ties to liberty , and thus to telecommunications , to avoid regulatory issues that might impede its bid qvc and home shopping , which together control about 98 percent of the television retailing market , broke off negotiations for a planned merger in november , saying qvc s involvement in the paramount bidding had complicated their plans home shopping said michael w d mcmullen , president of its international division , would head the new venture

none of this would have happened if vince coleman had shouted fore ! in the clubhouse but forget that lapse of etiquette for the moment the mets being the hot team they are , with an 810 record , you can understand how they would need to get away from baseball , even in their clubhouse , and relax a little before the dodger game by concentrating on their golf , as they were doing monday night the conversation was not what , say , the dodgers' starter might be throwing , but how to play the 12th hole at the riviera country club when they get to los angeles this is fact , as crazy as it might sound to the layman so coleman and bobby bo and mike maddux are working on their swings golf swings , of course and flailing away when the mets' starting pitcher that night , doc gooden , who himself is preoccupied with distractions like what he s going to throw strawberry and davis and that crowd , happens by coleman , driving for the flagpole , hits something solid with his club he thinks it might be a tree , and is puzzled , because he s in the middle of the clubhouse it turns out the only thing he hit was doc gooden s pitching shoulder so , in his dreams , coleman is still laying one and it necessitates no penalty he thinks he s sittin' pretty the only problem is , gooden is in some pain and since the mets have always been squeamish about doc s health , they decide to keep him out that night and they make an announcement to the crowd that gooden will not pitch because of a freakish accident in the clubhouse the crowd is told that he has bruised his shoulder , is being held back for precautionary reasons , and is expected to pitch the following day now , gooden , for his entire 10year career , has been treated by the mets like a precious piece of china , like a ming vase and now do n't we know how it got a crack \? at this point , the story gets even wackier the mets think that that s the end of it or say it is they do n't want to relate exactly what the freakish accident was , as though the fans who pay through the nose for tickets and parking and hot dogs and tshirts have no right to know exactly why the guy many of them have brought their kids to see that night will not be on the mound and the mets figure the news reporters wo n't follow up to ferret out the story like the good little clones of sherlock holmes that they are \? do n't the met officials read the papers \? have n't they heard of watergate \? do n't they know what kind of super sleuths sportswriters are \? wait ! stop the presses ! have n't they heard of the bobby bo incident last year , when bonilla , upset about a call by an official scorer that gave him an error , called the press box during the game , and then denied it \? and the manager , jeff torborg , covered up for him \? and then it hit the papers with the force of hurricane hugo , in baseball terms \? the explanation is an eyepopper and a jawdropper , and a lollapalooza , too i was covering up for him , said torborg of slammin' sammy coleman it s the same thing we went through with bobby last year there s no damn privacy in here anyway he meant the clubhouse something happens and it becomes a big deal is it my responsibility to tell somebody exactly what happens in here \? i do n't tell about a freak accident and now i'm covering up and al harazin , the general manager , went one bumbling step further i'm sorry we did n't do a better job of keeping it out of the papers , but we tried if we had come out and said that one of our players was hurt when somebody hit him with a golf club , do you think it would have been all over the back pages of the tabloids \? you bet it would but i am suspicious i think the mets knew all along what was going to happen after all , no one not even the mets could be so stupid as to think no one would investigate this , and get to the bottom of it and when they did , it would not be a oneday story , as it would have if they had 'fessed up from the getgo , but a two and maybe threeday story i am suspicious because i think they knew all this and wanted the publicity i think it s the george steinbrenner axiom the goofier the publicity the better when you 're under 500 and people in spring training were predicting you might win a pennant , and it s always better to have them think you 're nuts than bad right \? certainly so now if they fall flat on their faces , the mets can blame the press for the mashie niblick incident , just as the bobby bo communique was the signature incident of the season that threw the ballplayers off their game and the mets hierarchy is home scotfree again a brilliant stroke photo vince coleman \( g paul burnett \)
mogadishu , somalia , june 20 although united nations troops destroyed the headquarters of gen mohammed farah aidid last week , the tactics used by the somali clan leader s militia proved that it is a wellorganized and effective urban guerrilla force , military officials say though seriously weakened by the attack on thursday , these united nations officials said , such a force may continue to threaten stability here exploiting the unwillingness of the united nations soldiers to open fire on civilians , general aidid s militia counterattacked not around his compound , but in the crowded outskirts of the neighborhood that area was the scene of the heaviest fighting the united nations coordinated a ground force of five nationalities , but still suffered significant casualties at the hands of the much smaller somali force an effective counterattack for several hours , according to united nations reports , hundreds of moroccan and french troops were pinned down by coordinated heavy gunfire from houses , a hospital , a muslim cemetery and a stadium , and from behind crowds of women and children , the military officials said the fighting was so intense that moroccan soldiers saw comrades lie bleeding 20 feet away and could not go to their rescue in less than two hours , on a stretch of road less than 700 yards long , 4 moroccans and a pakistani were killed , 36 moroccans wounded and dozens of vehicles destroyed these somalis were dedicated fighters , because they held their positions to their death even when they had means to escape , said capt michael keleher of united states army , 10th mountain division , who was a liaison officer with the french troops the ground assault came on the sixth day of a large united nations military operation to disarm somalia s militias , destroy general aidid s headquarters and weapons caches and cripple him politically blamed for ambush united nations officials say general aidid is responsible for the killing of two dozen pakistani peacekeepers and the wounding of 59 others in an ambush on june 5 on thursday , the united nations military ordered his arrest , but he has gone underground the officials say the operation aimed at destroying general aidid s command center was a complete success but the complexity of the operation and the tactics of the enemy were underscored by the large number of casualties suffered by the united nations troops , especially the moroccans officials say the operation was delayed at least twice , possibly giving general aidid s militia an advantage maj david stockwell of the united states army , the united nations military spokesman , said helicopters fired 11 tow missiles three malfunctioned and one hit the compound of a relief agency , killing one somali and wounding seven others but logistically , the operation was a milestone for the united nations , a feat of multilingual coordination after days of planning and rehearsals the multinational effort almost 1 , 400 troops from five countries were involved pakistan , morocco , france , italy and the united states , plus the american planes and helicopters the target was a 16block area , but the fighting quickly spread general aidid s militia numbered only several hundred but held the dominant position , holed up in buildings with heavy weapons and using crowds as shields , military officials said five hundred pakistanis , all infantrymen , were the immediate choice to conduct the ground assault , a senior military official said the moroccan , french and italian forces brought tanks and other armored vehicles , and a small number of united states ground troops acting as liaison officers were involved in the fighting the moroccans' responsibility was to cordon off the target area , and the french and italians flanked the area on the north and south communication was a major hurdle when the arabicspeaking moroccans backing up the urduspeaking pakistanis were pinned down , french troops came to their aid when they were then pinned down , the italians brought in support 'allo ! 'allo ! none of the troops had the same radio frequencies , but each had liaison officers with the other countries' troops the link among them all were 45 united states officers , several with each contingent , who communicated movement and coordinated helicopter gunfire at the center was the war room in the united states embassy compound , where orders from gen cevik bir of turkey , the commanding officer , were passed on by each country s representative a small contingent of united states special forces troops could communicate directly only with ac130h gunship planes among the moroccans , only the commander and his executive officer spoke english when the commander was killed and the executive officer was wounded , american liaison officers communicated by hand signals when they were pinned down by sniper fire the ground assault began at dawn the moroccans spread out along a road parallel to digfer hospital , in the heart of general aidid s territory crowds divert the moroccans at 6 30 am the moroccans were approached by two large crowds , one of which had built sophisticated barricades of charred vehicles and corrugated metal , said maj timothy m knigge , the united states army liaison officer with the moroccan troops the crowds were dispersed with tear gas the crowds were a diversionary tactic to draw out the soldiers , who immediately began receiving gunfire from the hospital and nearby houses the moroccan commander was under orders not to shoot at the hospital with anything but small arms , major knigge said on the short stretch of road , somali gunmen hit the moroccans with heavy machine guns and rocketpropelled grenades , the attack that caused most united nations casualties when the gunmen were flushed out of one house , they moved into another the american helicopters had limited ability to fire at the somalis because the united nations soldiers were so close the moroccan commander , col abdullah bin namus , was wounded but refused to be evacuated he bled to death the pakistani liaison officer was killed as well gunshots and crowds when the french troops came to assist , there was shooting from all directions , from behind the makeshift tents of a refugee camp , from buildings , from the muslim cemetery and from the hospital , with heavy machine guns and rocketpropelled grenades the united nations troops held back from firing because of large crowds that had formed in the area at one point , helicopters reported seeing people who looked like civilians walk unarmed into the cemetery area and return with weapons , captain keleher said the french commander s orders were only to fire at snipers above the fourth floor of the hospital , to avoid civilian casualties in the courtyard finally , at 4 pm , the french entered the hospital at least twice , gunmen used women and children as shields , allied military aides said the united nations military estimates that it killed or wounded dozens of militia members but its calculations were based either on seeing a person fall to the ground or on counting blood stains the somalis will not leave dead or wounded behind , military officials said in islamic culture , a body must be buried intact , and as soon as possible , if the soul is to rise to heaven general aidid s militia has used disfiguration to intimidate the pakistani troops , who are also muslims on june 5 , when a wounded pakistani captain was captured by mr aidid s men , they mutilated him while he was still alive , said lieut brian mcinerney , the united states army liaison officer with the pakistanis photo american soldiers returning fire at snipers on thursday outside the compound of gen mohammed farah aidid in mogadishu , somalia \( associated press \) map of somalia shows location of us embassy in modadishu
picasso s demoiselles d'avignon is regarded as a masterpiece but its qualities were not immediately apparent as howard gardner relates in this excerpt from creating minds , published this month by basic books picasso s ambivalence toward les demoiselles d'avignon was heightened by the reaction of his acquaintances and friends even those who had admired his earlier work did not know what to make of it reactions ranged from confusion or mystification \( gertrude and leo stein , braque \) to downright rage \( matisse \) only two dealers , danielhenry kahnweiler and wilhelm uhde , showed interest kahnweiler later recalled what i 'd like to make you realize at once is the incredible heroism of a man like picasso , whose moral loneliness was , at the time , quite horrifying , for none of his painter friends had followed him everyone found that picture crazy or monstrous picasso described what it is like at such moments when one is taking enormous risks painting is freedom if you jump , you might fall on the wrong side of the rope but if you are not willing to take the risk of breaking your neck , what good is it \? you do n't jump at all you have to wake people up to revolutionize their way of identifying things you 've got to create images they wo n't accept stung , though not derailed by the mostly hostile reactions , picasso quietly put away the canvas and did not display it publicly for several years eventually , of course , the achievement of les demoiselles and its unique status in the history of the period came to be widely recognized or , speaking sociologically , the field elected to regard this work as a masterpiece copyright 1993 by howard gardner photo detail of picasso s masterpiece les demoiselles d'avignon \( museum of modern art \)
filbert , sc dori sanders first began telling stories sitting in the nook of a massive rock here , with acres of her family s peach trees all around and the warm carolina sun beginning its descent on the horizon the 10 children in her family called it the storytelling rock and marveled at how time and weather had shaped it to look like a giant mushroom , and how if your eye caught it from a certain angle , it appeared as if an eagle sat perched on its edge that was some 60 years ago , when the sanders children would gather their friends after school and spin tales ms sanders s brother orestus always told horror stories that left his listeners cowering when it was do ri s turn , the stories were about young girls getting their first kisses and old women working the fields a farmer who writes but for a young black girl growing up in south carolina during world war ii , storytelling was a hobby , not a career a girl like her with a knack for language could go into education , like her oldest sister , virginia , did or she could just be a chatty hand on the family farm , which is what dori did she still regales everyone who works on the sanders farm as she plants and prunes and picks and sells the fruits and vegetables at a roadside produce stand , only now ms sanders s stories include true tales of what it s like to be a real author out on the road promoting a book , which she is now doing for the second time as many brothers and sisters as i have , as large a family as i come from , i'm still not comfortable in that spot , speaking in public , said ms sanders , whose second novel , her own place , was just published by algonquin of chapel hill my trick is i do n't put on my glasses , so the audience is not real clear to me then i just look out and say to myself , 'all you people are just customers at my peach shed on highway 321 , and before the day is done i'm going to sell you some peaches' her first novel , clover \( algonquin \) , the story of the awkward relationship between a 10yearold black girl and her white stepmother in rural south carolina following her father s sudden death , was published three years ago to surprised and glowing reviews the new york times book review said ms sanders was very much the genuine item ms sanders s improbable career as a novelist began with a few jottings on the back of a menu at the best western state inn near andrews air force base in maryland where she was working in the banquet hall during the winter months in the 1980 s to earn enough money to keep the farm going when the crops failed the banquet hall manager , nancy shulman , noticed the writing and started castigating her workers for defacing expensive property then she read the few simple sentences and said that they were wonderful ms sanders confessed that they were hers mrs shulman encouraged her to pursue her writing , a preposterous but inviting idea , thought ms sanders , as she returned to the farm in york county , some 40 miles from charlotte , nc ms sanders eventually finished a manuscript and sent it to algonquin although its editor , louis d rubin , thought the work melodramatic , he found in it a voice , and he urged ms sanders to try again the publisher was rewarded a year later , when ms sanders submitted a novel that began they dressed me in white for my daddy s funeral and went on in a simple , child s voice to tell the story of clover 'farming s who i am' i wanted to leave something for my nieces and nephews , a way to tell them what life was like on the farm , because i know when my generation passes , this farm will pass out of our family , said ms sanders , who is divorced , has no children and admits only to being older than 60 none of the young people these days want to farm you see , they want things and farming does n't afford you things farming s a black hole it sucks everything in and gives virtually no return but it is who i am if someone asks me what i do , i say , 'i'm a farmer' and only later do i say , 'oh , and i also do some writing' her latest novel , her own place , is about mae lee barnes , who matures from a rural south carolina teenager , all buckled knees for her high school sweetheart , to an abandoned mother of five whose fierce reserves and constant humor help her family to prosper although the novel spans the decades from world war ii to the present , subtly covering such subjects as racism and aids , it moves at the gentle , timeless pace of a work by willa cather kirkus reviews , whose early readings of books are often harsh and are the first critical windows to a work , said the novel resonates as powerfully as an old hymn and has the truths and details that are the cipher of fine writing ms sanders has practically memorized the review , repeating its lines in pleased disbelief as she stands in front of her modest clapboard house on the farm , a wisteria tree flanking the walk , all purple flowers drooping over twisted branches 'the cipher of fine writing , ' that s what they said , she said about me , little dorinda sanders ms sanders is slim and muscular , her hair dyed , she admits , an unnatural shade of black , and she squeezes her hooded eyes tightly when she laughs , which she does often
across this desk not long ago came a recording of ravel s tombeau de couperin so aberrant in style that it set one to wondering what younger pianists are thinking about an important body of french piano music the performance is part of an arcadia cd , hommage to couperin \( arc 20002 \) , which also includes 13 of the baroque master s pieces de clavecin the pianist is pavlina dokovska the opening bars of the prelude set off at an alarming speed unrealistic to be sure , but there are at least five more tempos to come in this twoandahalfminute piece a couple of them are almost correct the toccata also begins with blazing ambition and then suddenly pulls back ms dokovska , a young bulgarian by way of the juilliard school , seems to base movement not , as ravel did , on 17th and 18thcentury dance models but on the limits of her considerable technique play fast while you can , less fast when you have to she punctuates the necessarily slower forlane and minuet with sighing hesitations the 19thcentury salon is revisited sinding and moszkowski hold forth one can almost forgive ms dokovska s confusion she is a pianist of attractive musical instincts and a certain amount of innocence , and she is being asked to confront one of music s more puzzling split personalities for there are two ravels the first is a reinventor of the past , an austere salvager of france s baroque preeminence ravel s chord extensions \( where would modern jazz be without them \?

he is the compulsive orchestrator of his own piano music and perhaps the most tasteful sensationalist who ever composed this is the ravel of scarbo and alborada del gracioso , both of which elevate pianistic difficulties to olympian parlor tricks most people probably know le tombeau in its shortened orchestral form and not its sixmovement original the two are different compositions despite their identical language one a dignified exercise in blackandwhite , the other an endearing icecream sundae of a piece what ms dokovska has not realized is that ravel kept his two personalities separated she tries to mix them together miscalculations of this magnitude among the young are indeed cause for worry , but there is also comfort to be had at your record store a number of cd s offering ravel s piano music played by younger performers currently circulate , and some are quite good the literature fits fairly neatly on two disks louis lortie plays it all \( chandos chan 8620 , 8647 \) as does boris krajny \( supraphon 11 14762 132 \) first volumes of projected complete sets are available from philippe bianconi \( lyrinx lyr 124 \) and gordon fergusthompson \( asv dca 805 \) a complete set by jacques rouvier made in 1974 is also recirculating \( calliope cal 9824 \) note , too , a cautionary voice from the past vlado perlemuter s twocd set on nimbus \( ni 5005 , 5011 \) many contemporary pianists took isolated lessons from the great man , but none deserves the title student of ravel more than mr perlemuter , who was born in 1904 ms dokovska could learn much from his unadorned simplicity , his refusal to milk phrases for momentary effect , in short , his insistence on letting the classical ravel speak for himself the gaudy ravel was beyond mr perlemuter when these recordings were made pieces like scarbo retreat behind pedaled clouds of obfuscation even such an excellent \( and much younger \) musician as mr fergusthompson a pianist who plays le tombeau and the valses nobles et sentimentales with admirable calm and reflection struggles audibly with the extravagance of ondine likewise , mr rouvier , a scrupulous french journeyman , negotiates ravel s more difficult places with palpable apprehension mr krajny , who was trained in prague , offers the slowest ravel performances this listener has ever heard for their sheer novelty , they can be refreshing and informative , but in the long run they hardly satisfy whether mr krajny s stately progress through the repertory is the product of esthetic conviction or practical necessity is a question left for the listener to decide mr lortie s scarbo is in startling contrast so immense is this young canadian s technique that he can lay open to close scrutiny , almost pedalfree , passages that other pianists are happy simply to get past and if this seems sometimes more braggadocio than art , elsewhere mr lortie produces glowing color in the miroirs and shows his essential good taste in the antique pieces mr lortie and helene mercier play ravel duet music on chandos chan 8905 ma mere l'oye is , of course , in its original fourhand version the introduction et allegro , bolero and la valse are in arrangements by the composer the transcription of rapsodie espagnole is unattributed here the mother goose is appropriately chaste , the rest appropriately opulent mr bianconi s playing has an admirable elegance as well this first volume includes the miroirs , the valses nobles et sentimentales and gaspard de la nuit the young frenchman s technique is splendid it may lack the overpowering forcefulness of mr lortie s , but his reticence at times becomes an asset when mr bianconi records the rest of this music , his set promises to be an attractive alternative or even a companion piece to mr lortie s photo maurice ravel a compulsive orchestrator of his own piano music and perhaps the most tasteful sensationalist who ever composed \( the bettmann archive \)
on the joyful morning that christopher battiste joined his mother s whitewashed church in the bronx , the rev jerry mosby felt a sharp , fleeting sense of dread he could not quite define it , he said later , but there had been something strangely unsettling in the newcomer s eyes hours later , during a visit to another church , that intuition proved prophetic as organ and voices swelled in an opening hymn , mr battiste bolted toward the altar , sweeping the bible , the gleaming metal cross and the brass candlesticks to the floor before loping glassy eyed for the door that was 13 erratic and sometimes violent months before the sunday in january when , the authorities say , mr battiste went berserk on the steps of yet another bronx church and hammered the life out of doll mamie johnson , an 80yearold former sunday school superintendent , with a piece of pipe mentally ill for much of his life and frequently hurling himself into rages with crack and a hallucinogenic drug called angel dust , mr battiste had been a disaster waiting to happen when he was arrested and charged with murder , it sent a chill through a city that has grown fearful of an army of troubled people , many of them homeless , whose mental illness is made worse by the use of drugs most of these people , experts insist , are not dangerous but mr battiste s journey over the precipice tracked in police and medical records and interviews with psychiatrists , friends , his mother and city and state officials is the story of a deeply disturbed man and the system that failed to help him at almost every crucial step of the way for years , mr battiste had drifted in and out of jails , homeless shelters and psychiatric emergency rooms but even as his life became a lengthening litany of encounters with a fractured system , he received limited help at best lost in a web of medical , socialservice and criminaljustice bureaucracies , which do not share records because of confidentiality rules , he was often treated as a man with no records at all and as often happens with mentally ill drug abusers , he was never deemed appropriate for involuntary hospitalization , under a law that many psychiatrists say bars them from confining a patient unless , at the time of examination , he appears dangerous to himself or others his mother tried to get him help , said mr mosby , the pastor of the fellowship covenant church , three blocks from the apartments where mr battiste grew up in the castle hill section of the bronx she begged them to keep him in the hospital so he would n't hurt himself or somebody else mr battiste made more than a dozen trips to city emergency rooms in the last five years , sometimes manacled , kicking and yelling obscenities he is a powerfully built , intimidating figure with a dossier of arrests that rambles from auto theft to attempted rape but he would always calm down in a few hours or days and be sent on his way sometimes doctors would ask him to report to a psychiatric or drugtreatment center for followup care but he was not one of the few patients assigned a personal escort , or case manager , and he seldom , if ever , went for treatment terrorized his mother in the time it took to panhandle a few dollars , he would get hold of more drugs and shamble off for another meeting with his old demons pounding on doors and skulking in hallways , he terrorized his mother and her neighbors he fought with police officers and hospital attendants and sometimes slugged shelter residents who shrugged when he tried to bum cigarettes today , mr battiste is confined in a bellevue psychiatric ward , awaiting arraignment on charges of seconddegree murder how he will plead remains unknown his court appointed lawyer , alvin c morris , did not return telephone calls the slaying of doll johnson as she arrived at the salvation baptist church on the cold , graying afternoon of jan 17 , was only the latest in a series of highly publicized cases that have galvanized demands for new ways of dealing with potentially dangerous mentally ill drug abusers last fall , larry hogue , a mentally ill drug abuser , was finally placed in a state mental hospital after years of frightening residents on the upper west side with muttered threats and bizarre behavior mr hogue was ordered freed last week by a judge who said he suffered from an attitude problem , not mental illness the state has appealed a year earlier , kevin mckiever , another troubled man who had roamed the same neighborhood , was charged with stabbing a 30yearold woman to death the disorder a mental illness inflamed by drugs just like many of the rudderless young men who drop out of school and become regulars in the courts , jails and hospitals , mr battiste suffers from a difficulttotreat , wideranging condition known as antisocial personality disorder , according to doctors who have reviewed his psychiatric records those suffering with it usually do not hear voices and see visions , as schizophrenics do chronically angry and combative , they instead take pleasure in violating social norms and hurting others
after hearing horror stories about long waits in past years at the state department of motor vehicles in manhattan , the suburbanite was understandably anxious as he approached the yonkers office to transfer his driver s license from maryland to new york the line waiting for the doors to open was a block long how pleasant to find that , at 9 am sharp , everyone filed in quickly and in order not a linejumper in the crowd and there , just inside the door , was a courteous woman answering questions and pointing each person toward the proper desk no danger of waiting hours in the wrong line only to be sent to some other line first stop the line for photographs it moved so fast his picture was snapped before he could finish filling in form mv44 , the driver s license application the woman behind the desk even suggested he straighten his glasses for a more becoming mug shot one final stop where he took his eye test , handed in mv44 and his old license , paid 3475 , and got his new temporary license the permanent license would be mailed later blinking in the bright sun of getty square , he could hardly believe his good fortune elapsed time 17 minutes emotions drained none
the state of the game has been altered for the moment , the mets have chosen denial as their response from top executives to the manager to the players , the mets yesterday played down the significance of the looming realignment of the national league that would most likely place the atlanta braves in the east along with the mets the expos , another rising organization rich in young talent , and the phillies , the likely nl east champions this season , would also be in the same division as the mets the braves , the marlins and the pirates have not been officially placed in either the east or central divisions the competitive strength of a division could change in a hurry , said gerry hunsicker , the vice president of baseball operations for the mets did you think we were hoping for a break \? asked manager dallas green the braves are n't officially in yet and if they are , i wo n't get depressed looking at that prospect that would be defeatist we have n't even begun 1994 yet does n't mean nothing , said john franco , the mets' closer signed and delivering the unanimity of opinion did n't sound convincing the braves , with pitching that is the class of baseball , have climbed back within reach of their third straight nl west title their pitchers , for the most part , are locked into longterm deals their deep stockpile of prospects infielder chipper jones and first baseman ryan kelsko could be playing for most major league clubs has hardly been depleted by trades or injury hey , it still does n't guarantee them anything , said green shoot , we were picked to be contenders the last couple of years , dwight gooden said of the mets we 've learned names do n't mean anything you 've got to play according to david letterman , the mets would only have profited from realignment had they been ordered to play in the broadway show softball league the sarcasm is welltaken in the short term , sure , it s not the greatest news , said hunsicker but in the long term , you ca n't worry either we are going to be a successful organization or we are not said green none of it bothers me fooling with the game to begin with , that s what bothers me i'm a traditionalist what changes \? there are n't many other purists in the clubhouse a handful of the mets were n't even aware of the advanced stage the proposed reconfiguration and revision had reached a couple who were aware refused to believe it would be effective in 1994 still others were ignorant of the imminent challenge the braves would present the braves \? in the east \? how did they get in there \? franco asked when the topic was first raised i know i said the teams still had to play , said gooden , but i would n't have minded it if the braves had stayed put greg maddux , steve avery , tom glavine , john smoltz yesterday , they were suddenly more than the curiosities who were pitching the braves past the giants in september the horizon , something the mets have been staring at since april , also had the phillies refusing to disappear any time soon i 'll say one more thing , said hunsicker i do n't have to go too far back to remember when people said the mets were going to be good for a long , long time inside pitch tim bogar , the shortstop who had made a favorable impression in his audition for a fulltime 1994 job , will have his season ended by wrist surgery next week bogar , who has not played since he damaged ligaments and perhaps fractured a bone while sliding into the plate on aug 14 , hit 244 with 13 doubles and 25 runs batted in in 205 atbats for the mets i do n't know what their priorities are , bogar said they could feel they have to go out and get a shortstop if they do n't , i see myself playing every day there in 1994 i do n't think i hurt myself said manager dallas green he held his head above water no one imagined him helping us offensively as much as he did but i'm not saying he s a bona fide no 1 guy

the bond market sold off across the board yesterday as traders and investors worried about the possibility of faster economic growth and higher inflation but the lesson was not that interest rates are moving sharply higher nor was it that the economic fundamentals of sluggish growth and low inflation , which have underpinned this year s bond rally , have changed significantly rather , it was that the market will continue to be volatile and easily rattled , even by what are normally considered secondtier economic reports with longterm interest rates at the lowest level in 25 years , traders and investors have become cautious every day they wonder if interest rates have finally hit bottom and they are vulnerable to any news that might make them reach that conclusion three waves of news yesterday , the news came in three waves , though none was the kind of news that usually affects bond prices still , the price of the 30year treasury bond dropped 113 32 points , pushing up its yield , which moves in the opposite direction , to 591 percent from 582 percent wednesday among the news , the german central bank surprised most market analysts by cutting two key interest rates by half a percentage point the lombard rate fell to 6 3 4 percent while the more important discount rate dropped to 5 3 4 percent that made some people wonder if interest rates would start to fall even faster in europe , which would mean that the recessions there could end much sooner than expected that , in turn , could mean more demand for american exports , helping economic growth here , possibly sparking higher inflation it was a long chain of reasoning linked by a lot of ifs , but it was enough to prompt selling when , as one trader said , the bond market is looking for excuses to sell off john r williams , managing director of global economics at the bankers trust company , said , there is just a growing view that maybe the global economy is about to turn up a bit , though he added that he does not agree with this view a second factor was the surprising report by the federal reserve bank of philadelphia its index of regional economic conditions jumped to 151 in october from 07 in september some analysts , like raymond stone , a managing director at stone mccarthy research associates in princeton , nj , believe this index gives a good hint of how the index of the national association of purchasing managers will behave for october mr stone said the philadelphia index points to a jump in the purchasing managers index to 53 or 54 in october from 497 in september he also said that the employment index in the philadelphia index rose sharply , pointing to the possibility of an overall increase in manufacturing jobs in october , which would be the first rise in seven months if it is a harbinger of stronger manufacturing growth it is something to worry about , stephen slifer , financial market economist at lehman brothers , said the last factor was new concern in the market that the october report for the consumer price index will show an increase of threetenths to fourtenths of one percent the index was unchanged in september but the reason for much of that rise would be the adjustments made in the index to smooth out the regular seasonal fluctuations in prices , which means that the underlying rate would not be increasing still , given the tentative nature of the market right now , it was solely the prospect of a higher cpi number rather than the explanation on which many traders and investors focused the report that initial claims for state jobless benefits rose by 6 , 000 , to 350 , 000 , in the week ended oct 16 had little impact on the market , traders said it was the second consecutive weekly increase and reflected applicants who were switching from an expired federal program treasury notes the prices of treasury notes also declined yesterday the price of the 10year note fell 24 32 as the yield rose to 532 percent from 523 percent the day before the yield on the twoyear note rose to 384 percent from 382 percent in the whenissued market , the twoyear notes to be auctioned by the treasury on tuesday yielded 391 percent , up from 386 percent , while the fiveyear notes to be sold wednesday yielded 474 percent , up from 467 percent municipal bonds in the municipal market , goldman sachs company won the competitive bid for 4243 million of florida board of education generalobligation bonds the bond due in 2018 was priced to yield 517 percent , with an aftertax yield of 808 percent , while the bond due in 2023 was priced to yield 5242 percent , with an aftertax yield of 819 percent at the top rate of 36 percent graph taxexempt yeilds depicts average weekly yeilds for 20 general obligation bonds and 25 revenue bonds , july october 1993 \( source the bond buyer \)
a potentially serious knee injury to doc rivers turned a milestone night for patrick ewing into a night of concern for the knicks rivers suffered a severely sprained left knee , with possible ligament damage , during new york s 10885 victory over the los angeles lakers last night at madison square garden rivers , the starting point guard , was scheduled for a magnetic resonance imaging test this morning to determine what ligament damage , if any , exists the knicks hoped it was just a sprain a longterm injury to rivers would be a major blow to the knicks \( 154 \) , a team with championship aspirations that was already most vulnerable at the pointguard position the injury overshadowed the record by ewing , who scored 27 points to reach 14 , 618 and pass walt frazier \( 14 , 617 \) as the knicks' career leading scorer dressed in street clothes , rivers walked gingerly out of the arena immediately after the game with dr norman scott , the knicks' team physician while he walked under his own power , rivers still appeared to be in severe pain instead of speculating , the knicks waited for today s test results and hoped for the best we wo n't know until the morning , until he has the mri , the real extent of it , coach pat riley said after new york s fifth consecutive victory i'm concerned about it , but until tomorrow s definitive prognosis of exactly what it is , all we can do is hope that it s not maybe what people anticipate we 'll just have to wait for a report and react accordingly to that obviously he s in a lot of pain the crowd grows quiet rivers s injury occurred with 5 minutes 53 seconds left in the third quarter , and the capacity crowd went quiet as rivers drove down the lane for a layup attempt , he injured his left knee after leaping in midair between anthony peeler and vlade divac rivers landed awkwardly after the play , with all of his weight coming down on his left leg he immediately clutched his knee in pain mike saunders , the knicks' trainer , along with scott , quickly came to rivers s aide after about a minute , rivers had to be carried to the locker room by teammates eric anderson and herb williams if rivers s injury is longterm , knicks management will be faced with a major decision perhaps they would pursue a trade for a point guard derek harper has been unhappy in dallas , as has jeff hornacek in philadelphia isiah thomas could also be available , with the detroit pistons in rebuilding but all of that remained speculative until the extent of rivers s injury was known as for ewing \( 27 points , 11 rebounds \) , the basket everyone had been waiting for came with 9 39 left in the third quarter , when he made a 12foot jumper off a pass from charles oakley the crowd gave ewing a standing ovation as play continued until the 9 08 mark of the quarter , when coach randy pfund called a lakers timeout at that point , ewing s teammates embraced him with hugs and headrubs , then frazier came to the knicks' bench , where he shook ewing s hands and posed for several pictures it was a moment to savor for ewing , 31 , who has endured many good times and bad times since joining the knicks in 1985 it means a lot to me , ewing said of the record before the game , doc and john starks were kidding me , saying that they were the one who were going to give me the pass but , ironically , i got it from oak , and it seemed fitting because we 've been together the longest as a kid , you dream about this most of my dreams are teamoriented , not individual goals i'm very honored 'our thoughts are with him' but less than five minutes after ewing s moment , rivers was on the floor in anguish and ewing , like everyone else , was concerned i saw him when he was walking out , hobbling and stuff , ewing said of rivers our thoughts are with him even without rivers in the fourth quarter , the game was a rout , as the struggling lakers \( 814 \) offered little resistance divac and doug christie led the lakers with 14 points each once again , it shows the change in times when we used to be the team on the verge of breaking records , said pfund now we 're setting other kinds of records we basically did n't deserve to be on the court tonight for so many years this game has been big for us we only come into the big city one time , so i challenged the team , but they did n't respond we 're committed to young guys and we 're going to get better i'm not waving the white flag yet with rivers out , greg anthony returned to action in the fourth quarter after a twogame absence , and he was greeted with a mixture of cheers and boos more booing came his way after he missed a layup , but anthony responded with nice pass to anthony bonner a few minutes later anthony \( flu , upper respiratory infection \) had said he had eaten little except oranges for the previous six days but anthony , the backup point guard who has struggled all season , may be pressed into service quickly in light of rivers s injury i have to try to get my strength back , but i 'll be all right in a few days , anthony said the big test is going to be if i have to play tomorrow we do n't know the severity of doc s injury he s very , very crucial we 're all hoping for the best rebounds coach pat riley is anticipating a playofflike atmosphere at noisy chicago stadium tonight it will be the knicks' first game against the bulls since michael jordan s retirement when michael retired , the media automatically took their crown and put it over here , riley said that will give them inspiration they are the world champions , they 've won three in a row , and they 're playing as well as anybody in the league right now asked whether he thought the bulls were still good enough to win their fourth consecutive national basketball association title , riley said whether they 're good enough to win a championship remains to be seen but the same can be said about whether houston is , or whether seattle is , or whether we are but the one thing they have that none of us have is the experience of being there that gives them an edge photos doc rivers writhes in pain after injuring his knee in the third quarter as charles oakley

the boston celtics' captain , reggie lewis , said he has not yet decided whether to seek a third medical opinion before resuming his basketball career , which seemed threatened earlier this month lewis , in a radio interview , also accused some doctors of being inaccessible to him and of improperly releasing some details about his case to the public lewis collapsed in an april 29 playoff game against charlotte and spent the next 11 days in hospitals his problem was at first diagnosed as potentially careerending heart disease but later diagnosed as a relatively harmless case of nerves sending confusing signals to the heart after collapsing , lewis spent a weekend undergoing tests at new england baptist hospital after analysis of the results by 11 cardiologists none of whom examined lewis or met with him lewis was told he had a serious heart ailment the hospital and the celtics released a statement saying lewis had cardiac abnormalities , and team physician , arnold scheller , said lewis had a potentially lifethreatening condition and probably would not play again lewis left the hospital late at night and transferred to brigham and women s hospital , where a week later doctors said he had a nerve condition and a normal athlete s heart based on that diagnosis , lewis said he planned to return to basketball meanwhile , the celtics' president , red auerbach , watched nba playoff games on tv while resting in massachusetts general hospital yesterday and hoped to go home early in the week auerbach , 75 , who underwent two procedures this week to clear blocked arteries , had minor surgery friday to close a small hole in an artery to his right leg the hole was opened during one of the earlier procedures \( ap \)
charles rotkin s aug 8 critique of the interview of the photographer bob buchanan photographers find strength in unity , july 4 completely missed the point mr buchanan stated that 65 commercial photographers from the westchesterfairfield region formed an organization to address the specific needs of its members in this region many of us are members of the various photographic societies within a 50mile radius of new york city , and we are familiar with the scope and limitations of these organizations however , none address the problems unique to westchesterfairfield commercial photographers mr rotkin is not a professional photographer , but he is a professional writer he did not bother to research the subject or interview any of our members before writing his critique to the times therefore , he has no idea of the purpose and objectives of our organization or why we found it necessary to join together his reference to the help received by staff attorneys from the major new york societies , who testified before congress on issues of copyright protection and ownership , was equally flawed the 10year battle by those attorneys before the senate on work for hire reform and clients' abuses of the rights of commercial photographers , failed in every attempt not one of the five bills introduced by their sponsor emerged from the senate subcommittee hearings , and westchesterfairfield commercial photographers have to deal with the problems of an uneven marketplace by themselves paul zuckerman white plains
los angeles every so often , dr delaney smith will pull out a yearold videotape and relive the los angeles riots on his widescreen television , watching the flames rise against the night sky and feeling the rage of his people all over again as the liquor stores and gas stations burn only blocks from his home it has never left me , dr smith , an internist who specializes in emergency medicine , said recently it brings me back to my roots i do n't ever want to forget for middleclass blacks who are living evidence of the nation s civil rights gains , the beating of rodney king and the recent second trial of four white police officers in the case have been agonizing reminders of how much more has to change before they are truly accepted as equals interviews with more than 70 welltodo blacks in los angeles and around the country suggest that blacks did not find the convictions of two of the four officers a catharsis or a cause for celebration rather , they saw those verdicts as a grudging half step toward justice , a bittersweet culmination of a very bleak year 'the deepest sadness' when i heard the verdicts , i could n't stop crying , said dr donna franklin , a chicago writer and consultant it was crying of the deepest sadness one piece of it was release the other was , 'will our children ever know the absence of racism \? ' she and others interviewed said they had lowered their expectations about race relations over the last year they told of efforts to stand up to indignities and said they were rethinking their spending habits , putting money and economic clout behind other blacks and blackowned businesses despite the whoops and cheers from a black church near the southcentral district that bore the brunt of the riots , there was no jubilation along predominantly black crenshaw boulevard or in the black middleclass sections of leimert park or inglewood , all in or near the southcentral area justice was blind in one eye , said dr richard williams , a los angeles cardiologist here was a black man who was severely beaten , and they only convict 50 percent of the people charged with beating him those interviewed in los angeles said they had spent the last year trying to focus the anger they felt toward the officers who beat mr king , toward a simi valley jury that had acquitted them of state criminal charges , toward what they see as unequal treatment for blacks in everyday dealings in a whitedominated society the people who embraced integration in their climb into the middle class are now talking with bitterness and resignation about separation and solidarity last year s despair , they said , has turned to defiance we have had to look in the mirror of our society , said steven lott , an architect here what i see is very ugly citing toll of verdict he and others say they were angered that the officers' guilt in the beating took two trials , millions of dollars in legal fees , riots , millions more in lost property and dozens of lives to prove look at what it took to get this verdict , said doris davis , a los angeles teacher , a quaver in her voice while others talk of healing , those interviewed talked of doing for themselves and supporting one another in the way they said the jews and asians had done many have turned inward in the last year , transferring money to blackowned institutions from whiteowned banks , seeking out black businesses to repair their automobiles or buy walltowall carpeting they have been creating consortiums and cooperatives to serve the inner city and generally viewing the country as a more hostile place than they did before the simi valley jury verdict we carry around a rage in us , said walter allen , a professor of sociology at the university of california at los angeles , who has written on racial issues we carry the weight of the race and the weight of racism the rodney king case has radicalized black folks that used to be mildmannered it has brought people face to face with the country s racial caste system some are showing solidarity by putting their money where their concerns are since the riots , some black businesses are reporting banner years , with black customers seeking out the companies to show their support i will drive on fumes to get to a black gas station , said zna portlock , a lawyer who , while recently looking for a new doctor , went down a list of physicians and called their offices to see which ones were black gerald hutchinson , owner of an autobody shop in the crenshaw district , said the beating case had done more for business than the few advertisements he used to buy it s a shame to have this happen for people to be more aware , he said , but it s paying off the three blackowned financial institutions in los angeles posted gains in deposits despite the recession , which slowed growth at some other banks at founders national bank in southcentral , deposits rose to 75 million from 60 million the accounts held by black churches tripled to 50 after the riots , said carlton jenkins , the bank s managing director deposits at the blackowned broadway federal savings and loan rose to 3 million from 2 million , while those at family savings bank rose to 113 million from 109 million
washington , oct 24 the evidence of an iraqi assassination plot against george bush , the basis for a united states missile attack in june on the intelligence headquarters in baghdad , was significantly weaker than the clinton administration asserted , a new article says the article , written by seymour m hersh and published in the new yorker this week , says no evidence directly linked president saddam hussein of iraq , his intelligence service or his senior advisers to an assassination attempt on the former president president clinton ordered the june 26 attack a day after receiving a federal bureau of investigation report that concluded that iraqi intelligence agents had smuggled a car bomb into kuwait and planned to kill mr bush during a visit in april shortly after the attack , mr clinton said he had been presented with compelling evidence that there was in fact a plot to assassinate former president bush by iraqi intelligence as revenge by a tyrant against the leader of the coalition that defeated iraq in the gulf war in 1991 the american government s case against iraq as it has been outlined in public , anyway is seriously flawed , mr hersh writes the evidence was too weak to be conclusive but , in the administration s view , perhaps not weak enough to be dismissed , he says the white house and officials of the national security council had no comment on the article , said lorraine voles , a deputy white house spokeswoman an fbi official said tonight that the agency had no reason to change its assessment that there was an iraqi role the administration based its case largely on a comparison of the remotecontrolled firing device found in the car bomb with similar devices known to have been made in iraq but seven experts in electric engineering and explosives who saw photographs of the device found in kuwait and of a known iraqi device told mr hersh that both were generic equipment without unique characteristics fourteen iraqis and kuwaitis have been charged by kuwait in the case mr hersh depicts the main defendants as bumbling smugglers of alcohol and firearms who took no coherent steps toward detonating a bomb or carrying out an assassination the fbi cited confessions by several defendants and concluded none had been tortured by kuwaitis but some defendants disavowed the confessions and said they had been beaten , according to testimony cited in the article the trial is continuing
as the first round of this week s 93d united states open at the baltusrol golf club in springfield , nj , approaches , jack nicklaus is hoping that rekindled memories of some of his best golf ever will help him produce the best that he has left no theater in golf has illuminated the nicklaus legend more than baltusrol s lower course the last two times the open was held over the arduous a w tillinghastdesigned layout , nicklaus won by breaking the championship 72hole scoring record in 1967 , he closed with a 65 for a total of 275 to decisively defeat and unseat from golf s throne his playing partner over the final 36 holes , arnold palmer in 1980 , the 40yearold nicklaus emerged from what was then the worst slump of his career to win his recordtying fourth united states open after starting with a recordtying 63 , he finished by outdueling the putting genius isao aoki with a 68 to again break the championship scoring record twelve united states opens later , 272 still stands but since that summer , when he also won his fifth pga championship , nicklaus has won only three times on the pga tour the 1982 colonial invitational , the 1984 memorial and the 1986 masters last year was his worst ever as a professional , as he missed three of four cuts in the major championships and failed to win even on the senior pga tour to this point , 1993 has been just as bad for nicklaus since he turned 53 on jan 21 , nicklaus s best finish on the regular tour has been a tie for 10th at doral in three senior tour appearances , he has finished no better than a tie for ninth , at the tradition in an allout effort to give himself the chance to put a fitting cap on his majestic career , nicklaus has for months followed a strict physical regimen that has alleviated the pain in his hips and back , and has worked diligently on forging a correspondingly more athletic swing under the guidance of teacher rick smith but so far , the changes have not merged into success nicklaus s year reached its nadir two weeks ago , when he shot a thirdround 81 and finished next to last in the memorial , the tournament he founded near his ohio birthplace i need to get more out of my game , more out of me than i am getting , nicklaus said , clearly discouraged , after the final round over the muirfield village golf club he designed i'm not getting what i want out of myself if i ca n't go out and perform like jack nicklaus , then i do n't want to be out there i 've played all my life playing a certain way , and people expect jack nicklaus to show up when he does n't show up , that upsets me at that moment , with baltusrol looming , nicklaus was without his legendary confidence he even spoke of skipping the british open in july at royal st george s and thereby ending his streak of never having missed a major championship since he turned professional in 1962 'i 've doubted myself' you go through periods , nicklaus , the winner of 18 titles in the majors , said in the last two or three days , i 've doubted myself as far as what i can do a few hours later , nicklaus was sitting next to paul azinger at the victory news conference as the younger man described his mental state before holing a dramatic sand shot that won him the memorial i was thinking of what i had to do , not what i was afraid would happen , said azinger which sounds a lot like jack nicklaus azinger went on to cite a book on sports psychology he often reads that he said described nicklaus s mind as a cork jar full of positive thoughts given his recent performances and the doubt they have engendered , nicklaus could n't help a rueful smile well , he said i guess i 've lost my cork if he has , history has taught him to look for it at baltusrol when he arrived for the 1967 championship , nicklaus was searching for a putting stroke when a friend loaned him a centershafted putter painted white white fang , as he dubbed the putter , was the key to his victory by special invitation in 1980 , nicklaus was struggling to adapt to a deeper , flatter backswing that his original teacher , the late jack grout , had installed he had not won a tournament in nearly a year somehow , everything came together in the face of the arduous demands of baltusrol this year , nicklaus is in the championship on a special exemption granted by the united states golf association realistically , he knows he has become a long shot at any united states open as his driving has gotten shorter and less accurate , the unforgiving rough has strangled his chances since 1987 , nicklaus has finished no better than 33d in the national championship , and has missed the cut twice so when he arrived in new jersey last week to play baltusrol s lower course for the first time since the final round in 1980 , it was without an urgent sense of mission nicklaus was armed with irons from his new equipment company , but he was carrying the same wooden driver and 3wood he used in his prime , as well as the same blade putter , a george low wizard sportsmen 600 , that he got when he first joined the tour in 1962 and that he used at baltusrol in 1980 early in the round he admitted that he could remember very little about the

on monday , in a high school on the upper west side of manhattan , the rev jesse jackson stood on the stage of a nearly filled auditorium and spoke to the ache in the heart of black america for whatever reasons , and they are many and complex , large numbers of black youngsters in america are on a rampage of killing and they are killing mostly one another the mortuaries in black neighborhoods are thick with the residue of homicide the stunned , the grieving and the dead twoyearolds , threeyearolds , teenagers , young black men and women mr jackson told students at the martin luther king jr high school , we lose more lives annually to the crime of blacks killing blacks than the sum total of lynchings in the entire history of the country it is time , he said , to stop it mr jackson is leading a national campaign against violence and other selfdestructive behavior by young africanamericans he believes , correctly , that the struggle to halt the wholesale destruction of a generation of black youngsters demands the same urgency and intensity of effort as the long and ultimately successful fight for civil rights he noted that none of the enormous problems that have previously faced blacks in america not slavery , not lynching , not legal segregation have been as deadly as today s catastrophic combination of violence , drug abuse and aids what faces us today is preventable , he said it is within our power to change our behavior his campaign is designed to spotlight the problem , to create a sense of urgency and to get the young people the primary victims and potential victims of the violence to cry out against it mr jackson would like youngsters to find ways other than a knife to the throat or a bullet to the heart to settle a dispute , and , perhaps most difficult of all , to turn in their peers who are trafficking in violence and drugs gazing out at the 600 or 700 students in the audience , he said how many of you know someone in your age group who is dead because of drugs \? please stand about 25 percent of the students stood a similar percentage rose when asked if they knew of someone who had distributed drugs at school and about 40 percent of them stood when asked if they knew of someone who had brought a gun to school mr jackson then said , if you 've told some teacher or someone in authority about somebody who is carrying guns or drugs , please stand no one stood mr jackson told the students that their code of silence made their school a sanctuary for those who would commit violence and distribute drugs the lesson was not over the students were asked what they would do if they knew that someone a teacher , say , or a janitor had a sheet , a hood and some rope in his locker , or in the trunk of his car the students called out that they would turn the person in you would expose it , mr jackson said yes ! came the reply mr jackson s response was that we are far more threatened by the dope than the rope the ku klux klan is not marching in harlem or brownsville or east new york africanamerican teenagers are not being hosed down by bull connor or barred from school by george wallace the danger is coming from the fellow student with a pistol in his knapsack , or a drugdealing tenant in the next apartment , or a mugger who works the routes between home and school the real purpose of jesse jackson s effort is to return the dreams and the ordinary joy of childhood to africanamerican youngsters we have waited far too long to confront this problem head on there are other issues , yes poverty , joblessness , homelessness , many issues and racism is still with us but it s time to give the horrifying levels of violence and death among africanamericans the status of an emergency mr jackson s campaign can only succeed if it attains a bandwagon effect , generating more and more attention , excitement and support as it goes along a rally is planned for detroit and civil rightstype marches for other cities it wo n't be an easy effort , but there is none in black america that is more important
plans to develop the site of the new york coliseum were delayed again yesterday by a quarrel between the city and the metropolitan transportation authority over negotiations with mortimer b zuckerman , three days before a city deadline for signing a contract with mr zuckerman in the latest twist in the plan to build on the site at 59th street and columbus circle , the dinkins administration accused the mta of being unreasonable in its negotiations with mr zuckerman , who has been seeking to scale back the project and to reduce the price of the land the mta rejected the city s accusation , but the city s charge appeared to set the stage for a new set of talks on the coliseum , this time with mediation by vincent tese , commissioner of the state department of economic development victory for zuckerman the city s decision was a victory , at least temporarily , for mr zuckerman , and a setback for the mta because of the complicated ownership and sale agreement on the coliseum , both the mta and the city must agree on mr zuckerman s new offer for the site , one of the choicest for development in the city mr zuckerman has been trying to persuade the mta to lower the price of the coliseum site from the level set in 1985 , when he first agreed to buy it , and to allow him to both buy the land and build in stages the perennially cashstrapped mta has been reluctant to cut the price , and has been wary of such a twostage arrangement proposals scaled back mr zuckerman won the right to develop the property through his boston properties concern at the peak of the realestate boom in new york his plans have been scaled back twice after public criticism and court challenges , only to get caught in the crash of the officespace market , resulting in yet another scaledback proposal submitted to the mta two weeks ago the boston properties proposal needs improvement and refinement in a number of key areas before it would be acceptable to the city and , presumably , to the mta , barry f sullivan , deputy mayor for finance and economic development , said in a letter yesterday to peter e stangl , chairman of the mta unfortunately , the mta s actions suggest that it is unwilling to engage in a constructive dialogue with boston properties mr sullivan added that the mta s approach was not in accord with a request from mayor david n dinkins that the sides carry on reasonable and responsible negotiations latest zuckerman proposal mr stangl could not be reached yesterday , but robert bergen , general counsel of the mta , said we think we 've been acting reasonably and responsibly for the last 10 months , negotiating with the city and with boston properties this is the first time we 've heard this allegation and we obviously reject it completely none of the parties to the talks would discuss the substance of the latest zuckerman proposal , but it has been reported to include a first building with 700 , 000 square feet of office space and 150 , 000 square feet of retail space , to be followed at some time in the future by a second building while the current price tag on the site is 3386 million , people familiar with the talks have said mr zuckerman wants to buy the land for the first building for 62 million , and to leave the price of the rest of the land to be negotiated later price at issue these people have said the mta does not want to leave the price up in the air while the agency holds the land for mr zuckerman further , the mta is said to believe that mr zuckerman wants to delay any building until the realestate market becomes stronger mr zuckerman s option on the land keeps the mta from renting the exhibition hall at the site for anything except the most temporary uses under the current agreement with mr zuckerman , the mta would collect on a 338 million letter of credit that mr zuckerman maintains as a down payment on the site should he fail to reach an agreement on the nature of the development by a formal closing date last month , the mta asked the city to join in issuing a formal notice of intent to close the sale in an effort to reach an agreement with mr zuckerman or , failing that , to go on to other plans for the site but mr sullivan pointed out in his letter that such a closing notice would end the city s influence over the site , and added that the city wanted to consider the broader economic and planning ramifications of any use of the coliseum site rather than just the price of the land
moscow , may 9 mixing proud memories and bitter anger , some 15 , 000 war veterans , communists and nationalists flowed to the center of moscow today to mark the 48th anniversary of victory over nazi germany but with red square finally opened to the demonstrators , there was no repetition of the violence that erupted at may day marches last weekend all last week , after a clash between police officers and militants on may 1 that left hundreds hurt and one riot policeman dead , accusations and threats flew among the hostile political camps into which russia has fractured , and suspense mounted over the demonstration called by the hardliners for the annual may 9 holiday but after moscow city officials relented and allowed the marchers first to reach the eternal flame outside the kremlin wall , and then , at the last minute , to march onto red square , the tensions subsided last weekend , the clashes erupted when the national salvation front , which had been confined to a short route far from red square , tried to take an unauthorized route this time , though the banners and chants were fierce and militant and truckloads of policemen were poised in surrounding side streets , the march was tightly controlled more division than unity even without violence , however , the day spoke more of division than of the unity that victory day used to signify there were the usual reunions of old comrades , their chests aglitter with medals , and the speeches and movies extolling the soviet victory in the great patriotic war , the name russians give world war ii but comments by president boris n yeltsin and rival politicians , and the mood of the throng on tverskaya street , reflected the bitter political and social struggle over russia s fate the march down tverskaya had been called by what is known as the irreconcilable opposition the national salvation front , various successors to the communist party and various militant nationalist organizations conspicuously absent , however , was viktor anpilov , militant head of the russian communist workers' party and a cofounder of the national salvation front , and the man held most responsible for the fray last weekend summoned by prosecutor the news agency interfax reported that mr anpilov was summoned to the prosecutor general s office on saturday and never returned home , but government officials denied he had been detained none of those who did speak today called for disorder , although sergei baburin , a prominent communist legislator , likened mr yeltsin s occupation of the kremlin to napoleon s the french have again taken the kremlin , but once again they will be driven back down the road to smolensk ! he cried out a sampling of signs in the crowd included stalin brought us up to be loyal , save russia from international capitalism ! yeltsin killer , yeltsin reforms are a zionist diversion , and we defeated hitler we will defeat yeltsin the only marginal touch of humor was a rhyme that , loosely translated , read , throw the pig yeltsin , out of the kremlin mr yeltsin and all senior government officials placed wreaths either at the tomb of the unknown soldier under the kremlin ramparts , or at the newly opened war memorial west of the capital at poklonnaya hill , where napoleon waited in vain in 1812 for moscow city officials to hand over the keys to the kremlin the pairings and comments of government officials today reflected their political battles the president joined forces with prime minister viktor s chernomyrdin , defense minister pavel grachev and the mayor of moscow , yuri m luzhkov , all political allies mr yeltsin said a package of decrees to shuffle the government and speed up reform would be ready for publication immediately after the holiday to reflect the results of an april 25 referendum , in which a majority of voters supported the president as the president left the complex at poklonnaya hill , one veteran lunged at him , yelling , judas ! he was quickly restrained separate wreathlaying vice president aleksandr v rutskoi laid his wreaths separately from mr yeltsin but alongside two fellow rivals of the president , the chairman of the legislature , ruslan i khasbulatov , and the chairman of the constitutional court , valery d zorkin mr rutskoi declared that the leadership s unwillingness to seek compromise in a heterogeneous society such as ours may lead to tragic consequences reports from across the former soviet union said hundreds of thousands of exsoviet citizens celebrated victory day much as they had in past years , as the one universally acknowledged achievement of their difficult history in kiev , dushanbe , yerevan , kishinev and countless other cities in russia and the 14 other former soviet republics , veterans gathered once again to sing the old war songs , accept daffodils from grandchildren , don their clanging medals and bask in the fading glow of that victory 48 years ago those who wanted no part of marches or politics in moscow went as usual to gorky park , where they gathered under handprinted signs identifying their units about 20 million soviet citizens died in the war the only mishap reported today was in the city of nizhny tagil in russia , where a small plane performing a stunt meant as entertainment crashed into the crowd , killing the pilot and at least 14 observers
east rutherford , nj as soon as rodney hampton arrived in the giants' locker room after yesterday s 2010 victory over the los angeles rams , the 24yearold running back learned that he had carried the ball 41 times i jumped in an ice bucket , he was saying now you put your legs in the ice \? somebody said my whole body , he said , smiling i feel good now , but i 'll feel it when i wake up in the morning where \? he was asked all over , he said on the sideline at a national football league game , the sound of the collision between a running back and his tacklers is n't that much different from the sound of a highway fender bender but except for a bandaged knee , rodney hampton s fenders appeared to be as smooth as ever after rushing for 134 yards for the second consecutive game i do n't mind carrying the ball , he said , but i do n't like those hits i got to come up with some new dances to make those guys miss but the more times a running back carries the ball , the more hits he has to endure that s the price a running back must pay even with a threeyear 69 million contract , even at a solid 230 pounds on his muscular 5foot11inch body , it s a heavy price it s also the risk that a coach takes in exposing his best running back to that many hits hampton had 29 carries , his previous high , a week earlier yesterday only two other giant runners , dave meggett and jarrod bunch , carried the ball , each twice for a total of only 11 yards but when a coach has a running back as elusive as hampton , as dan reeves does , he tends to call plays for him especially to run out the clock , as hampton did with 11 carries for 21 net yards in the last 6 minutes to approach butch woolfolk s club record of 43 carries , set in 1983 rodney gets stronger as the game goes along , the giants coach said stronger in a sense , perhaps , and also more susceptible to a fender bender but in his 12 seasons as the denver broncos coach , reeves had running backs such as sammy winder , bobby humphrey and an aging tony dorsett , none of whom were as young and gifted as hampton is one reason why reeves has entrusted the running game to hampton in the giants' 30 start i never had someone as big and as good as rodney , the coach said i never had an offensive line that matches up physically as our guys do , that moves the other people off the line of scrimmage not that hampton is going to carry the ball 41 times every week but if the giants are going to endure late in the season as a super bowl playoff contender , they will need hampton at his healthiest , not at his sorest and returning to the playoffs is what motivates hampton now the rushing title would be nice , he said , but i want to get back to the playoffs when the giants won super bowl xxv , hampton was on crutches after having suffered a broken leg in their playoff opener against the chicago bears that provoked questions about the durability of his legs , but he rushed for 1 , 059 yards in 1991 and 1 , 141 last season and with 344 yards already this season , he s on his way to another 1 , 000yard season and is a threat to dethrone emmitt smith of the dallas cowboys as the nfl rushing champion seeing rodney scampering down the field , left guard william roberts said , is like seeing the little rabbit in the energizer commercial he keeps going and going in only his fourth season , hampton has already rushed for 2 , 999 yards , seventh on the giants' career list and more than halfway to the club record of 5 , 296 yards , held by joe morris if he were to win the rushing title , he would be the first giant to accomplish that since eddie price in 1951 and only the fourth in nfl history bill paschal did it in both 1943 and 1944 , and tuffy leemans in 1936 rodney s the overlooked back in the league , quarterback phil simms said he never looks tired he s a running back who s built to carry the ball it s a good thing he is , because dan s going to try it hampton also caught three of simms s passes yesterday , including one for a 37yard gain , his longest as a receiver simms completed 21 of 27 for 217 yards to eight different receivers as the giants maintained their share of the nfc east lead with the philadelphia eagles but after next sunday s bye , the giants enter the second stage of their schedule at buffalo in a sunday night game , at washington , then return to giants stadium against the eagles before another bye week those three games will provide a better idea of how good these giants really are in sweeping the chicago bears , the tampa bay bucs and the rams , three of the nfl s lesser teams , the giants have displayed a determined defense and a balanced offense despite the imbalance on hampton s use in the running game but if rodney hampton keeps carrying the ball so often , sooner or later he 'll be in a fender bender
detroit , june 19 a jury that took two painstaking weeks to assemble will have to decide whether the fatal beating of a black motorist was a wild exercise of raw power by the police or the action of committed officers confronted by a struggling man in a highcrime area as opening arguments began friday in the trial of three white former officers , many people here wonder whether what happens inside the courtroom will ignite an explosion in the streets the trial is expected to last six to eight weeks live gaveltogavel television coverage is planned , and extra security has been added the first witnesses are expected to testify monday two of the defendants are accused of seconddegree murder in the beating death of the motorist , malice green , a 35yearold unemployed steelworker a third is charged with assault in the beating in a curbside confrontation on a clear november night last year the incident has haunted detroit for seven months and led to the country s third racially charged trial this year involving police officers accused of abusing a black motorist , after those in los angeles and orlando , fla tense relationship like those trials , the detroit case , known in local newspaper headlines as the deadly encounter or the fatal force case , grows out of the often tense relationship between lawenforcement officials and black and other minority residents in the country s inner cities two juries , one for former officer walter budzyn and one for former officer larry nevers , will hear testimony at the same time , seated a few feet apart in courtroom 402 originally , the men were to be tried by one jury , but mr budzyn s lawyer , michael batchelor , asked for a separate trial , asserting that the defense of the former partners could be antagonistic , as each defendant tried to blame the other to save time and money , the judge in the case , george crockett 3d , decided to try the men together with with a double jury , a fairly common practice in michigan the panels will hear prosecution witnesses together , but jurors will be taken out of the courtroom during proceedings that do not involve the defendant whose fate they will decide of the 32 jurors and alternates , 26 are black , as are about 70 percent of the people in detroit the third defendant , former officer robert lessnau , has requested a bench trial , and his fate will be decided by judge crockett officials moved fast seven months ago , as word of the fatal beating spread , detroit officials moved quickly to calm the tension the mayor , coleman a young , said he was shocked and sickened by what he called a murder by the police eleven days after the beating , mr budzyn , 47 , and mr nevers , 52 , were charged with seconddegree murder , and in middecember they were dismissed by the police department mr lessnau , 33 , was also dismissed and charged with assault with intent to do great bodily harm four other officers , including a black sergeant , were suspended the incident began shortly after 10 pm on nov 5 , when mr green was stopped by two plainclothes police officers , mr budzyn and mr nevers , in front of a suspected drug house on the city s west side the officers , on the lookout for an armedrobbery suspect driving a red car , ordered mr green to show his driver s license halfway out of the car , he leaned over to the glove compartment and apparently had something in his hand the officers told him to unclench his fist and then started to beat him with their fists and heavy metal flashlights mr green was pulled out of the car , and the beating continued as two emergency medical service crews and several more police officers , including mr lessnau , arrived on the scene compared to relay team the prosecutor , mr baker , said mr green did not struggle , even as the two officers took turns beating him mr baker likened the beating to a relay team handing off a baton at this point , he said , mr green is massively injured blood is literally streaming from his head , through his hair and down into the street , where literally a puddle is formed mr baker said that mr budzyn struck first and that when he was winded mr nevers took over but the only people to see mr budzyn hit mr green were residents and customers of the drug house , and mr batchelor told the jury that none of them have said they saw mr budzyn strike mr green in the head by the time mr nevers began beating mr green , an ambulance had arrived one driver was so shaken by what he witnessed , mr baker said , that he retreated to the back of his vehicle to compose himself then mr lessnau arrived and at one point kicked mr green in the head while he was handcuffed on the street within 15 minutes of the beating , mr baker said , mr green died from at least 14 blows to the head mr nevers s lawyer , john goldpaugh , hinted that he would challenge the cause of death because mr green had cocaine in his system when he died while the death of mr green has not caused any disturbances in detroit , the rev wendell anthony , the president of the city s naacp branch , said he believed that a lot of anger was just below the surface marvetta davis , who lived near where mr green died and has now joined the justice for malice green coalition , sees the trial as a test of the justice system police violence happens every day in the black community , she said it s the normal thing if these cops get convicted , it will be history because they always get away with everything
metuchen the art scene continues uncertain , yet the new galleries keep coming phoenix group , at 247 main street here , is the third one to be visited by this reviewer in as many months and a snappy setup it is , too , installed in the ground floor of a clapboard house , complete with ultra era white interior , polished wood floors and , in back , space to park three or four cars for its second show , phoenix has come up with portraits '93 , a selection of paintings , drawings , photographs and sculptures by seven artists not all are likenesses in the conventional sense , and several predate 1993 no matter the interest is in the way the dealers , kathie mukaida and larry jones , have tried to blend different approaches to the task of portraiture at one end of the spectrum is the photographic realism of edward jones , whose background includes achievements as both a portraitist and a medical illustrator mr jones paints himself larger than life , looking part outdoorsman and part artist with paint on his clothes when focusing on the other model , a grayhaired man with head turned toward the viewer , the artist cuts down on his ambition , concentrating on the face with its blue eyes and weathered complexion , and he does a better job less photographic but no less realistic are elizabeth lombardi s large watercolors of seated women a former student of oskar kokoschka s , ms lombardi inherits some of the austrian expressionist s interest in kaleidoscopic color but none of his concern with character still , these likenesses painted in translucent hues laid on in patches like flower petals are convincing in rena segal s bigger than lifesize images of two grandparents , who give the impression of being emigres , the artist is an observant draftsman she catches crucial details like the asymmetry of the woman s jaw and the ruminative expression on the face of the man , sitting wreathed in cigarette smoke and wearing a hat as a painter , ms segal is less than expert , dragging the pigment hesitantly across the canvas when not brushing it on crudely , as in the crimson shirts worn by both parties she also adds headlights rather than highlights to the eyes there are lights aplenty reflected in the eyes of william vandever s models , but the photographer also focuses on tone and texture in his two blackandwhite prints in the study of a young man holding up his hands as if in prayer , the emphasis is on hair and beard in the one of a young woman in a sari , it is on the contrasts between silky white fabric , smooth dark skin and the matte black background mr vandever s verisimilitude is as calculated in portraiture as it is in his still lifes enter jacob landau , with a large , posterlike design in purple , yellow and brown on a white ground that celebrates the struggle of john brown , together with blackandwhite woodcuts of lincoln and mark twain this is the kind of polished work for which mr landau has long been known so , too , are the more intimate sketches of linus pauling and other notables that were drawn from life in , variously , black , sanguine and bister crayon these images , produced some years ago , when the artist was at a pacem in terris conference in europe , act here as a watershed between academicism on the one hand , and , on the other , the expressiveness of the two remaining artists , james andrew brown and lorenzo pace whether working in black chalk , ink wash or color laid on in small strokes and scored with scratches , mr brown packs a big punch , as he does with his sculpture still , he is at his best when compressing his energy , as in the small painted heads andrew glares out at the viewer framed by an ellipse of black andre leans back , a green visage with slits for eyes in a field of similar green the best , however , is black face , reproduced on this page , which is no more than a shape like a horned mask in gray wash mr pace stands at the far end of the spectrum , weighing in with three sculptures , one an african mask made of found wood a squarish shape with knobs and rims that , painted white , do duty for eyes and nose the face surmounts a chiseled body , like an overgrown peanut , and has arms suggested by a flat , inverted u of wood painted black , and the whole assemblage is crowned by a pair of long cane antennae painted scarlet with lucy , as this piece is titled , and with a selfportrait that s a triangular chunk of wood attached to a strip of splint basketry , mr pace achieves a mix of dry humor and menace the other assemblage of a painted dummy s head veiled with coarse woven fabric and set within a 19thcentury picture frame is less successful the show is worth visiting if only to see seven artists who have never shown together before and probably never will again it suggests , however , that the gallery needs a curatorial policy as professional as its premises then again , rome was not built in a day meanwhile , the show remains on view through may 7 , and the gallery is open monday through friday , by appointment only the telephone number is \( 908 \) 9061999 photo black face , by james andrew brown , is in an exhibition at the phoenix group , a new gallery in metuchen \( phoenix group \)
jerusalem , march 6 for many months they held center stage in united statesisraeli relations , becoming a barometer of how the countries were getting along president george bush withheld them from israel to punish one prime minister , yitzhak shamir , then handed them as a reward to a triumphant new leader , yitzhak rabin now , with political squabbles set aside , israel is about to go to market using the muchdisputed american loan guarantees , which will make it easier for this country to borrow up to 10 billion over the next five years to help generate jobs for a large influx of new immigrants the first 1 billion in these americanbacked loans are expected within a month , and finance minister avraham shohat says they will be used for telecommunications , power generation , roads and other infrastructure improvements while the united states is not putting up its own money only its assurance that it will cover bad debts should the israelis default it will closely monitor how the borrowed cash is spent most of all , american officials say , they want to be sure that none of it winds up in the occupied west bank and gaza strip , as washington believes was the case under mr shamir two years ago with a smaller batch of americanguaranteed loans 'under a microscope' mr shohat has reportedly acknowledged to american jewish leaders that israel s spending habits will be under a microscope for quite a while loan guarantees aside , questions have arisen about how much longer israelis can count on the substantial amount of regular american aid 3 billion a year that their leaders have come to expect as their due in recent weeks , they have heard fresh american warnings that while the aid looks safe for 1994 , they had better not take it for granted in following years the commitment of the american government and people to israel is not in question , now or in the future , william c harrop , the united states ambassador to israel , said on thursday but it may prove difficult to maintain our economic aid at its current high level on friday , the state department distanced itself from mr harrop s remarks , saying that he was not speaking on instructions from washington nonetheless , the ambassador merely echoed what the israelis had already heard from others , including members of congress the 3 billion a year amounts to 8 percent of israel s government budget and 5 percent of its gross national product , but israelis disagree among themselves about how indispensable that total is rabin to meet clinton not vital at all , say some , conspicuously rightists who argue that the less that israel depends on washington s largesse , the less vulnerable it will be to american pressure to give up settlement activity and land in the territories but that is not the view of the present government , and when mr rabin leaves next week for the united states and a first meeting with president clinton , one of his priorities will be to nail down existing aid levels a few weeks ago , staging the equivalent of a preemptive strike to protect the assistance , the prime minister said israel is entitled , more than entitled to the 3 billion it has been getting since the mid1980 s joining the refrain , foreign minister shimon peres said inflation had cut the value of the aid package by about onethird over the years moreover , israeli officials note that relatively little of this money ends up in government coffers of the total , 12 billion is considered economic aid , but it goes right back to washington to repay old israeli debts for military purchases of the 18 billion in military aid , more than 70 percent must be spent on united statesmade equipment and weapons , and thus , the israelis argue , it helps create american jobs even so , some israelis and their american jewish supporters acknowledge that talk about israel s entitlement may not sit well in washington at a time when foreign aid is unpopular and other countries also demand american attention israel , the largest single recipient , accounts for 20 percent of the total foreignaid budget , and even a supporter like senator daniel k inouye , democrat of hawaii , has warned against thinking it will go on forever on a recent visit , mr inouye proposed new forms of assistance , like an americanisraeli project to expand the port of haifa so united states warships in the mediterranean could berth there for maintenance and repairs favorable terms given questions about israeli dependence on washington also extend to the loan guarantees , which provide israel favorable bank terms that it probably would not receive on its own 30year borrowing , low interest rates and no repayment of the principal for the first 10 years the terms are so good that mr shohat recently asked the israel bonds organization , which had raised a record 12 billion worldwide last year , to scale back its own more costly borrowing by about 20 percent but the israel bonds president , meir rosenne , argues that unlike the case with the money he raises , there are strings attached to the american loan guarantees in future installments , the united states could deduct spending in the territories that it considers unacceptable , and theoretically mr clinton can scrap the guarantees entirely at any point , even out of dissatisfaction with israel s economic performance while the new administration is considered a friend here , somber possibilities were brought home when ambassador harrop observed that the pace of economic change has been slow , in fact rather disappointing
fernandomania is only a memory in los angeles , but the mexican mesmerizer has resurfaced in baltimore fernando valenzuela does not wear a cape and he does not carve his mark on the walls of opposing dugouts but he does leave his mark on opposing batters he s got us mesmerized , said tom kelly , manager of the minnesota twins , who were victimized by valenzuela twice in six days this month he s got this mystique about the screwball , and i think a lot of hitters are caught up with it the valenzuela screwball claimed a lot of victims in the pitcher s 10 seasons with the los angeles dodgers , but he and it were given up for baseball dead when first the dodgers and then the california angels released him in 1991 now , after a season in the mexican league and a change of coasts , valenzuela has become one of the pleasant surprises of the season a hot streak scheduled to pitch against the blue jays in toronto tonight , valenzuela takes into the game a stretch of five starts in which he has won four times , lost none and allowed three runs in 41 2 3 innings for an earned run average of 065 the streak , which began with a sixhit shutout of the blue jays on june 30 , has improved his record from 27 to 67 and reduced his era from 479 to 334 , matching his career mark it s just regular pitching , valenzuela said yesterday by telephone from toronto , offering his explanation for his strong comeback when i played for the dodgers , i liked to pitch a lot that s been happening here i'm pitching a lot and my arm feels better i have more consistent location with all my stuff location means a lot i use two spots , inside and outside , and that helps me do a little better it makes it tough for hitters to adjust they do n't know which side i'm going to throw the ball on 'he jams you up' what the 32yearold lefthander has done , besides regaining a healthy left shoulder and mastery of his pitches through a correction in his pitching mechanics , is outwit the hitters we watched tapes over and over , said kelly , whose twins were limited to three runs in two completegame efforts the screwballs are all balls they keep looking for the screwball and worrying about it , but there s no need to worry about that pitch it s rarely a strike it s a showtype pitch it acts like a changeup he uses it as an offspeed pitch to keep you off balance the hitters get caught up with the aura of the screwball then he throws a little cut fastball inside to righthanders and he jams you up a lot of guys hit weak dribblers there are n't a lot of balls hit solidly dick bosman , the orioles' pitching coach , who teaches the cut fastball , described the pitch as one that looks like a fastball but suddenly breaks 6 to 8 inches , like a slider but bosman nearly did n't get to work with valenzuela i thought i had a deal with san francisco , richard moss , valenzuela s agent , related i talked with bob quinn , and he seemed to be very interested he asked if fernando and dusty baker could talk by phone directly they did , and they had a great conversation i thought we had a deal , but at the last minute , the giants backed off moss went to the orioles' camp and met with their general manager , roland hemond i thought baltimore might be the least likely place for fernando , moss said he likes to hit and could n't in the american league , and he draws people and baltimore is sold out for the year but hemond long has had a fondness for mexican pitchers as general manager of the chicago white sox , he had salome barojas , francisco barrios and cecilio acosta , and last year he almost got armando reynoso from the atlanta braves so when moss went to see hemond the next day , they reached agreement on a minor league contract that guaranteed valenzuela no money and no job base salary and incentives the veteran had to make the club to get a major league contract , and he went out and dazzled teams throughout florida with his effective pitching his reward was a job and his smallest major league salary since his early years valenzuela , who 10 years ago gained the first 1 million salary in salary arbitration , has a base salary of 250 , 000 and incentive clauses calling for bonuses based on number of starts with his start tonight , he will have earned 200 , 000 in bonuses , and he can earn an additional 200 , 000 because he had a poor first game and the team had enough open dates that they did n't need a fifth starter , the orioles asked him to pitch in the minor leagues for a couple of weeks in april not many veterans would have accepted the assignment , doug melvin , the orioles' assistant general manager , said but he said , 'if it will help me and the organization , i 'll do it' he was very appreciative that we had shown confidence in giving him the opportunity to pitch in the majors again valenzuela , who has a 147125 career record , explained that he understood what the orioles were trying to do and that it would be good for him i like to work a lot , he said i like to pitch to feel good and to make my arm feel strong in april , i do n't pitch that good i do n't have the location my arm does n't feel strong enough to put the ball in places i want the reason was i had n't been pitching that much in 1991 , i played in the minor leagues i do n't think there s anything wrong with that if that helps , i 'll go anywhere that s why valenzuela was willing to pitch in the mexican league last year fernando really did n't think he was ready to pitch in the majors , moss said that s why he played in the mexican winter league , too by the end , he said he s ready he did n't want to push it until he thought he was back now that he is back , the orioles say they believe he can continue the type of pitching he has exhibited i see the quality of his stuff , i see location , i see consistency , bosman said i see where he s able to go out and repeat things , come back the next start and do the same i expect that will continue he knows how to go about maintaining a long streak he s done it before there s something to be said for maintaining the concentration , the tunnel vision you need to keep doing it photo the return of fernando valenzuela , now with the baltimore orioles , is one of the more surprising stories this baseball season \( associated press \)
chicago , april 10 dusk had just slipped into darkness on a recent night when a man parking his car was shot during a robbery and left bleeding in a vacant lot minutes later , flashing blue police lights drew a crowd , and among the onlookers was marcus tramble , a lanky 19yearold who lives just down the street marcus did not watch long seeing the wounded stranger filled him with dread and anger , and he walked away , shaken that could have been me lying in that mud , he said later you got to watch your back all the time there s never no time to rest but you adapt to it or you die that s the law of the street dying young marcus tramble , an urban survivalist , follows that law as closely as he can for years his daily decisions have been governed by his fear of dying young , another victim of the violence that hovers over his world there are places he will not go , clothes he will not wear , words he will not say and feelings he will not let out stay away from that street corner it s a crack dealer s hangout do n't wear a baseball cap cocked the wrong way it can be gang symbol and a magnet for violence never say anything , even in jest , that can be taken as an insult retribution can be deadly but some things marcus cannot control his skin color , his size , his youth when he looks into the mirror he sees not a monster or a mugger but a slender brownskinned teenager , 6 feet 3 inches tall , with hair cropped close on the sides and a smile that breaks out more easily than these mean streets would seem to warrant when he goes out , though , marcus feels accused of a crime he knows nothing about white strangers with their hostile stares and nervous glances seem to fear he will pounce at any minute even some fellow blacks , he says , see him not as a son or a brother but as a threat the 'white' world nearby just trying to stay alive takes so much of his concentration , marcus says , that he can hardly think about the future he dropped out of high school in the 11th grade , a source of friction between him and his mother he says he will go back after he works for a while and contributes something to his family he has applied for jobs as a messenger and a dockworker but has not had an offer frustration is worming its way into his soul on the occasions when marcus looks for work or fun in the loop , chicago s downtown , his mother tells him he would be treated better if he dressed more white , says marcus , who favors the hiphop uniform of baggy jeans , hooded sweat shirts and hightop sneakers his mother , julia tramble , said , i tell my sons that they want to fit in , that they want to ease into the white world with as little friction as possible but marcus s world is his south side neighborhood , washington park , where dressing more white will make him stand out , not fit in standing out is something marcus says he cannot afford to do growing up , fighting was an almost daily part of life , as common as learning to ride a bike , stealing a first kiss or holding back the tears at the wake of a friend he remembers when he was in grade school and his family moved to the city housing project where he lives now , a 16story building with what marcus calls cages of wire mesh on the balconies new to the neighborhood , he had to prove himself regularly , in fistfights and shouting matches what not to do now he fits in and has earned a measure of respect he is not about to change that by trying to adapt to the downtown world he says he no longer gets into fights but he also knows that a fight now would end not with fists but with a gun people wo n't fistfight me , marcus says , almost sadly i'm too big they 'd shoot me , step over my dead body and go about their business much of what marcus knows about the streets he learned by watching older men , men who now are either dead or in jail i learned from their mistakes , he said those lessons are what he calls the sure enoughs of the street never , ever , steal from somebody , especially if they 're rollin' , which means selling drugs never , ever , mess with another brother s woman never , ever , hit someone s mother and never , ever , disrespect somebody respect , he said , is like money you got to have it no respect , no cooperation no cooperation , no money at home a mother of 10 , a father gone julia and eddie tramble , she a clerktypist in a local hospital and he a young vietnam veteran with a wisp of a mustache , were wed in 1967 the marriage lasted 11 rocky years and produced nine children marcus charles tramble , born on nov 8 , 1973 , was the fifth marcus proudly points to his father in a photograph from his parents' wedding , eons ago in the snapshot his father , in a dark suit , looks stern , his posture military stiff i 'd like to find him , marcus said just to see what he looks like now he might think i'm mad at him i'm not i 'd just like to see him the last time marcus saw his daddy , eddie tramble was drawing on a napkin and sipping a can of beer marcus was a little boy , a shorty , and he begged his father for a sip when his mother turned away , his father handed him the can and marcus took a big swallow he felt as close to his father that moment as he ever has but later the beer made marcus vomit it was his mother who comforted him his father had gone out the bitter taste has lingered over all these years of absence mrs tramble , 49 years old and tall and thin like marcus , says she has reared her children mostly by herself and with god s help , not with much from marcus s father , even before their divorce
to the editor new jersey slump gogo suburbs went \( front page , may 20 \) deals extensively with the symptoms , but relegates the cause to one startling statistic buried deep in the article that new jersey has lost 200 , 000 jobs since 1989 , and 130 , 000 of the losses were in manufacturing the plight of new jersey is also the plight of the united states economy we have lost more than three million manufacturing jobs since 1979 , and manufacturing s share of total employment has fallen from 234 percent in 1979 to 166 percent last march manufacturing jobs in new jersey are now outnumbered by government jobs , service sector jobs and the wholesaleretail sector , but the last two pay substantially less than manufacturing and do not compensate for the economic shortfall in lost manufacturing jobs our valuable manufacturing jobs have been systematically exported , particularly to the far east , as our manufacturing industries have been devastated by the drastic influx of imports in 1991 and 1992 , 12 out of 21 manufacturing industries suffered trade deficits , but none as large as our textile and apparel deficit of 292 billion 35 percent of the total united states trade deficit many pundits indicate that the service sector is the key to our economic future we have added 22 million service jobs in the last two decades only to see our standard of living decline in that period we must pay more attention to the importance of manufacturing jobs to our economic health , in new jersey and the nation a study just released by the economic policy institute , employment multipliers in the united states economy , found that the average manufacturing job generates four and a half times as many secondary jobs as the average retail job , and almost three times as many jobs as the personal and business service sector the report states that manufacturing creates an average of 221 additional jobs in supplier industries for every 100 manufacturing jobs that is almost four times the 58 supplier jobs per 100 jobs in personal and business services and more than seven times the figure for retail trade the report also notes the relatively higher wages paid to manufacturing workers for instance , to offset the loss of 100 jobs in apparel manufacturing , 158 new retail jobs are needed based on march 1993 textile and apparel sector employment of 1683 million , that industry is supporting 15 million additional jobs at direct suppliers , plus 230 , 000 government jobs at the local , state and national levels when the wages of textile and apparel industry and direct supplier workers are spent , 14 million more jobs are supported in other words , the welfare of 48 million workers is at stake because of textile and apparel employment factor in the multiplier effect for all other manufacturing sectors , and you begin to understand how crucial it is to keep manufacturing jobs inside our borders manufacturing is a national asset and should be treated as such , before it is too late robert e swift west chester , pa , may 21 , 1993 the writer is executive director of the crafted with pride in usa council
havana his island ever more an island , his scraggly beard gone gray , president fidel castro stands fast against the winds that have blown away most of the communist world , along with its subsidies for cuba and its markets for cuban goods only socialism , only the revolution could absorb the terrible blows that we have received , the 66yearold leader says billboards and signs around the country proclaim the same faith join us and you 'll make it , promises one just outside havana on a wall not far from the havana airport , the faded scrawl says , we have fidel mood of grim sacrifice as the material cost of cuba s isolation grows , however , its mood these days is less one of heroic struggle than grim sacrifice in the long , concreteblock apartment buildings that the revolution built and in the crumbling old havana homes it subdivided for workers' housing , peoples' memories of meat have begun to fade pork , a cuban favorite , cannot be obtained except on the black market , where one pound costs nearly a week s wages for the average person as a beef substitute , a television chef recommends grapefruit steak carefully remove the rind , the recipe goes , season it , cover it with bread crumbs and fry but in search of more solid food , several cubans said they had eaten cats long wait for a bus on weekdays , the capital s stillgracious avenues have become gantlets of blank , sullen stares so many bus routes have been eliminated that the wait for a crosstown ride can take three hours or more not a dilapidated , hungarianmade bus moves that does not spill riders from its doors in trinidad , a quaint colonial town near the center of the island , a woman behind the bus station ticket window allows that the next available reserved seat to havana is on a bus leaving in three months but not to worry , she says , there is a waiting list to get people to their jobs , a million or so bicycles have been brought from china even on major thoroughfares , the workers riding them weave across all lanes of traffic , as though automobiles had never been a concern the cars are , in fact , relatively few from 10 gallons of gasoline some months ago , the monthly rations for most drivers have been cut to about five gallons in december they got none high school students and boiler repairmen can explain this as easily as government economic officials with the collapse of the soviet bloc and its preferential prices for barter trade with the island , cuba s income has fallen precipitously , while the cost of imports like oil has risen sharply in 1992 , officials said , the island took delivery on about 6 million tons of oil , down from 13 million tons in 1989 encouraged by a new trade protocol signed with russia in november , cuban officials said they expected about the same amount of oil in 1993 but in december , they extended electricalpower blackouts in cuba s biggest cities from four hours a day to eight the important state offices and enterprises that earn dollars and are exempted from the outages hotels , tourist restaurants , certain factories flicker like candles in the night at many intersections , the traffic lights dangle lifelessly from power lines television programming has been cut , and even night baseball games have become rare slowly , as the island s imports have fallen by more than threefourths , cherished social achievements of the revolution have also begun to erode in the best hospitals , some medicines are being replaced by herbal remedies chalk , paper and even milk are sometimes scarce in the schools castro maintains a core of support in a society that prides itself on a literacy rate comparable to that of industrialized nations , shipments of new books are so infrequent that a modest book fair in december drew a line nearly three city blocks long many newspapers and magazines have been shut down for lack of newsprint , and the communist party daily , granma , has become precious not only for its news but as a substitute for toilet paper for the first time , the government has acknowledged a modicum of unemployment because of factories shut down and jobs eliminated of about 37 million state workers , they say , slightly more than 100 , 000 now stay at home many more have been sent off to work in the fields foreign economists guess that real unemployment is considerably higher , and that close to half the work force is underemployed still , in hundreds of conversations during a visit of nearly three weeks to the island , it appeared that the government had managed to maintain a substantial , if unmeasurable , core of support even as it was running out of everything from antibiotics to soap and shoes its health and education systems , although badly strained , continue to function and while preserving a system of small rewards and perquisites for its partisans , the government has managed to keep an extremely tight grip on dissent faith that mr castro can restore cuba to even the relative prosperity it enjoyed with annual soviet subsidies that once ranged upwards from 3 billion seemed rare even among cubans supportive of the government but many people said they saw their options unchanged tolerate the hardship or try somehow to leave
unchastened by congress s rebukes for misinterpreting civil rights laws , the supreme court is back in the business of loading up job discrimination cases with extra burdens for those claiming bias on friday the court ruled that an employer could give false explanations for firing a black employee yet still prevail in a lawsuit over the years the courts have worked out procedures and burdens of proof that were fair to both employees and employers a plaintiff s plausible claim of discriminatory firing put the onus on the employer to provide a nonracial reason or lose the case one would think that a phony or incredible explanation would be worse than none at all not according to the 5to4 majority lawyers for melvin hicks , a black prison supervisor in st louis , demolished his employer s excuse for firing him , purportedly a series of rules infractions and a threat against his white superior they showed that white corrections workers were not disciplined for similar or more serious infractions and that mr hicks s boss manufactured the verbal confrontation still , a federal judge ruled that mr hicks failed to prove racial motive he said mr hicks had n't disproved the possibility of personal rather than racial animosity although prison officials never raised such a defense justice antonin scalia s majority said the trial judge was right does this reward lying in court , as justice david souter argued in a biting dissent \? no , said justice scalia the books are full of procedural rules that place the perjurer \( initially , at least \) in a better position than the truthful litigant who makes no response at all perhaps , but in civil rights cases congress and the courts have understood the special needs of plaintiffs biased employers no longer telegraph their motives victims are entitled to rely on the inferences that flow from unbelievable excuses four years ago the court , led by chief justice william rehnquist , handed down a string of similarly grudging , burdensome misreadings of the 1964 civil rights act these rulings provoked a wholesale correction in the form of the civil rights restoration act of 1991 this latest decision , in which the court is again forcing victims of discrimination to refight and rewin old battles , invites another lesson from congress in legal interpretation and fairness
the schoolhouse door segregation s last stand at the university of alabama by e culpepper clark illustrated 305 pp new york oxford university press 25 when integrationists stood up to segregationists in the american south during the 1950 s and 60 s , right confronted wrong , virtue challenged evil , good guys battled bad e culpepper clark , assistant to the president of the university of alabama , has a taste for drama as well as for moral principle and with the desegregation of his own university he had at hand a subject ideally suited to his inclinations and talents the schoolhouse door segregation s last stand at the university of alabama is oldfashioned narrative history , readable , involving , immediate and propelled by a motley cast of characters , each of whom had to make ethical choices that would affect not only his or her own future but also that of the nation as a whole mr clark builds his story around two set pieces autherine lucy s abortive attempt to integrate the university in the mid1950 s and gov george c wallace s lastgasp stand in the schoolhouse door before the institution was finally forced to accept black students in 1963 appropriately , the book begins with a description of one person , pollie anne myers , a feisty 20yearold black woman who decided in 1952 to try to enter the university of alabama and who persuaded her more reserved friend autherine juanita lucy to join her one of the author s key points , against accusations and myths to the contrary , is that the two young women acted on their own , without the support of organizations like the naacp , though of course that support was forthcoming once the university and the state government opted for a strategy of resistance following a long court fight , and after ms myers was denied admission because she had become pregnant while unmarried , ms lucy was obliged in february 1956 to face angry mobs , burning crosses and death threats on her own mr clark s portrait of her during this ordeal is one of steadfast courage and muted dignity this contrasts sharply with the picture of the university s president , oliver cromwell carmichael , a man , as mr clark presents him , whose credentials greatly outweighed his convictions a mild segregationist who had once been chairman of the board of trustees of the new york state university system , carmichael took the wrong turn at every crossroad , ultimately yielding leadership to the hidebound and uncompromising alabama board of trustees the board succeeded in expelling ms lucy less than a month after her arrival on the tuscaloosa campus \( among the virtues of the schoolhouse door is that it offhandedly reminds us just how close we are to the dark ages in 1952 the president of the university threatened not to allow the football team , with bart starr as quarterback , to compete in the orange bowl if its opponent , syracuse university , fielded any of its black players a decade later the state s governor commissioned a study from a north carolina professor of embryology that concluded blacks were mentally 200 , 000 years behind whites \) it was n't until 1963 that blacks were able to breach the university s wall of obstruction and intimidation that year james hood and vivian malone came to alabama s main campus at tuscaloosa and dave mcglathery enrolled at the huntsville extension center yet if autherine lucy and the hapless oliver carmichael are the major actors in the first part of the schoolhouse door , the dominant role in the second part belongs to none of the campus figures but to the man who physically tried to block the path of the tuscaloosa students george corley wallace indeed , as mr clark makes clear , the show was governor wallace s from beginning to end integration could not be averted in 1963 the courts , the kennedy administration , even leading elements of alabamian society were behind it the university itself was resigned to the change mr wallace , however , needed to make a public display of resistance he was , in mr clark s words , as thoroughgoing a racist as the civil rights movement could have invented he was also extraordinarily ambitious , with his eyes on the white house , a person who lived politics with an intensity that made the kennedys appear diffident mr wallace had been elected governor the previous year on a pledge to reject integration , even to the point of standing in the schoolhouse door , if necessary , and he meant to be as good as his word though he knew his confrontation with the federal government was nothing more than an exercise in symbolism , theater pure and simple , he was determined to follow his script through to the end in the short run , this story has a happy ending after reading a statement of defiance , governor wallace stepped aside and the university of alabama was integrated without violence in 1965 it graduated its first black , vivian malone , and by 1966 it had 400 black students \( last year autherine lucy foster , the wife of the rev hugh lawrence foster and the mother of four , received a master s degree in education from the university and had an endowed scholarship named in her honor \) but from a different , and larger , perspective , the results have not been so fortunate governor wallace s stand catapulted him into nationwide prominence and enabled him to run for president three times he introduced southern racial politics \( usually encoded \) into the national mainstream , helping to poison public debate , redirect party strategies and exacerbate social tensions as mr clark says , of those who went through the university s ordeal of desegregation , none profited more than george wallace sadly , we are still living with his legacy

rockwall , tex maybe you 've never heard of jack lazorko , the 37yearold righthanded pitcher who is as compact as a tugboat and is called il bulldog in italy , el bulldog in latin america and zork in the states maybe you 've never seen him play , his dark brows over intense hazel eyes , armed with an assortment of pitches from forkballs to knuckle curves to sliders to fastballs that dip and fastballs that rise none of which will blow anyone away , as he describes it , but all of which are invariably around the plate and always carry a purpose while he is hardly a household name , fans in hundreds of the most unlikely towns around the world plus a legion of people in baseball from players to executives knows him , or of him after all , he played for or with or against many of those in baseball maybe most of them sometimes , he said , it feels like all of them few baseball careers have been anything like jack lazorko s , who was born in hoboken , nj , and grew up in river edge to the north , and who has called so many places home since then that , he says , he has singlehandedly kept map makers in business maybe you have n't followed his career for the past 16 years , as he played for nine major league organizations and 17 of their teams , and maybe a dozen more teams in the caribbean and mexico and south america and europe this year alone , he has worn the uniform of the yankees \( in spring training \) and of the norfolk tides , the mets' class aaa team when a call was made recently to the tides' executive office , it was asked whether jack lazorko was there not anymore , came the reply gone after seven games it is , in a nutshell , the story of jack thomas lazorko s baseball life i 've been released by more teams in more leagues in more countries and in more languages than anyone in the history of baseball , lazorko said one day last week and i'm the only man to have been released by both the mets and the yankees in the same year within four months ! he shakes his head and smiles wryly unbelievable unbelievable because , as he said recently at his home here , i always seem to be the 11th man on a 10man pitching staff he is currently unemployed again but that could change tomorrow or the next day he is ready he says he has learned to pack in 10 minutes , and that s for a sixmonth trip , if necessary he asks two questions of his new team what color spikes do you wear \?

for security reasons , the italian national soccer team has chosen a prep school and a small , isolated hotel in new jersey for its base camp during next summer s world cup it s not terrorists that the italians want to be protected against , it s their own fans local organizers offered princeton and rutgers universities as training sites , among others , and the new york city area offers some of the world s most lavish hotels no thanks , the italians said they chose instead to train at the pingry school in martinsville , nj , and took all 110 rooms at the somerset hills hotel in warren , setting up camp some 45 minutes from giants stadium , where the azzurri , as they are called , will play two firstround games arrigo sacchi , coach of the italian national team , wanted a small hotel that would be secluded from obsessive fans both those who live in the new york area and those who will travel to the world cup from abroad at home , the italian fans are known as tifosi , or carriers of typhoid , for their feverish support of the azzurri and the food s good , too he felt they would be inundated with autograph seekers , and that fans would check into the hotel just to be near their heroes , charlie stillitano , director of the giants stadium venue , said of sacchi they got what they wanted privacy , security and a small , charming hotel with an italian chef ireland s soccer officials also toured potential training sites yesterday norway team officials arrived in late afternoon , and moroccan and saudi arabian officials are also expected to tour the venue this week , finalizing plans for a training site and securing hotel rooms italy and ireland will play on june 18 at giants stadium in the most eagerly anticipated matchup of the first round italy will play its second game at giants stadium against norway on june 23 ireland will face norway at the stadium on june 28 the other firstround matchup at giants stadium will pit morocco against saudi arabia on june 25 may stay for a month the italians are scheduled to arrive on june 6 , and , if they continue to win , could be bivouacked at giants stadium through the semifinals on july 13 the final will be played at the rose bowl in pasadena , calif , on july 17 sacchi said that the italians had scheduled a friendly match against japan for june 11 at giants stadium , but plans have not yet been finalized the americans , meanwhile , were based in los angeles , to no one s surprise the united states training camp is in mission viejo , calif , a mere 35 miles from the rose bowl team usa will get early looks at two of its firstround opponents , switzerland and colombia a tuneup match with switzerland is scheduled for jan 22 at fullerton , calif colombia , one of the tournament favorites , will face the americans in a fourteam tournament in miami from feb 1820 no favors for us the draw did not appear to be in the united states' favor switzerland defeated and tied italy in the qualifying round , while colombia shocked argentina , 50 , in buenos aires romania , the other team in the group , is sprinkled with players from the italian league but one american , defender alexi lalas , would hear none of the doomandgloom predictions it might be the toughest group , but we 're a tough team , lalas said we can beat all three of them first , though , american fans will have to be notified that the world cup is coming according to a poll by fifa , soccer s world governing body , only 35 percent of americans are aware that the world cup will be played here next summer another recent poll had the number at a meager 13 percent we 're here to launch soccer , said fifa s president , joao havelange of brazil , when told of the 13percent poll this represents 30 million people that s a very large number to begin with we feel the world cup will be a large success and demonstrate to the united states the value of our game
saintnomlabreteche , france they tried to play a regular golf tournament here last weekend , but the ryder cup kept breaking out who really cared whether the greens were soggy or whether ian woosnam came up with a magnificent firstday eagle on the 16th what mattered more was finding out who was going to be paired with whom on friday against the americans at the belfry nothing new about this , said colin montgomerie , one of nine members of the european team to compete in the lancome trophy here since we started qualifying in september , every tournament and every person that wins a tournament , the word ryder gets mentioned such unflagging emphasis on the biennial , intercontinental competition with the united states has not been to everyone s liking on this side of the atlantic last month , ronan rafferty of northern ireland , in the midst of a fight to qualify for the team , curled his lip and claimed , people are very bored with the ryder cup , and so am i count rafferty out it is perhaps unnecessary to report that after rafferty failed to qualify , he was not among those graced with a wild card by bernard gallacher , the european captain those three spots went to joakim haeggman of sweden and two very familiar spaniards , jose maria olazabal and seve ballesteros olazabal and ballesteros , both ryder cup stalwarts , have often treated their american counterparts like the bulls treat pamplona tourists in 12 matches together , they have lost only once and have never lost in foursomes , in which teammates alternate shots but neither player has won a tournament since march 1992 , and both have struggled this season olazabal reportedly toyed with withdrawing his name from contention ballesteros , the favorite to be named captain after gallacher steps down this year , never considered that option back in dashing form after missing three weeks in august because of bronchitis , ballesteros did a fine impersonation of his former dashing , scrambling self and finished second in the canon european masters in early september ballesteros credits his surge to working with simon holmes , a former david leadbetter disciple , and to following his own advice in his 1988 book , natural golf i looked at some pictures of my swing back when that book was published and noticed that i had flattened my swing out a bit since i was at my peak , ballesteros said i'm trying to go back to a little more upright swing i always felt it was only a matter of time for me to correct some technical points and regain my confidence it s coming at a very good time on the eve of the ryder cup the timing is not quite so perfect for bernhard langer , the formidable german who has been sidelined for the last three weeks because of a neck injury that has bothered him since the united states open in june langer , for those who need reminding , was the principal protagonist in the 1991 ryder cup thriller at the ocean course in kiawah island , sc the europeans came into that match with undisputed and often exercised bragging rights , having won the cup at the belfry in 1985 and successfully defended it in 1987 and 1989 as the americans routinely fell apart in bestball competition and on the final hole but this time , langer cracked under the snowballing pressure on the final hole of his decisive singles match against hale irwin , langer needed to sink a sixfoot putt to tie the overall score at 14 and allow europe to retain the cup langer missed and walked away in tears handled like a real pro a defeat like that can ruin a golf career , but langer roared back the next week to win the german masters in a playoff no one could have handled that situation better than bernhard , ballesteros said but i think an important distinction needs to be made none of us on the team feel that bernhard missed the putt he just did n't hole it langer has holed more than his share of putts this year , winning that other masters \( the one in augusta , ga \) for the second time along with the european pga championship and german open but the week after his victory in germany , he had to withdraw midway through the first round of the european masters because the neck injury was severely hampering his backswing and causing him considerable pain on his longiron shots the pain since has moved down into his left shoulder , but his teammates still expect langer to be fit enough to play at the belfry , the watery course in the english midlands where his team has yet to lose a decision will be made on wednesday , after langer has had a chance to practice european twist if langer plays , he will help form the most genuinely european team since the americans' ryder cup opposition expanded beyond britain and ireland in 1979 haeggman will be the first swede to play constantino rocca the first italian rocca , a squat 36yearold who likes a cigarette between shots , spent eight years working in a polystyrene factory in bergamo before turning professional in 1981 he lost his european tour card on four occasions before finally breaking into the top 50 in 1990 this year , he has won twice alberto tomba is still more popular than me , rocca said golf in italy has a long way to go the europeans' other ryder cup rookies are the englishmen barry lane and peter baker the rest of the european team should look more familiar , including nick faldo , the world s topranked player , sam torrance , mark james , montgomerie and woosnam , who is 05 in ryder cup in singles matches but playing very well thanks to a new putting stance and new association with the psychologist john allsop i think i 've just put myself under too much pressure before because i wanted to win so much for my mates , woosnam said now , i 've just got to try to play for myself , for my personal pride hopefully , it will help to think of it that way it s all about pride team pride , of course , will remain the rule at the belfry , where for three days , the usually wellcompensated stars of international golf are offered only expense money and a chance to gather in triumph around a small , tasteful trophy when the europeans controlled that piece of silverware from 1985 to 1991 , there was considerable talk about their tour s supremacy but the americans are the ones holding the cup now , and though the mood in these parts is still confident , the resolutely superior tone is missing at least it was missing last week you can say that i think we 'll win , james said but i think both sides should admit these days that either side can win it at either venue neither tour has an edge it s just a question of who s right on the day

farmington , conn in a perfect world , elevators would never do those irritating things elevators do , such as coming late or not at all or stopping at every floor between here and there or suddenly slamming their doors on a passenger who has been a nanosecond too slow , or generously opening their doors to show a wouldbe rider an elevator packed tighter than a broadway local subway car at rush hour but this is an imperfect world , and that is why bruce a powell , john s kendall and david j sirag labor for the otis elevator company in the rolling hills of central connecticut , using various forms of artificial intelligence technologies and disciplines with odd names like fuzzy logic and neural networks to improve the relationship between humankind and its elevators the first otis elevator system incorporating such technology is now being installed in osaka , japan , at the 28story hyatt regency osaka hotel , which is to open next year the system will be able to handle more people with less waiting time than other elevators , the otis researchers say with the sophistication of the new artificial intelligence , and with better processors , these elevators can process a lot more information , said mr kendall , director of advanced research at otis , a division of the united technologies corporation they 're learning mr powell , principal research engineer for otis , said the goal was to keep people moving we 're unhappy when someone waits more than 30 seconds , and we like to have waiting times average no longer than 20 seconds , he said and , ideally , nobody waits longer than 90 seconds one of otis s most promising technologies works on fuzzy logic instead of traditional logic , with crisp distinctions , such as true or false , that lead to the typical precise computer decisionmaking , fuzzy logic can be programmed to suggest that something is more true or more false take , for example , calling an elevator to the 6th floor of a 12story building the elevator control system has two choices send car a , which is on the 9th floor with three passengers heading for the lobby , or send car b , on the 11th floor with no passengers the very naive approach , and one that s taken by the older systems , is to send the closest elevator , mr powell said , but that means a delay for the riders in the ninthfloor car thus , the researchers say , it is better to avoid the crisp question which car will get there fastest \? and try a fuzzy approach in which the system assesses not only how near the cars are but also how busy they are , asking and answering the question , which car should be sent \? even though otis s first working fuzzy' elevator is being installed in a new japanese hotel , the company sees a big market for the technique in renovations of elevator systems in the united states and elsewhere such upgradings are a crucial part of otis s revenue , which totaled 45 billion in 1992 , particularly since the glut of commercial real estate has cut construction of new buildings besides otis , several japanese companies , including hitachi , toshiba and mitsubishi , make fuzzy elevator dispatchers but even the smartest such systems can get confused by the hourtohour idiosyncracies of a building say , a 40floor building with a cafeteria on the 31st floor causing heavy lunchtime traffic developing dispatching logic robust enough to handle such tasks , mr powell said , is what makes our job challenging to handle such problems , otis is researching the neural network , a computer system that can be taught to recognize patterns or to check its own performance and learn from its mistakes such systems theoretically have many strengths say the entire third floor goes to lunch at 1 pm every day instead of always parking idle elevators at the lobby , as many elevator systems are programmed to do on the theory that the cars are more likely to be wanted there , a neural network could learn to park idle elevators on the third floor at 12 55 can these new smart elevators tell the difference between an elevator call from the chief executive and one from a pack of underlings hoping to slip out to buy a bowl of gruel \? no problem , mr kendall said , because peons everywhere , take note even today s elevators typically have a vip option the dignitary in question can use a button or key to take priority over all other calls a system similar to the emergency override options used in hospitals there are plenty of pitfalls in elevator programming mr sirag , an analyst in the artificial intelligence group at the united technologies research center , where otis thinks many of its big thoughts about elevators , recalls a simulation that was intended to keep elevator systems from sending cars that are too full to take passengers the computer was told , in effect , do n't send a car that ca n't take all the people who are waiting the system obeyed the line of wouldbe passengers lengthened still , no cars came , because none could accommodate all the imaginary waiting passengers the whole system fell apart , mr sirag said sometimes things that seem intuitively obvious do n't work out the way you expect to be sure , it is not only speed that concerns otis s elevator researchers they also try to reduce vibrations , so we do n't have to turn the elevator music up so loud , mr kendall said , and they have developed a new door sensor that sees not only a foot or an arm but even a pen or a credit card , to keep the doors from nipping at people s heels but the main goal is to reduce the time spent waiting for an elevator and the time in an elevator most people tolerate a minute and a half in an elevator , and after that they start to get a little bit antsy , mr kendall said , adding that he has an assistant for whom any amount of time in an elevator is so unbearable that she will not even get into one there are other techniques for reducing the perception of waiting time , including putting reading material inside the cars and then there is the piece of elevator lore everyone seems to know that shiny surfaces improve the elevator experience there is an old story in the operations research community that there was a building in which people were waiting too long , mr powell said so they did a whole bunch of studies , sent people with stopwatches , measured everything that could be measured , and finally they put a mirror in the hallway , so people could check their hair and their clothing , and that minimized their anxiety over the elevator and the wait cultural differences the otis team has made some interesting cultural discoveries while dealing with otis s first fullscale fuzzy logic system , the elevonic 411 , being installed in osaka it turns out that japanese seem to feel more strongly about reducing the longest waiting time than americans do in japan , the person who waits 10 seconds feels badly that his colleague has to wait three minutes , mr powell said mr kendall added in new york , they 're not that way they do n't like to wait photo at the otis elevator company , the assignment of bruce a powell , left , david j sirag , center , and john s kendall is to make use of various forms of artificial intelligence to try to improve the relationship between the machines they make and the people who use them \( carl david labianca for the new york times \) chart fuzzy elevators two elevator cars serve 12 floors both are traveling down a passenger on the sixth floor calls an elevator using the crisp rule , the computer would send car b , on the ninth floor , since it is closest to the sixth but in a fuzzy logic system , the computer assigns values to several variables in a mathematical equation , considering such factors as the number of people in each car and proximity to the desired floor it then uses the equation to respond to a rule that has been programmed into the system if car b is crowded an car a is close , then choose car a car a proceeds to the sixth floor \( source otis elevator company \) \( pg d9 \)
new orleans , april 4 in their quest for the national collegiate basketball championship here monday night , north carolina and michigan will first battle for supremacy in the paint north carolina starts a front line that has an average height of 6 feet 8 inches and a total weight of 705 pounds michigan s interior starters average nearly 68 and weigh a total of 704 pounds that is plenty of height and muscle under the basket , and both lines are quick as well add both teams' insistence on establishing lowpost dominance and something must give both teams could experience heavy foul trouble inside , and both teams must have a complement of outside shooting to make their inside play effective both sides confident neither team knows exactly how the interior war will unfold , but both realize that the winner inside will likely claim the championship we know what to expect , north carolina forward george lynch said all of their guys are strong in there we 've got to box out and keep them to one shot michigan forward juwan howard said we are not worried about the play inside we 've been playing well there all year defensively in the low post , we get a lot of help from our guards michigan s chris webber , who is listed as a forward but is essentially the starting center , added michigan has the best front line in the country we are n't worried they are good , but we welcome the challenge in its 7868 semifinal victory saturday , north carolina s starting front line lynch , center eric montross and forward brian reese outscored kansas' starting line by 4419 michigan s starting front outscored kentucky s by 5541 in the wolverines' 8178 overtime victory the tar heels took seven 3point shots and made five , all by donald williams michigan took four and made none north carolina prevailed in rebounding by 3524 michigan by 4034 they outplayed us inside and their passing to the post , especially the lob passes over the top to montross , killed us , kansas coach roy williams said of the tar heels montross did a good job of not only making the catch but knowing what to do with the ball kentucky coach rick pitino said the same about michigan , especially webber wolverines guard jalen rose said his teammates call webber hands because he is so good at catching the basketball before finishing a scoring play inside michigan s post players rebound and play defense like an nba team , pitino said they are big and they use their bodies they push you inside and establish position that is a team that knows where their bread is buttered montross is 7 feet tall and weighs 270 pounds he hit 9 of 14 shots from the field against kansas and currently has the tournament s fourthbest career shooting percentage \( 667 percent , 68 of 102 in 13 games \) webber will guard him , but howard and reserve center eric riley will also take their turns i 've known chris since we were in high school when we met at the nike camps , montross said in high school , he was always so much better than the other guys and it s been that way for him in college we have similar personalities , especially off the court he s pretty quiet and so am i we try to do what s best for our teams michigan believes its xfactor in the frontline matchup is riley a senior , riley is 7 feet tall and weighs 245 pounds he has a soft touch on his jumpers and is strong enough to post and slam dunk claims an edge we should have the edge inside , said michigan guard jimmy king we 've got two of the best postup guys in the country in juwan and chris , and when riley comes off the bench , that s three of the best in the country for montross , that s like three on one i like those chances the tar heels whose bench includes two other 7footers , kevin salvadori and matt wenstrom disagree we 'll hold our own , reese said we know that championships are won playing insideout they bring a lot of beef to the table but we play as well together inside , as one unit , as they do and on monday night we 're confident we can be just a little better
brussels , aug 9 the nato allies approved procedures and targets today for air strikes against bosnian serb nationalist forces if they kept up their strangulation of sarajevo but they put off a specific bombing decision and confirmed that such missions would not begin without specific approval by the secretary general of the united nations nato airplanes and coordination procedures with united nations peacekeeping forces in bosnia and herzegovina are already in place the actual decision to launch attacks would depend on additional judgments that the serbs were tightening the noose around sarajevo and other besieged areas , and then only after all 16 allies met here again to approve a nato statement of the final decision today said there should be no doubt about the firm determination of nato and its member nations to act against those responsible so that the resolutions of the un security council are respected and the suffering brought to an end in this context , it is essential that the bosnian serbs lift without delay the siege of sarajevo and that the heights around the city and the means of access are placed under the control of unprofor , the united nations protection force there 'now it is up to the serbs' clinton administration officials who urged the allies to act on their own initiative and tried to minimize the extent of united nations control over possible nato military action insisted that the agreement today was a success it reiterated but in some ways also qualifed a threat the united states persuaded the allies to make last tuesday now it is up to the serbs whether the air strikes will occur , said stephen oxman , united states assistant secretary of state for european and canadian affairs we are ready to act the nato secretary general , manfred worner , said after the meeting today of the alliance s political governing body , the north atlantic council it is essential that the bosnian serbs lift without delay the siege of sarajevo if not , the council will meet immediately to consider the use of air power the principal and basic objectives of the united states have been reached to an extent some might have believed impossible originally some compromises had to be made other officials said the united states had recognized this and got today s decision through in only four hours by taking french , british and canadian objections to more forceful action into account and presenting a new proposal today as a joint draft britain , france , spain and other european allies , unlike the united states , have thousands of soldiers in the united nations force in bosnia and have worried about bombing errors , as well as about the possibility that serbs could retaliate against them for any air strikes the danish foreign minister , among others , also expressed second thoughts last week about the effect of threats to start bombing on the peace talks now under way in geneva the nato statement emphasized that the alliance s threat was meant to be limited to the support of humanitarian relief the alliance also agrees with the united nations secretary general , boutros boutrosghali , that the first use of air power in the theater shall be authorized by him , the statement says military options limited according to diplomats here , the military options discussed today were limited in scope and all aimed at insuring a continued flow of relief supplies to muslim and other refugees from the fighting in bosnia they are also aimed at encouraging a settlement at the geneva peace talks , where a possible partitioning of the country is being discussed it s not a war strategy , one senior military officer said it s a genuine attempt to put military strength in the service of diplomacy any air strikes , diplomats said , would be set off only after close coordination with the united nations commander in bosnia , lieut gen francis briquemont , and the overall commander of united nations forces in the former yugoslavia , gen jean cot nato intended the bombing threat as a means of forcing the peace talks in geneva to a conclusion , but lord owen , the european community s chief negotiator , has been sharply critical of the talk of air strikes as being premature general briquemont also criticized saberrattling during the fighting in the mountains around sarajevo last week it is possible , diplomats conceded , that nato might never be called upon to carry out a single air strike more than 50 american , british , dutch and french planes have been positioned in italy and in the adriatic and ready to provide air support to united nations commanders since july 22 , but they have not yet been asked for sarajevo s need for supplies what we are trying to do is stop the fighting , one official said on nov 1 the temperature in sarajevo will be below freezing , and a catastrophe will ensue for the people living there if the siege continues other officials spoke of getting the serbs to stop shelling the city and to permit supplies of fuel , electricity and water to get through officials here did not disclose the targets they were prepared to strike , but said none of them was in belgrade or serbia proper the plan sent to the united nations calls for graduated air strikes of varying degrees of intensity that could be triggered by serbian actions on the ground in bosnia bombing attacks could be limited to individual targets like artillery pieces or mortars , or could be carried out against a large number of targets over a wide area simultaneously mr worner said serbian conduct on the ground in bosnia and willingness to act in geneva had both shown the effect of the nato threat under pressure of the threat , bosnian serb commanders agreed sunday to withdraw from two key hilltop positions their forces had occupied , a move that had been demanded by the leader of the bosnian muslims , president alija izetbegovic , as a condition of rejoining the geneva talks
uniondale , li jan 5 an early inundation of quebec s goaltender , ron hextall , provided an early lead for the islanders tonight at nassau coliseum but their inability to maintain any semblance of pressure made hextall s life simpler for the remaining 58 minutes and led to a 21 loss to the nordiques that could have lulled the 9 , 168 spectators on hand into slumber were it not for repeated interruptions by the raucous sound system and scoreboard noisemeter the home club s slogan promises the new ice age , but matters on the home front grew positively glacial as the minutes waned and quebec completed its 11th road victory in a season of surprising resurgence and coach al arbour s comments were appropriately icy there was no secret to that game , said arbour with a snarl they outworked us , outfought us , outhustled us they played with grit and guts , and we took the soft way out islanders take early lead the islanders , who needed 11thhour heroics but did n't quite get them , reserved their prettiest , and most seamless , play of the night for their opening goal after that , hextall got combative , and that made scoring problematical you could count the islanders' good chances on two or three fingers said the former flyer goaltender hextall halted the islanders' most adamant forward , patrick flatley , headon with eight minutes to go in the game , and stopped him again after the islanders removed goalie glenn healy with 57 seconds left flatley called arbour s gripes legitimate and hextall s play confident of his own team , he said , we were playing not to lose , and that s not good enough the only dent to hextall s increasingly impassive armor came early in the contest when a trio of islander forwards converged and outwitted him hextall made a pad save on brian mullen s wrist shot from the slot , but after the rebound went to benoit hogue just beyond the right post , hogue s lateral pass found flatley alone and waiting just beyond the left post with hextall committed in hogue s direction , flatley had a clear target and put the islanders in front by 10 just 1 minute 35 seconds into the game hunter receives major penalty the islanders were granted a lengthy opportunity to improve that lead when tim hunter caught and cut claude loiselle in the mouth at 8 11 , an infraction that mandated hunter s ejection and gave the islanders a fiveminute power play it also cost loiselle , who did n't return until the second period , four upper teeth the fiveminute power play he bequeathed his team in his absence was , however , a total dud the islanders took just four shots , all from the perimeter , and none of them disturbed hextall , who is back to playing with the confidence that made him a star in philadelphia we could have buried them there , sent them to the showers , but we did n't , said healy in the second period , a decidedly more boisterous quebec club outshot the islanders , 117 , and outscored them , 20 , to take a 21 lead into the third period young answers for quebec quebec s tying goal was a marvel of footwork mike ricci won the faceoff in the circle to healy s left , and then used a gentle tap of his skate blade to send the puck sliding backwards to scott young the right wing wound up and blasted a hard , low shot that would have sheared the blade off healy s right skate had he not lifted his foot slightly off the ice the puck streaked beneath it and quebec earned a 11 tie at 3 02 the nordiques took a 21 lead at 17 51 , again helped by some sleight of playmaking from ricci , who has had to make amends for the damage done to the quebec talent pool by injuries to joe sakic \( eye \) and mats sundin \( shoulder \) this time , like a race horse rounding the final turn , ricci careered neck and neck around the back of the islander net with pierre turgeon turgeon had position on the inside , but ricci had the puck , and in the confusion he managed to whip his wraparound shot past both turgeon and healy photo islanders goalie glenn healy reaching to stop the puck during last night s game against the nordiques \( richard harbus for the new york times \)
to understand how michael zimmerman has excelled so quickly in the tennis rankings is to look past his suburban roots , his days at harvard and his expensive clothes and car mike s a pretty easy kid to motivate , he s very hungry , he works extremely hard , and that s unusual for kids in this area , said robbie wagner , zimmerman s longtime coach in great neck he s so unspoiled you do n't even have to ask him if he s worked out , lifted the weights you already know he has that determination was not bought about by his father , an investment banker , and it was not taught at harvard , where zimmerman was an allamerican the work ethic came from within , he and his coaches say , soon after he had ruptured his spleen and broke his collarbone in a car accident in his junior year at great neck north high school the car that he and a friend were in swerved off a road and hit a tree uncle at tennis school the accident set him back four months in school , and he did not play tennis for a year but he came back , refined his tennis , and is now considered a rising young prospect on the pro circuit in the rankings of the association of tennis professionals , zimmerman is 431st in singles among 1 , 300 ranked players in doubles , he is 356th zimmerman was introduced to tennis by his uncle bob litwin , who teaches at future stars in great neck tennis was part of the family zimmerman s grandparents played , and his grandfather , manny litwin , operated the tennis pro shop in great neck his parents also play zimmerman s father , ronald , is an a player at the wildwood tennis club in kings point his mother , jane , plays in regional tournaments , and his uncle remains one of his coaches on high school varsity in 7th grade zimmerman was so good as a seventh grader that he played on the varsity high school team then there was the car accident i think that somehow made me more focused when i came back to play tennis , he recalled it was just the time off or the motivation i needed everything just started to happen i started playing tennis better i was doing better in school i got admitted into harvard as a junior in college , zimmerman was ranked as high as seventh nationally and no 1 in the east he finished his collegiate career ranked 21st in singles and ninth in doubles after graduation last june , he put off a career in economics to play tennis in less than a year on the circuit zimmerman has traveled extensively to play in satellite tournaments and earn his ranking he has two sponsors reebok , which supplies free shoes and clothes , and prince , which gives him equipment otherwise , he is on his own , from correcting his game to calculating the differences in currency to making travel arrangements zimmerman does not have any endorsements yet and his responsibilities have doubled since becoming a professional he makes his own arrangements and finds the practice courts by himself he has to make sure that he eats right , and he rarely has a coach with him , so he has no one to critique , or congratulate , him he pays litwin and wagner mostly for advice over the phone it s quite a contrast from his college years , when the coaches take care of everything he already has so many travel stories that he is thinking of keeping a journal in bangalore , india , his match was postponed when wild monkeys swarmed the area , swinging through the trees the city was so clouded with pollution , he said , that people had to cover their faces underwhelming earnings his most bizarre trip was to mexico , where each player was essentially bought by a member of the town or tennis club , and the odds were set based on how well the player was playing none of us knew beforehand , and all of a sudden you have these people rooting for you and buying you dinners , zimmerman said after a while you realize they 've bet on you players pay their own way on the satellite tours , and zimmerman s earnings have totaled 530 this year , hardly enough to support himself for one tournament his parents pay the rest but if zimmerman continues to improve he may propel himself into the next level , the challenger tours or , possibly , qualify for grand prix events , where the money is lastmonth he lost in the first round of qualifying for the us clay court championships in charlotte , nc but he played well , and that was encouraging , because his opponent went on to qualify i think when he first got down there , michael was n't sure he belonged , litwin , his uncle and coach , said but then he saw he can compete with these guys and realized these are the tournaments he should be playing in crucial six months if zimmerman is to excel , he needs to improve his game on clay and acquire a strong serve or a sliced backhand to distinguish his style and he needs a good result in a big tournament , perhaps reaching the semifinals or quarterfinals the next six months are crucial , wagner , his other coach , said he 'll be a year into the pro circuit , and where he is in the next six months will be a good gauge to see where he 'll go he does n't want to be at the satellite level a year from now , because it gets kind of draining but if anybody can do it , he can zimmerman will have two chances soon he is now competing in a fourweek satellite in england he will also play in the 14th maccabiah games , from july 5 to 15 in israel , where jewish athletes from around the world compete in olympicsanctioned games i hope to play tennis until i feel it s something that i do n't want to do , zimmerman said i mean my ranking has only been going up so if i started stagnating or i feel i'm not enjoying it anymore or if i'm sick of traveling or too far into debt , then i 'll choose another job photo michael zimmerman practicing in port washington \( steve

a major expansion of the broadway alliance , the twoyearold plan to produce plays at low cost to bring reduced ticket prices to broadway s darkened theaters , was announced yesterday by broadway s theater owners and the major theatrical unions the plan , which has so far yielded three plays , none of which has been successful , has been restricted to three of broadway s often unoccupied theaters , the belasco , the nederlander and the walter kerr yesterday the number of theaters participating in the plan was expanded to 11 with the addition of the ambassador , the brooks atkinson , the cort , the john golden , the longacre , the lyceum , the eugene o'neill and the neil simon we hope this will lead to a new era for the alliance , said david s rosenak , the alliance chairman , who made the announcement for the theater owners and unions no new alliance productions are planned for this season , he said , but there is interest from producers in the new theaters no hits to date so far , the three plays produced in the two years of the plan our country s good , the speed of darkness and crazy he calls me have not been financially successful under the alliance plan , theater owners , performers and backstage workers agree to scale down costs to permit a top ticket price of 35 the current top cost of a ticket for a straight play on broadway produced under conventional agreements is 45 previously , the three participating theaters were made available to producers of alliance plays in rotation , since each was owned by one of the three major theater owners \( the belasco is owned by the shubert organization and the walter kerr by jujamcyn theaters \) the lack of choice discouraged many producers from bringing their plays to the plan , mr rosenak said under the expanded plan , producers will have their pick of 11 theaters one of the new theaters , the eugene o'neill , is owned by jujamcyn two others , the brooks atkinson and the neil simon , are owned by the nederlanders , and the rest are owned by the shuberts although another theater , the royale , a shubert house , had been proposed for the plan , actors' equity objected , saying that the theater was too much in demand to qualify for the reducedwage plan the royale was dropped from the expanded list of theaters
the search for a possible new home for the yankees is also a search for the money to build it if the yankees depart yankee stadium for manhattan or new jersey , at least 200 million would be needed to construct a new ball park in proposing the west side railyard near the jacob k javits convention center as a site for the yankees in addition to a surrounding commercial and entertainment complex new york gov mario m cuomo has suggested issuing state bonds backed by the complex s revenues as a form of financing but the state would undoubtedly incur costs to improve the surrounding infrastructure however , if george steinbrenner s search for the sweetest deal leads him to new jersey , which has been wooing him since 1984 , an intriguing form of financing would await him casino revenues the 12 atlantic city casinos pay 125 percent of their gross winnings into the casino reinvestment development authority during the course of the casions' 25year obligation to the crda , an estimated 17 billion for statewide economic development and housing projects will be raised although the crda fund is skewed to projects in atlantic city and south new jersey , nicholas amato , the executive director of the crda , said that at least 250 million will be available through the term of the casino s obligations to help finance projects in northern new jersey , including a ball park use of the money is not subject to taxpayer approval if the yankees decided to come to new jersey , said amato , between crda money , luxury suites and other financing , this stadium could be built without taxpayer money my purpose in suggesting this has been to come up with a viable plan that would not use tax dollars or revenue bonds the crda could be a conduit agency bond issue rejected a 1987 referendum to approve a 175 million bond issue to build a baseball stadium in new jersey was rejected primarily because it would have used taxpayer money recent polls suggest again the desire of new jerseyans for a ball park , but only if they do n't have to finance it with their taxes amato met last year with yankee officials before steinbrenner s return march 1 from his banishment , but does n't expect to meet with them again it was merely exploratory and just to apprise them of the concept , he said of the meeting david sussman , the yankees' general counsel , declined to comment on team contacts with amato new jersey problem financing would not be the job of the yankees , but that of the new jersey sports and exposition authority , which runs the meadowlands sports complex that complex consists of giants stadium , the home of the giants and jets the byrne meadowlands arena , home of the nets and devils , and the meadowlands race track amato said he had suggested the casinofund concept to jon hanson and bob mulcahy , the authority s chairman and president , respectively mulcahy said recently that if new jersey was successful in luring the yankees , we can put together a privatepublic partnership , using taxes like an extra levy on hotel bills or sin taxes on cigarettes and alcohol the crda money is a way not to get involved with sin taxes , amato said john samerjan , a spokesman for the sports authority , acknowledged that amato had suggested casino funding , then added if major league baseball were to come to new jersey , we 'd explore a wide battery of financing alternatives to the stadium i'm sure that would be one area to explore samerjan said that no price tag could be placed on stadium construction in new jersey it would be site specific and dependent on franchise needs , he said in 1987 , the authority projected that the failed 185 million bond issue to build a stadium on undeveloped land in lyndhurst would have been divided this way 85 million for construction , 71 million to buy land , 15 million for engineering and other fees and 14 million to cover inflation costs will certainly escalate over the next few years at whichever site ischosen in new jersey or new york the promise of casino revenues may figure in the funding of a new 175 million ball park in detroit to replace tiger stadium according to the detroit news , michigan officials are contemplating a plan that would finance the acquisition of land for a new downtown stadium by committing 4 percent of the revenues from two proposed indianrun casinos casinos in detroit \?

beatrice gindea thought the lawyers were on her side now she s not so sure in 1988 , the retiree invested 10 , 000 a large chunk of her nest egg in a real estate fund sponsored by prudentialbache securities through the firm s morristown , nj , office it seemed like a good investment prudential guaranteed her 12 percent annually for three years , and then all her money back but the promises were false , and the investment collapsed last month , when the check to settle her claim against prudential and other defendants finally arrived , mrs gindea was aghast out of the 10 , 000 , i thought i would only see 50 percent of it back , she said instead , she got 42353 for every dollar she had invested , mrs gindea received a bit more than four pennies i was astonished , mrs gindea said i thought i was being cheated meanwhile , the law firm that represented mrs gindea and thousands of others in the class action was paid as much as 6 million in fees , plus expenses adding to the sting , some investors in the same fund who sued separately came away with far more money sometimes more than 100 percent of their investment , plus interest and legal fees many thousands of limitedpartnership investors like mrs gindea are learning the troubling truth about classaction litigation brought in their names without ever going to the effort of a trial to fight for a better deal , the law firms representing these investors can win approval for settlements of a few cents on the dollar for their clients while pocketing millions of dollars even tens of millions in legal fees for themselves the classaction lawyers argue that their clients could have done no better , but that is cold comfort for those who watch some fellow investors who have hired their own lawyers go to trial or arbitration and then come away fully compensated even more frustrating for such investors , anyone who is part of a classaction settlement waives all rights to further claims , even if the government later affirms accusations of fraud against the partnership for example , investors who earlier settled with prudential in class actions for a small fraction of their investment are excluded from sharing in a fund of 371 million set up in october to repay some losses by customers who had been falsely assured about the safety and returns of the partnerships the players a number of law firms have staked out business in class actions involving limited partnerships milberg weiss bershad specthrie lerach , in new york city , for example , represented mrs gindea bernstein litowitz berger grossmann , also in new york , is the lead counsel in the action involving the prudential bache energy income funds but the most active in the field may well be the small chicago law firm called beigel sandler ltd run by herbert beigel , a onetime prosecutor of mob members , it has made millions off the travails of limitedpartnership investors and some critics say the amounts it has made and the way it has done so epitomize what is wrong with this part of the legal system a review of cases involving the firm by the new york times shows that beigel sandler has never taken a significant class action to trial , settling rather than fighting for a bigger award even when it had a strong case at the same time , the firm that so many investors are trusting to recover their investments has been repeatedly criticized by federal judges for sloppy legal work and frivolous filings but mr beigel said such criticism and setbacks are the price of playing in the classaction arena he said the small amounts he wins for investors in classaction settlements are better than what would come out of a case that goes to court , where many judges have no sympathy for those they view as having gambled on an investment and lost that s the reason you see cheap settlements , mr beigel said these cases have a chance of losing and they are thrown out constantly in the settlements that have been reached , mr beigel said , we like to think we have done a good job in some very difficult cases but mr beigel does not dismiss critics out of hand no one should be in a class action who has a strong individual claim , he said , except for a person whose claim is of such small monetary value that it would be economically unfeasible to bring a claim any other way those kinds of smallclaim cases are largely responsible for the rapid growth in class actions over the last two decades such litigation has been used in many kinds of disputes , from product liability to price fixing , and lawyers often receive multimilliondollar fees from the settlements but class actions alleging fraud at investment partnerships are notable in that most plaintiffs have suffered huge losses rather than small ones , and therefore have a lot more to lose in an unsatisfactory settlement one problem is that lawyers representing investors in a class action do n't need their approval of a settlement of course , investors can opt out of a class action and sue on their own but most ca n't afford it given the outcome of many of the limitedpartnership class actions , some experts are asking whether the time has come for reform
on the verge of bankruptcy and dissolution , the newyork historical society shut its doors to the public this month one thing is clear about the 189yearold institution if it is to emerge from its latest crisis , it must finally become a different , and probably leaner , institution different from what , you might ask for much of its history it was run so like a private club that few people had the slightest idea what was housed within its somber limestone walls on central park west not much has changed even during the last few years , when the society , reeling from its last neardeath encounter , has tried to attract a wider public yet while millions of people each year streamed into the american museum of natural history across the street , at its peak in 1992 the society drew only 93 , 000 visitors it would be a cultural tragedy if the society were now to die , not least because of what it would imply about a city that allowed such a rich resource to go under while at the same time campaigning vigorously to keep david letterman in town yet if it were to die , few people would know what had been lost until recently , even the society did n't know what it had to lose only in the last several years has it tried systematically to inventory and catalogue the millions of things it has mostly unsystematically accumulated over the last two centuries the society has been new york s attic probably no other place could tell as well , through a combination of art , artifacts and documents , the story of early america , or of 19thcentury american society , or of the architectural evolution of new york up to world war i between its library and its museum , the society has colonial letters and manuscripts , northern renaissance paintings , memorabilia from the spanishamerican war , and art of the hudson river school donated during the mid1800 s when the society was the only art museum in town \( the metropolitan was founded in 1870 \) those who know something about the society may know that it owns audubon s watercolors for the birds of america and the 19thcentury american painter thomas cole s course of empire but few people know that it also houses dozens of civil war cannonballs , an assortment of firemen s boots and helmets , and a worldclass collection of paperweights how to make sense of all this material \? that is the question the society must answer , and answer quickly it finds itself in such desperate financial circumstances that by june it will not be able to exist even with the doors shut and the staff down to 35 employees \( from a high of around 125 \) if money is to be raised in a hurry , an independent advisory committee charged with conceiving a strategy for survival must accomplish in the next several weeks what the trustees did not when there was time articulate , once and for all , a clear mission for the society that mission may require jettisoning parts of the society s holdings an added burden on the society s leaders will be to insure that those jettisoned parts land in other public collections it may already be too late to avoid the auction block entirely , since the society , in a lastditch attempt to stay afloat , deposited 3 million worth of its holdings with sotheby s as collateral for a 15 million loan how the impoverished institution will be able to repay the loan when it comes due in december remains a mystery what makes the deal all the more unfortunate is that by the time the loan was secured , it was no longer enough to keep the place running the sotheby s deal is merely the latest episode in a depressing saga of crisis management during the early 1980 s the society faced severe financial troubles its trustees proposed selling air rights on central park west for an apartment tower , but the plan , which outraged west siders , was rejected by the city s landmarks preservation commission a shortsighted board resorted to selling off parts of the collection rather than initiating a fundraising campaign the endowment was depleted , first by trustees who began to use it for operating expenses , then by the stock market collapse of 1987 , which reduced the value of its portfolio when , among other expenditures , money had to be devoted to salvaging works that had been allowed to deteriorate , the society neared bankruptcy in june 1988 , trustees closed two floors of galleries and dismissed almost a quarter of the staff after news of the woeful state of the collection became public , the director of the society resigned by april 1989 a largely new board and a new president took over the institution they raised more than 22 million during the next few years attendance more than doubled conservation and cataloguing were stepped up , and new programs on race and class aimed at bringing more diverse communities into the formerly stuffy society yet financial problems did not evaporate it s possible to fault the city for ignoring the society s appeals for help covering operating costs nonetheless , with hindsight , it is clear that despite the strengths of its curators and librarians , the society s trustees and administrators failed in various ways
washington , dec 3 in what analysts called clinching proof of economic speedup , the nation s unemployment rate fell fourtenths of a point in november , to 64 percent , the biggest monthly improvement in 10 years the unexpected decline resulted mainly from strong job creation that removed 534 , 000 people from the unemployment ranks , according to a survey of the nation s households many of those people returned to jobs from which they had been laid off adult men were the principal beneficiaries katharine g abraham , the commissioner of labor statistics , called today s report from the labor department almost uniformly positive leading indicators gain the encouraging jobs data came as the commerce department reported that the government s main forecasting tool , the index of leading economic indicators , climbed fivetenths of 1 percent in october , its third consecutive increase after seesawing through the first seven months of the year the department also announced a third straight solid gain for orders to american factories , which rose 12 percent in october and the nation s auto makers reported a 104 percent gain in vehicle sales in november , with many executives and analysts predicting that the recovery that began in the spring would prove longlasting page 37 but it was the stunning jobs report , which is considered the best single measure of economic performance , that captured the most attention it reflected job gains in most parts of the economy except the military and apparel industries the report also showed job gains in all geographic regions , including drops in unemployment in both new york and new jersey page 48 'more sustained' recovery employers nationwide reported adding 208 , 000 payroll jobs , and the factory workweek expanded to its longest since world war ii , reflecting increased industrial activity moreover , fewer job holders had to settle for parttime work as fulltime jobs became more plentiful all of the reports we 've gotten in the past several weeks confirm that the pace of recovery has picked up , said laura d'andrea tyson , chief economic adviser to president clinton , referring to upbeat statistics on retail sales , industrial production , orders for durable goods , home sales , consumer confidence and even incomes the recovery , she added , had become steadier and more sustained despite the strengths shown today , the inflationsensitive bond market responded favorably , and and interest rates fell this , in part , reflected the fact that the 208 , 000 rise in payroll jobs , based on the separate household survey on which the unemployment rate is based , was only moderately greater than the 175 , 000 or so that most analysts had expected stocks , meanwhile , rose slightly another factor in the markets' reaction is that inflation remains well contained , with little upward pressure on wages or commodities today s labormarket report showed that average hourly earnings climbed just twotenths of 1 percent in november and 23 percent over the last 12 months , somewhat less than the rise in consumer prices and if the 15 percent drop in oil prices over the last six weeks were sustained , ms tyson noted , this would knock half a percentage point off the 1994 inflation rate still another reason for levelheadedness in the financial markets may have been recognition that the decline in the unemployment rate was almost certainly overstated it partly reflected a decline in the labor force of 81 , 000 people that following a huge october surge of 739 , 000 additional workers and thomas j plewes , a senior official , predicted the fourtenth of a point improvement would shrink , probably by half , after seasonal adjustment factors had received their annual revision next month today s figures were not affected by the change in methodology by which the survey of households is conducted in midnovember the government announced that a pilot program using the new procedures indicated a possible halfpoint rise in the national unemployment rate when the new system is introduced with january figures to be reported in early february among other things , the new system will curb a bias that has led to underreporting of jobmarket activity by women and overreporting of it by men ammunition for optimists still , today s report provided lots of ammunition for optimists even california , which still suffers from military retrenchment , posted a statistically significant 12point decline in its jobless rate , to 86 percent in november 1992 , 10 percent of the california work force was unemployed other hefty improvements came in illinois , down 19 points , to 59 percent , and north carolina , down ninetenths of a point , to 39 percent one of the clearest signs of a stronger labor market was in manufacturing , which added 30 , 000 jobs after a small october gain before that there had been seven straight declines in factory jobs totaling 256 , 000 and while the factory workweek and factory overtime edged up just onetenth of an hour , or six minutes , both these traditional harbingers of new hiring hit records at 417 hours , the average workweek has not been this long since the late stages of world war ii , and 44 hours of overtime is the most since this data series was begun in 1956 health care costs officials said employers seemed finally to be ending their tendency at a time of uncertainty about the cost of medical benefits to avoid adding new workers by pushing existing staff harder representative david r obey , a wisconsin democrat who heads the joint economic committee of congress , mused today that new hiring might be encouraged by requiring overtime hours to be paid at double or triple regular pay instead of the current one and a half times in addition to factory and other worker recalls , analysts said , job growth last month also included construction workers who normally would have been laid off in the autumn but who were kept on longer this year because low interest rates have helped generate more business construction added 27 , 000 jobs , health services added 32 , 000 \( though none in hospitals \) and finance , insurance and real estate added 27 , 000 , the most robust of three straight advances retail sales jobs retail sales jobs rose by less than is customary for the month , thereby posting a 17 , 000 decline after seasonal adjustment , the report also showed the variation among demographic groups , however , was unusually widespread , with the unemployment rate for adult men falling fivetenths of a point while the rate for adult women eased a negligible onetenth of a point each now shows a rate of 58 percent the rate for whites and hispanic workers eased sixtenths of a point and 11 points , respectively , while the rate for blacks climbed eighttenths of a point , to 125 percent , the same as in august among the 11 components of the commerce department s leading , or forecasting index , the only one to decline was the money supply an advance of such breadth is very rare , analysts noted the leading index was revised this month to reflect new weightings graphs the labor picture in november shows employment

miami , may 8 after being shifted five times from one city to another , the racially charged retrial of a miami police officer on charges of killing two young black men is scheduled to begin on monday in orlando the case of william lozano has preoccupied florida for more than four years , and judge w thomas spencer of dade county circuit court has been stymied in his effort to hold the trial in a city where blacks are likely to be on the jury orlando , where the second trial of mr lozano has settled , is conservative , overwhelmingly white and none too happy to be saddled with what the rest of florida views as miami s problem selection of a sixmember jury is expected to consume about a week , with opening statements probably taking place in midmay mr lozano admits firing the shot that led to the deaths of the two men in early 1989 , but says he acted in selfdefense the deaths of the two men , a motorcyclist and his passenger , touched off three days of racial rioting in the city in his first trial , mr lozano was convicted on two counts of manslaughter , but an appeals court overturned the verdict , saying the jurors might have been influenced by fears of further racial violence public officials and leaders of citizens' groups have warned that the retrial has so many echoes of the rodney g king case in los angeles that more racial unrest could be ignited if mr lozano is acquitted leaders of black civic groups have been especially critical of the decision to move the case from racially and ethnically diverse miami to orlando , which some call the simi valley of florida , in reference to the overwhelmingly white southern california community where a state jury acquitted four los angeles police officers in the beating of mr king a janet reno case mr lozano s new trial , which is to be televised , will offer a glimpse at the prosecutorial skills of attorney general janet reno , who was state attorney here for 15 years and oversaw the case until she left for washington ms reno s office had a history of being reluctant to prosecute police officers involved in brutality cases as in the first trial , mr lozano s defense will be led by roy black , who came to national attention in 1991 when he defended william k smith in a widely publicized palm beach rape case mr smith was acquitted the lozano case began jan 16 , 1989 , when the 33yearold hispanic police officer fired a single shot from his glock pistol at a motorcyclist who was being chased through the predominantly black overtown section of miami by another officer the cyclist , 23yearold clement a lloyd , died of a head wound his passenger , allan blanchard , died the next day of injuries he received when the motorcycle crashed even as police officers were investigating the shooting , rioting erupted in predominantly black areas of miami over the next three nights , arson , gunfire and looting resulted in one death , hundreds of injuries and arrests and millions of dollars in damage symbolic of tensions in addition , the case quickly became a symbol of longstanding tensions between hispanic residents , who dominate politics and business in dade county , and blacks , who constitute about 20 percent of the county s population mr lozano , who was born in bogota , colombia , immigrated to the united states at age 12 with his family he became a police officer in 1985 and has three brothers who are policemen in december 1989 a jury of three whites , two blacks and one hispanic member convicted mr lozano of two counts of manslaughter he was sentenced to seven years in prison and dismissed from the police force in his appeal , he argued that he had not received a fair trial because jurors were afraid of rioting if they acquitted him florida s third district court of appeals ruled in june 1991 that mr lozano s original request for a change of venue should have been granted and that he was therefore entitled to a new trial outside miami since mr lozano s first trial , there have been numerous incidents of racial conflict around the country , most notably after the four officers' acquittal on state charges in the king case last year \( two of the los angeles officers were convicted on federal charges in the king case last month \) with that example in mind , elected officials and civic leaders throughout florida have strenuously sought to prevent the case from being shifted to their jurisdictions in a matter of a few months last year , the case was moved from miami to orlando to tallahassee , then back to orlando and back to tallahassee again , with the primary reason being concern over the possible racial composition of the jury after efforts to move the case back to miami were rejected late last month , orlando was finally designated as the trial site last may , judge spencer cited the king case when he countermanded his initial decision to move the case to orlando and instead selected tallahassee that so many of our fellow americans feel shut out from our judicial system demands our attention , judge spencer wrote he also vowed that this court will insure that blacks will be on the jury that tries this case to the extent the law permits precautions with jurors though mr lozano s lawyers , joined by prosecutors , were able in march to persuade an appeals court to overrule judge spencer and move the trial out of tallahassee , mr lozano appears to remain concerned in an appearance on a spanishlanguage radio station last year , part of his continuing effort to raise money for a defense that he says has bankrupted him , he suggested that the los angeles riots had made it impossible for him to get a fair trial in florida anybody in the jury will be thinking that if they absolve me , there will be burning and disturbances and millions of dollars lost , he said black officials and civic leaders have been even more critical , pointing out that the percentage of blacks in the jury pool in orlando is only half that of miami or tallahassee to reduce the possibility that jurors might be swayed by concerns about racial violence , judge spencer has ordered that the identities of jurors not be released until six months after the trial the judge has also said that jury selection will not be televised and that jurors will not be photographed or televised during any part of the trial lawyers for both sides have declined to say what new arguments or evidence , if any , they will present in the retrial mr lozano testified at his first trial and is expected to do so again chart a trial that traveled 1989 jan

austin , tex , sept 27 senator kay bailey hutchison was indicted today on charges that she abused her position as texas state treasurer while she was preparing for her senate campaign this past spring her landslide victory made her a rising star in national republican circles the indictment , handed up by a grand jury in austin , accuses her of using state workers , computers and supplies for her personal benefit , apparently for campaignrelated purposes , and of trying to destroy computer files and other government records once an inquiry into her activity was begun two of her top aides were also charged the indictments cap an investigation begun by the democratic district attorney in austin , ronnie earle , once an aspirant for the seat mrs hutchison now holds the investigation included a state raid of the treasurer s office within days of her election in june accusations denied as she has throughout the investigation , mrs hutchison sought today to dismiss the indictments as a political stunt orchestrated by frustrated democrats in austin who were chagrined at losing a senate seat that had been in democratic hands since reconstruction the democrats are trying to nullify the victory i won by a 2to1 margin , she said at a news conference in her senate office in washington with her husband , ray , at her side this is the beginning of the 1994 campaign none of the charges have merit mrs hutchison was scheduled to appear in manhattan tonight at a fundraiser for senator alfonse m d'amato of new york , a fellow republican , but her office announced she was canceling the appearance senator bob dole , commenting at the fund raiser , called the indictment a political witch hunt from which mrs hutchinson would emerge stronger than ever 5 counts in indictment for the moment , the indictments are likely to dim mrs hutchison s luster for the republicans top republican party officials , mr dole , had trumpeted her landslide victory in texas as an augur for republican success in next fall s midterm elections the 50yearold mrs hutchison faces five counts three of official misconduct , each carrying a maximum punishment of 20 years in prison and a 10 , 000 fine , and one each of tampering with evidence and tampering with a government record , carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison the indictments were couched in general terms , and mr earle did not elaborate today on the charges mrs hutchison racked up the largest statewide margin ever won by a republican candidate in texas , 67 percent to 33 percent , in beating the interim senator , bob krueger , a democrat who was appointed to the seat by gov ann w richards after lloyd bentsen resigned to become treasury secretary senator hutchison faces reelection in november 1994 for a full sixyear term and , while most texas politicians had been casting her as a virtual shooin , many said today that the field was now likely to be crowded with both republicans and democrats sensing political blood in the water the timing of her trial is not clear mrs hutchison insisted she wanted to face the charges and get them behind her as quickly as possible , but the preparation and inevitable delays of the process also make it conceivable that she would have the trial hanging over her head in the midst of her fight for reelection the senate has no rules that automatically discipline a senator who is indicted or convicted on a felony charge it takes a twothirds vote to remove a senator , and a party caucus can always strip a member of seniority or committee assignments ten sitting senators have been indicted in the chamber s history as a practical matter , the senate would be hardpressed to keep her as a member if she were convicted of a felony , and because she is in the minority her chances of political survival would be even less mrs hutchison s lawyer , michael dowd , of washington , described the indictments as baloney and described his client as one of the most selfless public officials ever to hold that office down there but the foreman of the grand jury , saadi a ferris , in an unusual public statement , said the inquiry had been conducted with independence of politics and political persuasion and defenders of mr earle , the district attorney , have insisted that accusations by republicans that he was politically motivated were dubious , since he has made a name for himself in austin for indicting or forcing the resignation of several prominent democrats while mrs hutchison has denied accusations that she abused her office , she did say last year that campaign fundraising records , which she described as a small amount of nonstate material had been found in a treasury computer she said the work had been done without her knowledge and added it was done contrary to established procedures that carefully separate my state business from nonstate business we are redoubling our efforts to make sure it never happens but the indictment handed up today indicates that mrs hutchison acted a month later to cover up other evidence of political activity within her agency it said she moved to alter , destroy and conceal a record and a

chores for her on state time , including helping her to redecorate her home in austin one treasury employee , sharon c ammann , who is the daughter of the late gov john b connally , said that mrs hutchison once slapped her when she took too much time looking up a phone number that mrs hutchison wanted mrs hutchison denied she had slapped anyone because of the wording of the indictments , it was not clear whether mrs ammann s accusations were part of the charges against mrs hutchison earlier this month , senator hutchison appeared before the grand jury but suggested later that she had , on advice of her lawyers , exercised her fifth amendment right not to give selfincriminating evidence photo senator kay bailey hutchison denied she abused her position as texas state treasurer while

generally speaking , a book patched together from old news clippings is a poor candidate for success the contents of newsroom morgues may be immensely interesting to scholars , but a reader browsing through the average file of some deceased reporter is apt to encounter prose that seems as yellow and decayed as the paper on which it was printed but forward positions the war correspondence of homer bigart \( university of arkansas press , 2495 \) is a stunning exception the 51 battlefield dispatches collected here by betsy wade , ho mer bigart s colleague at the new york times , ring with genuine drama shorn of facile cliches , propaganda and selfcongratulation assembled in book form , they afford a rare overview of a great journalist s career i was privileged to know homer in vietnam during the last of the many wars he covered for the new york herald tribune and , later , for the new york times when homer arrived in saigon in 1962 , i was the associated press correspondent there , and we became friends and occasional competitors homer had won many honors for his coverage of world war ii and the korean war \( including two pulitzer prizes \) , and he was a journalistic legend by the time he arrived in vietnam at the age of 54 but it represented a transition for him his reportorial passion for detail and his spare , eloquent prose were never stronger than during his six months in vietnam , but for homer the conflict was a new and distasteful kind of war that he regarded as an ordeal rather than a satisfying professional challenge he hated vietnam the country as well as the war one reason was saigon s tropical climate , not easy on a man who was no longer young but what really galled him was that all the major participants in vietnam , americans as well as vietnamese , were playing deceitful games that left no room for trust in anyone homer was a confessed curmudgeon , skeptic and cynic , but underneath it all , he liked to trust people if he could he had always found at least a few trustworthy people in previous wars , but toward the end of his vietnam tour he told me that he had come to think of the place as a snake pit , where nothing was as it seemed and no one told the truth during the time i knew homer , i often felt that he was uneasy with the confrontational style of journalism that evolved as a response to the poisonous atmosphere of the vietnam war homer had never played the role of cheerleader for the home team , but however critical his reporting of such military blunders as the anzio beachhead could be , there was never any doubt which side had his sympathies in vietnam , by contrast , homer could never wholeheartedly identify himself with an american team that often looked arrogant and wrongheaded , and whose cause seemed questionable to him in vietnam , homer was treated as an enemy by some of his own compatriots for the first time in his career american diplomats and commanders in 1962 were under orders to keep the ngo dinh diem regime happy , and that meant keeping the hated american press at a distance when saigon authorities reported some battle as a victory , united states military and diplomatic spokesmen generally parroted the claim even when they knew it to be a lie , and relations between officials and reporters settled into a more or less permanent state of confrontation world war ii and korea saw plenty of bickering between journalists and military spokesmen , but it was never so continuous or bitter as in vietnam homer was in the thick of these disputes , and they sapped his \( and everyone s \) energy the tension was a constant source of irritation , but something else disturbed him at least as much the changing style of reporting that news organizations were imposing on their foreign correspondents by and large , editors wanted no more firstperson narratives and no more injection of personal opinion into news dispatches the issues in vietnam were muddy enough , news directors and editors believed , without their having to weed out the particular biases of the men and women on the scene moreover , some american news executives came to harbor serious doubts as to whether their representatives in vietnam were entirely trustworthy the gloomy tone of reporting from vietnam , which told of corruption , bungling and defeat , was in stark contrast to reports from the washington press corps , which painted a far more sanguine picture of the war if an editor had to choose between a dispatch from saigon saying one thing and a dispatch from washington reporting the exact opposite , which was he to trust \? many newspapers , like the new york times , adopted a policy of printing both versions and letting the reader split the difference homer despised this practice , which he called clerkish how cacacacan a fact and a lie both be correct \? he would stutter are n't we supposed to choose \? then , after one of his pregnant pauses , he would add , yes in 1962 homer was overweight , wore glasses , often dressed in business suits despite the heat , and stuttered more than usual when he was angry , which was most of the time he had none of the egotistic flamboyance of some of the star correspondents of world war ii and korea , who sometimes succumbed to the temptation to depict themselves as their own heroes throughout his career he avoided that snare he never visited the saigon tailor shops that outfitted american network correspondents with safari suits but in one respect homer was a war correspondent in the old tradition he felt most comfortable writing news in the first person
to the editor i found g gordon liddy s review of tom clancy s novel without remorse \( aug 22 \) highly entertaining , and full of good advice to the aspiring author like the unfortunate mr clancy , i too do n't know how a suppressor attaches to a pistol i did n't even know that in guns , a clip is different from a magazine when i write my novel i will keep this review in mind , and be very careful not to write carelessly about things i do n't know but most interesting to me was a particular tidbit of information mr liddy slipped into his review the american left , he tells us , was supplying intelligence to the enemy during the vietnam war dear me i thought that i was part of the american left back then , but for the life of me i ca n't remember supplying intelligence to the enemy i asked a number of my friends , also part of the american left at the time , and none of them can remember either who in the american left had any intelligence , at least any of the military variety worth sharing with an enemy \? and given that the great majority of us american lefties ca n't tell a clip from a magazine , i ca n't imagine that any enemy worth its salt would trust our intelligence anyway but i must be mistaken someone as scrupulous as mr liddy is when it comes to fine detail certainly would n't have made such a grand claim if it was n't absolutely true daniel garber chicago

boston president clinton has wanted from the start to concentrate on the domestic issues that elected him to that end , i believe , he has decided to avoid political conflict on foreign policy as much as possible , giving ground to conservative opponents there so as to husband his strength for the domestic battle that tactic explains a number of areas where mr clinton has clung to past conservative policies two current examples , important ones , are nuclear testing and angola legislation passed last year imposed a moratorium on nuclear testing until this july 1 from then until september 1996 the law allows 12 underground explosions to test the safety of nuclear weapons and 3 to test their reliability after that there would be none unless other countries tested according to reports over the weekend , mr clinton is likely soon to order a resumption of testing after july 1 he would do so despite overwhelming evidence that tests are unnecessary for military purposes , and would be extremely damaging to america s interest in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons the united states now has upward of 10 , 000 nuclear weapons the cold war is over everyone agrees that we need far fewer probably hundreds , not thousands under strategic arms agreements the us and russia are already committed to coming down to 5 , 000 each us forces are in the process of withdrawing many warheads the ones being taken out of service are older models newer ones with safety features to reduce the chance of accidental explosion will remain and bush administration officials told congress last year that the air force and navy do not want to put any new safety features on existing warheads moreover , the 1992 law allows testing of warheads with new safety features only if they are actually due for deployment not mere experiments if we resume testing , russia and france will probably follow , and perhaps china that would greatly reduce our leverage to persuade north korea and others not to go nuclear the havenots have always said that a universal test ban is a necessary preliminary to meaningful agreement on nonproliferation why , then , would president clinton be considering such a counterproductive step \? the answer is that he wants to avoid a fight with conservatives in the senate and the military who want to go on testing forever the pressure for tests originates in the three nuclear laboratories livermore in california , los alamos and sandia in new mexico they do not want to go out of business or have their work converted to something more useful and they have friends in washington so mr clinton s inclination is to compromise , to order enough tests so the laboratories and their backers will be content but no matter how he explains it , he would undermine his own leadership in the effort to keep nuclear weapons from spreading to new countries in angola , the civil war was supposed to have ended last fall , with a unsupervised election president jose eduardo dos santos won a plurality and his party a legislative majority but the rebel leader , jonas savimbi , denounced the results and resumed the war the government had naively cut its army as the peace agreement required , from 100 , 000 to about 10 , 000 as a result the savimbi forces have occupied large parts of the country many thousands of civilians have been killed or are starving , relief unable to get through in the past the united states withheld recognition from the angolan government because mr savimbi had powerful support among american conservatives now state department officials are pressing for recognition otherwise , they say , we look as if we are rewarding people who upset peace agreements and elections but so far president clinton has said no to recognition why \? the only reason i can see is that he does not want to upset jesse helms and other friends of savimbi the tactic of yielding to conservatives in foreign policy results in bill clinton doing things that were deplored by democrats when ronald reagan and george bush did them and the tactic rests on an unconvincing political theory giving way to your opponents in one area does not make you stronger in others it encourages the opposition to think you are weak

david koresh claimed to be god and threatened an apocalypse if federal agents stormed the compound near waco where his branch davidian followers were encircled for 51 days but there was nothing divinely ordained by yesterday s catastrophe it followed a dawn assault by the fbi meant to save lives by pumping nonlethal gas into the compound scores of people were killed , hours later , in a suicidal pyre evidently ignited by the branch davidians the demented mr koresh achieved his martyrdom , but this was assuredly not what the fbi , the justice department or president clinton wanted of at least 17 children in the compound , none are known to have survived as many as 70 adults are presumed dead president clinton and attorney general janet reno will need much better explanations than the visibly shaken ms reno gave yesterday to justify what looks like an illconceived and unwarranted operation on the facts as she presented them , time was on the authorities' side , and they threw it away as ms reno acknowledged , the assault was not the result of new circumstances or new ultimatums from mr koresh rather the showdown was approved in the belief that the armed standoff could not continue indefinitely , and that the current team surrounding the enclave would have to be replaced , requiring the training and preparation of a whole new group in the words of bob ricks , the fbi spokesman in waco , the impasse had to be brought to a logical conclusion at some point it is hard to believe that impatience alone could justify a risky showdown with an unbalanced adversary ms reno described the tear gas attack as an incremental increase in pressure on the cultists designed to encourage women and children to flee , with no intention that yesterday would become dday but assault by an armored vehicle equipped to poke holes in buildings seems like a large escalation of force more likely to make cultists think that dday had indeed arrived obviously the choices were cruel , and by all accounts fbi agents showed courage and restraint in not returning fire when dozens of rounds were directed at them from within the compound but in light of the tragedy , mr ricks s assertion that there was no question our plan was correct seems sadly to miss the point the plan , which ms reno said was approved unanimously by her advisers , and to which mr clinton gave his assent , assumed that mr koresh would yield without carrying out his suicidal threats the miscalculation was neartotal the koresh affair has been mishandled from beginning to end it started with a bungled attack by federal alcohol , tobacco and firearms agents in which four agents and unknown number of cultists were killed , and ended in yesterday s fbi misjudgment the hard lesson is that patience and determination do not cost lives , but impatience does does anyone now doubt that it would have been better to let the standoff in waco continue \?
hempstead , li , oct 25 it was only a month ago that the halloween date between the jets and giants held out the promise of a titanic clash the giants were 30 and had regained their footing in the national football conference east division the jets were 21 and appeared on their way to a resurgence in the american conference east but as the season has unfolded the two teams have gone in different directions the giants are 51 and atop the nfc east and the jets are 24 and at the bottom of the afc east and sunday s game at giants stadium not only lacks the expected drama but carries a different kind of urgency for the jets and their coach , bruce coslet after three straight defeats , including a 1910 loss to buffalo sunday , coslet s focus is on fixing his team and not the rivalry with the giants he is beginning to show signs of strain , snapping at reporters this afternoon for questioning the team s rosy perspective and sharply defending optimistic statements by quarterback boomer esiason and free safety ronnie lott if i'm going to get ridiculed by saying that we 're going to stay positive and if i'm going to get ridiculed by saying we 're a good team and boomer is going to get ridiculed by saying , 'hey , i think we 're pretty good , ' and if ronnie is going to get ridiculed for making a stupid mistake of saying that he s been on bad teams that have turned it around again , which is what he meant , then fine , coslet said ridicule us we 're trying as best we can to put it together we 're not getting it done we 're not aliibing because of the officials against the raiders we 're not alibiing because the philadelphia guy returned it 94 yards against us and there was an illegal block we 're not alibiing because buffalo s right tackle held 20 times we lose it does n't matter how you win you win by one point and you win it s a win or a loss that s all there is to it we 're judged on our wins and losses we 're not getting it done we i'm including myself in it we period end of statement later , coslet calmed down and seemed apologetic about his flareup i'm trying to keep my sense of humor , guys , he told reporters , whom he had chastised for the second time in two weeks this is difficult for me if we do n't stay positive , then we do n't have a chance to win out there , he said this is coslet s first jetsgiants matchup , but he said he attached no special significance to it one win or one loss , he said if we win the game we have n't turned anything around a lack of depth and the jets are badly in need of a turnaround at first coslet said he did n't know why the team was losing but later he said he knew exactly why it was losing he said the losses were a result of many problems , but he was n't going to share the reasons coslet has a policy of not publicly criticizing players he ca n't be very happy about the performances of some of his key players in the last three losses after getting off to a fast start in the first three games , the jets' offense has stumbled some of the problems can be attributed to injuries and some to ineptitude the team does n't have the depth to allow coslet to easily bench a starter who is n't doing his job , as dallas coach jimmy johnson might do nor can coslet expect a backup to perform at the same level as an injured starter for example , before injuries limited center jim sweeney , who sprained his ankle against the eagles and played just a quarter against the raiders , and right guard dwayne white , who missed the raiders game with a sprained ankle , the jets had given up only three sacks in the first three games all of them came in the season opener against denver but against the raiders and the bills , the jets yielded a total of six sacks the result of the defensive pressure has been less time for esiason to complete passes , less time for receivers to run better routes on sunday , the offensive line seemed incapable of blocking bills defensive end bruce smith on the interception that bills linebacker darryl talley returned 61 yards for the gamebreaking touchdown , smith beat left tackle jeff criswell and forced esiason to hurry the throw esiason struggles the team on the field against the bills last sunday bore little resemblance to the team that convincingly beat miami and new england and then went up by 210 on the eagles since that devastating 3530 loss to philadelphia , the jets' offense seems to have been unraveling esiason , who was brilliant for a stretch that went from the third quarter of the season opener at denver to the third quarter of the eagles game , reflects the jets' offensive plight in his first three games , esiason completed 723 percent of his passes for 909 yards , five touchdowns and two interceptions and was sacked three times in the last three games , esiason has completed 55 percent of his passes for 702 yards , thrown four touchdowns and had four interceptions two of them returned for gamebreaking touchdowns and has been sacked six times esiason had five completions for more than 40 yards in the first four games he has none in the last two he has n't completed a touchdown pass in the last nine quarters everybody is disturbed by what has happened the last few weeks , esiason said now we have to stop it you do n't push any particular buttons you just have to go back to work and make a commitment to your teammates that you 're going to know the new york giants better than you 've ever known any other football team and play it like it s your last football game that s the way we 're going to look at it extra points jets defensive end jeff lageman has a sprained shoulder and is listed as questionable for the giants game , as is dave cadigan , the left guard , who has a bruised thigh rob moore , the wide receiver who had arthroscopic surgery on a knee , and blair thomas , the running back who has been out with a hamstring injury , will run in practice on wednesday moore said he felt he could play sunday
two days after signing one of the best defensive centers in montreal history as their head coach , the devils yesterday added one of the best defensemen in canadiens' history as his assistant larry robinson , who was with six stanley cup winners in montreal , joined jacques lemaire , the hall of fame canadien hired monday to coach new jersey lemaire , who has eight stanley cup rings , and robinson were teammates for seven years in montreal and won five stanley cups during that time \( 1973 , 197679 \) the 42yearold robinson retired at the end of the 199192 season , after 20 years in the national hockey league he played 17 years with the canadiens and spent the last three with los angeles after signing with the kings as a free agent the devils signed robinson to a twoyear contract with an option for more i 've been looking to get into some area of the game , said robinson i did n't want to be a head coach right off the bat i did n't have the experience future hall of famer robinson is destined for the hall of fame , too he played 1 , 384 regularseason games and scored 958 points , fourth highest among defensemen his 227 games in the playoffs are the most by any player twice he won the norris trophy as the league s outstanding defenseman it appears that he will be lemaire s only assistant last season , under herb brooks , the devils had three assistants none of them has been rehired yet and one , doug sulliman , has left hockey to go into the securities business speaking by telephone from montreal , robinson said he considered it an honor and a privilege that lemaire had asked him to be his assistant he said that when they were teammates in montreal , the key to winning was good players working hard when it came time to practice , we did , robinson said when it came time to party , we did it together we were a tightknit group that went to the wall for each other lou lamoriello , the devils' president and general manager , is looking forward to robinson s help in elevating the devils , fourthplace finishers last season , to the next level the experience and knowledge he will bring to our whole team and our young defensemen , in particular , is invaluable , lamoriello said from the time jacques mentioned larry as his first choice for assistant , it became hard to imagine anyone else better suited to our needs

in beulah , a show that made its debut on abc in 1950 , the title character was a huge black maid with a mooching , irresponsible boyfriend a dimwitted , highstrung girlfriend a keen sense of rhythm , and an apparently inexhaustible supply of patience beulah was the first television sitcom to feature a black lead , preceding amos 'n' andy by a year it was one of several shows of the early 1950 s that helped perpetuate old stereotypes in a new medium , leading many black actors and politicians to protest that television represented a setback to the cause of equal rights over the next two decades , though , television was slowly to reveal that it had a more progressive streak as well even as amos 'n' andy reruns continued in syndication , television coverage of the civilrights movement was bringing the struggle to life for millions of viewers who might otherwise have had little sense of it and by the time the next comedy with a black heroine , julia , went on the air on nbc in 1968 , the familiar stereotypes along with any hint of racial strife were selfconsciously suppressed diahann carroll played a beautiful , talented nurse living in a perfectly integrated neighborhood this ambivalent history of blacks on television , from beulah through julia all the way up to oprah , is the subject of a new series of talks and screenings through march at the american museum of the moving image in astoria , queens the premise of the series , titled changing the picture the emergence of africanamericans in television , is that television images not only reflect but also help shape racial attitudes in this country the premise is particularly thoughtprovoking given the current state of race relations in new york city moving sometimes chronologically , sometimes thematically , the screenings offer a look at blacks on television that is alternately troubling , inspiring and entertaining it raises questions not only about programs written by whites that reinforced negative images of blacks , but also about blackoriented shows like in living color that in the search for laughs , often seem to come dangerously close to reenacting old stereotypes speakers in the series include malcolmjamal warner , the star of nbc s here and now , on monday melvin van peebles , the actor and film director , on jan 23 , and ms carroll on march 11 the screenings began this week with a set of programs that established the comic stereotypes of the 1950 s the jack benny show , with eddie \( rochester \) anderson as the gravelly voiced valet amos 'n' andy , with tim moore as the conniving kingfish , and trouble with father , with willie best as the brainless handyman in an episode from the second season of beulah , hattie mcdaniel fittingly teaches her small charge , donny , how to dance \( amos 'n' andy and trouble with father will be screened again at the museum on monday and feb 15 to 19 \) this weekend , in honor of martin luther king jr day on monday , the focus of the series will shift to television and the civilrights movement tomorrow at 2 pm , jim desmond and nick proferes will introduce free at last , their documentary about king , filmed in the months before his assassination and at 4 pm , there will be a screening of kenneth clark s interviews with king , malcolm x and james baldwin , originally broadcast on public television in the early years of television , variety shows were important showcases for black entertainers , and several of the biggest names in show business , among them ed sullivan and steve allen , actively promoted black performers on their programs white viewers , however , did not always respond favorably in early 1952 , for instance , eddie cantor invited sammy davis jr , then relatively unknown , to be on the colgate comedy hour during the show , cantor used his handkerchief to wipe davis s perspiring brow after the program , both men received baskets full of hate mail over this interracial contact as a result of white viewers' attitudes , blacks did not have much luck as hosts of their own variety shows to many blacks , the failure of the nat \( king \) cole show was one of the low points of television history the nat \( king \) cole show went on the air on nbc in late 1956 , but despite the host s enormous popularity as a recording artist , it could not find a national sponsor it was canceled after one year , prompting cole to write in ebony that madison avenue and their big clients did n't want their products associated with negroes scenes from the shortlived nat \( king \) cole show will be shown at the museum on sunday at 4 pm the colgate comedy hour episode with sammy davis jr will be shown next month on the news in contrast to the barriers black performers encountered in entertainment shows , news programs of the late 1950 s and the 60 s often provided sympathetic portraits of black political leaders and of their work in his book blacks and white tv \( nelsonhall , 1992 \) , one of the few extended studies of race and television , fred macdonald , a historian and film collector , writes , there can be no doubt that scenes of protest against racial injustice communicated nationally through tv in the early 1960 s did much to win popular support for meaningful reform

dominated by a trainer , shug mcgaughey , a cherubic 42yearold kentuckian who made history when he saddled the winners of five stakes races and one allowance race in fact , the only thing at belmont

the whirlpool corporation was declared the winner yesterday of a 30 million prize for the best design of a refrigerator that both saves energy and is gentler on the earth s protective ozone layer the company used refinements in conventional technology , rather than any radical new approaches , to win the award , which was offered by a consortium of electric utilities whirlpool , which markets refrigerators under the brand names whirlpool , kitchen aid and kenmore , beat frigidaire refrigerator products in the finals of a contest known in the industry as the golden carrot the company said it would begin selling refrigerators early next year that have none of the chlorofluorocarbon chemicals , or cfc s , used in conventional devices and that will use at least 25 percent less energy than current government standards because the 30 million put up by 24 utilities will be used to offset engineering and development costs , the new refrigerators will have prices similar to those of current models in markets served by the participating utilities in the new york area the utilities include the atlantic city electric company , jersey central power and light , the long island lighting company and the public service electric and gas company of newark whirlpool officials said they expect to sell 250 , 000 of the refrigerators in 1994 to 1997 , the life span of the superefficient refrigerator program a spokesman for the pacific gas and electric company of san francisco , whose 7 million contribution to the program was the biggest , said customers could expect to save 100 to 150 a year on their electricity bills with the new appliances because a refrigerator is turned on all the time , it is one of the largest users of electrical power in a typical home , accounting for about 20 percent of total consumption refrigerator makers have been struggling to meet federal requirements for more efficient operation , while also seeking substitutes for cfc chemicals used in the refrigerant fluid and in the foam that insulates the refrigerator production of the chemicals is set to cease in 1995 a number of radical technical proposals have been proposed , including using vacuum panels instead of foam insulation or controlling pistons in compressors electrically rather than mechanically but whirlpool said its new appliance was an extension of conventional technology reducing chlorine in the whirlpool model , the cfc12 used as the refrigerant in conventional models is being replaced by a compound that has no chlorine the chlorine in cfc s is regarded as the culprit in ozone degradation the cfc11 in the foam is to be replaced by a chemical with less chlorine , but this will probably be banned as well in the future whirlpool said its design included an improved compressor and better insulation as well as a computerchipcontrolled defrost system that adjusts the length and frequency of powerconsuming defrost cycles

the goodbye girl would be a better show , i think , if martin short were less likable that may seem a strange observation a number of things are clearly wrong with the musical that the playwright neil simon , the composer marvin hamlisch and the lyricist david zippel have fashioned from mr simon s 1977 film of the same name few spectators leaving the marquis theater these nights would count mr short among them , however after all , in this , his broadway debut , the motion picture star and saturday night live alumnus proves himself an engaging , if unorthodox , leading man he s been cast as elliot garfield , a chicago actor who arrives in manhattan one stormy night with the firm intention of forging a name for himself off off broadway new york ! he exults , having bounded onstage and taken in his new surroundings with a broad , excited sweep of the head just then a flash of lightning illuminates the landscape well , maybe they 'll fix it , he shrugs , shrugging off any doubts and reservations in the process a little realism is n't about to dampen his enthusiasm , poison his dreams or slow his scurrying step the unflagging energy not to mention a wide and swooping grin that can turn his face into an impish version of the happy button makes him difficult to resist giving him the best of the evening s quips , as mr simon has done , only strengthens his hand then , as if to guarantee that our allegiance wo n't wander , there s his miserable debut in the title role of richard iii this is to be no traditional production of shakespeare , you see the introspective hungarian director \( john christopher jones \) wants him to accentuate the feminine side of the monarch , or the queen in the king , if you will accordingly , at the end of act i , mr short sallies forth in gilded tights , blond sausage curls framing his anxious face , a gold lame hump hugging his back like some ridiculous highfashion knapsack i look like a rich cabbage patch doll , he moans , correctly sensing the artistic humiliation that awaits him frankly , who is n't going to cotton to this man \? and that s the problem there s a price to be paid for his likableness , and i'm afraid mr short s costar , bernadette peters , is the one who s paying it for what may well be the first time in her career , the actress vulnerability itself in such musicals as sunday in the park with george and mack and mabel seems sour and peevish the goodbye girl , like most of mr simon s comedies , puts two people together in uncomfortably close quarters and then encourages them to test each other s nerves no one appreciates urban angst as he does or better understands the comic potential of rentcontrolled togetherness while he once obliged sandy dennis and jack lemmon to spend a traumatic night in central park \( in the film the out of towners \) , the great outdoors is rarely acknowledged in his work the claustrophobic indoors is his chosen arena although the action unfolds this time in various locales around manhattan , the city is such a dark and glowering place , as santo loquasto has designed it , that even the outdoors qualifies as indoors chief among the evening s battlefields is the upper west side brownstone apartment occupied by paula mcfadden \( ms peters \) , a onetime dancer , and lucy , her 12yearold daughter when the curtain rises , paula has just been jilted by her lover , an actor who has run off to spain for a movie shoot and sublet the apartment without her knowing it sometime around midnight , on that stormy night , elliot , the unwitting sublettee , knocks at the door and , over paula s startled and increasingly vehement objections , moves in the irritations commence immediately logically , paula has every reason to be disturbed elliot strumming his guitar in the nude and burning incense at all hours in one bedroom of a cramped twobedroom flat is bound to be an inconvenience logic rarely governs our responses to plays , though why , we 're soon asking ourselves , ca n't she see what we do that elliot is a decidedly entertaining inconvenience the battle has barely been joined and already we 're on mr short s side the more we know him , the more ms peters s continuing protests strike us as crotchety he s mr nice guy flaky perhaps , but fun she s ms scold and no fun at all the basic equation is out of sync the film , which starred richard dreyfuss and marsha mason , got it right at the start , mr dreyfuss was loud and overbearing his habits were obnoxious as for manners , he possessed none ms mason was understandably on the defensive and even a bit helpless in dealing with so much callousness you automatically rooted for her and waited for the city s drama critics to humble him in the stage version , you root for him and wonder if she 'll ever warm up the film also dealt ms mason a trump card a 10yearold daughter played by quinn cummings , who , despite an alarming precocity , was very much a child adding two years to her age puts the character on the cusp of young womanhood wiser , hipper , no longer quite so innocent which is precisely how tammy minoff portrays her in the musical ms cummings needed shielding ms minoff belongs to the mall generation , which makes a point of fending for itself that seriously undercuts paula s mothering instincts she ends up protecting a child who does n't require much protection from a lout who is n't a lout at all once again , ms peters suffers the consequences
burlington , mass in 1988 , after nearly 15 years in business , mitchell e kertzman came to a conclusion that strikes fear into the hearts of many smallbusiness people his company was going nowhere fast in a rapidly changing industry while the manufacturing software company , with 18 million in sales , was still marginally profitable , it was a small player in a large market , and mr kertzman saw no way to gain market share without making some dramatic moves unlike many executives , who would be frozen with uncertainty and doubt , mr kertzman decided to bet his company on a new and untested technology to either succeed or go down in flames , as he puts it he hired a software designer , david litwack , with an idea for a new software tool for the corporate computing market huddled with six programmers in a single room near the company kitchen , mr litwack set to work creating the new product , called powerbuilder over the next three years mr kertzman struggled to appease his other employees , who viewed the new development team as a drain on valuable resources , and searched for venture financing to keep the company , computer solutions , afloat mr kertzman s gamble has paid off handsomely powerbuilder sales have jumped from 50 , 000 to 22 million in just 18 months and mr kertzman s company , renamed powersoft and based in burlington , a suburb northwest of boston , rocked wall street in february with one of the most successful initial public offerings of the last year , nearly doubling its opening 20 per share price the first day to close at 3825 \( the stock , which trades on nasdaq , closed at 2950 on friday \) reminiscent of silicon valley offerings that characterized the 1980 s , powersoft s debut has made the witty and ebullient mr kertzman , 44 years old , a multimillionaire while enriching the venture capitalists who own much of the company s equity forty of the company s 170 employees also became paper millionaires , mr litwack said it was clear we were not turning into a big winner , mr kertzman said so i went to my board of directors , who were mostly venture capitalists , and said , 'i want to bet the company , go deeply into the red for two years and build this tool' they gave me the green light , which was unusual for venture capitalists since the successful offering , mr kertzman said , he takes time at every meeting to beg employees not to watch the stock price and to concentrate on keeping the company moving forward as for himself , he said , if anyone sees any sign of me becoming arrogant , i 've issued orders to shoot me immediately indeed , mr kertzman s company is by no means in the clear competitors like umang gupta , founder and chairman of the gupta corporation in menlo park , calif , note that powersoft is a oneproduct company in a market with a very low barrier to entry he said he expected tough competitors like microsoft and sybase to enter the market and give powersoft a run for its money mr kertzman began his career a long way from software after dropping out of brandeis university in 1968 , he pursued a career in radio , but was fired after just four months as a boston disk jockey desperate for a job , he got hooked on computer programming and in 1974 started his company as a oneman contract programming shop most of his clients were in manufacturing , and by the early 1980 s he had decided to shift from programming to selling a software product that helps manufacturers control inventories , allocate resources and complete many other tasks he remembers his struggle he was on food stamps when he started in computers even after the computer solutions software business was up and running , he took 30 , 000 in salary and plowed the rest of the profit back into the business but after realizing that his manufacturing software business was not the ticket , mr kertzman invested his faith and money in mr litwack , who had n't been able to persuade venture capitalists to finance his idea mr kertzman shared mr litwack s vision a tool that would make it easy for programmers to write complex software that could be run on networks of personal computers hooked to powerful work stations called servers for two decades , business software for order processing , inventory controls , accounts receivable and the like has been run on large , expensive mainframe computers powerbuilder provides guidelines to help programmers accustomed to writing software for mainframes write the same type of program for networks of lessexpensive personal computers running microsoft windows for example , programmers at american airlines have used powerbuilder to write programs that enable their pilots to schedule training sessions on flight simulators mr litwack and his team got to work the summer of 1990 was a very bad time , he recalled we were an isolated group and if not for mitchell , we 'd have been out of there mr kertzman not only poured 3 million into mr litwack s project , he began to see that powerbuilder could bring tremendous growth and render his current manufacturing software expendable
zarqa , jordan , march 7 in cramped , unheated rooms on the outskirts of amman , the relatives of mohammed a salameh , the man charged in the bombing of the world trade center , gathered today and pondered the magnitude of the crime and the infamy that has befallen their name he went to the united states to get a job and make money , said aysha salameh , his mother , as she keened to and fro in a red vinyl chair and clutched a damp tissue he went to make something of himself , to speak english , to study , to have a future and now they say that he did all this , that he did this bomb no , no , no the woman , besieged by neighbors and relatives who came to the home on a narrow dirt lane to express their support , stopped to gain her composure as she pulled herself together all that was heard in the small room , crowded with men of the salameh clan , was the ticking of a wall clock and the soft clink of the prayer beads that slowly circulated between the men s calloused fingers refugee in infancy he was a gentle man , said a cousin , ali mohammed salameh he would not commit such an act he was not a person of violence mohammed salameh was arrested on thursday and charged with helping in the attack that killed five people mohammed salameh s childhood , like those of many palestinians of his generation , was rudely interrupted by war israeli troops occupied biddiya , his village on the west bank , three months before he was born his father , amin salameh , a lieutenant in the jordanian army , packed his wife , five boys and six girls , and left with thousands of other palestinians for amman when the boy was two months old the home and most of the possessions were left behind the infant did not know it , but he had become a refugee the family settled in the palestinian slums here mr salameh grew up amid a mass of concrete hovels and dirt streets , where many palestinians still live piled one on top of the other to supplement the army pension , his father took a job for an import clearing house but the family always lived just a few steps away from poverty the squalid streets of zarqa seemed a long way from the idyllic world of palestine , or at least that version of palestine that was dished out to the brood of children a color photograph of the dome of the rock , the muslim holy site in jerusalem , hangs prominently in the living room , as it does in many households here zarqa offers what vices jordan can serve up cheap hashish , a few weapons and a trade in stolen goods but jordanian authorities say that neither mr salameh nor his family had any record of being involved in the criminal activity that is endemic in the country s thirdlargest city , where those who have legitimate jobs work mining phosphate and potash the boy was not a good student and had trouble finishing school he wanted to study law or engineering , his mother said , but he was not accepted into these schools he could only get into the islamic law department at jordan university , although he never finished his studies his mother handed over a picture of her son at school , dressed in a neat blue suit and bearded he became pious and prayed a lot , said his brother ahmed he stayed only with friends who were religious he gave up everything else for religion he grew a beard 'not a fanatic' but the family , which does not run a strict islamic household , insists he steered clear of radical religious groups he used to spend a lot of time in mosques , listening to the clerics , said a cousin we could see he was becoming very religious , but he was not a fanatic his religion , his family says , was only an example of his piety i go to prayers , his father said , but that does not make me a fundamentalist when mr salameh was 19 , he abandoned his studies and tried to find a job he looked and looked , his mother said , but there was nothing against his parents' objections he announced he was leaving jordan for the united states his departure six years ago was the last time he saw any members of his immediate family rough times in new york two years after he left jordan , his father finished building a small house , with four bedrooms , where they now live he had so many dreams then , his mother said , of a job , of money he told us how he was going to help us but the streets of new york apparently did not embrace the young arab with much more enthusiasm than those he had left at home he took a few menial jobs , but after four months was destitute , the family said he turned , for the first and only time , to his one relative in new york , a doctor , and asked for a 400 loan but his relative , who had emigrated to the united states 20 years before , turned him down the refusal to aid a member of the family , so foreign a concept in the culture he had left behind , seemed , according to his parents , to have steeled in him a hatred for the callousness of the society he had entered it was unemployment and poverty that drove him to the united states , said his mother , and it was unemployment and poverty he found when he got there this was very bitter for a while he stocked shelves in a supermarket for below minimum wage his parents were unsure where but one day he came to work and they had replaced him , his mother said i remember him telling us this story , and he was out on the street again the young man seemed to begin drifting into a world his parents did not know jobs and addresses became vague they say they were often unsure about his work and his contacts but nearly every month he called home , asked a few questions about his brothers and sisters and assured everyone he was well small money orders intermittently reached the house he sent us about 4 , 000 during all the time he was in the united states , his mother said i guess that s not much , but he tried so hard he never asked us for anything he always wanted to help the last phone call came in january it was , the family said , the usual brief exchange of pleasantries , all parties acutely conscious of the meter ticking away the charge on the international line in the conversation he mentioned a woman and there seemed in the air to be the prospect of marriage the call was taken at the neighbor s house , as the family has no phone of their own the next time his parents heard of mr salameh he was in the news after hearing of the arrest , the family said , mr salameh s father went to jordanian security officials to ask whether they had any information , but they said they had none for these palestinians each pushed unjustly , they believed , from their homes on the west bank after the 1967 war , and some pushed again out of kuwait after the persian gulf war there is only one group capable of bringing this latest disaster into their lives the jews , mrs salameh uttered with a vehemence that shattered the calm that had descended on the room this is from the jews , who have done this and blamed my son you will see that he is innocent heads nodded in support men , to ward off the cold of the night air , pulled their brown , wool cloaks closer over their legs and the mother turned to the only american in the room will they let him pray in jail \? she asked , or in this great democracy is this forbidden \? i hear they do not let him practice his religion , that conditions are very bad in jail my son , said

those who would disagree , as i do , with some of the specific proposals in president clinton s economic program must give him credit for his boldness and political courage in advocating them and for his indefatigable efforts to sell them to the american people if he demonstrates the same leadership qualities in addressing the major foreign policy issue of our time , he can secure his place in history as a great president that issue is the survival and success of political and economic freedom in russia that is not to say that the mideast , iraq and bosnia are not also important , or that the nations of eastern europe and the other former soviet states do not also deserve priority attention where they have democratically elected governments and have initiated serious freemarket economic reform but what happens in russia will have an enormous effect on those nations , on our allies and on the united states without a substantial increase in aid from the west , the yeltsin government will not survive the us must lead in providing it it is a very tough sell for the president the last gallup poll showed that only 4 percent of voters considered foreign policy to be an important issue in mr clinton s nationally televised town meeting , there was only one question concerning foreign policy it was about bosnia his political advisers understandably will tell him , as they did in the campaign , it s the economy , stupid ! but foreign and domestic policy are like siamese twins one cannot survive without the other if boris yeltsin s democratic government collapses and is replaced by an aggressive , hardline nationalist government , this will have a far greater impact on the american economy than all the clinton domestic programs combined the peace dividend will be down the tubes the defense budget will have to be increased by billions of dollars rather than cut this would mean that the president s plan to cut the deficit would have to be taken off the table the russian democracy is going through a deadly crisis the negative factors are frightening russia has 31 republics and provinces that have declared their sovereignty and 132 nationalities before the peaceful revolution of december 1991 , the russian people had never known either political or economic freedom what works in poland , the czech republic and hungary will not work in russia russia is going through an economic downturn worse than the great depression of the 1930 s in the united states in 1992 inflation was 25 percent a month , the gross national product was down 20 percent , and living standards were down 50 percent there has been an alarming increase in crime and corruption separatist tendencies and nationalistic conflicts which had been cooled by the cold war are getting hot again , ranging from bloody war in the transcaucasus and central asia to confrontation over minority rights in the baltic states but despite these overwhelming odds , the conventional wisdom of most of the american media that the russian democracy is doomed is off the mark there is still strong support for reform among political leaders and the russian people the real political battle today is not between reformers and reactionaries , but between different kinds of reforms there are those like mr yeltsin who prefer to act swiftly and decisively , and those like the civic union which would rather move more gradually the fact that all political leaders except for the extreme reactionaries pay at least lip service to a free market economy means there will be no turning back to communism the negative news from russia has completely obscured the positive news just as washington is not america , moscow is not russia while political infighting is big news in moscow , privatization and growth are proceeding irreversibly in other parts of russia twenty percent of the gnp is now produced by private enterprise more than 30 percent of russian workers are in private enterprise the press is free privatizing the economy has helped to eliminate shortages no one talks about the possibility of starvation , as was the case when i was in moscow just nine months ago most important , as experts like james billington and gerald corrigan have pointed out , the caricature that russian workers are not responding to economic incentives is false in a meeting in st petersburg two weeks ago , private entrepreneurs unanimously agreed that , when given the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of a free society , russian workers are among the best in the world they are also among the best educated ninety percent have graduated from high school a higher percentage than in the united states can boris yeltsin survive \? some western leaders i talked to question it some of his opponents in russia doubt it most shocking , the state department officer who was in charge of aid to russia publicly predicted last month that he would not last with friends like that , mr yeltsin needs no enemies his approval rating is down sharply because of the economic downturn but he is still the most popular politician in russia he has made serious mistakes in dealing with the parliament he inherited from mikhail gorbachev but while revolutionary leaders are generally good at destroying old orders but not good at governing new ones , mr yeltsin has surprised even his critics by his political skill in handling what must be the most difficult political position in the world
officials announced yesterday that the twin towers of the world trade center would be closed for at least a week , and gov mario m cuomo asked the federal government to make lowinterest loans available to small businesses affected by the bombing in a center garage on friday in a race to prepare for the work week , executives and workers at the huge financial center in lower manhattan yesterday turned their aplomb and ingenuity to finding ways to carry on business in temporary quarters officials of the five commodities exchanges were granted permission to reopen this morning in one of the center s smaller buildings , dodging what would have been a major blow to the nation s businesses the big brokerage houses in the trade center , which was damaged by a bomb on friday , also said they had arranged alternative locations that will allow them to keep working page d1 but many small firms , as well as restaurants and shops near the sevenbuilding complex , faced grave uncertainty and the possibility of devastating financial losses some neighborhood fastfood stores were already cutting their staffs , expecting lower manhattan to look like a ghost town today city and state officials said they expected larger firms to be more resilient they said they did not anticipate lasting devastation to the city s economy or a flight of panicked tenants from the complex 'pretty severe' the impact on small businesses could be pretty severe , and we recognize that , said richard c leone , the chairman of the board of the port authority of new york and new jersey but he added , i think it s a mistake to say this is an economic disaster for new york , the region or the country two days after thousands of people fled from the smokefilled buildings , trade center tenants yesterday milled about in the marble lobby of a nearby building where port authority officials had opened a command center working on folding tables , officials tried to find alternative arrangements for affected businesses , while some workers were being escorted to their offices by police officers to retrieve vital documents and computer files while four buildings of the sevenbuilding complex will be reopening today , the two 110story towers will be closed , and there was still considerable confusion about where many of the 55 , 000 people who work in the center were to go this morning anne compoccio , the supervisor of the mailroom at the engineering company ebasco inc said she had told the 18 employees who work for her to stand by for instructions in the meantime , she planned to pick up the company mail , usually five or six bags , at the post office either i 'll take it to the lindenhurst office , or i 'll sort it out at my house , she said we have to go on we ca n't let this stop us the aetna life and casualty company , which had 350 employees at 2 world trade center , found itself in the unusual position of handling its own crisis instead of everyone else s we have a lot of experience with natural catastrophes hurricanes , earthquakes , said stephen m wasdick , a company spokesman it s so unusual for us to have a manmade disaster that affects our own employees he said customers would notice no difference , with calls rerouted to the company s long island offices in garden city and lake success but the executives had not yet decided where to send workers state and city officials declined to estimate the extent of losses from the devastation , beyond acknowledging that it would be in the millions of dollars but after canvassing almost all of the 350 tenants of the complex , they said none had said they were so traumatized that they wanted to move we have n't heard that from one business , said vincent tese , the state commissioner of economic development their question is , 'when are we going to get back in' the world trade center contains 10 percent of lower manhattan s office space and some of its biggest

trade center clients over the weekend this is going to be a wild scene tomorrow , said doug mello , new york telephone s group vice president for manhattan so we 're getting ourselves organized to try to accommodate priority requests for these customers if they want to go to another location mr mello said the company already had requests for 1 , 000 telephone lines and 100 data transmission lines telephone company officials said most phone lines were being rerouted through computers at new york telephone s central office many seemed determined to prove the observation of samuel m ehrenhalt ,

the heat , the passion , the aggressiveness were all there , just as advertised , just as dallas green had promised unfortunately for the new mets manager , also present last night at shea stadium was the same team that cost jeff torborg his job wednesday a 42 loss to the atlanta braves brought to a halt what euphoria had greeted green in his first appearance in a mets uniform it also brought to green s attention some of the kinds of plays and pitching that have helped dig the mets into such a deep hole in the national league east while the braves poked and prodded mets pitchers , the mets' hitters were for the most part stymied by greg maddux \( 43 \) the first hitter sent to the plate scored , but the mets did not get another run until the ninth , on a pair of oneout singles and a sacrifice fly by bobby bonilla futility marked the time between the rallies as maddux dominated , at one point retiring 18 straight green saw positives but he also saw some flaws i 've already talked about that , he said after the game not with you he spoke with a smile , meaning his words were n't intended for the news media , but for someone , or ones in uniform later , green admitted that the talk was with bonilla , the right fielder who committed a fielding error , the team s 32d of the season but green did n't take bonilla or anyone else to the woodshed i did n't really hear myself get too hightoned tonight , he said instead , he talked to bonilla about how the fans' negative perceptions of his play could affect his performance if he allows them to the discussion was only one sign that green wants bonilla and the team to change damaging tendencies now , while they still can i do n't think it s any secret that this team has not played well defensively , or we would n't be where we are , said green that s something , in my mind , you can improve on and we 're going to put a program in to try to address some of those problems temper , temper what little fire there was came in the form of a tantrum from an uncharacteristic source howard johnson , one of the quieter mets who rarely slips off an even keel , slipped into a frenzy in the third inning the blowup came after the braves put two runners on with none out atlanta s otis nixon bunted toward the mets' starter , eric hillman hillman , gambling and losing , tried to throw out mark lemke at third the play was close , but the umpire , jerry layne , ruled lemke safe johnson flew off , starting his argument with a chestbutt of the umpire he hit me right here , layne said , pointing to his chest that s why i ejected him i lost it , admitted johnson , who suffered his firstever ejection as a professional why \? the situation with dallas and all that stuff , johnson said we had a really exciting meeting , we had a onerun lead that we were nursing , i knew it was going to be a lowscoring game besides , said johnson , he made a bad call good or bad , the result could be damaging to the mets the contact , which johnson described as incidental and layne described as not , could result in further sanctions i just hope i do n't get suspended , johnson said with the out and johnson lost , the mets found themselves in a basesloaded situation characteristically , they could not find their way out , as atlanta proceeded to score twice dissecting that rally , green would not have to look far to see the traits that led the mets to last place the braves' third was fueled by the kind of niggling mistakes and nearmisses that opened the way for so many of the mets' previous 25 losses first , hillman \( 02 \) committed one of baseball s most obvious faux pas by walking his counterpart , maddux , giving the braves two runners with none out then came nixon s grounder and a runscoring single by jeff blauser and bonilla s error , allowing a second run on the same play the game did not start with such a worldweary feeling for the mets they scored first and aggressively , too vince coleman , who won green s praise , opened with an infield single , stole second and eventually scored on a ground out by eddie murray inside pitch outfielder deion sanders rejoined the braves for the first time since april 29 after agreeing to a threeyear contract reportedly worth 11 million mets manager dallas green named braves advance scout bobby wine as his bench coach photos mets' howard johnson bumping thirdbase umpire jerry layne , left , in the third inning last night he was promptly thrown out of the game \( g paul burnett the new york times \)
cairo , july 8 the egyptian government hanged seven militant followers of sheik omar abdel rahman today for attacks against foreign tourists and conspiring to overthrow the government of president hosni mubarak it was the largest number of executions for a political crime in more than four decades the decision to execute such a large group of militants is a turning point for the president , who has in the past refused to carry out executions for political crimes egyptian officials , worried about inflaming the islamic militant movement , have hesitated to confront their adversaries head on and provide the radicals with martyrs mr mubarak s government has asked the united states to return the blind cleric to egypt , where he faces criminal charges as the united states and egypt struggle over how to deal with the sheik , a new problem has emerged senior administration officials say the extradition treaty between the two countries does not appear to offer legal justification for returning him to egypt page a3 the hangings carry with them a risk of increased attacks by followers of the islamic movement bent on revenge while the executions have intensified the duel between the government and islamic militants few people expect the government policy to lead to widespread demonstrations this will create a feeling of rebellion among many egyptians , said ali ismaeel , one of the lawyers for the militants the government was winning the propaganda war over the last few months but this will turn sympathy back toward the militants followers of mr abdel rahman , who is now in detention on immigration charges in the united states , were linked to the bombing of the world trade center and a plot to blow up several sites in new york city and assassinate political leaders , including the egyptian president the seven men executed today were sentenced to death by a military court in april they were found guilty of attempted murder in six specific attacks on tourist buses and a nile cruise ship last year they were executed at the tora prison complex one at a time , the first at 7 am in the morning , and the last three hours later , according to military prosecutors four of the seven men had just finished high school , had grown up together and came from a small village in southern egypt 9 executions since june the egyptian government has put to death nine men since june 13 for involvement in armed militant attacks and have 13 more on death row the militants were all convicted by special military courts that began to try terrorist crimes last october the 22 death sentences handed out for politically motivated crimes dwarfs anything seen in egypt in many years in 1982 five men found guilty of assassinating president anwar elsadat were executed , and in 1954 the same number were hanged after being tied to a plot to kill president gamal abdel nasser but the executions are part of a broad government crackdown there have been hundreds of arrests , armed raids on militant hideouts that have left over 30 suspected militants dead , and swift , and often harsh , sentences meted out by the military courts , where defendants have no right of appeal government officials , who have rounded up close to 800 people they accuse of plotting assassinations and a wave of bombings , said they would soon obtain indictments that could lead to some of the biggest trials yet against muslim militants criticism by rights groups human rights groups have criticized the government for the tough measures and a recent amnesty international report said egyptian security forces appear to have been given a license to kill with impunity the president , however , has made it clear he will continue the push to break the militant movement , even in the face of outside censure i refuse to allow human rights to become a slogan to protect terrorists , the president told reporters the islamic group , which sees sheik abdel rahman as its spiritual leader , has attacked the police , coptic christians , government officials and foreign tourists in its war against the government in the last 18 months 180 people have been killed in violence related to islamic militancy the egyptian government presented the united states with a formal extradition request for the cleric on sunday to stand trial here and the cleric s followers have vowed to attack american targets and americans living in egypt and other countries , unless the sheik is released the men executed today were convicted of being behind , among other incidents , an ambush against a tourist bus last november in which five germans were wounded six of the militants were said to have been directly involved in the bus attack in the southern town of qena , and the seventh was accused of being the head of the armed cell , and the planner of two other attacks none of the total of 49 defendants in the case were accused of involvement in the worst attack against tourists last october , when militants fired on a bus and killed a british woman the seven men were among 32 militants convicted of attacks against tourists the rest got prison terms of up to 25 years the court acquitted the 17 other defendants the attacks against foreign visitors have wrecked the country s tourism industry , which once brought in over 2 billion a year and the violence continues to plague the capital in may and june five nail bombs left 16 people dead and 63 wounded
trenton , june 19 although new jersey s pioneering ban on militarystyle assault rifles was sold to the state as a crimefighting measure , its impact on violence in the state , two years after it took effect , has been negligible , both sides agree , and debate over its impact is colored more by opinion than by fact of the tens of thousands , and possibly hundreds of thousands , of assault weapons that state officials had said were in the hands of the public , only about 2 , 000 have been accounted for since their possession was outlawed , on may 30 , 1991 the stores that sold the guns do not miss the business , their owners say , and so far , no one has been sent to jail purely for possession of one of the weapons and like the worried nature lovers who flocked to join the sierra club or wilderness society in response to the reagan administration s environmental policies a decade ago , worried gun owners in new jersey have tripled the size of the state s national rifle association affiliate in the aftermath of the fight over gun control membership has grown to 12 , 000 from 4 , 000 since 1990 , when the bill was introduced , said cal ellis , president of the association of new jersey rifle and pistol clubs , the state arm of the nra an example for others for his part , gov jim florio can still count his defeat of the republican legislative majority s effort to rescind the gun ban as a high point of his term and with connecticut s enactment of a similar ban earlier this month and with new york state now considering its own version , mr florio s prediction that new jersey would set an example for other states is coming true moreover , mr florio intends to use the gun issue against his republican challenger in this fall s election , christine todd whitman mrs whitman has avoided giving her views of the governor s legislative showpiece , and she shows signs of being uncomfortable with her party s opposition to the ban still , the ban has not yet turned out to be the crimebuster that it was sold as if we can get these guns out of the hands of criminals , we will all be better off , mr florio said in 1990 until the ban was imposed , the police were not required to keep statistics on the number of crimes involving assault rifles in the years since , the statistics show them to be a tiny fraction 026 of 1 percent of the total the banned weapons are civilian versions of military rifles they are not capable of automatic fire , instead requiring a pull of the trigger for each round but their magazines hold more rounds than standard rifles and can be fired longer without overheating their barrels are also shorter , making the gun easier to conceal 'like the machine gun' the florio administration once estimated the number of assault rifles in the state at 300 , 000 , but later revised the estimate to about 40 , 000 we 're ready to concede that there is not a really high percentage of crimes committed with assault firearms , and we 're going to make sure that number does n't grow , said frederick devesa , first assistant attorney general it s like the machine gun , which was once used in a large number of crimes , but you do n't see them used that much anymore machine guns were all but outlawed for civilian ownership by the federal government 70 years ago opponents of the ban are unmoved by such an explanation pure nonsense , political pap , said joseph constance , deputy chief of police on the trenton force and , as a republican mercer county freeholder and whitman ally , a political enemy of governor florio assault rifles have never been an issue in law enforcement i have been on this job for 25 years and i have n't seen a drug dealer carry one they are not used in crimes , they are not used against police officers possession charges increase dominick polifrone , head of the new jersey bureau of the federal bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms , agrees , but nevertheless praised new jersey s law as an aid to law enforcement i 've never encountered an assault rifle , mr polifrone said in an interview the guns we have been dealing with are mostly 9millimeter handguns , 38caliber pistols and 25millimeter handguns , because they 're easier to conceal at the time the ban was enacted , mass killings with assault rifles had occurred in california and some other states , but new jersey had not experienced such an incident according to the annual report required by the gun law , in 1992 the incidence of crimes with assault weapons declined in all categories from 1991 , the law s first full year , save in arrests for illegal possession state and county prosecutors have made it a policy not to go after simple possession of the outlawed guns and to seize them only in connection with other investigations this policy has strengthened the florio administration s argument that otherwise innocent people have not been targeted under the gun law the 147 assault rifles seized since the law was enacted thus all came from people who were stopped or searched for other reasons about half of them had arrest records many weapons missing but , said evan nappen , a monmouth county defense attorney who specializes in weapons issues , that also means more than half of those charged with gun law violations had no records he said he was currently defending several people whose charges include illegal possession of the outlawed guns some of my clients' guns were found in transportation stops , some were confiscated under the forfeiture rules of the domestic violence act , or pursuant to a bail or court order , he said none of my client s guns were seized in commission of a crime none charles steen , owner of sarco , a firearms and war memorabilia outlet in passaic township , said that before the ban he had sold between 50 and 100 assaulttype rifles of out total annual sales of about 5 , 000 guns the guns ranged in price from 250 to 800 he said loss of the business had not affected him much those guns were never that important in this business , he said in an interview during a oneyear grace period that ended in may 1991 , owners of the guns could sell them to dealers or out of state or could make the guns incapable of firing by removing the firing pin , then register the deactivated weapon owners of four types of guns used in shooting competitions could keep them by joining a recognized shooting club an additional 26 gun owners turned their weapons over to the state police to be destroyed no one knows what has become of the tens of thousands of other outlawed weapons michael hudak , a gun salesman at dosil sporting goods in keansburg in monmouth county , said three or four owners tried to sell their guns back to him , but he refused what was i going to do with them \? he said i 'd just have to find someone else to take them so some of these guys lost hundreds of dollars when they had to get rid of their guns graph gauging the effect of a weapons ban shows

hillsborough , carriacou in these times of blossoming multiculturalism , the tiny island of carriacou has decided that selfrespect demands that it too should join the struggle to say its piece for too long , residents say , they have been the silent victims of their administrative overlords in grenada , or the mainland , 20 miles to the south , and recently they have begun to insist that they be allowed to assert their own traditions the unlikely inspiration for this dissonance under the sedating windward climes is an activity that the 6 , 000 carriacouans assert is ingrained in their very fiber contraband , or bobol , as it is known in the local , frenchinspired patois in a debate that they say strongly echoes the american independence movement against britain , they have begun to argue that with little in the way of return on their taxes paid to grenada , there is no reason they should submit to customs duties on imported goods imposed by their sister island invoking their birthright unlike grenada with its banana and nutmeg farming , they say , the people here make their living through a combination of fishing and sailing from island to island throughout the region , trading goods freely and informally and returning with whatever is lacking at home to interfere with this livelihood , carriacouans can be heard to say nowadays , would be to rob them of their birthright fittingly , the patrick henry of this drama is an americantrained lawyer , anselm b clouden , who by evoking the seafaring ways of his ancestors , and their descendants' supposed mistreatment at the hands of grenadians , has begun to arouse strong nationalist passions in his neighbors to the outsider , carriacouans and grenadians can seem very much alike , both in appearance and accent as might be suspected , the two islands share much history , from the destruction of local indian populations , to the importation of slave labor from west africa and colonial rule under france , then britain but comparisons bring from mr clouden a detailed and impassioned accounting of the cultural differences that separate the people here from their neighbors in grenada a different mentality grenada has evolved from a plantocracy , so their mentality is different from ours , said mr clouden , peppering his speech with phrases like liberty or death , and taxation without representation , evocative of the american revolution we being a small island look to the sea for our living our forefathers always made their living the same way , risking their lives as brave men to bring the goods home to their valiant wives trade has never been subjected to customs here , and what the grenadians are trying to do to us is nothing short of the kind of ethnic discrimination that many have suffered from in your country on the streets of hillsborough , the waterfront town of 600 that would serve as capital if this 16squaremile speck of land were to achieve its dream of independence , others put this sentiment more simply , but with similar conclusions the grenadians are a bit different from us , but i ca n't say exactly why , said lennox corion , a taxi driver we have an old saying here that if a carriacouan and a grenadian get married , their life together wo n't last if carriacou can be said to have had its own tea party , most residents would say the event was the arrival some months back of a british customs expert contracted by the government of grenada to see to it that import duties were being paid here when the agent arrived on a saturday , residents recount , none of the island s few taxis would carry him with his bags to his temporary residence on the next monday , when offices opened , local government workers too refused to help him , and police officers had to be sent from grenada to assist many here described this passive resistance as a deeply satisfying , if appropriately lowkey , act of defiance for a slumbering fishing settlement where chickens feel secure enough to rest in potholes because of the lack of traffic i would n't speak of an insurrection , but whenever government is destructive to the rights of its citizens , the people must contemplate their own liberation , mr clouden intoned gravely , talking up the idea of forcing a vote on secession in the next elections when we meet eyeball to eyeball , every true carriacouan simply wishes to be left alone patience is urged but while mr clouden dreams of a new republic nourished by what he says could be a boom in things like tourism and international ship registry , many of his fellow carriacouans seem to have less exalted aspirations i am one of those people who believe that we have to have a little patience , said cuthbert snagg , a shirtless 32yearold who was repairing the small boats he rents to the occasional tourist it is true that grenada has neglected us , but we should focus on getting a few basics , like running water and some paved roads otherwise , i am afraid people will be expecting much too much too soon photo trade has never been subjected to customs here , and what the grenadians are trying to do to us is nothing short of the kind of ethnic discrimination that many have suffered from in your country , said anselm b clouden , the patrick henry of a growing dispute between carriacou and grenada \( howard w

of all the battles the founders of the benjamin banneker academy have waged to open one of new york city s 32 small new public high schools on time in september , none has proven more intractable than the matter of the subversively angling wall architects at pratt institute , the brooklyn design school sponsoring the new school , penciled the angling wall into the academy s floor plans to widen a hallway at one end , creating a student gathering area easily monitored from staff offices but when the blueprints were sent to the board of education , an official there refused to approve them , calling the wall a costly deviation from the gridlike lines customary in public schools weeks of negotiations have halted work on the classroom space the board leased for the school as a result , with less than seven weeks until school opens , the academy s founders are scrambling to find temporary quarters one board of education bureaucrat who wants straight walls on the cookiecutter model has held us up for weeks , said state assemblyman roger l green , the school s most influential advocate mix of support and resistance the trials and triumphs of the parents , politicians and educators organizing the banneker academy open a window into the mix of enthusiasm , resignation and resistance with which the vast bureaucracy has reacted to one of the most ambitious efforts in years to overhaul the city s high schools these new schools are a way to stimulate change for the entire system , said stanley s litow , who as deputy chancellor presided over preparations for the new schools until he left office june 30 but by definition , bureaucracies resist change which is difficult and threatening , and there s been a lot of resistance but also a lot of support , from the most unlikely of quarters the 32 new high schools are all designed to offer a more intimate and personal education than has been possible in many of the city s 125 existing high schools , some of which have as many as 5 , 000 students located in existing schools , college campuses or leased space , most of the new schools will focus their curriculum on a specific theme and will provide various forms of learning outside the classroom and though the schools offer specialized instruction , they are not allowed to recruit only elite students the banneker academy , named after an 18thcentury engineer , is to teach math , science and technology , both through traditional schoolwork and having the students work on construction projects in the clinton hillfort greene area in some ways , the academy has received especially generous treatment because of mr green s influence , officials said the board voted in june to spend 23 million to build classrooms for the academy in a warehouse space at pratt , far more money than most of the new schools have received approval , then resistance nonetheless , mr green and his collaborators on the banneker planning team , which includes several pratt faculty members and jan atwell , a veteran parent advocate , say that since the board approved their plans in march , they have had to struggle with school officials' pressuring to enlarge class sizes , union officials' seeking to control teacher hiring , and regulations limiting the length of the school day and year the board and the unions support the idea of the new schools , said ms atwell , vice president of the united parents association , a citywide coalition , who helped found the academy but in practice , none of the players have really relinquished control organizers of many other new schools reported problems finding space , signing up students and hiring staff three have had such severe troubles that they have delayed opening until september 1994 perhaps those casualties are not surprising , given the sweep of the attempted changes opening more new experimental high schools in one term than the city has opened , cumulatively , in several decades naomi barber , program officer at the fund for new york city public education , a private organization that has helped organize the new schools , said the school system has reacted with remarkable flexibility there s a tacit understanding that the way we are serving teenagers leaves something to be desired , ms barber said and that s led almost everybody to approach these new schools generously from the moment last year that ms barber s organization , working with former chancellor joseph a fernandez , invited neighborhood groups to outline proposals for small new schools , there was tremendous enthusiasm the fund received 282 proposals , ms barber said one was mr green s banneker academy proposal mr green , a former teacher , had dreamed of starting a new high school ever since his election to the assembly in 1980 from brooklyn s 57th district he turned to pratt institute and to ms atwell , whose own commitment to school reform had been strengthened in 1988 , when her 16yearold daughter was beaten by fellow students at her manhattan high school science and neighborhood
the international olympic committee meets in monte carlo this week to pick the site for the summer games in the year 2000 of the five cities seeking the prize , beijing has the weakest claim the chinese have been anything but subtle their chief lobbyist has threatened a boycott by china s athletes of the 1996 atlanta games if beijing is n't picked but if beijing gets the nod , the chinese government says , it will put the names of ioc members on a monument at the great wall the disqualifier is china s suppression of dissent and disregard for basic human rights human rights organizations report that , even now , the government is preparing secret trials of 17 dissidents next month and , incredibly , chinese negotiators have even pledged that there would be no public dissent during the olympiad the chinese and diehard olympic romantics argue that politics has no place in the quadrennial games in fact , politics intrudes frequently and obviously south african athletes were banned for 32 years the us led a boycott of the 1980 games in moscow moscow retaliated with a boycott of the 1984 los angeles games obviously willing to play politics when it suits their purpose , the chinese joined in boycotting the moscow games but politics is n't really the issue in this case the overriding issue is human rights citing a state department report , along with tiananmen square and other outrages , the house has adopted a resolution urging the american representative on the ioc to vote against beijing later , 60 senators including the majority leader , george mitchell , and minority leader , bob dole sent a written protest to all 94 members of the ioc and just last week the european parliament voted its own antibeijing resolution the four other contenders are berlin , istanbul , manchester and sydney none of their countries have spotless records on human rights , particularly turkey but none practice the kind of systematic , pervasive repression found in china china has developed a sports machine on the european communist model its leaders now want the olympics in their capital as certification of their regime s respectability when they build a record of respect for their citizens perhaps in another four years it will be time enough but not yet
now that the women involved have moved on to other things , the question can be asked politely did you ever believe , for a second , that jane alexander , madeline kahn and christine estabrook could be siblings \? as the original sisters rosensweig in the broadway production of wendy wasserstein s vastly popular comedy , the three women were more like an additional trio of college alumnae from ms wasserstein s earlier work , uncommon women and others , school chums of disparate backgrounds who had drifted into very dissimilar lives \( perhaps attending different acting schools along the way \) there was little reflexively familial physical comfort among them and whenever ms alexander s coolly poised sara stroked ms kahn s outlandishly flamboyant gorgeous in a gesture of affection , it was a little as if she were petting et there is a new cast of stars in the sisters rosensweig , and , as is often the case with such changes , there are distinct gains and losses the happiest result is that there now seems to be a genuine , visceral pull of consanguinity among the sisters , who are played by michael learned , linda lavin and joanne camp there is even a slight physical resemblance the sheer comic brio of the earlier version may be somewhat diminished but the sense of inextricable family ties and the impossiblity of escaping one s background which is , after all , what the play is mostly about reads much more clearly and as a consequence , the comedy seems much more of a piece than it did before this can be attributed largely to ms lavin , who received the unenviable assignment of recreating the role for which ms kahn won a tony as the suburban housewife turned radio psychologist , ms kahn delivered a dazzlingly mannered performance of a brandnameconscious jewish matron on its own overthetop terms , it worked brilliantly , but ms kahn seemed more directly linked to the audience than to anyone else on the stage in contrast , ms lavin brings a lowerkey , maternal quality to the role that produces a glow of unexpected warmth while she gives a naturalistic , almost throwaway reading to gorgeous s more outrageous pronouncements , she sacrifices none of the part s loopy humor \( the scene in which gorgeous tries on her first real chanel suit is still the evening s high point \) but she seems much more expressly motivated by feelings of sibling rivalry and affection , and the evening s dizzying seesaw of familial conflict and reconciliation simply makes sense in a way it did n't before ms camp finds in the underwritten part of pfeni a wry jewish toughness that works as a natural bridge between the two other sisters \( she is less persuasive than ms estabrook at conveying pfeni s vulnerability \) none of the other replacements , however , yet match the strength of their predecessors ms learned provides the requisite composure , and some of the emotional ambivalence , for sara , the successful anglophile banker in constant flight from reminders of her ethnic past but she lacks the selfaware , selfamused irony that gave ms alexander s performance its bite as mervyn kant the too lively \( in sara s words \) new york furrier who wears his jewishness with earthy comfort hal linden is courtly and restrained , which is not what the part demands one realizes just how much robert klein s brazenly easy , rambunctiously animated performance energized the first version and the essential erotic chemistry between sara and mervyn is almost nonexistent even given these handicaps , ms wasserstein s jokes still play very well and even if this incarnation reminds us anew that the playwright never truly realizes her lofty ambitions to create a melancholytinged comedy in the chekovian mold , it also reminds us of how well ms wasserstein knows her audience , which is mostly upper middle class and college educated ingeniously combining elements that evoke both neil simon and s n behrman , the author glazes cheerful , sitcom humor with a veneer of worldly culture that allows the play s viewers to guffaw at the sight of gorgeous angrily limping after she breaks her manolo blahnik shoe , and to chuckle knowingly at zingy references to metternich and muriel spark the audience with which i saw this most recent performance still seemed very happy indeed to be able to do both the sisters rosensweig by wendy wasserstein directed by daniel sullivan sets by john lee beatty costumes by jane greenwood lighting by pat collins sound by guy sherman aural fixation production stage manager , roy harris presented by lincoln center theater under the direction of andre bishop and bernard gersten at the ethel barrymore theater , 243 west 47th street , manhattan tess goode amy ryan pfeni rosensweig joanne camp sara goode michael learned geoffrey duncan tom hewitt mervyn kant hal linden gorgeous teitelbaum linda lavin tom valiunus brian f o'byrne nicholas pym rex robbins photo joanne camp , linda lavin and michael learned \( martha swope \)
what s new \? when people ask me that , they mean it in the literal sense they want to know about markham and bolo and christer s , about amarcord , shin s and iridium , all restaurants that have opened in the last couple of months have you been there \? they ask is it good \? somehow , i always find myself telling them about fresco , which opened nearly two months ago it s not that this is a particularly attractive restaurant fresco , in fact , is an awkward space with such a raw , unfinished look that when the maitre d'hotel came over one day to brag , we did the room in just eight weeks , i was about to commiserate fortunately , i hesitated a moment so that when he added , did n't we do a great job \? i was able to nod politely secretly i was thinking that the restaurant would be immensely improved if only they would paint out the awful fresco and remove that enormous painting on the other wall it s not that the service is so smooth , either the staff varies from friendly and fine to friendly and frazzled there are days when the waiters seem more harried than happy and when the bar begins to fill up with people waiting for tables , the smile on the face of the pretty hostess starts to look forced and not all the food is wonderful that abundant antipasto table up front looks colorful , but many of those lovely vegetables are very disappointing a few of the entrees strike me as losers , too and some of the desserts lack finesse in spite of all this , when i think about a place i 'd really like to eat , it is fresco that pops into my mind fresco is an entirely new take on the old italian momandpop place the heart and generosity of the redsauce restaurants have been blended with the sophistication of a new generation marion scotto and her children anthony jr and elaina are so new to the restaurant business that they still have the enthusiasm of amateurs \( rosanna scotto , another sister and a newscaster on channel 5 , is also a partner \) this is our place , they announce proudly to anyone who will listen the warmth is oldfashioned the food is not they 've hired a talented young chef , vincent scotto \( not a relative \) , who last worked at al forno in providence , ri their collective mission is to see that nobody goes home hungry from the moment the grilled pizza is put on the table , you know that abundance is the theme the charred oval of dough is stretched so thin that the crust is barely there , but the surface is slathered with tomatoes and cheese you gasp at its size when it arrives at the table , then suddenly discover that there is none left it is irresistible so are most of the appetizers a big bowl comes filled with succulent little clams sauteed with white wine , ginger , garlic and hot pepper a plate of soft polenta comes topped with chicken livers cooked with rosemary and brandy , a dish that brings the italian countryside to the city soups are big , hearty , satisfying salads are n't the strongest suit here the chef seems to think that mere greens are n't sufficiently substantial , and he loads them with shrimp , fennel , apples , polenta croutons , anything that comes to hand still , his bread salad is a triumph the base is one of those pizzas , topless this time , heaped with greens and surrounded by rosy slices of grilled tuna try dieting with this one !

nairobi , kenya , dec 17 john wainaina had heard about aids for years but never thought it was an illness that could touch him or his friends life was good the 40yearold construction worker was healthy and had a job , a family and , like many of his contemporaries , several girlfriends today , 16 months after testing positive for hiv , mr wainaina , emaciated and weak , shares a bed with another patient in kenyatta hospital here , too ashamed and too frightened to tell his friends and relatives that he has aids at first , he did not even tell his doctor mr wainaina is a victim of a growing epidemic that the government and health officials say threatens to destroy the economic backbone of east africa s wealthiest country in the next decade government starting to act after years of passivity , the government is finally facing up to the threat and taking a forceful role in the fight against aids mr wainaina s four children in a nearby suburb are healthy , but his wife has tested positive for hiv , the virus that causes aids , though she has no symptoms of the disease three of his friends have died of aids , and mr wainaina guesses that at least five other friends who saw the same women must also be hiv positive of course i was aware that aids existed , he said but back then i was a young man , with a job , a car none of us used condoms people thought that if you get aids , you die right away so if you stay healthy , you 're ok i am so ashamed i cannot even tell my brothers if i tell my friends , they will sneak away and they wo n't help and then what will happen to my children when we are gone \? this year the aids epidemic was debated in kenya s parliament and cabinet for the first time leading government officials , including president daniel arap moi and vice president george saitoti regularly warn the public in speeches to avoid infection national officials are instructing district administrators , including local tribal chiefs , to tell people that they must take responsibility for their future by practicing safe sex and limiting their sexual partners we have not come out as fast as we should have in talking about aids , said naftali agata , director of the health ministry s program for aids prevention the government has now made a definite commitment the government estimates that 800 , 000 people in this country of 22 million are infected with hiv , including 30 , 000 children the exact number of aids cases in kenya is not known , but a recent survey by the agency for international development put the number at about 100 , 000 roughly 900 , 000 kenyans are expected to die of aids by the year 2000 , and another 2 million will be infected by the turn of the century , government officials say already struggling with inadequate financing and a surge in tropical diseases like malaria , kenya s public health system will be unable to cope , and the loss of millions of young and skilled workers will devastate the country s already faltering economy , experts say though the virus has been racing through subsaharan africa since the early 1980 s , kenya has been far slower than many of its neighbors to acknowledge the epidemic or combat it through education and prevention programs its record presents a paradox despite an economic decline linked to corruption and the collapse of global commodity prices , kenya is still the wealthiest country in east africa and has been relatively stable since it won independence from britain the 1960 s if any country in the region could have coped with aids , experts reasoned , it would have been kenya threat to tourism feared but unlike neighbors like uganda , where the government of president yoweri museveni opened an aggressive campaign to halt the spread of aids in the mid1980 s , the kenyan government tended to play down the threat for fear that it would keep tourists and muchneeded cash away from its game parks and beach resorts though kenyan doctors diagnosed their first aids case in 1984 , the government did not release national statistics on the malady until 1986 that year it listed one aidsrelated death after years of semiofficial neglect , the government must now do far more than simply acknowledge the epidemic , kenyan officials now say we have to develop strategies that are broader than just writing something in the media , said mr agata , the head of the government s aids prevention program unless awareness of aids is going to change behavior , we are not going to achieve anything among the biggest challenges the government faces are a general reluctance among kenyans to talk about sexuality , the illusion that aids can be contained within certain population groups and the shame people feel when they discover that they have the disease attitudes of patients here contrast with those in uganda , which has the highest number of recorded cases of hiv infection in africa around 15 million there , aids has touched virtually every family and much of the cultural , religious and psychological stigma of the disease has slipped away uganda and several other african countries have developed grassroots strategies to cope with the epidemic , including home care networks and community support and counseling groups in kenya , with an abundance of victims like mr wainaina , who heard about aids years ago but never thought he could contract it , the government will have to find ways to personalize the disease
cincinnati , april 18 the anger over the ejection of two mets was on hold bret saberhagen s surrendering of a 20 lead , difficult to figure and hard to take , was done there was , then , one bit of unfinished theater left to the april afternoon in riverfront stadium howard johnson vs rob dibble the showdown could n't have been more elemental johnson , whatever his troubles at the plate over the last year , has retained his appetite for fastballs and two home runs , one friday night , one to lead off the fifth today , had demonstrated a rediscovered ability to devour them dibble , of course , is the closer who owns the national league s unmatched fastball the reds led , 32 the mets , with 26 outs in the books , had men on first and second johnson got in the box and got a fastball he hit it hard , but a millisecond late , and the baseball soared foul into the bullpen along the leftfield line i did n't want to expand the strike zone too much , said johnson , who had seen dibble walk bobby bonilla a moment before and i figured dibble was n't going to get beat on a bad pitch three more fastballs followed , only one of which was in the strike zone the count was 22 the afternoon s final pitch , a fastball away , exploded out of dibble s right hand johnson got started early , but never got his bat through the zone in time the end of his bat produced a soft fly to left and the end of the game i love that moment , i had a good idea and i swung at strikes , said johnson the last swing was a full swing it concluded a day loaded with emotion and arguments , and more conspiracy theories murmuring in the clubhouse about eddie murray s rocky relationship with umpires there had been fourthinning ejections of murray and manager jeff torborg over a dispute about a called strike there had been crippling lapses for saberhagen in the seventh and eighth , as the reds , moribund at the plate all weekend , scored three runs against the club s top pitcher and so there had been , in an april of derailed momentum , the season s toughest setback we had a lead , and we had our man on the mound , said torborg indeed , saberhagen had smoked his way through six innings against the reds i do n't think he threw one fastball under 90 miles an hour , said sid fernandez the righthander for the mets had allowed only three hits , and none of the reds had made it as far as second base johnson s home run off tim pugh in the fifth , quickly followed by a runscoring triple by ryan thompson , had given saberhagen a 20 lead i had control of the game , said saberhagen , whose record fell to 21 i expected to put them away but kevin mitchell singled with one out in the seventh and chris sabo busted a hanging change to leftcenter for another single randy milligan , who already had two hits off saberhagen , beat him again , bouncing a single through the infield to score a run a reggie sanders sacrifice fly then leveled the score i might have got carried away with my fastball , said saberhagen and so when i wanted my curveball , it was n't there in the eighth , there were reds everywhere on the bases , and saberhagen was again stuck with no other pitch but his fastball cecil espy singled leading off and roberto kelly beat out an infield hit one out later , barry larkin was walked intentionally to load the bases and at least present the possibility of mitchell , overweight and with a bum leg , smashing into a double play todd hundley called for a curveball to start mitchell saberhagen shook the sign off instead , mitchell nailed the firstpitch fastball to rightcenter for a sacrifice fly that scored the game s final run i'm angry , said saberhagen i'm one of a group of us angry the manager was angry the general manager was angry murray was angry the weekend that began with 31 and 41 triumphs ended with an angry edge the final chance to satisfy that anger evaporated with rob dibble s nastiest fastball of the afternoon inside pitch john franco was once again unavailable to pitch because of elbow stiffness the closer will ask to be seen by the club s doctors in new york this week
rudolph w giuliani s victory resulted less from seismic changes in voters' attitudes than from tiny shifts in the voting blocs that he and mayor david n dinkins assembled four years ago , the first time they ran against each other this time , mr giuliani was helped by higher turnouts in white neighborhoods , especially on staten island , where enthusiasm for the secession referendum drew more people to the polls the increased turnout on staten island accounted for half of his winning margin of 44 , 000 votes mr dinkins was hurt by small erosions of support a percentage point less here , several thousand fewer votes there none of the changes was enough to spell defeat on its own but together , they cost mr dinkins the edge he needed news analysis , page b6
mayor david n dinkins s certain victory in the democratic primary on tuesday reveals a paradox of black new yorkers' political power his race has helped him stave off any real challenge to renomination , but it remains one of his greatest vulnerabilities as he fights to avoid becoming the first black mayor of a major american city to be defeated in his quest for a second term the demographics of the city s democratic primary electorate in which blacks account for about onethird of the vote and a candidate needs just 40 percent of the total vote to avoid a runoff drove away otherwise serious contenders , who could not hope to crack mr dinkins s base despite his rocky term he is left facing a negligible challenge from two political gadflies , one of whom happens to be black , the other hispanic but that very strength among black democrats counts for much less among the general electorate because no single ethnic or racial group predominates and even though registered democrats outnumber republicans by 5 to 1 , whites showed their willingness to defect in droves four years ago , leaving mr dinkins with not quite 30 percent of the white vote \( which was still a national record for a firsttime black victor in a racially diverse city \) in short , historians and political analysts agree , this election could prove to be just as great a transitional moment in the city s coalition politics as mr dinkins s victory in becoming the first black mayor polls show that rudolph w giuliani has peeled away some of the liberal white and hispanic voters who helped make the mayor s twopoint margin of victory black population growth is declining in relation to waves of new asian and hispanic immigrants , many of whom are not yet citizens or registered to vote all of this could eventually lead to an environment of shifting coalitions , whether mr dinkins wins or loses this year iffy alliances what happened in '89 was in some respects premature , reflecting more the democratic primary electorate than the electorate as a whole , said chris mcnickle , the author of the current book to be mayor of new york \( columbia university press \) , a study of the changing ethnic alliances of the last 50 years in the democratic electorate , a black candidate has a terrific base of support , but in the city as a whole , the electorate is still quite evenly split of course , any incumbent has a presumed advantage in winning his party s renomination but the last mayor to face a term as tempestuous as mr dinkins s , abraham d beame in the mid1970 s , fell to a crowded field of challengers mr dinkins won the nomination four years ago on the strength of sentiment against edward i koch , who had come to be seen as racially divisive , and he began the campaign for the general election in november well ahead of mr giuliani in the polls , borne on by his promise of racial healing but his coalition was always wispy , connected more by a general sense of hope than by clearly defined and shared priorities , and the mayor has had big trouble consolidating that coalition in office polls show that a clear plurality of new yorkers believes that mr dinkins has not managed to make much of a difference in race relations , and that a bare majority now believes that any mayor could , compared with nearly 6 in 10 surveyed four years ago it was an alliance based on the good will of whites and hispanics , but it was held together with spit and toothpicks , said andrew hacker , a professor of political science at queens college and the author of two nations black and white , separate , hostile and unequal \( scribner s , 1992 \) it was so iffy , and clearly in the last four years that alliance did n't become any stronger promise unfulfilled mr dinkins s race has always been a distinctly doubleedged sword four years ago , he won in no small measure by appealing to whites' sense that it was time for a black candidate , and also to a pragmatic sense that a black mayor might be specially equipped to deal with racial tensions , while mr giuliani was often seen as a candidate of white resentment people liked dinkins precisely because of his nonracial appeal , somebody who was black and showed us that this city was big enough to elect a black mayor , and yet does n't go around saying , 'we 've got power' and 'in your face , ' said thomas h kessner , a history professor at the city university of new york that was a great deal of his promise , and now much of the opposition to his candidacy is the feeling that that has not worked out mr giuliani has worked to soften his hardedged image and to couch the election as a referendum on competence and management of the city , to convince skeptical liberal voters that they can comfortably vote against the mayor on the basis of his record in office and not his race that rankles many of the mayor s supporters , who argue that he has managed to hold the city together in the face of a deep recession , and that if he were white , his reelection would be all but certain , given his party s advantage

zagreb , croatia , jan 27 fighting between croatian and serbian forces intensified today , with united nations peacekeeping troops caught in the middle the fighting raised the possibility that the united nations might withdraw from croatia a serbian counteroffensive was reported around maslenica , a town on the coast that had been in serbian hands until a croatian offensive began on friday other reports from the area spoke of a large massing of troops along a front north of split in a briefing to the security council in new york , the secretary general , boutros boutrosghali , said that the croats and serbs seemed unreconcilable , and that the fighting had put the entire peace process in the region in jeopardy thus , he added , he might recommend pulling out the united nations troops page a6 threats to un forces a withdrawal of peacekeeping troops could open the door to a resumption of fullscale war between the croats and serbs , the two largest and most antagonistic groups of the old yugoslav federation it would take 72 hours for a general war to break out once we left , a senior united nations official said the united nations troops , who number about 16 , 000 , were threatened in two incidents on tuesday in benkovac , 21 united nations policemen were held by serbs in the top floor of a hotel , apparently to prevent it from being shelled by advancing croatian troops mr boutrosghali said the croats had also begun shelling united nations soldiers holding the peruca dam , which provides electricity to much of the coast the dam , which is under united nations control but surrounded by serbian forces , was mined and boobytrapped by serbs before they yielded control to the united nations there was also renewed fighting between croats and muslims and serbs and muslims in neighboring bosnia thus , for the first time , two republics of the old yugoslav federation are simultaneously embroiled in conflict un troops under fire in today s fighting in croatia , serbs retook skabnje , a village about 15 miles inland from zadar that they had lost only 36 hours earlier , united nations officials said western news reports from the area said that for the first time , serbs were using helicopters as gunships the fighting broke a yearlong truce in croatia that had held even when battles raged in neighboring bosnia of croatia s 47 million people , 11 percent are serbs , concentrated in an enclave called krajina during the 1991 war , the krajina serbs expanded their control to reach the adriatic , separating the republic s north from the dalmatian coast to the south the serbs rearm when the croats attacked friday at maslenica , part of the serbs' toehold on the sea , they met with immediate success , securing a strategic inlet where the maslenica bridge once stood serbs destroyed the bridge more than a year ago , and northsouth traffic relies on ferries the croats want to build a pontoon bridge the croats also seized an airport at zemunik and began to push east toward benkovac and knin , the heart of krajina and capital of the serbs' selfproclaimed republic within croatia as soon as the croatian attack began , serbs raided depots where their weapons had been stored under the united nationsbrokered peace plan the depots were lightly guarded by united nations police and the serbs emptied 200 of them of everything from automatic weapons to heavy artillery and tanks thus the serbs , who were backed by the yugoslav army when they seized most of northern dalmatia and much of central and eastern croatia in late 1991 , are once again so heavily armed that they are the greatest source of worry among united nations officials this offensive and the fact that it has spurred the serbs to get their arms has put efforts to maintain security in the united nations area back by months , said peter kessler , of the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees it set things back to the very beginning but the yugoslav army has shown no desire to send troops or weapons to help the serbs of krajina the croats also rearm the croats have also built up their weapon supply three years ago they were vastly outgunned , but now they have several planes , some heavy artillery and even a number of t84 tanks built at their factory in slavonski brod the offensive has bolstered the popularity of franjo tudjman , croatia s nationalist president it seems to have won universal approval in the press and has silenced the opposition elections for the upper house of parliament are scheduled for feb 7 , and mr tudjman s party , the croatian democratic union , has got a noticeable boost frustration and anger had been building among many croats because important provisions of the peace agreement were not put into effect the plan , signed in january 1992 , allowed the deployment of united nations peacekeeping troops along the front lines , which the serbs wanted , and the serbian forces were supposed to be disarmed the agreement called for the return of vast amounts of serboccupied territory to croatian control , and more than 200 , 000 croatian refugees were to be allowed back home virtually none of this has happened a frustrated un the resolution called for a stepbystep process , cedric thornberry , civilaffairs director of the united nations protection force , said in an interview today the problem is we have not been able to get that stepbystep process because we have not been able to get cooperaton from both sides the united nations' mandate to keep peace here ends on march 8 and if croatia strongly opposes renewal , it might be hard for the 16 , 000 united nations troops in croatia to remain president tudjman has implied that croatia s objectives in dalmatia are limited , a hint that seems intended to soothe international criticism but the security council has demanded that the croats halt their offensive , and deputy foreign minister vitaly churkin of russia visited mr tudjman today to criticize the attack germany , a historical ally , warned that croatia could face international sanctions the united nations military commander , gen satish nambiar of india , also visited knin , in krajina , and heard serbian demands for a complete pullback by croatian forces the authorities here made their positions clear , he said croatian armed forces must withdraw unconditionally from the areas which they had recently attacked photo a yearlong truce continued to crumble yesterday as fighting intensified between serbs and croats a serbian volunteer greeted street musicians who played at a sendoff

chicago , dec 18 how many times have we seen this winning football formula in nasty weather here at soldier field \? emphasize field position force turnovers run the football it used to be a bears formula that clicked on command , especially here in december , foulweather games but considering the way the bears' offense keeps chugging with a thud and plodding along with no pop , other teams are using the old formula and the mismatch on offense to turn the tables on the bears add the denver broncos to the list denver whipped the bears by 133 this afternoon before 53 , 056 fans in windy , rainy weather bears weather despite the broncos becoming the 12th straight opponent to fail to score 20 or more points on the bears , they became the sixth team to beat chicago with fewer than 20 points and the second straight to do so by scoring only 13 points tampa bay managed the feat last week at least the bears' offense got 10 point in that loss jim harbaugh s injured , passing right hand had not healed sufficiently to suit bears coach dave wannstedt , so he started backup peter tom willis three interceptions , four sacks and only 120 passing yards later , willis had done no better with the bears' offense than harbaugh has this season elway contained the game was certainly winnable chicago took an early 30 lead , trailed by 103 at halftime and allowed denver only 3 points in the third quarter and none in the fourth john elway was only 14 of 24 for 113 yards with a long pass of only 15 yards the broncos' longest run was only 15 yards and chicago sacked elway three times , two by end richard dent the defense played like they have all year , wannstedt said it s a shame when you have some great effort by a lot of individuals and it does n't show up when the game s over we have a lot of improvement to make in a lot of areas and we will do that we need to address the next couple of weeks we 're wounded badly now in this playoff hunt i told the team we 're not out of it , we have got two games left and that s where our focus will be chicago fell to a 77 record with games left here against detroit and at the rams denver \( 95 \) can tie kansas city for the american football conference west divisional lead if the chiefs lose at home to san diego on sunday the raiders enter their game at home against tampa bay with an 85 record , so , if the chiefs win and the raiders lose , there will be a threeway tie in the division it s getting close , down to wire , and we 're proud to be in there , broncos coach wade phillips said we kind of felt we had to play this game their kind of way , on their terms with this weather of course , it was tough on the bears having to go with their secondhand quarterback it has been tough on the bears' offense all season regardless of who was at quarterback denver made the game s first big mistake when cornerback ronnie bradford , on special teams , touched a punt and the bears recovered at the denver 29 chicago could move no closer than the denver 14 and settled for a kevin butler field goal and 30 lead with 11 47 left in the first quarter from there , the bears' offense made all of the critical mistakes willis was intercepted by end shane dronnett early in the second quarter and dronnett s 6yard return gave denver the ball at its 25 that was a key , wasted bears scoring chance then tim worley fumbled at the chicago 11 with 7 46 left in the half denver , however , could only manage a 29yard jason elam field goal that tied the game at 33 with 6 28 left with 1 35 left before halftime , denver linebacker mike croel stripped willis of the ball and recovered it at the bears' 17 a 16yard run by rod bernstine \( 20 carries , 103 yards \) and a 1yard scoring dive by robert delpino lifted denver to its 103 halftime lead the strategy i did n't play very well , obviously , willis said i did n't play well enough to comment on anyone s else s performance but my own they tried to run my way and throw my way , too , said dronnett i looked at it as an opportunity we knew their offense was n't going to come out and score 40 points we knew if we kept it close or got an early lead that we might be able to settle down and force them into some things we thought we could tip some balls at the line and that was part of the game plan that s how i got the interception denver took the secondhalf kickoff and completed a 14play drive that took 7 58 and resulted in a 24yard field goal by elam another fourthquarter drive that took 8 34 resulted in no points , but denver did n't need anything else for the victory willis was intercepted by safety dennis smith on firstand10 at the denver 27 early in the fourth quarter then late in the quarter , he was intercepted by safety steve atwater on secondand8 at the denver 32 there were no penalties in the game by denver and no interceptions of elway just field position , turnovers forced and a running game if i was on defense here , maybe i 'd be a little upset right now , said bears rookie receiver curtis conway , who made one catch for nine yards it is so frustrating we are playing so great on defense and we are not improving on offense we do n't have the answers give the bears credit they have not began pointing fingers at each other they are too predictable and they do n't have enough motion before the snap , atwater offered but you know they are capable the way they are playing , though , gives confidence to every defense they face even in soldier field , where denver entered knowing it would have to play the bears' style to win and it did , though the bears keep producing a style of offense uniquely their own photo running back robert delpino going over the top to score the broncos' first touchdown against the bears in the

the economy a plan is born now , watch out ! ok , it s 1 , 342 pages , and it s so complicated that to try to understand it all could put you in need of some heavyduty health care but look at it this way , president clinton said , as he plunked his mammoth health care plan in congress' lap last week none of us could devise a system more complex , more burdensome , more administratively costly than the one we have now he s got a point there but then again , the present system was n't built in a day , and he s trying to create a brand new labyrinth in a single stroke the plan has evolved during its months of gestation , notably in new limits on government subsidies an attempt to allay fears that big government will take on an unworkable burden but for all the talk of his waffling , all the plan s revisions , he s stuck to one razorsharp goal health care security for all americans is it the clinton economy yet \? things economic take a while to sort themselves out , but at some point we 'll have to start talking about the clinton economy maybe it s time president clinton clearly thinks so , saying he sees sparks of a true rebound he 'd gladly take credit for last week s figures , data that showed quarterly growth at a strong 28 percent annual rate and inflation at just a 18 percent rate of course , if different numbers had appeared on the dice , someone might have blamed bushera policies the revival has skipped some places , like california but , sadly , there will be a lot of rebuilding there soon , so if there s a silver lining to last week s horrifying fires , it s that construction could give the state a lift not a cruel month at all well , the stock market survived october , and survived it in style in the past , it s been a cruel month in 1987 , say , and in 1989 so with prices already high , investors tiptoed into october , ready to head for the exit at the drop of a statistic but the statistics were good , and the dow industrials closed out the month with two records in a week the dow nudged another barrier , 3 , 700 , before ending at 3 , 680 companies paramount is n't sitting still paramount is n't exactly sitting around eating popcorn while those folks with billions to burn decide who s going to buy the company quite the contrary last week it said it was teaming up with chriscraft to start a fifth television network they plan to do it much the way fox did in 1986 combine stations , buy some more , and get into more homes via cable but here s where the whole interlocking mess gets tricky if paramount winds up with its chosen suitor , viacom , then telecommunications , a prime backer of rival bidder qvc , will not be happy so tci , as the nation s biggest cable operator , could make life difficult for the infant network call in captain kirk and dr spock ! which , in fact , is what paramount plans to do the cornerstone of the new network is another star trek series speaking of that takeover battle , the billions keep flying , and now the lawsuits do too after viacom matched its 10 billion bid , qvc asked a court to block paramount from merging with viacom then , to add more spice , there was talk that bellsouth might jump into the bidding warp 3 , here we come ! gm coddles the auto workers general motors is selling more cars these days , but it had better hope sales get even better it said last week that car sales rose a powerful 20 percent in the last 10 selling days but this news was dwarfed by gm s settlement with the uaw the company badly needed union concessions especially on pensions , where it has dug itself into a hole , and on health care , where , amazingly , it still pays it all but gm , eager to be buddybuddy with labor , walked away with no concessions ford sings , gm does n't last week was also earnings week , and the numbers served to underscore detroit s new pecking order ford said it earned 463 million in the quarter , while gm posted a 113 million loss the expectation gap was even wider , for there was immediate carping that ford could earn even more if it were n't offering so many rebates in contrast , at gm the expectations were so bleak wall street was actually impressed by such a small \( small \?

republicans in congress have professed their willingness to work with president clinton on health care reform but a number of gop plans have also been put forward , most notably by a group of senate moderates led by john chafee of rhode island and phil gramm of texas and by a group of house members while the republican plans differ , all rely far less on government intervention to expand coverage or hold down costs than the clinton plan does instead , they say , their plans would increase competition , making insurance more affordable and adding incentives for holding down costs none of the gop plans would require all employers to pay for health care , as the clinton plan does none would set as rapid and definite a target for universal coverage none would reshape the health care system in the aggressive way the president s plan proposes , and none would impose mandatory ceilings on the growth in the nation s medical spending at the conservative end of the spectrum is senator gramm s proposal to give individuals the chance to be more responsible for their own health costs the money an employer spent on a premium could go into a taxfree savings account dedicated to health care some of the money would be used for a required catastrophic care policy , and the employee would spend or save the rest here is a comparison of the provisions of the various republican proposals and the clinton plan coverage chafee plan requires everyone to obtain coverage and offers vouchers to help lowincome workers buy it requires employers to offer workers the chance to join a group plan , but does not require employers to help pay for it like the clinton plan , protects benefits regardless of medical status , barring insurers from seeking only healthy clients standard minimum benefits , to be defined gramm plan requires all employers to offer access to coverage through a group plan , but not to help pay for it protects benefits against job change those with unavoidable preexisting

to the editor re mayhem in los angeles \( editorial , oct 22 \) as i understand it , your defense of the ridiculously lenient verdict against damian williams in the reginald denny case centers on agreement with the defense argument that if mr williams had really wanted to kill mr denny , he could have finished the job think about this for a second the implications argue against virtually anyone s being charged with attempted murder because most perpetrators charged with this offense certainly have a chance to finish the job i 'd also be willing to bet that damian williams thought the chances of reginald denny s surviving his vicious attack were little to none the liberal , leftwing bent of the times editorial board gets more divorced from reality and more offensive daily timothy schilt new york , oct 22 , 1993
with the first two genetically engineered crops a few months away from american food stores , a scientific policy organization called on the government yesterday to delay commercial approval until the united states better understands the potential risks the plants may pose to the environment in a study intended to provoke the clinton administration into reconsidering policies that were instituted in the reagan and bush years , the organization , the union of concerned scientists , said that the new plant technologies were not being adequately controlled by the government responding to the study , greg simon , the administration s top biotechnology policy coordinator , said most of the issues it raised had been debated extensively within the government and among scientists the department of agriculture has done a very good job with the review of genetically engineered plants and on the environmental assessments of those plants , said mr simon , the chief domestic policy adviser for vice president al gore roger salquist , the chief executive officer of calgene inc , a plant biotechnology company in davis , calif , said that since 1986 , when the government instituted new procedures for testing genetically engineered plants outdoors , not a single experiment had indicated that the crops were an environmental threat if there had been even the slightest problems , they would have appeared in one of those tests , said mr salquist , whose company developed a new tomato that is awaiting approval by the food and drug administration so it can be marketed an fda spokesman said yesterday that the agency was expected to complete its review some time in the next two weeks , and the new tomato could be in food stores in a few months a variety of squash is also near final approval the study , perils amidst the promise , is part of a new project at the union of concerned scientists to identify technologies and develop policies to help make modern agriculture less destructive of the environment in a preface , the chairman of the group , henry w kendall , said he hoped the report would provoke serious public discussion of whether transgenic crops are likely to advance or retard progress towards a more sustainable agriculture in the study , dr margaret g mellon , a molecular virologist , and dr jane rissler , a plant pathologist , indicated that they had doubts that biotechnology would be as safe as the government and the industry have said both scientists recently moved to the union of concerned scientists from the national wildlife federation , one of the nation s largest conservation groups , where they were wellknown critics of biotechnology among the many concerns that dr mellon and dr rissler raised about the safety of plant biotechnology were two basic issues the unknown effects of using genetic material from plant viruses , and the possibility of creating plants that were so hearty they could become pests themselves they said scientists are inserting genes from plant viruses into crops as a way of enhancing immunity to plant diseases dr mellon and dr rissler argue that not nearly enough research has been conducted to say whether the technique is entirely safe , especially when used on a commercial scale of thousands of acres of new crops there is the potential , they said , for genetic engineering to lead to the formation of new plant viruses that threaten crops across an entire region there are experiments you could do to determine whether risks are real or not , said dr mellon we are not doing them we are assuming the risks are nonexistent , and with a technology this new , that s not good enough dr rod townsend , a plant pathologist , and director of regulatory affairs at pioneer hibred international , a crop breeding company in des moines , said that scientists had studied this issue and that field testing of crops with viral genes had not produced any problems dr mellon s and dr rissler s second main concern involved the potential creation of a sort of super plant that could outcompete its natural relatives and itself become a weed the two scientists urged the government to require more extensive testing to prevent such a possibility since 1987 , the department of agriculture has regulated the outdoor testing of genetically engineered crops the department reports that in that time , almost 500 such crops have been field tested and none have resulted in environmental damage but dr mellon said the field tests had been conducted under conditions too carefully prescribed to determine longrange environmental risks for instance , if the government was interested in knowing whether a genetically engineered crop might become a weed , it should require that some plants be placed at the edges of a field near real weeds

open draw that now includes becker , who is seeded no 4 , and no one else ranked above no 24 so much for several conspiracy theories , though becker continued with his bizarre thirdperson diatribe over the scheduling snafu the schedule has been very poor concerning becker , he said but as for the logjam of matches he faces , he also continued to talk as tough as he looks with his new short haircut and long sideburns i am a strong son of a gun , he declared after having his firstround match put off until wednesday , then raindelayed until its completion thursday night , becker was good and peeved and not without a point yet here he now stands , practically defaulted into a likely semifinal matchup with jim courier , assuming none of the unseeded masses left in his draw have magic bullets loaded in their racquets 7 of 16 seeded men out thanks to goran ivanisevic s inexplicably lame , 63 , 76 \( 74 \) , 76 \( 75 \) loss to the spaniard carlos costa in the grandstand on a sweltering afternoon , the 24thranked wally masur is the only player in the top 25 left in a quarter of the draw that was n't terribly impressive in the first place over all , 7 of the 16 seeded men were gone by late yesterday afternoon , a record for two rounds of the open i have to stick to my own matches , becker said , responding to the issue of ivanisevic s surprise departure there are four seeded players in each quarter of the draw in becker s , besides himself , were no 5 sergi bruguera , the french open champion who is ineffective off clay and was a firstround loser here no 13 ivan lendl , the fading veteran who retired in the first round with an injured knee , and no 11 ivanisevic , whose interest yesterday seldom went beyond claiming a point with an ace i did n't come in , i did n't do anything , the enigmatic croat said , after ignominiously blowing a 50 thirdset tie break lead if i put first serves in , hit an ace , then ok if not , i'm in trouble he used match point to illustrate his point , claiming that he had at least six chances to take one of costas s short groundstrokes to the net instead he stayed back , until , finally , he rocketed a forehand in the general direction of the van wyck expressway a tie breaker is lost the truth was that ivanisevic was beaten a lot sooner than that he had an opportunity to get into the match , but faltered in a secondset tie breaker , dropping the last four points after leading , 43 in the final set , he had one set point at 56 , then raced to that 50 lead in the tie breaker costa rallied to 5all , then pulled ahead on the point of the match , a diving backhand drop volley of a crushing ivanisevic forehand if i cannot win a set at 50 in a tie breaker , i do n't know what i can win anymore , said ivanisevic it was n't the stifling weather conditions , he insisted , and it was n't that costa had the weaponry , he added , to keep him away from the net the 31stranked costa , in fact , was sheepish , almost apologetic , in trying to find an explanation for his victory i did n't expect this , he began , reminding everyone again and again that he is a claycourt specialist with no substantial experience or success on hardcourts pierce to play graf adding to their slim united states open portfolios yesterday were a couple of young american women , no 13 mary pierce and the unseeded lindsay davenport both fought their way into the fourth round , where the competition will quickly stiffen the 18yearold pierce has been the subject of soap operalike headlines , as she and her mother , yannick , have distanced themselves from jim pierce , mary s father and former coach but with yesterday s 75 , 76 \( 73 \) victory over brenda shultz of the netherlands , pierce s tennis will be the topic for discussion , as she moved opposite topseeded steffi graf in the fourthround draw her last meeting with graf , who was granted a walkover when judith wiesner turned up ill , was this summer in san diego , where graf won , 64 , 75 i felt like i had a chance , said pierce when i play against them , i really do n't feel dominated by the top players by routing the 15thseeded amanda coetzer of south africa , the 17yearold davenport , a 6foot2inch slugger , earned her best grand slam result she , like pierce , now has an opportunity to move out from the shadow of the ousted jennifer capriati , especially if she plays creditably against gabriela sabatini the fifthseeded sabatini had difficulty holding serve against ginger helgeson but managed a comefrombehind 46 , 62 , 64 victory there were

mogadishu , somalia , oct 18 after a summer in which the united states used gunships and attack helicopters to pound sections of this city , the elite american forces that spent the vietnam war trying to win hearts and minds have resumed the quest the united states army special forces have thus begun to venture out in somalia and have found a rare oasis of support in southern mogadishu , the hostile blight that is the domain of the americans' principal foe , gen mohammed farah aidid it is called medina , a neighborhood whose residents support another faction leader , mohammed ali mahdi they are glad for any medicine or other help the americans can give and the special forces , also known as green berets , have been eager to provide it after arriving here six weeks ago in what was becoming an urban guerrilla war we understand that if you do n't have the cooperation of the population , you really do n't stand a chance in a lowintensity conflict , maj bill robinson said the other day as his unit was helping guard a makeshift medical clinic that had been established in medina for the afternoon 'driving a spear' the mission reflects the american shift in strategy from confrontation to accommodation to major robinson , who is from lincolnton , nc , it is the tack that military forces here should have taken all along you were basically driving a spear into the heart with what we were doing before , he said as his soldiers loaded medical supplies and army doctors into a ninevehicle convoy like the rest of southern mogadishu , medina was left to fend for itself this summer as relief organizations withdrew workers from the capital local elders told united nations officials this month that medical care was among their most urgent needs in taking on the project , the army has begun what its officers acknowledge to be a modest mission only 50 officers and soldiers from the fifth special forces group in fort campbell , ky , are now in somalia , and its duties are combat and outreach and in medina , its task of winning favor there is hardly a great feat the mostly abgal residents battled general aidid and his haber gedir subclan before the americans arrived , and they look to americans and the united nations as their protectors officers say they remain wary that their forays will leave the impression of taking sides but in a city still so tense that even american helicopter patrols dare not stray over certain sectors , major robinson and others said they could find nowhere else in which they might safely try to redress what they regard as the mission s political failings as their convoy rumbled down the road where three american marines and an interpreter were killed in an explosion of a remotecontrolled mine on aug 25 , the special forces convoy encountered blank stares from some of the adults who peered from shops and stalls along the crowded streets but there was none of the overt hostility the troops saw a week earlier , when a woman emerged from her home with a butcher knife in hand and made a slashing motion at her throat this time , the scene was transformed into that of a bustling street fair as men , women and children rushed to line up for treatment when the americans pulled up outside a former unicef clinic , their machinegun equipped humvee multiterrain vehicles taking up positions at each end of the alley a rush of patients as army doctors , special forces medics and four swedish doctors hurried into the compound , children shouted america ! the line outside grew longer , and a crush of bodies pressed to squeeze through the metal gates inside the compound , the scene was almost joyous , as patients suffering from everything bullet wounds to malaria saw doctors for the first time in months omar abdulahi omar , a 12yearold carried around by his parents since civil war crossfire left him a paraplegic a year ago , received his first wheelchair , a gift from sgt kent alterman , a special forces medic who had it labeled omar the kid in the courtyard , moussa sudi , who is regarded by local residents as the leader of the neighborhood , says his animosity toward general aidid gives him a bond with the americans among the throng , others shake with anger as they describe how relatives have suffered at the hands of the haber gedir , and they speak with pride about their militia a sense of futility all the people who live here know each other , and they are people who do n't want trouble , said fatima yusuf ahmed , a 23yearold english teacher who said her younger brother was killed in fighting with general aidid s forces two years ago as the hours passed , the crowd outside the gate grew larger and more unruly , shoving so hard against the metal that it began to buckle those who had been treated became stranded inside , and after seeing 120 patients , the americans had had enough the gates were allowed to open , and the somalis who rushed into the compound raised a chorus of complaint when told that the clinic was closed as the americans began to don helmets and flak jackets to make their way back through southern mogadishu , some spoke with painful recognition of the insignificance of their effort my personal feeling is when the last us convoy rolls out the gate , somalia will go back to being what somalia was , said major robinson people wo n't be hungry , but in a little while , they 'll go back to being hungry again photo as united states army soldiers resumed patrols in southern mogadishu , guarding medical clinics and trying to restore some good will in their mission , more troops arrived yesterday at the airport \( liz gilbert sygma , for the new york times \) map of mogadishu showing location of medina

white plains , dec 10 a westchester nanny admitted in court today that she had fatally injured the 10monthold boy in her care by hurling him violently to his bedroom floor after he tugged at her hair after insisting for months that she had played no role in kieran dunne s death on march 3 , ann franklin told a starkly different story this morning about how the baby had fractured his skull a week earlier her eyes red with tears , her voice a whisper , ms franklin made her first public admission of guilt in a crowded courtroom that included her parents , somber and drawn , who sat an aisle away from kieran s father and mother , who occasionally sobbed audibly the baby s mother , peggy leahy dunne , is more than seven months pregnant with her second child 'annoyed and angry' ms franklin s comments came as part of a plea bargain , accepted this morning by westchester county judge j emmett murphy , in which she agreed to plead guilty to firstdegree manslaughter , a lesser charge than that of seconddegree murder she had faced under the agreement , the 26yearold nanny from rye , who faced 15 years to life in prison if convicted of murder , would be eligible for release after serving at least 8 1 3 years , but not more than 25 years , in prison , prosecutors said she remains free on bail until jan 6 , when she must surrender to authorities her formal sentencing will be feb 17 standing unsteadily between her lawyer and a private investigator hired to assist her case , ms franklin told what happened about 5 pm on feb 25 how kieran had pulled at her long , red hair as she placed him into his crib after changing his diaper i got annoyed and angry , she said evenly i shook him away from me and i swung him and threw him down hard asked later by maryellen martirano , chief of the westchester district attorney s child abuse bureau , how far across the room she had tossed the baby , ms franklin first said , it was far , before agreeing to the prosecutor s characterization that it was about six to seven feet asked what part of the baby s body struck the floor first , ms franklin , clutching a crumpled tissue in her folded hands , said quietly , his head , i believe ms franklin said that moments before she changed the baby in his secondfloor bedroom at the dunne home , she had been smoking marijuana in the firstfloor laundry room , although she did not link her reaction to the influence of the drug ms martirano told reporters after the hearing that no evidence of the drug was found at the scene and that she was skeptical ms franklin had been using marijuana at the time case stirred anxieties with her admission , ms franklin brought to a painful close a case that had fanned anxieties among working parents who leave their children in the care of nannies they often know little about the case drew immediate comparisons with that of a swiss au pair , olivia riner , who was charged and eventually acquitted last year of burning a baby to death in the community of thornwood , just 10 miles away from the dunnes' rye home after the 20minute hearing in westchester county court here , ms franklin s father , john , and her boyfriend , martin curran , said they still did not believe she had committed the crime she had described instead , mr curran said he thought judge murphy had stacked the deck against his girlfriend by ruling on dec 1 that prosecutors , at a trial to have begun next month , could present a set of photographs of kieran that indicated possible prior abuse ms franklin s lawyer , michael p romano , told reporters that his client had come forward today so that she could bring the matter to a merciful conclusion he declined to say when she had made up her mind , although prosecutors said mr romano first approached them with an offer , made at ms franklin s behest , on dec 6 it was ann s intent that the process of healing for the dunne family , her family and herself now begin , mr romano said she knew a trial would be long and painful while mr romano said ms franklin extended her deepest regret and sincere remorse for the dunnes' loss , mrs dunne , a project manager for the business planning department of the new york times , and her husband , david , would hear none of it kieran is an angel in heaven , mr dunne , an associate director at bear stearns , told reporters ann , your hell is starting today hired through an ad the dunnes had hired ms franklin in july 1992 after placing an ad in the irish echo , a newspaper that has become the central clearinghouse for babysitter jobs in the new york area the dunnes and the franklins shared a local connection , living a mile apart in prosperous rye and attending the same roman catholic church ms franklin , who worked for the dunnes five days a week , seemed to care for kieran as if he were her own , feeding him cheerios and mashed carrots and wheeling him proudly along purchase street , rye s main thoroughfare then on feb 25 , the police were called to the house , where they found kieran , limp and unconscious , and took him to united hospital medical center in port chester inconsistencies in ms franklin s account of that afternoon quickly surfaced according to court documents , she initially identified herself to the police not as ann , but as margaret , her younger sister s name , and she provided a date of birth three years younger than she actually is the dunnes had insisted , as an essential condition of the plea bargain , that ms franklin explain in open court what had transpired when she was alone with the baby that afternoon mr dunne told reporters , it s some semblance of relief , i guess , to hear how she killed our son photo ann franklin leaving the westchester county courthouse yesterday with michael p

there are certain things stephanie novotny will not tolerate in dave s tavern demands for blender drinks , fights over cue sticks , customers who try to punch each other out she will brook none of this , even if it means taking a right hook to the head , as she did one night when she broke up a fight in the doorway of dave s , a dimly lighted tavern on 43d street in times square where she tends bar working in a place like this makes you hard , said ms novotny , 24 , who has worked in the blenderless bar for more than a year i have to be mean i have to be aggressive very mean , very cold it used to be that men seemed to prefer that the person behind the bar be another man but more and more women tend bar these days in manhattan , that island of cocktails at 6 , nightcaps after the night shift and bloody marys with pancakes they work in the dingiest watering holes and the fanciest hotels , where they are sometimes preferred managers say they bring in more men and with them , more money , and that they are often more adept at handling barroom disputes than their male counterparts at least 30 of the 270 bartenders in local 6 of the hotel and restaurant workers' union are women ten years ago , there were none i tried to get bartending jobs while i was in school , and it was impossible , said liliana lovell , 25 , who recently opened her own place , the coyote ugly saloon in the east village , where she employs eight bartenders , seven of them women now , it is a lot easier because people are realizing that women are good for business women are much better at this job than men , miss lovell said they bring in more money because men like to see them behind the bar plus , there is a certain respect customers have for them , which alleviates problems like fights also , they are much cleaner unlike ms novotny , miss lovell has a laissezfaire view of how her customers should behave on a recent wednesday night at the coyote , on first street , she stood on top of her own bar and did the swim to the song delta dawn , one of the many oldies her bar is known for moments later , miss lovell , wearing a tiedyed tank top despite the blizzard raging outside , rode through the bar on the shoulders of a man in a flannel shirt who finally plopped her back on the bar , where she poured vodka into a coworker s mouth customers in p j carney s , an irish pub on seventh avenue near 57th street , often tell fran levy that they are surprised to see a woman on the other side of the bar there are no female bartenders in real irish pubs here , she said as a result , we have to be twice as sober , twice as on time and twice as good to not get flak ms levy , 31 , said women who have come into the bar approve of her role , but she thought men would be unhappy to a find a woman behind the bar of every pub in town the women , all of whom said they had been cocktail waitresses , said they found bartending easier and often more profitable they said they also felt more in control and got more respect from behind the bar on the other hand , the women said , they constantly have to fend off advances some said they simply play along until tip time has passed others tell wouldbe suitors that they have a boy friend some simply say bug off without smiling i have a strict policy in my bar no dating the customers , miss lovell said it is bad for business other men might not come in on that woman s shift also , bartenders have a certain celebrity status once you start mingling with customers , you lose that a woman s influence although most women would be expected to have a more difficult time handling confrontational drunks , most said that they find problem drinkers respond to scolding men do not want to be embarrassed by a woman , miss lovell said usually they will leave right away when you say something to them the bartenders also said that customers prone to weeping prefer to do so on the shoulders of a woman when a male bartender is on , a customer will come in and brag about how drunk he got , and all the women he has cheated on his wife with , ms levy said but when he comes in on my shift , he will ask me how he can make it up to her , and what he is going to do with his kids there is little need for reproach from behind the bar at the royalton hotel on west 44th street , where a theater crowd stops for preshow cocktails , and where the main pour is vodka , not beer some squish down into the soft white chairs in the main bar , while others , many of them draped in black , sit in the round bar , a dark padded room where they sip champagne and fruitinfused martinis and whisper to each other the elusive woman in charge of the round bar on a recent friday night , who would offer only a first name , susana , and would n't give her age at all , said she believes there is a certain mythology that surrounds a woman tending bar people think that you have a lot of knowledge , she said with quiet cool , she instructed another woman on the art of a raspberry tonic \( way more ice \) , poured a few glasses of chardonnay without looking and cooed sympathetically to a hotel guest who said he had just lost his antique lighter some people want conversation , others want you to make them laugh , she said others just want you to leave them alone i just want them to be polite dave calleo , an insurance salesman from ramsey , nj , who stopped in the round bar for a drink before a hockey game , observed of women bartenders that they have a tendency to flirt more i think that otherwise there is no real difference between them and the guys , he said even in mcsorley s old ale house , on seventh street in the east village , which began admitting women only in 1970 , there are nods of approval towards women , though the manager , steven zwaryczuk , said he does not expect them behind his bar any time soon photo women are much better at this job than men , said liliana lovell , 25 , who recently opened her own place in the east village , the coyote ugly saloon , where she employs eight bartenders , seven of them women \( g paul burnett the new york times \)

to the editor in light of your editorial support of more restrictions on legitimate ownership of private firearms , when inmates carry guns \( editorial , jan 20 \) misses a crucial point it seems that even in prison , where many civil rights do not apply and where access , movement and activities are highly controlled , criminals who want guns can still get them , albeit at a high price further , the prison system in question is surrounded by one of the most restrictive jurisdictions in the country for legitimate gun ownership does n't this suggest to you that in normal society , where none of the above conditions exist , it would be folly to try to limit criminal access to guns by restricting the right of lawabiding citizens to own them \? as our country s earlier experience with alcohol prohibition amply demonstrated , greed and venality will always provide willing conspirators if the price is right eric s ching mountain view , calif , jan 25 , 1993

to the editor the senate s defeat of president clinton s jobs bill , and its impending burial of campaign finance reform , have been depicted as tactical victories for its republican minority what has escaped attention is the transformation of the senate procedures that fueled these victories traditionally , the filibuster has been the instrument of regional interests , small states and ideological minorities bent on blocking adverse legislation or securing concessions from the senate majority the ability to sustain such a filibuster , as in the case of the motor voter bill , described in a useless filibuster \( editorial , may 11 \) , depends on bargaining and negotiation among visible actors this system , undeniably undemocratic as you suggest , and perhaps unconstitutional , as was recently suggested by lloyd cutler , has been further corrupted by what we might call a caucus filibuster on the jobs bill , the minority caucus secured a commitment from all its members to filibuster the entire package , regardless of each senator s feelings about the merits of particular components by binding its members to filibuster the entire bill , the republican caucus in effect denied its members the right to bargain it also denied the public the right to know who among its 43 members opposed what parts of the bill and why never before in senate history has a party caucus used its power to bind its members in a filibuster that denies the public the right to know who opposes what in a given bill none of the traditional defenses of the filibuster apply in these cases however insidious the little group of men who blocked american involvement in the league of nations or how much southern filibusters blocked progress on civil rights , the lines were clearly drawn the caucus filibuster obscures such accountability and raises an already undemocratic procedure to new heights of irresponsibility edward schneier bertram gross new york , may 12 , 1993 the writers are the authors of legislative strategy \( new york , 1993 \)

washington , dec 16 with efforts to reinstate the rev jeanbertrand aristide to the haitian presidency no closer to succeeding today than they were a year ago , president clinton s policy of summarily returning haitian boat people is drawing increased anger from outside the administration some critics also say that the policy is causing some acute embarrassment at the highest levels of the administration , though officials deny that in what is perhaps the starkest selfcriticism of any policy that he has helped formulate including those on bosnia or somalia the national security adviser , anthony lake , conceded at a meeting with human rights advocates last friday that the administration s policy toward haitian refugees was indeed a dark stain on its record , according to three people at the meeting he was defensive about it , said one of the three , who disclosed mr lake s comments on the condition that they not be identified he was n't defending the policy he was implying that he did n't like the policy but felt that they were trapped in a vise and were stuck with it but today mr lake denied categorizing the policy as a dark stain he said he had told the group this was a policy none of us likes , including myself but it was a policy that was necessary for us to follow because the alternative was worse of risking a humanitarian disaster at sea , possibly risking tens of thousands of lives mr lake added that those sentiments are ones that have been expressed by administration officials for months in public administration officials justify the policy of forcibly returning fleeing haitians picked up at sea by saying they are moving to return father aristide , whom the military overthrew in 1991 in that vein , two senior officials said today that a military delegation from the unitedstates , france , canada and venezuela would soon meet in portauprince with the head of the haitian military , lieut gen raoul cedras the envoys will seek assurances for the safety of an international group of military and police trainers that will again be sent to haiti a group of american military trainers was to go to haiti in october but in the face of a group of armed men in plainclothes who threatened them and the unwillingness of the country s military leaders to assure the safety of the trainers , their ship turned around without unloading them after the incident senior pentagon and other administration officials said privately even if another training mission for haiti military was put together they were not sure whether american military personnel would take part but today a senior administration official told reporters that if proper assurances were received from the haitian leaders americans would be in a new mission a senior official who insisted on anonymity said that we are willing under the proper conditions to participate in a new united nationsbacked mission the policy of returning the boat people without hearings on press their requests for refugee status was initiated by president george bush in the campaign mr clinton denounced the policy as cruel , but he adopted it after his election in recent weeks human rights groups and advocates for refugee rights have grown even louder in denouncing the policy as fostering repression by the haitian military and hardship from a united nationsimposed embargo this is absolutely no better , and in some ways worse , than it was under the bush administration , said the rev richard ryscavage , executive director of the migration and refugee service of the united states catholic conference administration officials , including john shattuck , assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs , argue that the united states is not violating international laws because the refugees can go to three state department centers but in recent weeks , rights advocates say , the centers have been overwhelmed by many asylum requests
washington , aug 18 the administration s decision to add the sudan to the list of countries that sponsor international terrorism was based on evidence that the sudan harbors terrorists , and not because of any sudanese links to a reported plot to bomb targets in new york city , united states officials said today the state department spokesman , michael mccurry , said evidence indicated that the sudan had allowed its territory to be used as a sanctuary for groups like the abu nidal organization , the party of god and the palestine islamic holy war the state deparment considers all three groups terrorist organizations we also believe safe houses and other facilities used to support radical groups are allowed to exist in sudan with the apparent approval of the sudanese government s leadership , mr mccurry said further , we believe that reports of training in sudan of militant extremists that commit acts of terrorism in neighboring countries are credible no proven links to new york but he said there was insufficient evidence to link the sudan to any plot to bomb the united nations , the hudson river tunnels and other sites in new york state department officials said the investigation , ordered last december by former secretary of state lawrence s eagleburger , was ready last month , but had been delayed so links between khartoum and the 10 people indicted in the reported new york plot could be explored an administration official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the investigation did not confirm any connection one official said that based on information from the prosecutors , evidence linking the sudan to the conspiracy is weak at this time , though some state department officials have said in the past that they believe there is evidence of a link officials indicated that the sudanese government , led by lieut gen omar hassan elbashir , was added to the list of nations supporting terrorism because it had failed to respond to repeated requests for information on suspected training sites , safe houses and other terrorist activities denials by the sudan a state department official said the sudan had repeatedly denied any involvement in terrorism , but had provided no explanations for suspected activity within its borders they did n't respond with anything that we considered credible , the official said basically , they just denied , denied , denied the decision to list sudan as a terrorist state means that the government will be ineligible for united states economic and military aid , of which it receives virtually none at the moment relief aid of 56 million for refugees in the southern sudan will not be affected about 5 million sudanese have been displaced by famine and civil war officials from private aid organizations and from the state department expressed concern that the sudan would block refugee assistance after the administration s decision president bashir said today that he would not accept aid from washington , the associated press reported talking about the continuing humanitarian assistance means talking about an american intelligence presence in sudan , he said , which would make our country a theater for spies and agents an awkward intersection it s a real dicey thing , a state department official said about the refugee program we have played a very , very big role in the international community s response to the humanitarian crisis it s mostly our money and mostly our people there what i would hate for this to do , is sort of get wrapped up around this terrorismlist issue the two are distinct issues khartoum has a long record of making promises not to interfere with relief shipments , then breaking them , officials from the state department and relief organizations say the sudanese government has , over time , consistently tried to manipulate humanitarian relief effort towards its own political ends , said hiram ruiz , a policy analyst with the united states committee for refugees still , some officials say it is doubtful the sudan will carry through on a threat to block aid because that would only cause more political instability in addition , most food aid enters the sudan from ethiopia and kenya and is distributed in areas the government does not control
washington , july 22 despite increasing pressure from republican senators to spell out her positions on controversial issues , judge ruth bader ginsburg today resisted giving her views on the death penalty and gay rights as she completed her third day of testimony before the senate judiciary committee with little suspense over the outcome she is expected to be confirmed easily as the nation s 107th supreme court justice the day s hearing was highlighted by a display of just how much the committee s democratic and republican members have traded roles since bill clinton s election excerpts from the hearing , page a16 in the last decade of republican control of the white house , the committee s republican members sought to insulate nominees from relentless questioning designed to elicit unequivocal statements on specific areas of legal philosophy pressed on death penalty but today , it was senator orrin g hatch of utah , the ranking republican on the committee , who pressed judge ginsburg to say whether she believed the death penalty was constitutional you were very specific yesterday in talking about abortion , equal rights and a number of other issues , senator hatch began but you were not very specific on the death penalty he then asked her whether she agreed with two former justices , william j brennan jr and the late thurgood marshall , that the death penalty was unconstitutional in all circumstances when judge ginsburg began to answer by describing the current state of the law without giving her own views , senator hatch interjected sharply but do you agree with all the current sitting members of the court that it is constitutional \? is it within the constitution \? she replied , i can tell you i agree that is the precedent an exasperated senator in an exasperated manner , senator hatch noted that she had recently been willing to say that she thought statutoryrape laws were constitutional as long as they did not distinguish between male and female offenders but you 're unwilling to comment on the constitutionality of the death penalty , the senator went on , and the thing i'm worried about is that it appears that your willingness to discuss the established principles of constitutional law may depend somewhat on whether your answer might solicit a favorable response from the committee judge ginsburg sought to distinguish her comments about abortion from her unknown views on the death penalty by saying that she had written extensively about abortion now the death penalty is an area i have never written about senator hatch persisted it s not a tough question metzenbaum weighs in judge ginsburg said asking her to signal how she might vote on an issue that was certain to come before a court is something you must never ask a judge to do but that s not what i asked you , mr hatch replied i asked you is it in the constitution \? senator howard m metzenbaum , democrat of ohio , sought to underline the changed role mr hatch was playing when he recalled that in 1987 , when judge anthony m kennedy appeared before the committee , he similarly refused to give his views on the death penalty judge kennedy was at the time a federal appeals court judge , as is judge ginsburg , who sits on the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit this is not the first time we have had a nominee who has declined to respond on this question , senator metzenbaum said a changed landscape the sharp backandforth underlined the profoundly changed political situation in which a supreme court justice is confirmed the most heated issue in the fights over who would sit on the supreme court for more than a decade had been a nominee s views on abortion none of the seven lawyers nominated to the court by presidents ronald reagan or george bush would give a hint on how he or she might rule on the issue , perhaps for fear it could doom their chances to sit on the court but on wednesday , judge ginsburg gave an unflinching defense of the constitutional right to abortion without any apparent thought that it could affect her chances for confirmation some of today s aggressive behavior on the part of the panel s republicans appeared to have resulted from their realization that the first nominee in 26 years from a democratic white house was sliding through the committee with none of the friction that had troubled republican nominees in the past a 1977 brief is cited senator charles e grassley , an iowa republican , sought to challenge judge ginsburg s assertion that she had never spoken or written about the constitutionality of the death penalty senator grassley said he discovered a brief that judge ginsburg wrote in a death penalty case in 1977 as a staff lawyer for the american civil liberties union , judge ginsburg had argued that the death penalty for rape in georgia was unconstitutional judge ginsburg replied in sharp tones that the issue involved was not capital punishment with the air of a displeased tutor , she instructed senator grassley to read the opinion again judge ginsburg at one point appeared to say that she regarded discrimination against homosexuals as deplorable but then under questioning from a republican senator said she did not mean to comment on the issue because it might come before the supreme court senator edward m kennedy , democrat of massachusetts , had asked her for her opinion about discrimination based on sexual orientation she replied i think rank discrimination against anyone is against the tradition of the united states and to be deplored but when senator william cohen , republican of maine , pressed her on the issue of allowing homosexuals in the military two hours later , she said she could not give her views as that issue might come before the court the committee members at times fell at times to bickering among themselves in one unusual exchange , senator carol moseley braun , democrat of illinois , interrupted mr hatch , saying she found his questioning of judge ginsburg racially offensive members of the committee seemed baffled at the objections of senator moseley braun , the senate s only black member when senator hatch was quizzing judge ginsburg about roe v wade , the 1973 supreme court ruling that first found a constitutional right to abortion , he said that many people thought its reasoning was just as flimsy as the reasoning the court used in 1857 to uphold slavery he said that it was impossible to distinguish the dred scott case of 1857 from roe v wade in what he characterized as an invented right the methodology is the same , he said senator moseley braun interjected , this line of questioning i find to be personally offensive she said that she found it very difficult to sit here as the only descendant of a slave in this committee in this body and hear a defense , even an intellectual argument that would suggest there is a rationale an intellectual rationale , a legal rationale that can be discussed in this chamber at this time senator hatch tried to explain that he was only citing the dred scott decision as an example of a horrible ruling by the supreme court senator , that is not what i said , he replied he described the dred scott ruling as the alltime worst case in the history of the court photo senator orrin g hatch , left , conferring yesterday with senator joseph r biden jr during yesterday s confirmation hearings \( stephen crowley the new york times \) \( pg a16 \)

there are nights harold thomas lies in bed , kept awake by the words that still scream through his head , words he heard for years over the paging system at the miller brewing company plant in fulton , ny a production supervisor in the packaging department , mr thomas has no idea whose voice it was , calling him harold , the ape , thomas but by early 1991 , he had grown so distraught that a psychiatrist advised him to take a leave upon his return almost a year later , a voice rang out over the paging system , welcome back , harold , but you 're still a nigger for almost a decade , through last year , many black and female employees at the plant in fulton , a small industrial town north of syracuse in central new york , say they were targets of racial epithets or sexual comments over the speaker system or were harassed by other means , such as messages written on restroom walls , obscene drawings and prominently placed items , like a noose , that spoke of overt hostility while these kinds of incidents are not necessarily characteristic of miller plants , they are remarkably common in the american workplace and may even be on the rise efforts by companies to hire more minorities and women , often at the expense of white males , coupled with the wave of corporate downsizings that has further threatened job security , have led to a backlash against minority workers , federal authorities and management experts say since 1990 , complaints of racial harassment filed through local and regional offices of the equal employment opportunity commission and state human rights agencies increased nearly 17 percent , to 6 , 038 filings last year among the recent cases is a class action suit against the ford motor company charging racial discrimination and harassment it s not just limited to bluecollar workers , said mildred saunders , a new yorkbased consultant on equal employment matters in academia , in government , among professionals , wherever people are different and fewer jobs are available because of the economy , these kinds of issues are commonplace one reason the problem persists is that companies often deny it exists or fail to eradicate it at its base levels , forcing victims to turn for action to the courts , as mr thomas has lawrence kunin , general counsel to the new york state division of human rights , said that sometimes a company has established a culture , without realizing that it s discriminatory the view from milwaukee while perhaps extreme , the miller case in fulton provides a compelling study of how bigotry endures in the workplace , even after victims complain repeatedly and managers experienced in diversity are brought in to help at miller s headquarters in milwaukee , officials maintain that their efforts to catch the fulton perpetrators were adequate , if unsuccessful michael brophy , a miller spokesman , said that through the years in question senior managers in fulton had taken corrective action in the form of a tape monitoring system and surveillance by security personnel were we concerned \? of course , he said do we believe the problem was rampant \? of course not we 're talking about a plant where there are 1 , 200 to 1 , 400 pages a day , about 550 , 000 a year , more than 5 million over 10 years how many offensive pages are we talking about \? maybe 12 or 14 largely for that reason , he said , the paging system , the principal means of abuse , was retained until last year a miller lawyer in milwaukee , bert butler , insisted miller has always complied with state and federal antidiscrimination laws he said that over a 16year period no formal complaint of racial harassment reached the office of the fulton plant manager he said miller officials in milwaukee would not have known about complaints from people like mr thomas to their superiors or how the superiors handled them mr thomas and others managers as well as union workers said complaints were largely ignored how much harassment might be considered too much \? speaking in general terms , mr kunin said , after 35 years of civil rights laws , i have to question a response of 'i did n't know , ' or 'it happened at such a low level , ' or 'it was too subtle' i have to question even one statement over a loudspeaker several employees have filed complaints against miller for discrimination mr thomas and waverly faison , a former miller employee who was laid off in 1984 , presented enough evidence to the united states attorney in syracuse last year to have the federal bureau of investigation investigate whether federal criminal civil rights laws had been violated to prevail in a criminal action , a prosecutor must show that racial harassment included physical harm or a threat of physical harm in addition , mr thomas and two other black exemployees filed separate civil claims against miller with the new york state division of human rights , in which a plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that discrimination occurred mr faison has challenged miller in new york state supreme court under the same civil rights laws the lure of fulton
louisville , ky , april 28 there is a horse galloping around the track at churchill downs these mornings without a saddle he is el bakan , the big shot from panama his owner says he 'll be wearing a saddle in the 119th kentucky derby on saturday , but this is the way they train them in south america there is another horse here named rockamundo who ran the fastest mile and an eighth of the year for 3yearold horses when he won the arkansas derby in 1 48 people think his name is amusing so were the odds he beat when he won in arkansas two weeks ago 1081 he has another peculiarity besides beating long odds he tends to hold his breath during races , like a child throwing a tantrum his jockey , calvin borel , overcame that problem by leaning down and poking rockamundo in the belly then there is kissin kris , who gets flustered in fact , he is being stabled in some privacy at churchill downs in a barn far from the 18 or so other derby horses he is so sensitive to crowd noise that he sweats profusely in the paddock so , he will face his public and his rivals on saturday with a protective piece of equipment earmuffs that s right , a hood with ear muffs to keep out the crowd noise no secretariat in the stables all this is not to suggest that these are 20 oddballs getting primed for the kentucky derby but this is 20 years after secretariat reigned over the derby with majesty , and one year after arazi commanded an international following with style and now , the symbols of this year s wideopen , goforit derby are a 1081 long shot and a horse who trains without a saddle everybody , said d wayne lukas , pinpointing the mood , thinks he can step up and hit a home run in this derby the unusual tone is probably fed by the fact that only two of the starters , prairie bayou and storm tower , have won more than one graded stakes race this year diazo , among several others , has never won one el bakan , who won seven straight starts in panama , ran second in the lexington stakes in his only appearance in the united states the tone is heightened by the absence of the leading 2yearolds of last season if you win the breeder s cup juvenile in the fall , you are a sure bet to be crowned the favorite for the kentucky derby the following spring and you are also probably a sure bet not to win it since they started running the breeder s cup nine years ago , no juvenile champion has gone on to win the derby the jinx has already struck this year s 3yearolds the five top finishers in the breeder s cup juvenile last oct 31 were gilded time , it sali'lknownfact , river special , living vicariously and mountain cat for a veriety of medical and artistic reasons , none of them even got to churchill downs this spring but the horse with the earmuffs did if there is another streak working against this year s bunch , it is the losing streak suffered by derby favorites since spectacular bid won in 1979 , no favorite has won the derby tom bohannan , who trains the favorite , prairie bayou , for john ed anthony s loblolly stable , considered the weight of recent history and said it just might be an indication of just how tough this race is to win prairie bayou galloped a mile and a quarter this morning while bohannan fretted over another question when the field is drawn thursday morning , should he enter marked tree and go with a twohorse team \? a few weeks ago , it looked as though loblolly might go with a threehorse team but after marked tree ran third in the wood , he was withdrawn now , he s here and available the third star , dalhart , is here but unavailable i'm not sure which way to lean , bohannan said marked tree has had a bunch of races pretty close together , and i'm a little afraid of knocking him out of some races later down the road i'm also afraid i might get derby fever and run him just to know i 'll make up my mind , call mr anthony , let him know and then let him make the final call finish line while most of the derby horses were exercising lightly after their final hard workouts , storm tower ran a fast halfmile in 48 seconds flat wednesday morning in his last serious work before the race he galloped out another furlong and was clocked in 1 023 5 his trainer , ben perkins jr , reported that the colt , the winner of the wood memorial , just galloped through the lane , pricking his ears perkins also said he was n't troubled by the possibility that storm tower might duel personal hope for the early lead i 'd like to be two or three lengths in front all the way around , he said our horse is just as fast as his if he breaks sharp and nice , we might go for it photo el bakan , wearing a pad instead of a traditional saddle , with excercise rider david vasquez before his morning workout \( associated press \)
khartoum , the sudan , feb 10 comparing the plight of christians in the sudan to that of jesus on the cross , pope john paul ii called repeatedly today for this country s islamic leaders to cease what he called religious persecution of christians and to end the terrible harvest of suffering caused by civil war in the south the pope s unusually stark imagery and unequivocal insistence on minority rights and religious freedoms in the predominantly muslim sudan evoked centuries of conflict between christians and muslims in this region the conflict has become even sharper here as the sudan s leaders have aligned themselves with the forces of islamic fundamentalism , particularly in iran indeed , the vision of the leader of the roman catholic church alighting here among robed and uniformed islamic leaders seemed to symbolize the collision of faith that has molded history since the crusades and throughout the era of european colonialism in north africa and the middle east 'just solution' urged today it is essential to recover the sense of mutual respect and cooperation , in the service of the common good , and in the frank and honest search for a just solution to the conflict which continues to reap such a terrible harvest of suffering , the pope told the sudan s leaders , referring to the country s two religions he arrived here from uganda for a ninehour stopover at the end of his 10th african tour rigorous respect for the right to religious freedom is a major source and foundation of peaceful coexistence , he said speaking later to priests and nuns at khartoum cathedral , he evoked the crucifixion , saying , in this part of africa i see clearly a particular reproduction of the mystery of calvary in the lives of the majority of the christian people and at an open air mass in the city s main square , shortly before his departure for rome , the pope again revived the imagery of the cross , saying the names of the sudan s christians were written on the palms of the hands of christ , pierced by the crucifixion banners call for help at the mass , the pope spoke under heavy security provided by sudanese soldiers carrying automatic rifles the banners in the crowd , referring to the government , implored the pope to speak up for people who cannot speak out for themselves and to protect the rights of the poor and needy christians , the majority of them roman catholics , represent only 7 percent of the sudan s 25 million people , concentrated along with many animists in the african south rather than in the arabicspeaking muslim north of the continent s biggest country thousands upon thousands of exuberant christians thronged khartoum s streets today to welcome the pope and attend the openair mass for decades north and south , thrown together by british colonial frontiers , have fought violent civil wars but since gen omar bashir took power in a 1989 coup , the bloodshed has intensified and the country s human rights record has worsened , with charges by church and other monitoring groups of widespread torture , killing and religious persecution moreover , famine and war in the south have sent hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing north to camps outside khartoum there , the church says , they are subject to islamic law , which underpins general bashir s fundamentalistbacked military government and which the pope argues should not be imposed on christians 'an essential element' minorities within a country have the right to exist , with their own language , culture and traditions , and the state is morally obliged to leave room for their identity and selfexpression , the pope told general bashir publicly before the two had a private meeting the freedom of individuals and communities to profess and practice religion is an essential element for peaceful human coexistence the pope , in his constant appeals for understanding , has also used strong language to criticize christians who oppress muslims in his annual christmas day message in st peter s square , for example , he called the mostly muslim people of bosnia and herzegovina hostages of programmed and inhuman violence though he did not name any group , the comment seemed a clear reference to ethnic cleansing by orthodox catholic serbs in territories they have occupied in part , the pope s blunt talking here reflected what vatican officials called his desire to avoid any suggestion that , by visiting khartoum , he was giving his imprimatur to a government that some of his own bishops have accused of genocide while in khartoum , you will be given a redcarpet welcome and you will hear many solemn , official speeches from the major authorities of the khartoum government , a group of priests from southern sudan said in a letter handed to the pope during his visit to uganda these are the same people who persecute , torture and kill pastors , priests , sisters , catechists and evangelists you will be shaking hands dripping with the blood of christians from khartoum s point of view , by contrast , the pope s visit offers a rare opportunity to nurture a more benevolent and tolerant image than it has thus far projected we are confident that the peaceful resolution of the problems confronting this country will be achieved in the near future , and the sudan will be able to live in peace , general bashir told the pope , invoking the koran to say that , for muslims , christians are closest to them in love religious persecution denied the general said the pope s visit would enable him to see also how the sudan , a multireligious , multiracial and multicultural society , has devised ways and means whereby all can enjoy life and live in harmony , fraternity and tranquillity general bashir denied the pope s allegations of religious persecution , saying that for muslims such action is simply unthinkable he called the reports of human rights abuses grotesque fabrications while he acknowledged there had been political detainees after the 1989 coup , he said , there are none now , except very few emergency cases for very short terms diplomats here said the sudan s leaders were motivated by a concern that united states military intervention in somalia had set a precedent that could be extended to their own country if they seemed unable to come to grips with comparable problems of anarchy and famine longer visit sought while the pope was in uganda , the sudan s leaders sent negotiators to meet with representatives of the fractured southern rebel movement , saying they were seeking peace vatican officials said the sudanese authorities had initially sought a far longer visit by the pope to gain maximum political benefit from his presence but the pope told diplomats in uganda that conditions in the sudan did not permit a full papal visit and insisted on keeping his stay brief and focused on his flock vatican officials said the pope had purposely set out to hammer his points home from the start rather than take a circuitous approach general bashir looked on stonily as the pope registered his catalogue of complaints when people are weak and poor and defenseless , i must raise my voice on their behalf when they are homeless and suffering the consequences of drought , famine , disease and the devastation of war , i must be close to them photo pope john paul ii arriving yesterday at khartoum cathedral in the sudan , where he called for an end to religious persecution of christians \( reuters \) map of sudan shows location of khartoum
washington , april 9 the tax break to encourage business investment that president clinton has proposed as a central element in his plan to stimulate the economy and create jobs is not likely to be enacted , leading lawmakers in both parties say that means mr clinton may get almost none of the measures he has sought to give the economy a quick jolt the other half of the stimulus program , a spending bill , has been blocked in the senate by a republican filibuster and stands no chance of passage in its current form the proposed investment tax credit , meant to induce businesses to buy new machinery and equipment , has won little support in congress or in business circles congressional leaders opposed treasury secretary lloyd bentsen said in an interview recently that the tax credit , which would cost the government more than 21 billion in lost revenue over five years , was an integral part of the president s economic package and that the administration would fight to preserve it it was supposed to be part of the tax bill that congressional committees will begin drafting next month , with the idea that the credit would be retroactive so it could be applied to purchases made after last dec 3 but the chairmen of the congressional tax committees daniel patrick moynihan , the new york democrat who heads the senate finance committee , and dan rostenkowski , the illinois democrat who is chairman of the house ways and means committee said they were opposed to the proposal because it would open an unnecessary tax loophole and did not know of much support in either party on their committees even the national association of manufacturers , which represents the kinds of businesses that are among the heaviest buyers of machinery and equipment , is opposed to the clinton proposal criticism from industry it is a bad idea that will simply shift investment from the future forward , said jerry j jasinowski , the association s president roger brinner , chief economist at dri mcgrawhill , an economics consulting company , said of administration officials , they ca n't find a friend for it in congress or in industry mr clinton and his spokesmen have maintained that the stimulus program is needed because the economy is recovering so slowly from the recession and relatively few new jobs are being created some economists favor the proposals and some do not , but the prevailing view is that the effect of a 30 billion stimulus over two years in a 6 trillion economy would be marginal as for the political consequences , the rejection of a large portion of the president s stimulus package will probably be forgotten if mr clinton succeeds in winning approval of the basic elements of the budget he submitted to congress on thursday the opposition to the investment tax credit proposal comes from several directions some opponents believe it will be a waste of money others are philosophically opposed to skewing the marketplace with tax incentives others note that while the president was giving with one hand he would take away with another , by raising the tax rate on corporate profits to 36 percent from 34 percent they say they would rather keep the lower rate than have an investment credit still others say they favor an investment tax credit in a different form mr moynihan and mr rostenkowski , who were interviewed separately in their offices , said they expected the fight in congress to be over what else to do with the 21 billion , not over whether to approve an investment tax credit that s our cushion , mr moynihan said it s going to be used in place of revenue from some other tax other proposals for money mr rostenkowski said it was even possible that the money saved by not approving the tax credit would be used to lower the federal deficit further an investment tax credit was first put on the books in the kennedy administration it expired and was reinstated several times until it was finally repealed , supposedly for good , by the tax reform act of 1986 the main theme of the 1986 law , which mr moynihan and mr rostenkowski strongly supported , was lower tax rates and the elimination of tax breaks i have spent a lot of effort getting mischief out of the tax code , mr rostenkowski said but mr clinton has a different philosophy he believes that businesses and individuals should sometimes be given tax incentives to accomplish economic and social goals in his election campaign last year , mr clinton offered an investment tax credit as one of the main aspects of his effort to generate more private investment putting people first , the clinton campaign manifesto , observed that the japanese invested twice as much per person as americans and he promised a targeted investment tax credit to encourage investment in new plants and productive equipment here at home that we need to compete in the global economy plan smaller than expected the actual proposal sent to congress in february proved to be much more modest than many business executives and economists had expected based on the campaign oratory
it was a leaky roof at a decrepit , 95yearold public school in chinatown that led to the discovery that years and millions of dollars had been wasted on negligent or fraudulent asbestos inspections , that scores and possibly hundreds of city schools may still be contaminated with the cancercausing material but long before asbestos was found last june at public school 1 , at 8 henry street , touching off the investigation whose explosive results were announced at city hall yesterday , authorities in charge of school asbestos abatement programs should have known that the problem was widespread , investigators said over the last three years , the investigators said yesterday , the school construction authority created by the state in 1989 to speed renovations in schools had found asbestos in walls and ceilings at 70 schools , all sites that federally mandated reports in the 1980 s had pronounced asbestosfree the construction authority reported its asbestos findings , and contradictory reports made under the federal asbestos hazard emergency response act of 1986 socalled ahera reports to the board of education s asbestos task force , but apparently nothing was done to determine the extent of the problem or to alert the public or other officials problem ignored , report says thus , asbestos that posed dangers to children , teachers , custodians and other school staff members was ignored over long periods of time because of a misplaced reliance on inaccurate ahera reports , the investigators , edward f stancik and thomas d thacher 2d , said in a report to mayor david n dinkins efforts to obtain comment from officials of the asbestos task force late yesterday were unavailing the problem of inaccurate or fraudulent asbestos reports may date back more than a decade in 1979 , the state directed all local school systems to survey their schools for asbestos and develop plans for abating hazards , which often meant sealing them rather than trying to remove them , since asbestos fibers are dangerous when airborne that same year , the board of education created and staffed the asbestos task force to comply with the law in 1986 a similar but more comprehensive federal law was passed and the task force was expanded to fulfill its requirements it hired a consultant , envirosafe , to assist with inspections , training and the preparation of asbestos reports on 1 , 100 schools before a 1989 deadline then , in renovating city schools the school construction authority began to find asbestos in places where the ahera reports said none was present it happened often enough , investigatators said , that the authority began to distrust the ahera reports , and before undertaking any extensive work at a school it began conducting its own sampling and testing in the last three years , investigators said , the authority found asbestos in 70 schools in walls and ceilings that had been called asbestosfree in the ahera reports , and it detailed these findings and the discrepancies to the board of education s task force , which took no action investigators yesterday said that it was unclear when , or even if , officials in the construction authority or the task force recognized that a pattern of consistent errors in the ahera reports was developing the authority was merely reporting a series of discrepancies to the task force , which was responsible for keeping the asbestos records accurate and up to date , one official said the problem finally came to light last june when the construction authority , nearing the completion of roof repairs at ps 1 in chinatown , began work on walls that had been damaged by longstanding leaks it found extensive asbestos , much of it flaking dangerously inaccuracies cited the ahera reports for the school , completed in 1988 , were so egregiously wrong , even as to the location of walls , ceilings and other fixed locations , investigators said , that they might have been describing another school in another community spots that the ahera reports said were asbestos free were in some instances laden with asbestos , while others were in thin air in the middle of the room or some location outside the room , the report to the mayor said in one case , it added , the coordinates describe a spot outside the building the construction authority , instead of notifying the asbestos task force about just another discrepancy , told amy linden , the school system s chief executive for school facilities it was the decision to inform ms linden , investigators said , that apparently broke the logjam in the case amid an uproar by alarmed parents and teachers who charged that the health and safety of hundreds of pupils and staff members had been jeopardized , the school a fivestory white brick building erected in 1898 , was closed on june 16 and its children sent to another school for the final week of classes consultant called in ms linden , who is responsible for planning the school system s capital construction and renovations , asked a consultant , contest , of nutley , nj , to investigate the situation and notified the construction authority s inspector general , mr thacher , and mr stancik , the special schools investigations commissioner , of the problem with the ahera reports the ensuing investigation by mr thacher and mr stancik over the next four weeks examined fewer than two dozen schools and ahera reports , but concluded that each one was fundamentally inaccurate it also found that the extent of asbestos contamination in city schools was impossible to determine but so alarming were the preliminary results and so large were the stakes the dangers to nearly a million students and the possibility that some schools may not be able to open when school starts on sept 9 that the investigators and mayor dinkins decided to make matters public , even at the risk of further eroding public confidence in a school system where unknown dangers lurk while responsibility for what has happened remains to be determined , the investigators were clearly blaming the asbestos task force citing the public s right to know about asbestos contamination in schools , they told the mayor the atf has effectively frustrated these provisions , providing an already skeptical and cynical public with further reason to mistrust government photos since the prior asbestos tests have proven meaningless and mismanaged , mayor david n dinkins terminated more than 45 city contracts with envirosafe , the company that oversaw the asbestos program a

john sculley s personal odyssey is continuing the former president of pepsico was once sarcastically asked by steven p jobs whether he wanted to spend his life as a sugar water salesman since then he has made the transition to apple computer s chief technology officer and now is on the brink of becoming what president clinton affectionately referred to as a washington technology policy wonk mr sculley was prominently seated next to hillary rodham clinton when the president presented his economic package before congress last month a week later , when president clinton and vice president gore visited silicon valley to introduce the president s high technology program , they dined as mr sculley s guests in los gatos , calif mr sculley had even been prominently mentioned as a candidate for a highranking position in the clinton administration then there is the possibility of the presidency at ibm mr sculley is reported to be one of a small group of executives the world s largest computer maker is considering mr sculley asserts that none of these options holds any interest for him instead , his passion remains what he describes as the convergence of four industries computing , publishing , telecommunications and entertainment into a single trillion dollar information business by the turn of the century question what has meant the most to you at apple \? answer the powerbook gave us a chance to rethink the entire company the things that made us successful in the 1980 s will not make us successful in the 1990 s i realized that the 90 s were going to be designed around communications more than computing the success of the powerbook speaks more about what apple will be like in the future the apple of the 1990 s is going to be about mobility and communications q what do you want to accomplish next \? a i 've been at apple 10 years the thing that i'm most proud of and most interested in is our technology that s what i want to focus my time on if you look at the most successful high technology companies , the best strategies are based on business decisions which are technology centered my sense is that is the place where i can have the most leverage q apple is about to enter the computer systems business how can you succeed \? a we do n't start with anything near the credibility that other companies have instead we 'll start with apple s loyal base in education and other places where we have strength , such as the publishing industry we 're going to focus on what s happening with media being distributed over networks and what s happening with imaging being distributed over networks q but you 're known as an easeofuse company why should apple succeed in corporate computing \? a we think one of apple s strengths is not just its user interface , but its integration of the pieces those are things we 'll focus on in the server market but to say we 're going to be a heavyduty server company like hp or dec or ibm would go beyond the point of credibility at this point q how did you begin working with the clinton administration \? a i met hillary clinton five years ago when we began working together to create the national center for education and the economy which i now chair and she is a board member of i met bill clinton two years ago when i approached the national governors' association on technology and education issues we could n't get the bush administration to pay any attention to what we were trying to do john sculley born april 6 , 1939 , new york city education brown university , ba wharton , mba drives east coast 1983 mercury lynx west coast 1984 mercedes station wagon noncomputer reading the creators , by daniel j boorstin ideal escape cottage in maine hobbies designing and building things , including barns , houses and boats pc apple macintosh powerbook 180 loaded with the works photo of john sculley \( associated press \)
let s stipulate that president clinton has a lot on his mind these days besides naming ambassadors granted , too , that his choosing of ambassadors is complicated by a laudable desire to give more scope to women and minorities add to this the cumbersome fbi clearances that now include the nannygate hurdle of possible prior employment of illegal domestics even so , none of those factors can excuse the surfeit of empty embassies still sitting in many countries , some of vital importance to american foreign policy these vacancies attest to the indecision that afflicts a wobbling presidency as the times s elaine sciolino recounted friday , mr clinton in five months has failed to put forward his choice for , among other countries , japan , india , italy , israel , australia , south korea , the philippines , saudi arabia , sweden and morocco all told , there are no nominations for vacancies in 37 out of 164 embassies , not including germany , where a lameduck holdover continues the white house counters with two defenses , neither persuasive it claims that the senate has confirmed 12 nominees , compared with the total of 9 and 8 in the same span after presidents bush and reagan assumed command those slippery numbers measure the senate s performance , not the president s a second defense is feebler that secondlevel career diplomats are fully capable of performing all necessary functions if that s so , then why have ambassadors \? host countries anxious to have their views heard in washington want to deal with an envoy who has highlevel access sometimes access can matter more than diplomatic inexperience , as in the case of mike mansfield , the former democratic senator who served effectively in tokyo for presidents carter and reagan a better explanation for mr clinton s indecision is the political necessity of repaying campaign debts with embassy posts jeanette hyde , a democratic fundraiser , was charmingly frank she covets greece , cyprus or switzerland but would settle for some little island this antic aspect of american democracy invites unseemly lobbying among rivals for the spoils but the larger problem is of mr clinton s own making his insistence on approving every choice himself that could work in a wellmanaged white house , but it has become a formula for procrastination , especially for a president too eager to please everybody to be sure , delegating authority and speeding clearances carry some risks but those empty embassies carry bigger risks for a president whose resolution is in doubt , at home and abroad

later , but there had been something strangely unsettling in the newcomer s eyes hours later , during a visit to another church , that intuition proved prophetic as organ and voices swelled in an opening hymn , mr battiste bolted toward the altar , sweeping the bible , the gleaming metal cross and the brass candlesticks to the floor before loping glassy eyed for the door that was 13 erratic and sometimes violent months before the sunday in january when , the authorities say , mr battiste went berserk on the steps of yet another bronx church and hammered the life out of doll mamie johnson , an 80yearold former sunday school superintendent , with a piece of pipe mentally ill for much of his life and frequently hurling himself into rages with crack and a hallucinogenic drug called angel dust , mr battiste had been a disaster waiting to happen when he was arrested and charged with murder , it sent a chill through a city that has grown fearful of an army of troubled people , many of them homeless , whose mental illness is made worse by the use of drugs most of these people , experts insist , are not dangerous but mr battiste s journey over the precipice tracked in police and medical records and interviews with psychiatrists , friends , his mother and city and state officials is the story of a deeply disturbed man and the system that failed to help him at almost every crucial step of the way for years , mr battiste had drifted in and out of jails , homeless shelters and psychiatric emergency rooms but even as his life became a lengthening litany of encounters with a fractured system , he received limited help at best lost in a web of medical , socialservice and criminaljustice bureaucracies , which do not share records because of confidentiality rules , he was often treated as a man with no records at all and as often happens with mentally ill drug abusers , he was never deemed appropriate for involuntary hospitalization , under a law that many psychiatrists say bars them from confining a patient unless , at the time of examination , he appears dangerous to himself or others his mother tried to get him help , said mr mosby , the pastor of the fellowship covenant church , three blocks from the apartments where mr battiste grew up in the castle hill section of the bronx she begged them to keep him in the hospital so he would n't hurt himself or somebody else mr battiste made more than a dozen trips to city emergency rooms in the last five years , sometimes manacled , kicking and yelling obscenities he is a powerfully built , intimidating figure with a dossier of arrests that rambles from auto theft to attempted rape but he would always calm down in a few hours or days and be sent on his way sometimes doctors would ask him to report to a psychiatric or drugtreatment center for followup care but he was not one of the few patients assigned a personal escort , or case manager , and he seldom , if ever , went for treatment terrorized his mother in the time it took to panhandle a few dollars , he would get hold of more drugs and shamble off for another meeting with his old demons pounding on doors and skulking in hallways , he terrorized his mother and her neighbors he fought with police officers and hospital attendants and sometimes slugged shelter residents who shrugged when he tried to bum cigarettes today , mr battiste is confined in a bellevue psychiatric ward , awaiting arraignment on charges of seconddegree murder how he will plead remains unknown his court appointed lawyer , alvin c morris , did not return telephone calls the slaying of doll johnson as she arrived at the salvation baptist church on the cold , graying afternoon of jan 17 , was only the latest in a series of highly publicized cases that have galvanized demands for new ways of dealing with potentially dangerous mentally ill drug abusers last fall , larry hogue , a mentally ill drug abuser , was finally placed in a state mental hospital after years of frightening residents on the upper west side with muttered threats and bizarre behavior mr hogue was ordered freed last week by a judge who said he suffered from an attitude problem , not mental illness the state has appealed a year earlier , kevin mckiever , another troubled man who had roamed the same neighborhood , was charged with stabbing a 30yearold woman to death the disorder a mental illness inflamed by drugs just like many of the rudderless young men who drop out of school and become regulars in the courts , jails and hospitals , mr battiste suffers from a difficulttotreat , wideranging condition known as antisocial personality disorder , according to doctors who have reviewed his psychiatric records those suffering with it usually do not hear voices and see visions , as schizophrenics do chronically angry and combative , they instead take pleasure in violating social norms and hurting others
dallas , dec 16 if the nation finally has a recovery worthy of the name , it is due in large part to the turnaround executed by home builders like robert spies mr spies , based in the dallas suburbs , builds what used to be called starter homes these days he is keeping busy , and then some straight through the weekend , he tours subdivisions where he could start projects and inspects the last of the more than 100 homes he has built this year , the most since 1988 banks and savingsandloans are competing to lend him money , and rarely does he get as far as sodding a front lawn without finding a buyer that is a far cry from two and a half years ago , when he was on the verge of declaring bankruptcy the government took over his major lender and cut off his credit potential home buyers were holding back for fear of losing their jobs his work crews , idled , eventually dispersed a painfully close call i 've gotten survivor' written across my chest , he said , drawing himself up with a deep breath by the grace of god , i made it the boom in home buying and building , in dallas and much of the rest of the country , has animated the broader economy builders require supplies of materials and labor home buyers shop for furnishings and appliances so today s buyers and construction workers are tomorrow s customers at sears , ethan allen or circuit city the commerce department reported on friday that home starts were up 39 percent in november purchases by firsttime buyers accounted for much of the gain visiting a construction site , mr spies , 57 , steps nimbly through the skeletal frame of a 100 , 000 home going up 20 minutes east of downtown dallas he prods the carpenters to stay until they use every scrap of lumber delivered that day , lest overnight disappearances cause delays for the first time in five years , mr spies is also developing raw land for new neighborhoods , putting in roads , utilities and sewers until recently , dallas builders could buy all the lots they needed from the government , which had seized them when the savings and loan institutions capsized his project in east dallas , he said , is on some of the last of those lots , its basic facilities and services provided , but then left vacant for years although banks have recently become more willing to lend , their rules are new ten years ago , i could virtually do a land development without putting a nickel into it , mr spies said today , i 've got to bring the land to the deal , free and clear to buy the land without borrowing , mr spies has had to find investment partners , which has cut profits the banks only finance the improvements even so , by this fall , new singlefamily houses were going up at the fastest rate nationally since the mid80 s about a third of the current 4 percent annual growth in the economy can be traced to the building of singlefamily houses and related spending , said kenneth t rosen , chairman of the center for real estate and urban economics at the university of california at berkeley falling prices and low mortgage rates have brought out the buyers , while banks' renewed willingness to lend has helped builders housing is the most affordable it s been in two decades , mr rosen said it s an affordablehousing boom recovery in name only it s also a boom that has been very slow in coming new housing , usually the first flower of a recovery , failed to blossom this time until the limp expansion was more than two years old the reasons become evident in the story of mr spies s nearcollapse and recovery he is the sort of builder that others in dallas perhaps conscious of their industry s sometimes hucksterish , highrisk tinge point to as a good example , his dealings as tidy as a model home during the mid80 s boom , mr spies was building 150 to 200 houses a year his staff of 20 included crews to pour foundations and nail together frames he remained conservative , borrowing only half the price of his 20 , 000 building lots he turned down 10 , 000 a month from some savings and loan executives to do little more than front for their real estate deals he still had plenty of money for cruises or european tours and for meals at the dallas restaurants of the moment in mid1987 , regulators demonstrated their trust in mr spies by installing him as a board member at two failed savings and loan institutions in houston and asked him to liquidate them within about six months he saw loan portfolios that included land directly under a dam an appraisal calmly noted that the dam was opened , flooding the land , only once a year then the regulators told him they had too little money to pay off the depositors board members had little choice but to raise interest rates to levels among the highest in the country , in search of new capital they drew in brokered deposits up to the 100 , 000 limit of federal insurance , drawing money away from healthier institutions his own financing came from a solid fort worth bank , texas american , so he thought he had few worries
let s say you were channelsurfing tuesday night on nbc , there was the premiere of the john larroquette show let s say you were channelsurfing thursday on nbc , there was the premiere of the john larroquette show again as the 1993 television season begins the official starting date is sept 20 , but few pay attention to that anymore viewers are going to see the same episode of many new shows showing up twice they are also going to see several shows premiering in time slots that are not their own the first practice broadcasting the same show twice within days is known in the television industry as doublepumping the second , starting a new show in a time slot more favorable than the one it will eventually have , is known as stunting both have the obvious goal of increasing the number of people who , in industry parlance , sample a new show it is hoped , of course , that the more people who see one episode of a show , the more will come back but that is not always the way it turns out it works if a show is a good show , david f poltrack , senior vice president for research at cbs , said if it s not , exposure occurs early , and people bail out early by the time the season starts , the show is already in decline figures provided by peter chrisanthopoulos , abc s executive vice president for research , marketing and promotion , show that doublepumping and stunting do indeed increase the audience for a new show but they also suggest that when it comes to the show s ultimate success or failure , the tactics make little difference last year , for example , abc broadcast the pilot episode of covington cross twice in one week , a tactic that increased total viewership of the show by almost 50 percent the show still ended up being canceled none of these tactics insure that the show s going to be successful , mr chrisanthopoulos said but they do without a doubt generate additional sampling doublepumping and stunting are relatively new tactics , and both originated in response to the increasingly competitive world in which the broadcast networks operate according to mr poltrack , it used to be that roughly half of all viewers would try a new show now , with so many new options available to viewers , that proportion has dropped to roughly a third to get closer to 50 percent , or at least 40 percent , you 're going to have to do something extraordinary , he said the downside of both tactics is that other shows are displaced , and viewers may become confused about which show is really on when if you can get the sampling in the regular time period , you 're obviously much better off , mr poltrack said for advertisers , a second broadcast of the same show is treated essentially as a new show because the viewership for the second broadcast is apt to be lower , though , the rates are apt to be lower , too each of the four broadcast networks is stunting or doublepumping at least a few shows this month on abc , missing persons , an hourlong drama , had its premiere on a monday night its regular time slot is on thursday night thea , a halfhour sitcom , was broadcast last week after the hit show home improvement on wednesday night its regular time slot is before home improvement this week , moon over miami , a comedydrama , will premiere in the coveted post home improvement spot as of next week , it will be broadcast half an hour later on cbs , it had to be you , a new sitcom starring faye dunaway , will premiere after 60 minutes on sunday night its regular time slot is on friday night mr poltrack said that the network was trying to keep doublepumping and stunting to a minimum because the major league baseball playoffs and world series will be interrupting cbs s schedule in a few weeks , and viewers might get too disoriented nbc is doublepumping the john larroquette show not just once , but twice the network sees the show as a potential hit a preview episode was broadcast two weeks ago on thursday night and rebroadcast last night the show officially premiered in its regular time slot last tuesday the premiere was then rebroadcast thursday night after the hit comedy seinfeld fox is doublepumping three of its new shows the adventures of brisco county jr , living single and daddy dearest , and one of its returning shows , roc it will be several weeks , of course , before the impact of all this mixing and matching is known it is likely , though , that by then some of the shows will already have been canceled drawing

buffeted by persistent charges of racial friction , inadequate training and misconduct by some of its top officials , the transit authority police announced a major management reorganization yesterday , simplifying its command structure and reshuffling critical personnel under transit police chief michael f o'connor under the reorganization , an official recently accused of sexual harassment was relieved as the commander of the department s inspectional services and internal affairs investigations but the department s top black official , who had been reprimanded recently for showing xrated movies to visiting russian officials in 1991 , was given command of all patrol and detective services transit officials said the structural changes had been planned since last summer and would streamline the department , giving more power to fewer commanders and replacing some too long in the same jobs they said the changes were also a way to promote strategies that have cut serious subway crime by nearly 30 percent over the last two years officials said the top personnel changes were not a response to recent problems 5 , 100member department other lawenforcement experts noted that the reorganization , which took effect immediately , would not alter the ways in which the 5 , 100member police department patrols subways , tracks criminal suspects or deploys other forces to safeguard the public but new commanders and restructured bureaus , these experts said , might help to reduce frictions , improve training and ease other personnel problems i would think this is not some great reorganization to improve service , said a lawenforcement expert familiar with the inner workings of the transit police , who insisted upon anonymity it s just moving people around a little to improve the way they get along , to help them deal with racial difficulties and individual difficulties albert o'leary , a transit police spokesman , acknowledged that the changes affected structure and personnel , but said that they would improve crimefighting this is management shuffling the management deck , but it puts new eyes on the existing problems , mr o'leary said it s not going to affect the way the department patrols , but it will affect how we analyze patterns of crime and deploy and use resources mr o'leary said serious crime on the subways homicides , robberies , rapes , assaults and other felonies had declined by about 15 percent in each of the last two years the final figures for 1992 will not be out until next month , but are expected to show fewer than 13 , 500 subway crimes last year , down from 15 , 572 in 1991 and 18 , 324 in 1990 the reorganization was the first major change under chief o'connor , who became head of the transit police last march , replacing william j bratton , an innovative commander who in a 21month tenure got his officers new uniforms and 9millimeter pistols , created decoy patrols , expanded warrant squads and was credited with raising morale and cutting crime on a system used by 32 million riders daily mr bratton resigned last january to take the no 2 job in the boston police department the reorganization was in part an effort by chief o'connor to put his own imprint on the department and to lessen his administrative burdens by assigning more responsibility to top subordinates , officials said under the plan , five former bureaus were consolidated into three enlarged commands , each headed by a threestar chief or its civilian equivalent in the largest and most important unit , all patrol and detective services were consolidated into a new field operations command its members include most of the department s 3 , 600 patrol officers , 200 detectives and 600 sergeants , lieutenants , captains and other supervisors most of the department s 700 civilians are in other commands appointment defended named to command field operations was george a latimer , the former chief of administrative services and the department s highestranking black official in november , chief latimer was accused of being intoxicated on the job and had been accused earlier of showing pornographic movies to a delegation of visiting russian police officials about 18 months ago chief o'connor , in an interview , said no evidence had been found to support the allegation that chief latimer had been drunk on the job , but he said chief latimer had been formally reprimanded after an investigation into the incident involving pornographic movies he defended chief latimer s appointment , saying he was the best commander for the field operations post other lawenforcement experts noted that the appointment of a black chief to the no 2 post might help to ease tensions in a department that has been deeply troubled recently by reports of racial frictions some reports have come from anonymous letters to top officials in the department others followed the shooting last november of a black undercover officer , derwin pannell , by two white transit officers who said they mistook him for a mugger as he held a farecheating suspect at gunpoint outside a brooklyn subway station

rome , dec 13 buffeted by election setbacks and touched by italy s vast corruption scandal , the insurgent northern league has publicly closed ranks behind its leader and his call for italy to be divided into three federal states before a twoday league congress in milan , which ended on sunday , italian analysts spoke of rifts in the organization and possible challenges to to the leadership of umberto bossi after two years of gains that have propelled the league from fringe movement to political heavyweight the shifts and strains have come after mayoral elections a week ago in which the league fared poorly outside northern italy , forcing it for the first time to contemplate seeking allies before national elections expected in the spring but threats to mr bossi s position seemed to evaporate as he restated his claim to dominance in whatever national government emerges from almost two years of scandal and political turmoil the league will be the decisive force for the nation s future , he declared to cheers but the party s acclaim did not remove a sense that the league is facing problems as it seeks support beyond its northern base losses to leftists in the elections on dec 5 , northern league candidates in genoa , venice and trieste lost to rivals from leftwing alliances supported by italy s former communists , who also scored heavily in rome and naples and put down a strong challenge from the neofascist italian social movement some league members blamed mr bossi for the defeats his fortunes seemed to dim further last week when one of his senior aides confessed to accepting an illicit 130 , 000 campaign contribution from the ferruzzi group , italy s secondlargest private conglomerate the disclosure was a particular embarrassment , since the league s appeal lies largely in its readiness to project itself as a clean organization tilting against the corruption of italy s discredited political establishment while mr bossi did not defend the aide , he offered to testify before magistrates in milan investigating italy s huge kickback scandal when the league congress opened on saturday , mr bossi indicated that he had shifted from the idea of the league s spreading its influence beyond the north so as to storm the gates of national government alone new electoral laws , he said , mean that you must either form alliances or run the risk of isolation the only way to defeat the left is with a liberal , democratic alliance with the league at its heart , he said since the mayoral vote , politicians of all stripes have been talking about new partners and allies , but none seem especially comfortable with prospective suitors iconoclastic approach both the former communists and the neofascists , for instance , object to the league s notion of federalism , while the league itself has not spelled out whom it would court for a political partnership at the weekend congress , mr bossi seemed bent on continuing his own iconoclastic approach , unveiling a program for federalism that would divide italy into three republics in the north , center and south with strong fiscal independence people in italy s affluent north have long asserted that while they pay the bulk of the country s taxes , they receive disproportionately low revenue because rome fritters away money in the impoverished , mafiahaunted south mr bossi promised a referendum in the north on his federalist plans soon and , keeping up pressure for an early dissolution of parliament to open the way for new elections , he repeated his threat to withdraw the league s 79 members of parliament as soon as a new budget was approved this month
miami , feb 4 when the dade county commission was considering a familyleave ordinance in 1991 , malone hyde food distributors was among the many companies that testified against the idea , arguing that the legislation would impose an unnecessary and disruptive burden on them but nearly a year after the law took effect in florida s most populous county , the company has a new attitude we had reservations about being told what we could and could n't do , but it has n't really had any affect on us , said janet blair , the personnel director none of the 600 employees have yet asked for a family leave even though they are aware of it , she added nationwide , 25 states and the district of columbia have some type of familyleave legislation but dade county was the first county in the country to pass such a measure , and its ordinance most closely resembles the federal bill , according to the families and work institute , a organization in new york city that studies the issue in dade county , many of the 2 , 500 companies covered by the law have reached conclusions similar to that of malone hyde food some , like ms blair , say it is because few employees are taking the leaves others say it is proving less expensive than expected and actually increases worker satisfaction and output big gain in loyalty not only do you get a tremendous amount of loyalty , since they know they can come back to their job , but from the productivity perspective you get more done because they come back refreshed , said stephen cerrone , director of human resources at burger king , which has its corporate headquarters here this has been nothing but positive for us the legislation s backers say they have been pleased with the results commissioner larry hawkins , who sponsored the ordinance , and other county officials have said that the policy is working as expected and that there have been few complaints like the bill passed by congress last night , which provides for 12 weeks of leave , the legislation here , which took effect in march , lets workers take six days more , up to 90 days , of unpaid leave for the birth of a child or the illness of an immediate relative , with a guarantee they will have a job when they return because of the similarities , workers and corporate managers here say that once a federal bill became law , the misgivings around the country would probably ease edward garcia , a service representative for southern bell who was able to take six months off to care for a sick child , said he was pleased i was allowed to return to the same title , the same office , the same supervisor and the same money , he said how could i not be grateful to a company that granted me this , that helped my son incredibly \? fears that large numbers of employees here would immediately try to take advantage of the program have proven to be unfounded there has been very little abuse compared to the size of our work force , said henry c fraind , director of management and operations for the dade county school system , which employs 38 , 000 you ca n't earn money when you 're out , sitting at home many critics of family leave argue that obligatory policies will add to the cost of doing business , thereby leading to higher unemployment senator connie mack , a florida republican who opposes the federal bill , said in a statement this week that it is ridiculous for the government to pile regulation after regulation on employers and not expect job losses to follow but companies here that offer family leave say their experience has been otherwise the costs have not been oppressive , said terry johnson , a spokesman for southern bell , which has about 5 , 500 employees here and was one of several larger corporations that already offered family leaves that is not to say , though , that companies have not had to make adjustments new strategies the challenge to our managers and bank team is the staffing issue , said elizabeth ferrer , vice president for human resources at barnett bank of south florida , who has taken two maternity leaves herself one thing we have done is to have a larger support team throughout dade county , so that when family leave occurs we have somebody who can step right into that place but mr cerrone of burger king said that by shuffling workers around , his company has actually gotten some yardage out of exposing people to different areas of the business executives of smaller companies , however , argue that it has been harder for them to comply with the county ordinance because they do not have as much flexibility lombardo perez , president of metro ford , an automobile dealership here that has 92 employees , said that only one of his workers , a mechanic , had asked for the family illness leave my one reservation about this is that in some very specialized jobs , like an air conditioning mechanic , it can be difficult to get a temporary replacement , mr perez said mr perez also said he was happy to hold a job for productive workers but if they 're not good employees , i'm not going to want to do the same , he added photo edward garcia was able to take six months off from his job at southern bell to care for a sick child because of familyleave legislation in dade county , fla i was allowed to return to the same title , the same office , the same supervisor and the same money , said mr garcia , with his son bryan how could i not be grateful to a company that granted me this , that helped my son incredibly \?

music historian , and kip lornell , a music researcher for the smithsonian institution s national museum of american history , do not softpedal the facts , adding a previously unreported teenage shooting incident \( cleared up by his father , who had given him the pistol \) to three betterknown imprisonments for murder and assault though the details generally remained fuzzy , much was made of ledbetter s criminal record and supposed propensity for violence when he was first celebrated as an entertainer however , they do minimize their subject s image as the murderous minstrel of a 1935 time profile they point out that leadbelly lived in a frontier environment where violence was an accepted part of life they argue that his sole homicide conviction resulted from a case of selfdefense , and they establish that the crime for which he did hard time in louisiana s brutal angola penitentiary was refusing to take guff from a white man for ultimately , of course , his africanamerican world was controlled by europeanamerican racists still , examine the lives of other bluesmen and songsters with dangerous reputations and you 'll find only one prison term each for son house , bukka white and lightnin' hopkins , and none for robert johnson , charley patton , tommy johnson or henry thomas unless leadbelly had exceptionally bad luck , he must have been one tough customer the authors' willingness to skirt this embarrassing likelihood typifies the failures of the life and legend of leadbelly , an honest , authoritative biography that provokes as many questions as it answers mr wolfe and mr lornell are excellent on the varied sources of leadbelly s music their detailed history of his renowned goodnight irene , which appears to have originated with a racially integrated pop songwriting duo of the 1880 s and undergone uncounted oral transformations before it reached the man who gave it back to the world , quietly demolishes the musicofthefolk romanticism that holds that songs are created spontaneously by vague collectivities or by anonymous geniuses , unsullied by education , industrialization or modernity itself they have found out as much about his virtually undocumented early life as seems possible almost a century later and their account of how leadbelly suddenly became a darling of white academics and progressives of his dealings with the lomaxes , the nascent new york folk scene of the 1930 s and 40 s and the communist party is balanced and thoroughly researched but they never take it up a notch more than any bluesman , the artist whose career most closely parallels leadbelly s is the folkmusic movement s other star exhibit , woody guthrie , who grew up less than 300 miles from leadbelly and even sponged a bed off him for a while in new york granted , it s not entirely fair to compare the life and legend of leadbelly to joe klein s woody guthrie a life whereas leadbelly died in 1949 , mr klein did his digging barely a decade after the death in 1967 of his subject , a compulsive scribbler who left millions of unpublished words behind him mr klein knew he had the makings of a great book , and he wrote one nevertheless , the guthrie biography points up what is absent here not just the psychological depth that can be attributed to mr klein s privileged access , but any concerted attempt to assess the evolution of folk music as a theoretical concept and an urban phenomenon , the cultural ferment surrounding the communist party , or , indeed , leadbelly s place in musical history by declining to offer critical analyses of leadbelly s music of his vocal and instrumental style , his writing , the changes he worked on found material the authors make that music seem like a natural phenomenon rather than willed , conscious art or entertainment , which is precisely the kind of mystification their research usually works to correct finally , we are left with what must have been a surreal inner journey a mature black man plucked from the selfcontained world of the black south a world that he \( unlike muddy waters , say \) never showed any desire to escape or transcend except when enmeshed in its penal system and transformed , in the space of about a year , into a nearfamous new yorker whose professional and social relationships were primarily with wellmeaning white people , many of whom regarded blacks as noble savages , regardless mr wolfe and mr lornell do a good job of limning this complex story , but they 're understandably chary of filling in the outline a fuller account would clearly require empathy as well as sympathy a leap of imagination into leadbelly s racial conflicts that would almost certainly have been facilitated by more candid interviews with surviving africanamerican witnesses as well as the personal experience of bias it would be simplistic to suggest that any black writer could have provided more insight into the same raw material but i 'd love to see the right one try

four hundred us army rangers arrived in somalia yesterday , bolstering the 25 , 000 un troops already there as part of a peacemaking effort that will cost more than 15 billion this year at the same time , the un and private development groups are scaling back handouts of free food , replacing them with foodforwork projects that will in turn be replaced with cashforwork projects on the surface , this seems very positive the food emergency is over the harvest , largely sorghum but also other produce , looks good charity is being phased out yet these wellmeaning policies will only help to recreate the situation that led to the food shortage in somalia in the first place the food that somali workers will be receiving from agencies like care and the red cross will be imported wheat , rice and other commodities and when workers are paid , the funds will have been raised by selling donated food on the open market the un euphemistically calls this process monetization whatever it is called it will have the effect of undermining agriculture , hobbling commercial distribution networks and keeping the country dependent on imported food care alone has sold 5 million worth of wheat flour on the somali market a care spokesman in mogadishu told me that wheat is not grown in the country and therefore does not compete directly with the crops grown by somali farmers but someone whose belly is full of wheat flour is not likely to spend money on local sorghum the spokesman conceded that care would do better to use cash to pay somali workers , but he said it s much easier to get donations of food than cash food is plentiful and in surplus around the world cash is tight as he was explaining this , us blackhawk helicopters thundered overhead the price of one flight about 2 , 000 in 1980 , i began one of the earliest foodforwork projects in east africa after a year it was obvious the project did n't work because the food is free to the donors , its value is debased such projects tend to be makework excuses for giving away food this seems to be the case in mogadishu today where foodforwork consists of giving people empty garbage bags and then trading a bag of food for a bag of trash much of mogadishu has been reduced to rubble , but it s fairly clean somalis do n't waste much the project is likely to turn into a scavenger hunt with people looting garbage trucks as they once looted food convoys donors putting up their own cash would probably put more effort into designing projects they might tend to see their projects as investments , and create enterprises that would produce real income and eventually become selfsustaining saving money in the long run and once the workers themselves see that the projects produce income , they would have a stake in continuing them , even after the donors leave care now has 5 , 200 somalis receiving food and involved in public works projects none of the projects will lead to fulltime employment or become selfsufficient , and none will survive if new fighting cuts off food supplies and forces aid workers out of the country again africa is littered with the ruins of such projects somalis are paid to do them but have no personal stake in them unfortunately , relief groups are more adept at delivering charity than they are in building institutions groups looking for a model of successful development in mogadishu might take a closer look at the port where they go to collect food from the ships eddie johns , a former chief warrant officer in the us army and now employed by the un , is trying to run the port solely from fees paid by shippers mr johns employs 450 somali workers , paying them in cash his goals are modest to hand over a selfsustaining enterprise to a somali government someday unfortunately , commercial development in the rest of the country is being crippled by the continued dumping of surplus commodities , adding economic destabilization to the political crisis and while the un is raising billions for its military operations , it is investing nothing in building somalia s economy
baltimore , sept 29 jimmy key did not have a pennant race to pitch in , but there were other objectives like the chance to win 18 games for the first time , to solidify the yankees' grasp on second place , to increase his careerbest strikeout total and to further demonstrate that the team was wise to make a fouryear , 17 million investment in him key accomplished all of the above and finished his first season with the yankees in style tonight by pacing them to an 83 victory over the orioles at camden yards in allowing one run and striking out nine in seven innings , key improved to 186 and finished with 173 strikeouts and a 300 earned run average he bettered his victory total of 1987 when he was 178 with a 276 era for toronto key assessed his cy young award chances as slim and none , but said , it feels good to be able to do what they counted on me doing i signed the big contract , i came to new york and i came through when i go home to florida next week and think about it , it will feel good the game was vintage key baltimore was limited to four base runners after the first inning as key continued his role as a stopper , finishing the season with an 113 record following yankee losses key s chance to win 20 was destroyed because the bullpen failed him six times when he left games with leads , including three fourrun advantages key said it did not matter to him that his era was not below 300 and said he would not ask manager buck showalter to let him pitch one inning in an attempt to decrease his era to 299 the secondplace yankees lead the orioles and tigers by two and a half games and key s comments made it appear unlikely that showalter would even use him for an inning of relief on sunday it s the way jimmy key should finish the season , showalter said i 'd hate to think what we would have done without him tonight was his whole season in a nutshell
in scapin , the servant is a maestro of mischief , unable to restrain himself from meddling in the affairs of others moliere , who certainly recognized a good part when he wrote it , chose to play the title role in the original production in 1671 since then , scapin has come to be accepted as a most durable farce and one that can be subjected to open interpretation , as in scapino , the mirthful jim dalefrank dunlop italianate variation at the classic stage company through feb 21 , andrei belgrader gives the play a freewheeling workout , updating it with contemporary references and underscoring it with a harsher line as always , scapin needs an agile scamp , in this case , stanley tucci , a quickchange clown with a sly deadpan and a gift for mimicry with more malevolence than is customary in the role , he puts the intricate plot in motion and then casually sidesteps into improvisation interrupting the play , he converses with theatergoers , scrambles through the seats and then settles back waiting for the comedy to continue but without him onstage , the show takes a long pause the adaptation by mr belgrader and shelley berc lacks the hilarious precision of their version of rameau s nephew \( also at the csc \) , in which they made diderot seem like a forefather of the absurd in contrast , their scapin is so easygoing as to seem lackadaisical too much is left to the agility of the actors and the responsiveness of the audience as director , mr belgrader has gathered an energetic company of performers , but except for ken cheeseman as scapin s straight man , none of them can match mr tucci for inventiveness , and a few of them have been pushed into caricature at a recent performance , no matter how much mr tucci cajoled theatergoers , many of them were reluctant to join him in making fools of themselves on stage audience invasion is a risky business then , too , rusty magee s score is largely incidental , from gospel to gypsy , except for one droll touch whenever love is mentioned , an angelic choir warbles from some hidden rafter in the theater happily , mr tucci is an artful farceur , whether he is trying to draw a faster response from the slowtalking mr cheeseman , making brazen promises to his lovesick master or trying to decide what his next pratfall might be at one point , he imitates a global array of character types , interspersed with specific impersonations from life and cinema naturally the sack scene is the comic centerpiece in that encounter , scapin persuades his master s father to climb inside a sack and hide from potential attack the sole attacker is , of course , scapin , who covertly pummels the gullible old windbag mr tucci carries off the duplicity and his own subsequent deathbed scene with roguish aplomb as the rascal scapin , the actor is irrepressible scapin by moliere a new version by shelley berc and andrei belgrader music and lyrics by rusty magee directed by mr belgrader set by anita stewart costumes by candice donnelly and elizabeth hope clancy lighting by stephen strawbridge production stage manager , crystal huntington presented by the classic stage company , david esbjornson , artistic director patricia taylor , managing director at the csc theater , 136 east 13th street , east village octave alexander draper silvestre ken cheeseman scapin stanley tucci hyacinte sarah mccord williams argante michael mccormick geronte walker jones leandre joshua fardon zerbinette mary testa nerine roberta kastelic two porters john august and denis sweeney musician jules cohen photo stanley tucci performing in moliere s classic scapin \( t charles erickson \)
police and public safety experts throughout the new york region yesterday drew a tight security net around the city s airports , hotels , major tourist spots and other vulnerable public spaces , moving the city to an alert level not seen since the persian gulf war the precautions came as preliminary investigations pointed to the possible involvement of a terrorist group in the explosion in the basement of the world trade center on friday at newark international airport , a shortterm parking lot and three roadways were closed , security was increased near plane refueling areas and radar installations and teams of police officers were dispatched to investigate stray luggage and unidentified packages at la guardia airport , port authority police officers dragged away garbage cans and other receptacles that could be used to hide an explosive device and were calling for offduty officers to come to work additional precautions the heightened security was visible throughout the city , in closed roads , increased police and security guard presence and extra care taken examining deliveries that on normal days would be waved through into downtown offices , security coordinators at several businesses said explaining that security precautions at the waldorfastoria hotel in midtown manhattan were elevated to a level equivalent to that during a fire , flood or electrical interruption , bill carroll , the hotel s assistant director of security explained , we treat these things very seriously you ca n't minimize any threat the increased security stretched from newspaper offices to subway entrances and even telephone operation centers as the city s residents reacted with fear and astonishment to reports that friday s explosion in the basement of the world trade center may have been the result of a car bomb roughly equivalent in power to the explosion that rocked the united states embassy in beirut in 1983 if confirmed as an act of terrorism , the explosion would rank as the most violent terrorist attack in the nation s history , police and other law enforcement experts said yesterday while it was unclear what the bomb was made of , terrorism experts described the explosion as having the characteristics of from 200 to 300 pounds of a plastic explosive called semtex , and said it appeared to have been carefully placed and carefully planned they differed , however , on whether any terrorist group would claim responsibility and whether the apparent bombing on friday could be part of a broader plan of terrorist attacks within the united states new york city police commissioner raymond w kelly said the city was responding to the explosion with one of the largest antiterrorist operations since the start of the gulf war at an early afternoon press conference in manhattan , he and james fox , chief of the federal bureau of investigation in new york , confirmed that they had no suspects in the case mr kelly added , however , that police authorities had received at least 19 calls by groups claiming involvement none came before the midday blast , he said 'probably a bomb' though city and state officials stopped short of confirming the blast and fire as an act of terrorism , they ruled out almost any other possibility there is an immense crater , said gov mario m cuomo the damage , he said , looks like a bomb it smells like a bomb it s probably a bomb in washington and elsewhere around the nation , other security experts reacted to the news with precautions of their own police at the state department , the capitol and union station in washington were all placed on heightened alert after the world trade center explosion , said sgt dan nichols of the united states capitol police , the force that is responsible for the safety of government buildings including the capitol , senate and house of representatives officials at the white house and at washingtonarea airports said their security arrangements were not altered william colby , the former director of central intelligence , said that new york and other cities are in many ways easier to attack than the capital you do n't just sail into the bottom of the capitol building , so it is harder to do one of these things in washington ideal setting for an attack new york city , with its crowding , high profile and relatively low security , seemed to have provided an ideal setting for such an attack there is just going to be less security at a place like the world trade center than at the congress , the white house or the supreme court , said l paul bremer , the managing director of kissinger associates in manhattan and the ambassador at large for counterterrorism from 1986 to 1989 it is easier to move around in new york , and it is easier to create a great amount of terror there what makes such an attack so hard to guard against , said robert h kupperman , a senior adviser at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , is that it is easy to do the leverage is always on the terrorist s side because he can go wherever he wants while the government has to deploy ubiquitously , he said across new york city yesterday , that knowledge seemed to be sinking in although security officials with the united nations and many other institutions that could be targets for attacks declined to reveal their security arrangements and any adjustments made to them in the last 24 hours , many institutions explained that they responded as soon as word of the blast spread we 've made a minor increase in terms of security in some of our network facilities , said paula horii , a public relations representative with att ms horii said the company was preparing to protect computer systems , software , switching stations and other elements of its network the airports , however , were where nerves were most frayed as passengers waited for departing flights at kennedy , la guardia and newark airports , they commented on friday s explosion and the vulnerability of airline travel it shows you that the united states should be more cautious , said melinda yearwood , a new yorker preparing to leave from la guardia but it s not going to change anything for me i'm still taking my flights at kennedy airport , pat anderson , who had just arrived from tampa , fla , and was waiting for a connecting flight to rome , said she often believes that security is lax i have been delayed by increased security before , but i was very pleased , she said i think it s worth it at newark international airport , security was particularly tight as of 4 am saturday the complex was closed to all airport staff and ticketed passengers at about 8 30 am , a report of a suspicious package in terminal b prompted the port authority police to call the essex county police bomb squad , said lieut robert campion of the port authority police the squad was sent to check the package and found only a typewriter inside a corner of the airport terminal , however , was briefly evacuated while the box was examined photo security was tightened yesterday throughout the new york region following the explosion at the world trade center on friday

paris , april 6 sitting in a corner of the toulouse office of france s national archives one spring morning in 1991 , kurt werner schaechter untied a batch of dusty files and was suddenly confronted with a 1939 photograph of his mother , margarethe , attached to a refugee identity paper he had obtained special permission from local archival employees to study documents barred from public view since world war ii on the off chance of learning more about his austrian jewish parents though he knew they had been arrested in occupied france in 1942 and deported to nazi death camps , he was not prepared for what he found a question of morality i am a mathematician , therefore not at all mystical , said mr schaechter , who is now 72 but when i came face to face with my mother after 50 years , it was a shock it was a terrible experience i put the identity paper in my pocket it was the only document that i stole but the shock made him keep reading and , as he waded through more faded documents , many of them detailing french involvement in managing internment camps in the toulouse area and deporting both jews and nonjews to germany , he quickly saw why france wanted to keep this information secret then he decided that france had no moral right to do so with the help of a young french historian who was researching a different subject in the same building , he arranged for documents to be smuggled out of the national archives , photocopied and returned to their place over the next nine months , more than 12 , 000 documents were copied then last summer , fearing that his operation had been discovered and the documents might be seized , he sent copies of many of them to french officials and newspapers since then , he has embarked on a oneman crusade to demand that france open its tightly sealed world war ii archives in the name of respecting privacy , a new law in 1979 extended the period in which wartime documents were sealed , but the decision also reflected deep french reluctance to confronting the country s past and even now , with more and more of that past being unveiled , there is still no public clamor to know longhidden truths in this crazy world , if we do n't maintain our values , we 're lost , mr schaechter said in an interview at his home in the paris suburb of alfortville , where he is still sorting through the documents if we remain silent on these things , we 'll all go onto the rocks he insists that his purpose is not to seek revenge and suggests that if documents are released , the names of french officials be blacked out instead , he says , he wants to show that an entire system of state , rather than individual french citizens , was put at the service of nazi germany during the occupation his documents include hundreds of handwritten pages listing the names , birth dates , religion and fate left for germany is the euphemism for deportation of prisoners held in a half dozen internment camps in the hautegaronne department , which has toulouse as its capital above all , the files illustrate in greater detail than ever seen before how an efficient french administrative machine routinely went about carrying out arrests , seizing the property of detainees and , when necessary , selecting them for deportation to death camps or labor camps in germany or poland , recording everything it did on paper one of the few documents that offers any opinion is a 1943 report on the noe camp , 25 miles south of toulouse noting that most of its prisoners were old , it states the largest number of these are german israelites who can be considered refuse of life and who are incapable of insuring their subsistence their permanence in the camp therefore responds to a necessity train fares to death camps the french bureaucracy even treated the liberation of france in august 1944 as just one more event bills sent by the french national railroad authority two months after the allied landings in normandy asked the prefecture of hautegaronne to pay for transferring prisoners to germany and warned that interest would be charged for any delay documents showed that the bills were paid in late 1944 of course i do n't have everything , said mr schaechter , a nervous and talkative former musical instruments salesman i only have part of the picture , the tip of the iceberg to know the rest , we have to open the archives that s why i am provoking them i say , if i have done something wrong , take me to court in reality , mr schaechter readily admits that he violated the 1979 law limiting access to the documents though it does not refer specifically to world war ii files , the law sealed official documents containing medical , personal or family data for periods ranging from 60 to 150 years after they were written but so far the government has not charged mr schaechter with any crime , apparently preferring not to draw greater attention to the case for all france s reluctance to look afresh at its response to its occupation between 1940 and 1944 , awareness of the collaborationist vichy government s role in rounding up and deporting jews has in fact been growing in recent years , thanks to research carried out by a committee of children of deportees french accused of war crimes

syracuse marvelous marvin graves , bigplay maker and superb passer , is carrying the orange the running attack all but disappeared against pitt 35 attempts mostly between the tackles for 116 yards leaving the offense up to the quarterback so graves passed for 318 yards and 2 touchdowns , which is an average performance for the senior who has received heisman trophy attention the defense has been leaky all season and now comes miami in the orange bowl on saturday the hurricanes are less than invincible , and the concern of the coach , dennis erickson , was evident when he shifted quarterbacks on monday , from frank costa , a dropback passer , to the more mobile ryan collins that has not changed the syracuse defensive plans , said coach paul pasqualoni we expect to see both of

washington , may 26 the clinton administration is preparing a broad new effort to weaken iran by persuading reluctant allies to cut off loans , investment and arms sales to what american officials regard as a permanently hostile government the plan , drafted as part of an intensive policy review , reflects a conclusion that iran must be isolated if it is to be prevented from emerging as a substantial threat to western interests thus , the plan rejects reagan and bush administration policies that offered to reward teheran for good behavior abandoning a balance administration officials said the new approach aimed at denying iran access to the money and weapons needed to complete a military resurgence they said it was based on a decision that the united states and its allies should now treat iran as harshly as it treats iraq for much of the 1980 s , the united states sought to play iran and iraq against one another but with united nations sanctions imposed on iraq since the end of the persian gulf war , the administration has concluded that the wiser policy is dual containment secretary of state warren christopher hinted at the emerging shift earlier this year by denouncing iran as an international outlaw and a dangerous country for its support of terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear weapons but the new policy is far more sweeping than mr christopher indicated when he said the united states would seek to block loans to iran by international organizations administration officials say the isolation of iran should end only if teheran halts its support for terrorism , curtails its military buildup , stops its subversion of other governments and ends its quest for nuclear weapons catalogue of accusations among the antagonistic activities that united states officials attribute to iran is active support for efforts by the hamas and party of god organizations to use violence to disrupt the mideast peace talks the officials say iran has also helped establish terrorist training camps in lebanon and the sudan , and has assisted groups trying to overthrow the governments of egypt , algeria and tunisia the united states already subjects iran to stiff sanctions that prohibit military and most commercial ties administration officials said their new policy could succeed only if other countries change course among the top priorities , administration officials said , are efforts to convince russia and china to cancel deals to provide iran with weapons and nuclear reactors , and to persuade japan , germany and britain to cut off loans none of those countries have shown any willingness to sever such lucrative ties , and japan in particular has argued that commercial links can encourage moderate elements inside iran but while the united states once harbored similar hopes , administration officials now regard all factions in the current leadership as bound to remain hostile toward the west while many deals between united states companies and iran are already prohibited , the new policy would almost certainly lead the administration to reject a request by the boeing company to sell 20 boeing 737 jetliners to iran , a deal worth more than 750 million , officials say the broad outlines of the new approach were described in a speech last week by martin s indyk , the senior director for middle east policy for the national security council , to the washington institute for near east policy , a research group mr indyk said bluntly , if we fail in our efforts to modify iranian behavior , five years from now iran will be much more capable of posing a real threat to israel and to western interests in the middle east the iran review was one of several dozen studies requested by president clinton shortly after he took office but the atmosphere surrounding it has been intensified by suspicions that iran might have had a role in the world trade center bombing , government officials say investigators have found that tens of thousands of dollars were wired from iran to bank accounts held by suspects in the bombing no help likely for rebels final details of the plan await white house approval , officials say but while mr clinton made overtures to the main iranian opposition group before he took office , his advisers said there was no chance that the new policy would involve closer ties with the group , the people s mujahedeen the administration has concluded that the mujahedeen s ties to iraq and its terrorist attacks against americans in the 1970 s makes it an unacceptable partner the officials also expressed little optimism that the organized resistance or other domestic unrest could force a significant change in the iranian government they said they expected president hashemi rafsanjani to win reelection to a second fouryear term in elections on june 11 the political issues administration officials also said the united states had rejected seeking an embargo on sales of iranian oil the rebels have called for such a ban , but the policy review concluded that it could not be enforced without imposing a military blockade , a step mr clinton s advisers are unwilling to take in outlining the effort to isolate iran , officials acknowledged that the task would be more difficult than the containment of iraq , which carries the weight of united nations sanctions in march , an initial united states attempt to isolate teheran failed when the world bank overrode washington s objections and approved a 165 million loan to upgrade iran s electrical power system but officials who outlined the new policy said the united states intended to mount an aggressive effort to persuade other countries of the dangers iran poses administration officials have begun to argue that iran , which has borrowed 25 billion in the last four years , is not a good investment teheran has already fallen 5 billion behind on its payments , and the administration intends to warn countries that go ahead with sales of weapons and nuclear goods that they run the risk of not being paid because of high inflation and unemployment , a senior administration official said , iran was more vulnerable than it has been in the past or is likely to be in the future but he repeated mr indyk s warning that this moment will not last long the military issues the central intelligence agency has warned that iran may acquire a nuclear weapon by the end of the decade its deals with russia and china for nuclear reactors are regarded with uneasiness by some american analysts , who say the plants may be being used as a cover to acquire sensitive technology a simultaneous iranian buildup of conventional forces has prompted similar concern officials at the defense intelligence agency have said teheran s 2 billion military spending spree may be merely an effort to rebuild forces depleted during its eightyear war with iraq but purchases of russian submarines and a bid to buy topoftheline tanks have persuaded other officials that iran seeks to become the dominant power in the mideast
dublin , march 7 the wet , gray dublin winter has been warmed somewhat by the spirited onstage performances of the capital s two most prestigious theaters , the abbey and the gate the abbey , the official national theater , is also providing some heat with a flickering controversy about its artistic director , garry hynes since ms hynes , who is 39 , arrived in dublin from provincial galway county , to take over the abbey two years ago , she has been the constant target of the dublin theatrical establishment , led by newspaper and magazine critics they slashed her 1991 production of the plough and the stars , largely because she had audaciously presented sean o'casey s gloomy characters with shaven heads , recalling sinead o'connor , to the dismay of many dubliners who detest that singer since then , she has been under attack for putting on the wrong plays , for putting them on with imported actors \( like brian dennehy , who filled the house with his portrayal of hickey in eugene o'neill s iceman cometh \) and for ignoring the players of the abbey s own permanent company meanwhile , the gate , run by michael colgan , has matched , sometimes surpassed , the general quality of the abbey onstage without the offstage controversy the situation reflects the two theaters' essential and historical differences the abbey must present irish plays and develop irish writers , a mandate that often proves confining the gate is free to dip into irish material but more often presents european classics ranging from shakespeare to ibsen i love them both , said rosaleen linehan , ireland s favorite actress , who was in the abbey production of dancing at lughnasa in dublin , london and new york the two should be under the same canopy both are subsidized , so they should both be our national theater it would take away the sense of competition , without hurting they 're very different animals the gate has to produce classic plays with a very high production standard the abbey has to do both classical irish writing and new irish writing it has a much more dangerous , and adventurous , way a theater for everyone the theaters' marked difference in tone still provokes some theatergoers to label the gate and the abbey , respectively , sodom and begorrah , as they were known 40 years ago when the gate produced oscar wilde and the abbey put on j m synge in recent weeks , the gate regularly filled its 371 seats with congreve s double dealer the production , full of restoration lewdness and jokes , featured a hilarious performance by miss linehan at the same time , the abbey was having trouble filling its 628 seats with the honey spike , by bryan macmahon a sometimes harrowing work ending in death and despair , the play depicts the bad luck of two travelers , as ireland s itinerant people are now euphemistically known the itinerants , formerly called tinkers , are an underclass who face wide discrimination from many of their fellow irishmen ms hynes , in an interview in her small office above the theater , said her goal at the 95yearold abbey has been to produce stimulating and provocative theater the incessant argument over what a national theater should be has not helped , she said , adding that national means nothing , if not that it should be for everyone ms hynes said she wanted the abbey to do more tours of the country , but money is short she also said she wanted to bring the urban working classes into the theater i refuse to believe that good theater ca n't be popular theater , or that popular theater ca n't be good theater , she said she noted that she put real itinerants onstage as extras in the honey spike , and that she was trying to arrange for buses to transport residents of workingclass suburbs into the capital to attend plays ms hynes said she was puzzled by the critics' attacks i am an outsider , she said , but i'm not so sure that matters there are multiple views of what our national theater should be , and some of those views exclude plurality filling the seats mr colgan , who is 42 , took over the gate nine years ago , when it was filling only a quarter of its seats he said flexibility was the key to its success as the abbey s chief competitor in some ways , we keep the abbey honest , he said what is important is that we are capable of addressing the poverties of the irish theater mr colgan noted that the gate , which receives a government subsidy of about 600 , 000 a year , is freer than the abbey , which receives 3 million and must try to be a national theater in a country where there is no general agreement on what such a theater should present the gate , and mr colgan , are not vulnerable to such secondguessing as a result , the gate , founded in 1928 , is now seen by many critics and theatergoers as at least the abbey s artistic equal in terms of attendance , the gate consistently fills 90 percent of its seats , while the abbey averages about 65 percent future productions , mr colgan said , will include a midsummer night s dream , a doll s house and possibly a contemporary play , ira lewis s chinese coffee , starring al pacino mr colgan said that if the arts council raised the gate s subsidy to 900 , 000 a year , he could commission irish writers to write plays , as the abbey does we 've been looking at each other since the 20 s , he said of his rival we keep each other lively in recent days , both the gate and the abbey have been playing to full houses at the gate , ms linehan is sounding like ethel merman with a brogue in a sentimental musical , mary makebelieve audiences at the abbey have been applauding a version of the comedy of errors that moves shakespeare s play to a slum in modern dublin the actors engage in slapstick reminiscent of the three stooges , and the poetry is set to countrywestern music last week , the abbey received the bad news that the arts council had cut its grant by about 43 , 500 , while the gate was given an increase of abut 34 , 500 nothing 'built upon a rock' at the abbey , ms hynes declined to discuss whether she wanted to continue as artistic director the abbey s board is to decide in the fall whether to offer her a new contract that decision will in large part be made by james hickey , a lawyer who was recently appointed chairman , replacing noel pearson , who brought ms hynes to the abbey in an interview , mr hickey declined to discuss whether he would recommend offering ms hinds a new contract but he said that the abbey and its smaller experimental unit , the peacock , were playing to houses averaging 65 percent and that ms hynes has been doing well he added , we are in the business of taking risks mr hickey , whose wife is the actress fionna macanna and whose fatherinlaw , tomas macanna , was the abbey s artistic director three times , noted that in the theater s early years , audiences howled in derision at synge s playboy of the western world , and o'casey s plough , and that william butler yeats took the stage to tell the audience it had disgraced itself ms hynes said competition from the gate and smaller experimental theaters like rough magic meant that the abbey had to change none of us is going to survive , she said , by thinking there are impermeables , that things are built upon a rock she noted that in addition to the iceman cometh , the abbey had staged ibsen s hedda gabler and was planning a spring production of shakespeare s comedy of errors , and an adaptation of sophocles' trojan women by the irish poet brendan kennelly whether or not she continues as artistic director next year , ms hynes already has a favorite souvenir , a headline over a recent review of one of her productions abbey play not that bad photo the two should be under the same canopy , rosaleen linehan , ireland s favorite actress , said of the gate and abbey theaters in dublin both are subsidized , so they should both be our national theater at the gate , she performed in congreve s double dealer
washington , dec 23 when president clinton sought a new defense secretary , no one in his administration appeared better qualified than r james woolsey jr , the director of central intelligence mr woolsey , who has served mr clinton loyally for most of a year , is a onetime under secretary of the navy and a former senior arms control negotiator , has represented major military contractors as a lawyer and once served on the staff of the senate armed services committee yet , he was passed over in favor of someone outside the administration , bobby ray inman , a retired admiral who did not know mr clinton and who professed that he needed time to become comfortable with the president before accepting the job mr woolsey , who associates said would have gladly accepted the nomination , lost out in part because of strained relations between the central intelligence agency and the white house over analyses of hot spots like haiti and bosnia he has also alienated his intelligence overseers on capitol hill by opposing attempts to cut the agency s budget at a time when the cia , like the pentagon , is expected to scale back from the heights of coldwar spending i would doubt that it s been a fun year for mr woolsey , said richard kerr , the agency s second in command under president george bush there s a lot of frustration as people look for new missions when you have a clear enemy , as we did for 40 years , you have a clear consensus in congress and the nation when it s not obvious where our interests lie , that puts a lot of strain on him and on the agency trouble and tension at the end of a troubled year for american foreign policy , there is tension between the white house and the agency over policy as the administration states it and reality as the cia sees it in haiti , the balkans and other troubled lands , administration and cia officials said although he has made two hourlong talkshow appearances in the past month , mr woolsey declined to be interviewed by the new york times last week , expressing displeasure with the newspaper s editorials and news articles on the cia he offered a brief conversation during a car ride on the condition that his comments be published verbatim and unedited , unusual conditions deemed inappropriate by the paper s editors the strains that white house officials cite include their belief that too often the cia offers ambivalent analyses instead of concrete answers on crucial issues the officials also said they were irked this fall when the agency circulated a disputed psychological profile damaging jeanbertrand aristide , the exiled haitian president whom mr clinton sought to support , and when they learned that the agency had provided training and money to members of the haitian military government in exchange for information cia officers call that anger naive they say they will not tailor their analyses to fit the policy fashions of the day and will continue to seek information from anyone possessing it they also say the clinton administration has a hard time framing its questions to the agency and a harder time coping with unpleasant answers peacetime problems such spats reflect mr woolsey s difficulties in serving as the nation s chief intelligence officer without a cold war to wage in a world without an evil empire , it is hard for the agency to choose its targets and for mr woolsey to build a consensus on the uses of intelligence his interests include the hydraheaded threats of weapons proliferation and terrorism , macroeconomics , narcotics and environmental degradation but while most of the new challenges are intensely interesting is north korea building a nuclear bomb \? will fidel castro s cuba collapse \? they cannot match the great struggle against moscow today the cia s secret wars are fought not in the back alleys of the world , but inside leadlined rooms in congress , where he has had to work hard to shield the agency from querulous politicians mr woolsey s most important mission is to articulate to congress in a convincing way the size and mission of the intelligence community in the postcoldwar world , and i do n't know that he s done that , said brent scowcroft , who was mr bush s national security adviser closeddoor skirmishes mr woolsey has been to capitol hill 150 times this year , mainly for closeddoor skirmishes over the future of american intelligence , an increasingly acrimonious struggle over secrecy , money and power congressional officials say he has contended , in closed hearings , that deep cuts in the cia s budget could severely harm the agency s ability to monitor developments around the world mr woolsey says he accepts the fact that he has to cut back , to do more with less but he has fought the intelligence committees in congress so hard , the officials say , and bruised so many democratic senators in the process , that he may have done himself some damage , too behind those closed doors , mr woolsey is usually the smartest person in the room , and he knows it , according to congressional and intelligence officials he fiercely defends his officers and analysts , and they know it back at the agency s headquarters he gets high marks for coordinating the cia s agency s work with the pentagon s , no mean feat
englewood , nj , oct 18 the four adopted children who the police said were kept in a locked and lightless attic while their parents collected 24 , 000 a year from a new york city adoption program had come to the attention of local school officials and state socialservice officials before two of them broke out of their house and were caught shoplifting food at a supermarket the father of the children has said that the family had permission to educate them at home school officials say this is not true and that , in fact , the school system alerted the state division of youth and family services after it began investigating why the children were no longer coming to school but officials did not learn what had happened to the children until oct 8 when a 15yearold girl and her 11 yearold brother , were caught at a local store stuffing bologna , bagels , crackers and candy into bookbags after interviewing the children , the police visited their home on howland avenue and found a 16yearold girl sleeping on a mattress on the attic floor and 10yearold boy in diapers sleeping on the floor placed in new homes the parents , anthony james , 36 , and his wife , shirley , 39 , were charged last week with endangering the welfare of the children and were released in 10 , 000 bail each the four children , who were not found to be suffering from any serious physical ailments , have been placed with foster families elsewhere in new jersey the jameses also have an 8yearold biological son , and a 12yearold adopted daughter dr henry oliver , superintendent of englewood schools , said the james s children were in school only a short time before they dropped out he said all six children , not just the attic tenants , were taken out of school starting in 1991 , with some staying until 1992none showed up for the current 1993 school year he said school officials learned that some of the children went for a time to an unnamed parochial school and others went out of state , apparently back to new york , after they were withdrawn from the englewood system it was not a matter of playing hooky , dr oliver said , adding that he was reluctant to discuss the case further before all the information is pieced together but , he said it is not true that the school system did not act properly very ambitious attendance checks were made there are a lot of things that the district did to try to investigate , including visits to the home winnie comfort , a spokeswoman for the new jersey department of human services , said she was prevented by law from talking about a specific case she added , however , that if somebody calls with a possible complaint , we visit the home , see the children , and talk to the person making the complaint and to other adults to see if the complaint is accurate , not accurate , true or not true while declining to discuss the james case , she did say that the state agency was now working carefully and closely with local authorities to assist with any medical or therapeutic needs involving the family and will continue to do so spotlight on adoption programs the case has focused public attention on adoption programs for hardtoplace children that have placed thousands of children in new york city and new jersey in new families the program provides financial support for each child until age 18 , but does not monitor conditions in the home once the adoption is finalized , something that john j fahy , the bergen county prosecutor , said he found puzzling the jameses adopted the four children in new york and sometime later moved to new jersey new jersey officials said they know little about the case , including when the family moved to englewood , because the children were adopted in new york an article in new york newsday yesterday quoted mr james as saying that the couple had adopted the children six years ago the four adopted children , the police said , lived in the attic and had to use the bathroom in the basement the james s biological son and 12yearold adopted daughter lived with them in the main part of the family s colonialstyle home sheila jack , spokeswoman for new york city s human resources administration , said the agency could not speak specifically about any case , because of laws regarding confidentiality but she said the system offered an adoption subsidy program for hardtoplace children the children considered for the program have some type of handicap emotional , physicial or social they are also often minority children over the age of 8 or who have been in foster care for more than 18 months and have a difficult history of abuse or neglect preadoption inquiries the hope is that the foster family will adopt the children if they agree , there is a period of investigation of the home before an adoption is finalized , ms jack said , including home visits once an adoption is made final , there is no monitoring because the assumption is that the family is a whole family with ties as strong as those between biological parents and their children , she said but the subsidies continue until the children are 18 in the case of the jameses , the subsidy was 500 per child per month a spokesman for the new york department of social services , terrance mcgrath , told the associated press that subsidies can range from 200 to 1 , 200 per child and could be paid , in some cases , until age 21 police officials said the subsidy appeared to be the james s only income englewood detective frank c jones , who interviewed the children after their arrest said they told of living for months in the attic with no furniture , no lights , no heat and little food they said they pried open the bolt in the attic door with a coat hanger while their parents were at a restaurant and went out to forage for food the police have said the children all gave virtually the same story new jersey s adoption program , ms comfort said , has found homes for 4 , 000 to 5 , 000 hardtoplace children since it was started in 1974 without the program these children would have to be placed in orphanages , she said the basic subsidy in new jersey for a child under age 5 is 264 a month , but can increase to 379 , depending on the child s needs there are other graduated support levels for older groups of children to a maximum of 445 a month for children 13 and older ms comfort said that while the state does not monitor the homes , the adoptive families are introduced to a network of support groups made up of other adoptive parents who can offer advice on problemsolving each november we have a celebration for parents in the program , she said it s pretty incredible how these families are put together and it s usually families who have more love and the biggest hearts , she said but it can be expensive , especially when the child needs therapy a couple of times a week , and that s where the subsidies come in , so the families do n't have to be afraid of the cost

motorola inc said yesterday that it had lined up 21 potential investors for its iridium project , a 34 billion system to provide global wireless telephone service through 66 small satellites encirling the earth adding details to an announcement made several weeks ago , the company said that the investors had tentatively agreed to provide more than 800 million in initial financing and that they hoped to close the deal by midyear the announcement followed a meeting in geneva , switzerland , with 18 of those investors as before , motorola refused to identify its partners , and it noted that none of the agreements were binding we are very pleased by the enthusiastic participation of investors from around the world , said george fisher , motorola s chairman and chief executive , in a statement issued from geneva the company described the investor group as financially strong and technically competent many industry analysts have been skeptical about the iridium project , raising concerns about its relatively high cost , the uncertainty of its market , and potential problems in obtaining permission to provide service in some countries many of the world s most prominent telecommunications companies , including the american telephone and telegraph company , the mci communications corporation and british telecommunications plc , have chosen thus far not to take part the motorola system , as envisioned , would allow people to make or receive calls anywhere in the world on pocketsized wireless phones that communicate directly by satellite the system would be capable or transmitting calls without necessarily routing them through a traditional telephone company numerous companies are proposing other systems , all of which would be more technologically modest the federal communications commission is trying to draw up regulations on how to assign radio frequencies for the new service , and it hopes to accommodate several competing systems

, the 74yearold democratic councilman was arrested , handcuffed and taken to the police precinct station house in a turbulent morning that underscored how bizarre new york city politics can be school officials said mr horwitz had been arrested because he insisted on entering the elementaryschool auditorium even though he had no ticket , with the tickets issued only to parents mr horwitz , however , said that he was denied access to the event at public school 100 in brighton beach because the principal is aligned with the councilman s bitter political opponent while the kindergarten ceremony was taking place in the upstairs auditorium , mr horwitz was taken to the 60th precinct station house and charged with criminal trespassing , a charge that is punishable by up to a year in jail for a time , mr horwitz said , he was chained to a pipe in a holding room , and when he was about to be fingerprinted , a superior officer stopped the process time for apologies at the request of the council speaker , peter f vallone , several council staff members and councilman herbert e berman , who is chairman of the city council s finance committee , dashed to the precinct station house by the end of the morning , mr horwitz was released , the charges had been dropped and both the police commissioner and the president of the city s board of education issued apologies school officials said none of the students or parents at the graduation ceremony saw the councilman being arrested mr horwitz attributes the entire episode to sheldon plotnick , the president of community school district 21 , which itself has a stormy history of political infighting mr plotnick is a candidate for the city council seat from which mr horwitz is retiring later this year but mr horwitz is supporting another candidate for the position , assemblyman howard l lasher sheldon plotnick is in back of this whole thing , mr horwitz said after he was released there is no reason for this to happen i'm an elected official of the city of new york you ca n't keep me out of a graduation ceremony henry a sheinkopf , a spokesman for mr plotnick , vehemently denied that the school district official was connected in any way to the incident , saying that mr horwitz had attempted to stage a desperate political stunt if sam horwitz believes mr plotnick had something to do with this , then he must believe the world is still flat , he said mr horwitz said he was shocked by the arrest , but it was apparent that he anticipated some discord the councilman had made several inquiries to school officials about attending the ceremony several days before the event and was rebuffed every time , he said and he had called the bay news , a community newspaper , and alerted editors and photographers to a possible incident he suspected that there would be a problem , said kenneth brown , editor of courierlife newspapers , which publishes the bay news he had a feeling he would not be allowed in the school and he expected a confrontation councilman horwitz and mr plotnick were once close allies , with mr horwitz serving as a political mentor to mr plotnick but more recently the two men have been locked in a bitter contest over a number of political issues namely , whose forces would control the community school board by early this year , their feud was said by local politicians to have intensified sharply and in the recent school board elections , mr plotnick saw the defeat of some of his closest allies , some at the hands of mr horwitz donald weber , the superintendent of district 21 , said mr horwitz was asked repeatedly to leave the school and was treated with the utmost respect , but he added that the principal has the right to deny access to his buildings in fact , he said , all public officials in his district must obtain permission from the district to attend graduation ceremonies he added that mr horwitz had begged to be arrested graduation ceremonies in new york public schools have over the years developed a reputation for attracting large numbers of public officials , who vow to make only a few remarks but then speak at great length mr weber , the superintendent , said barring mr horwitz and any other public official without a ticket or a specific invitation was a means of curbing what many parents consider an annoyance outrage expressed within minutes of being released , mr horwitz headed for the steps of city hall , where he lost no time expressing his outrage over the incident mr plotnick , the councilman said , had to be involved because he s aware of everything that s going on and he s trying to teach me a lesson in all the 20 years i 've been a councilman , i 've never been turned away from a graduation , mr horwitz said i 've never been turned away from a city facility and i did n't think the time to start was now i was n't going to be the councilman to set a precedent
washington , june 29 anger among republicans who believe that their leader on the senate judiciary committee has been too easy on clinton administration nominees burst into the open today as a result , the president s choice for a top justice department post was put on hold the nominee , eleanor dean acheson , a granddaughter of president harry s truman s secretary of state , dean acheson , breezed through a confirmation hearing last week she had already received the warm endorsement of senator orrin g hatch of utah , the committee s ranking republican , to head the office that recommends judicial appointments and helps set overall policy for the department but today senator larry pressler , republican of south dakota , sent a letter to his colleagues questioning whether it would be appropriate to confirm ms acheson since until march she had belonged to a country club with no black members republicans involved in the confirmation said that mr pressler s letter was the latest evidence of dissatisfaction with mr hatch s leadership by some committee members opposition just once aside from the nomination of lani guinier to become head of the civil rights division of the justice department , mr hatch has not opposed president clinton s nominees to the department mr hatch has been under investigation for several months by the senate ethics committee for his efforts to help a business associate obtain a loan from the bank of credit and commerce international , and some critics have expressed hope that the clinton administration will reopen justice department inquiries about the matter some conservative republicans on and off the committee have privately accused mr hatch of pulling his punches to ingratiate himself with the new administration congressional officials say those who have questioned mr hatch s leadership include senators pressler , charles e grassley of iowa , thad cochran of mississippi and jesse helms of north carolina some republicans held a closed meeting of on capitol hill today , and some participants said that senator helms told the participants that mr hatch had failed to exert effective leadership against clinton nominations because of potential problems with the justice department hatch remains unchanged in an interview this afternoon , mr hatch acknowledged the criticism , but denied that he had rolled over because of the investigations if i feel deeply about a nominee , then i will move heaven and earth for him , and if a nominee turns out to have reasons to be rejected , i'm not going to stand back and pass them through , he said but i will not be as dirty to president clinton s nominees as they were to ours mr hatch said that his views about ms acheson s nomination to head the office of policy development were unchanged , but that mr pressler had raised a legitimate issue while mr pressler s action does not for the moment appear to jeopardize ms acheson s nomination , it puts the democrats in an uncomfortable position because they have often made an issue of nominees who belonged to clubs that discriminate mr pressler has told colleagues that as senate rules of courtesy allow , he will delay the nomination until the senate articulates a clear policy about when it should reject nominees who belong to private clubs that discriminate he also said he might seek to hold a second hearing of the committee , focusing on ms acheson s membership in the country club of brookline , mass the club has acknowledged that it has no black members and few jews and asians two other clubs in which she holds memberships , the longwood cricket club of chestnut hill and the badminton and tennis club of boston , have had few black members in an effort to highlight what he says is a double standard , mr pressler today attached to his letter the 1990 remarks about membership in discriminatory clubs made by senator edward m kennedy , democrat of massachusetts , who has been ms acheson s most vigorous supporter in congress in that speech he said that senators should consider the membership of nominees when deciding confirmations , adding that membership in a discriminatory club was inappropriate in the last few weeks , senator kennedy has told other senators that ms acheson s membership did not trouble him because she had worked at the clubs to recruit members of minorities and did not believe that the clubs had discriminatory policies ms acheson was not asked about her membership at a confirmation hearing last tuesday she did not return a telephone call today seeking comment but julie anbender , a spokeswoman at the justice department , said that none of the clubs to which ms acheson belongs had a policy of discrimination and that all of them have reached out to minorities in an active way photo some conservative republicans on and off the senate judiciary commitee have privately accused senator orrin g hatch of utah of pulling his punches to ingratiate himself with the new administration \( paul hosefros the new york times \)
san francisco , may 19 the editor of janet malcolm s two articles about jeffrey m masson took the stand in federal court today and testified that he overrode a suggestion from a new yorker lawyer that the words sex and women be removed from a quotation that is one of five in dispute in the libel lawsuit on trial here the editor , gardner botsford , who is also ms malcolm s husband of 17 years , said he had initially thought his wife had tape recordings of the worrisome quotation , in which mr masson said that he had hoped as curator of the freud archives to turn the freud family home into a place of sex , women , fun mr botsford testified that he soon learned the quotation was not on ms malcolm s 40 hours of tape recordings but rather on four typewritten pages of sketchy notes nonetheless , he restored to the text the words the lawyer had deleted janet showed me her notes , which was enough for me , mr botsford said mr botsford , who retired from fulltime editing at the new yorker in 1982 but retained several of his favorite writers ms malcolm , janet flanner and roger angell among them was one of two staff members from the new yorker who testified in the 10 million suit today the other was nancy s franklin , a former fact checker who worked on ms malcolm s 1983 articles about mr masson s dismissal as curator of the freud archives after writings that were critical of freud s work changing scenery mr botsford , whose stepfather was a member of the fleischmann yeast family that founded the new yorker magazine in 1925 , further testified that he had shifted the scene of the central monologue in his wife s piece , which in the published version occurs at the cafe chez panisse in berkeley it is there that mr masson is quoted as saying many of the vain and outrageous remarks that he says he never uttered ms malcolm insists he said them all , although she has testified that many parts of the restaurant monologue were spoken on the telephone or in new york in her first draft , ms malcolm set this multipage discourse on the berkeley pier , where mr masson was described as strolling with his girlfriend , his daughter and her daughter and admiring the hazy vista of san francisco bay today , mr botsford , an elderly man in professorial tweeds , said he had changed the locale to the cafe from the pier to simplify the narrative line of the story did you ever ask your wife where the conversation really took place \? asked charles o morgan jr , mr masson s lawyer i never cared that much , mr botsford answered rare glimpse at an institution the appearance here today of mr botsford and ms franklin offered a rare window into the editing and factchecking process at one of america s most respected magazines , whose writers' practices were harshly examined earlier during ms malcolm s turn on the stand the writereditor bond between ms malcolm and mr botsford would have been discouraged at many publications to safeguard the relationship between those who write stories and those who edit them but at the new yorker they were allowed to continue as a team mr botsford had edited ms malcolm from her early days at the magazine in the mid1960 s after their marriage , ms malcolm was assigned to another editor , with unhappy results the couple appealed to william shawn , the legendary new yorker editor who died last year , and were reunited mr masson s lawyer asked if it was unusual for a spouse to edit a spouse mr botsford replied that he could not think of another example one of the functions of an editor is to be critical , is that right \? mr morgan asked absolutely , mr botsford agreed the author feels that 'this is my baby , ' and the editor has to say 'that s not right , this does n't belong there' is n't that how it goes \? the lawyer asked authors who say 'that s my baby' are usually amateurs , mr botsford replied professionals do n't operate that way factchecking practices the jury today saw galley proofs that had passed between mr botsford and ms franklin , the fact checker , which gave some clues that the conventions of factchecking at the new yorker , are less rigorous than those used at , for example , time and its sister magazines at one spot on the galley , where ms franklin had placed the requisite marks indicating confirmed facts and figures and correctly spelled names , there were no such markings above a sentence about mr masson s daughter and former wife instead , there is a notation of oa , which means on author and indicates that the writer has taken responsibility for the information and told the checker not to verify it in testimony earlier this week , ms malcolm said she told ms franklin not to check any facts about kurt eissler , the director of the freud archives , who was first mr masson s mentor and later the man who dismissed him it was not clear why the sections about dr eissler , which were crucial to the narrative , would be on author the checker s guide , known in magazine circles as the bible , gives great latitude to the writer , who is spoken of in quite reverential tones it sometimes happens that a piece may contain sensitive information which he will ask you not to check , the manual says you should respect his wishes the manual reminds researchers , it is of the utmost importance that a checker approach his work with the idea of finding , whenever possible , reliable support for the facts that the author has put in the piece do n't go out of your way to refute the author asked to describe her former job , ms franklin who is now a nonfiction editor at the new yorker pointed immediately to the notion that the writer is boss you do n't set about trying to dog the writer and poke holes in what the writer is trying to do , ms franklin said in a firm , husky voice writers' heaven some publications are considered editordriven , with story ideas from on high and extensive changes in the author s copy others are thought to writer s havens , and none more so than the new yorker , where established writers could propose ideas , set off for months without supervision and then write booklength pieces that were lightly checked and gently edited for most of the magazine s 68 years , this laissezfaire approach went largely unquestioned but there have been moments when a writer s unsupervised behavior left the magazine blushing in the most notable case , in 1984 , the writer alastair reid said he had invented characters , rearranged events and composed conversations in his stories from spain and defended the techniques by saying he was seeking a truth that is harder to get at then the truth yielded by facts known for his loyalty to writers , mr shawn , then the editor , initially supported mr reid , then later issued a memorandum to the staff that said , we do not permit composites we do not rearrange facts we do not create conversation mr shawn , known for his good manners and dark suits , will speak from the grave , so to speak , at this trial by way of a sworn deposition he gave in this case in 1986 , mr shawn is to testify thursday on behalf of the plaintiff among other things , he will say that ms malcolm assured him that all her interviews with mr masson were on tape she denies that this conversation ever took place
what a season this has been for the houston oilers their owner , bud adams , declared in training camp that in all likelihood this was it for this group of oilers and issued a winorelse edict then came the 14 start then sniping from within buddy ryan had arrived as the team s defensive coordinator and purported savior , but initially he was a thorn the david williams , newbornbaby , familyvalues flap followed coach jack pardee was on the firing line quarterback warren moon was benched then the oilers won eight straight games and leaped atop the american football conference central division all seemed healed until early yesterday morning the shocking death of defensive tackle jeff alm , from a suicide apparently prompted by guilt or grief over the death of his friend , sent shivers through the oilers and the national football league how could it happen \? why \? there are more questions than answers now , and that is the case when such a sadly inexplicable event occurs in or out of football one wonders how much the highstrung , rollercoaster oilers can absorb this is a team for which many of the remnants of the jerry glanville regime remain glanville taught the oilers to play in the same emotional , reactionary way that he has shaped the atlanta falcons when glanville left for atlanta in 1990 , the character of the oilers did not leave with him one could always count on houston to play the game with a whichteamwillshowup style so talented , so fragmented , this team went into every game with an opportunity to win by 20 or lose by 30 and one could always count on the oilers from one end of the locker room to the other to offer their views usually explosive ones maturity is the key word here cohesiveness , too these are traits the oilers have longed for , traits that kept them from being a dominant team in the nfl there are few general managers in the pro game who will not tell you that the oilers are second to none in personnel they have the whole package a pro bowl , superstar quarterback an exciting core of receivers , tough backs , big line , strong defense , sound special teams and as they fashioned their current eightgame winning streak , they finally appeared to have recovered from that memorable playoff loss to the buffalo bills last season , when they staged the worst collapse ever in an nfl game , one that gave them the sticky label of the game s worst underachievers alm born in new york city , a strong player at notre dame and in his fourth season in houston was one of the more quiet oilers he simply came to work , did his job and was not one of their bushel of players who sought constant adulation it s unbelievable how someone can be here one day and gone the next , safety bo orlando said we were talking about playing this week and he said he might be back and he was in a very good mood alm had been sidelined with a leg injury now , with houston on the road , at pittsburgh on sunday , the oilers face a huge task in regrouping houston has a 94 record , but pittsburgh can tie the oilers for the afc central lead with a victory houston s following two games are at san francisco and at home against the jets pittsburgh finishes at seattle and at home against cleveland during the oilers' earlyseason swoon , running back lorenzo white said of his team it s hard to figure we have as diverse a team on the field and off the field that you can imagine we 've got guys who have a single mind on football and others who are all over the place we 've got talent we 've got guys who sometimes question each others' effort we 've got it all if there is ever a way we can put it all together , unite and focus , we can win a super bowl we can be one of the best teams ever what s it going to take for us to do that \? i just do n't know alm , no doubt , would hope that his team can unite he would surely hope that the oilers reach their potential , that somehow , some way , they coalesce and wind up in atlanta in super bowl xxviii and win pro football s biggest prize even if that happens , alm , for the rest of this season and beyond , will serve as a reminder for the oilers that there are much more important things than winning a football game and , in such a horrible manner , it could be just the thing that makes the oilers think twice and work twice as hard it could give the oilers those missing ingredients of maturity and cohesiveness what s it going to take for the houston oilers \? in sadness , they just may have found out
what a difference a couple of days can make only wednesday , andrei medvedev took a look around the united states open and determined it had all the potential to turn him into a 6foot4inch crybaby too noisy , too crowded , no place to park his gangly frame when he gets tired of smacking tennis balls and feels like falling down i hate the atmosphere , he said after scrambling through his firstround match inside the metallic confines of court 16 after one hour i start to be a little bit crazy and after two hours probably i start to cry but now he loves it when the garbage rattles around in the stands it reminds him of the steady swirl of detritus outside his manhattan hotel he understands the steady stream of backtalk from the spectators is nothing personal , just proof of freedom of speech in action he s amazed to have already survived nearly a week in a city where every pedestrian and every automobile seem to be on a collision course but are n't bothered enough by it to slow the madcap pace no country clubs in sight you go in the street , they walk so fast , you ca n't keep up , he marvels and they drive so fast , and no accidents , unbelievable i have n't seen one accident in new york and i was close a hundred times it is so beautiful that you ca n't explain it we are tennis players , we do n't see much of real life we are always playing in country clubs there is n't a country club in sight , and medvedev , that highpaid hayseed from kiev , is starting to develop the kind of street smarts that translate well at the most aggravating and aggrandizing of the slams he has n't been mugged , still has his watch and wallet , and has managed to snag several taxis with fellow russians at the wheel it is crazy , it is nice , it is funny you find out that there is life going on , said the 19yearold medvedev , who was born in ukraine but considers himself a russian i have a problem to hit my forehand he has a problem to make a living it took him two or three days , and two successful rounds inside the turbulent fishbowl that is the open , but by friday night medvedev was starting to talk like a contender instead of a crybaby seeded eighth as he takes his first professional crack at the open , medvedev is starting to resemble the player that other players , like andre agassi and goran ivanisevic , and other players' coaches , like agassi s pancho segura and stefan edberg s tony pickard , envision as a potential open champion a positive pattern his court assignments are beginning to assume a positive pattern from court 16 to the grandstand to , he hopes , the stadium if medvedev goes down , he wants it to happen on prime time you know if i lose i will try to take a lesson out of this loss , but i will not take it as a suicide or the end of life , said medvedev , who reached the french open semifinals and two weeks ago collected his first hardcourt title at new haven medvedev was in trouble friday night on the grandstand against richey reneberg , who surprised him by attacking the net instead of playing a placid backboard style , the straight man for medvedev s flashier playmaking medvedev lost the first set , then fell behind by 54 in the second , where he found himself a game away from falling behind two sets to none certainly i was n't 100 percent in the match i was like in and out , medvedev apologized and when the score gets 64 , 54 , with a break , i realized that there is no way back , that i am at the us open and it is the last grand slam tournament and i want to play well here medevedev broke reneberg at love , and when the set went to the tie breaker , he stopped being erratic and got down to the business of banging the smaller player into submission with his powerful serve and hardnosed ground strokes medvedev broke reneberg in the ninth game of the third set , and in the fourth , when a galeforce wind descended on the grandstand , levitating the garbage , breaking bottles and mandating an eightminute timeout , the teenager achieved a new york state of mind and took over for good 'a good turnaround' it was normal for me , the trash is flying around , the people they make some noise , and that is good , said medvedev since we got this suspended , richey , he hit one good ball on court it was a good turnaround for me you know , playing in these conditions , it s fun medvedev believes his postmatch commentary is so choice that journalists should pay to hear it we give you sensations , but for this , we have to get paid , right \? said medvedev , who s already a millionaire but the player did offer to share 20 percent of his earnings here with anybody energetic enough to chase him around the court with an airconditioner the next time he plays a match in sauna conditions it could be tomorrow when he is scheduled to face 78thranked karsten braasch from germany in the third round i was training in the heat a long time , 26 days , said medvedev , who figures the statistical favorites , jim courier and pete sampras , have nothing on him just because they 're floridabased but still i am sweating too much , said medvedev and is he worried about living up to expectations here \? what do you mean , worried \? he said match points they set an attendance record and they got no refunds for their trouble 22 , 495 patient and optimistic spectators showed up on this rainy day to try to watch day 6 of the open , but by 4 pm only one singles match had been completed yesterday s attendance broke the record set on wednesday , when 22 , 357 onlookers filled the grounds and got rained on as well , but not until late afternoon
london , nov 25 the government has begun releasing documents from winston churchill s secret wartime intelligence archive , but so far they do not shed light on one of the war s greatest mysteries whether churchill knew in advance of the impending japanese attack on pearl harbor in december 1941 one document , dated dec 4 three days before the attack is a record of a message that had been sent on dec 2 from the japanese foreign minister in tokyo to the japanese ambassador in washington ordering him to destroy secret documents , ciphers and related materials such a step presumably would be taken just before the outbreak of war it is clear that the message was intercepted , but a spokesman for the foreign office said there was no indication whether the document was shared with united states officials historians have written extensively about intelligence sharing among allies after the breaking of japan s code a statement drawn up by the public record office to accompany the first trickle of documents said none of the intercepts obviously indicate that british sources were aware in advance of the japanese attack on pearl harbor , although it was clear that japan was about to enter the war but it added , it is possible that historians making a detailed examination of all the relevant material might draw a different conclusion a spokesman for the records office said this simply meant that the archivists had not yet reviewed all 1 , 273 files representing the daily intelligence reports given to churchill in 1941 and 1942 , which become public information on friday he said it did not suggest that anyone had unearthed a piece of paper that was ambiguous or that suggested that churchill knew and did not tell president roosevelt about the plan for the attack the attack on pearl harbor killed and wounded 4 , 575 americans nineteen ships and 120 aircraft were lost in the third volume of his war memoirs , the second world war , churchill writes that at dinner on dec 7 at chequers , the prime minister s country home , with john winant , the united states ambassador , and averell harriman , roosevelt s special envoy , they turned on the news and heard some few sentences regarding an attack by the japanese on american shipping at hawaii churchill called roosevelt , who , he said , replied it s quite true they have attacked us at pearl harbor we are all in the same boat now the prime minister writes of sending messages around the world and of what he felt at the time no american will think it wrong of me if i proclaim that to have the united states at our side was to me the greatest joy the next day , british forces were overwhelmed when the japanese landed in malaya and thailand and bombed singapore the japanese quickly overran the peninsula through a combination of land and air attacks , forcing britain to pull its ships out of its vast naval base in singapore britain s code and cipher school , established in 1919 , vastly expanded its work in world war ii the prime minister received summaries of the german enigma messages once a day and often more frequently in an intercepted german police report dated september 1942 , tucked among items about cement factories in russia and wheat harvests in bosnia and herzegovina is a terse item with the heading , reports on deaths in german prison camps during august four camps are listed in one , auschwitz in poland , the death figures were 6 , 829 men and 1 , 525 women the item says , although typhus is still rife at auschwitz , new arrivals continue to come in another intercepted document recounts a meeting in september 1941 between the japanese ambassador in berlin and joachim von ribbentrop , hitler s foreign minister ribbentrop is said to have told the ambassador that japan must not lose this opportunity of achieving the establishment of the new order in east asia ribbentrop told the envoy that the existence of japan and germany on the one hand and america on the other was fundamentally incompatible
los angeles in the land of the big screen , the latest sensation is the littlest screen a featherweight notebook computer apple s powerbook , if possible for showing off one s business savvy , job dedication and technoknowhow , or just for showing off it s another gadget , said melissa bachrach , executive vice president at michael jackson s nation films , to make us into 'better' executives and the newer the gadget the better just as you would n't be caught dead driving up for a lunch meeting at the ivy in a loaner , so the notebook computer you slip out of your briefcase to consult your

the rest of the nation , the favorite of the entertainment industry is the powerbook line , which is the friendliest for neophytes many powerbook users persuade their companies to purchase the computers for them , at prices up to 4 , 000 or so it was the powerbook , said barry diller in a recent new yorker article , that inspired his latest venture into interactive media when he left the chairmanship of fox inc mr diller s endorsement added new respectability to the notebook craze jeff berg , chairman of international creative management , was an early powerbook user who has already

driving a car off the lot which may be why he has n't updated yet he recalls proudly demonstrating his 3 , 700 , 12pound toshiba laptop to colleagues when he first purchased it three years ago besides a wordprocessing program , it contained a database , his entire rolodex , quattro spreadsheets for budget projections and bookkeeping , a modem with telecommunications software that enabled him to send and receive faxes , and a quarterdeck program for keeping several applications open at once it was the cadillac of portable computers , he said , sighing now i feel like i'm in the dark ages in the old days , i proudly schlepped it everywhere but as these computers have gotten smaller and lighter , i started to get embarrassed in first and business class it was like carrying this outmoded heavy bag with bowling balls and shoes in it now i leave it at home mr feldman s best source on the latest computers is his dentist , jay brent , who once owned a computer business and readily informs his captive patients of the virtues of , say , the powerful 35pound dell 320 sli , which boasts a 60megabyte hard drive and two megabytes of random access memory but he is n't all that sure his many hollywood clients really care about the capabilities a notebook is a status thing , said dr brent in reality , most executives do n't know what to do with it with the exception of writers , most executives are still computer illiterate danny halsted , a production executive at disney s hollywood pictures , admitted it i barely know how to type and unlike many executives at the level of vice

not inexpensive , he added , which is why people do n't mind having them on their desks i have to find a 180 very soon the boss should have a 180 mark gill , senior vice president of publicity at columbia pictures , is an avid user not of the powerbook but of an ibmcompatible notebook he does credit mr diller s publicity about the powerbook for changing his image as a technonerd , however now

notebook in his briefcase but also clips a portable phone to his belt i must look like an incredible geek , he said but with his notebook , which he bought himself , i can do business anytime , anywhere you are selfcontained as an executive you walk into a room and whip the notebook out and informationally , you can stand alone mr ordesky takes the need to upgrade in stride unless i have a

when dvorak was living in new york a century ago , he wrote in harper s new monthly magazine of the feeling of strangeness and bewildered astonishment that filled europeans on their arrival in the new world he referred to an immense american capacity for enthusiasm for all things new , the essence of american push it is as if a boy wished to dive before he could swim at first this characteristic bothered him in his pupils , but then he began to think that the best hopes for american music lay in this eagerness to take up everything now dvorak s threeyear american residence has inspired a similar enthusiasm in celebrations of its centenary recently , the bard music festival , which devoted two weekends to dvorak in annandaleonhudson , ny , in august , followed up with another at alice tully hall two excellent books have recently been published dvorak in america , edited by john c tibbetts and dvorak and his world , edited by michael beckerman and next january , the brooklyn academy of music will offer a dvorak weekend the reasons for this enthusiasm have much to do with the way dvorak saw his role here a century ago i came to discover what young americans have in them and to help them express it , he wrote he wanted to help develop an american school of composition it must , dvorak asserted , strike its roots deeply into its own soil american music , he felt , should find its voice in black and american indian folk melodies many composers took him at his word a source book , indian story and song from north america , was published in 1900 operas on indian themes included arthur nevin s poia , written in 1909 , after the composer spent two summers among the blackfoot indians , and victor herbert s natoma , performed at the metropolitan opera in 1911 published collections of spirituals and creole songs inspired concert works with names like string quartet on negro themes and six plantation melodies for violin and piano at least two black composers , will marion cook and harry t burleigh , were also influenced by dvorak but much of this music , apart from the works by blacks that developed directly out of their own experience , is merely an historical curiosity \( that was true , at least , of a sampling at the bard festival \) studious use of folk material does not make a national music in the long run , dvorak s main role here , as director of the national conservatory of music , reached a dead end as well the conservatory itself , on east 17th street in manhattan , was a remarkable example of american artistic entrepreneurship it was founded in 1885 by jeannette meyer thurber , the wife of a wealthy wholesale grocer she envisioned a school with branches around the country , modeled on the paris conservatory , where she had studied violin before taking up a life of musical patronage she successfully lobbied for a congressional charter for the school in 1891 scholarships were offered to needy students , and the school educated women and blacks the curriculum emphasized general culture , not just musical drill and thurber pursued dvorak , offering in 1892 to pay him 15 , 000 a year \( equivalent to a salary of more than 200 , 000 today \) the conservatory established the educational standards and style that persist at institutions like the juilliard school but decades after dvorak left , it failed , because financial support was difficult to find efforts to interest congress in a publicly sponsored music school were futile the problem with dvorak s prescription and thurber s institution was that they did not have deep roots in american culture dvorak s advice was based on his own experience and presumed a coherent folk tradition along with high regard for the artistic enterprise the school was asking that the united states take the same attitude toward music that many european countries did as it turned out , american music did evolve , partly , perhaps , under the influence of dvorak s admonitions , but more because of the american capacity for enthusiasm and eagerness to take up everything the most obvious examples are in popular and black american music , in jazz and blues , in pop song and rockandroll , and in the development of an american musical entertainment industry all of which have had worldwide influence and none of which have depended on conservatory training or the selfconscious use of folk materials art music developed quietly but profoundly american opera has ranged from virgil thomson s four saints in three acts to philip glass s satyagraha american concert music includes , of course , such figures as copland and bernstein , elliott carter and milton babbitt , william bolcom and david del tredici if anything unites this roster , it is the individualistic energy , eclectic imagination and openness to diverse influences that dvorak saw a century ago american music did not evolve out of an attempt to create a national music it evolved because americans composing music could not help reflecting their culture now one hopes that this culture will develop further , that our capacity for enthusiasm will be directed toward education , and that art , as dvorak suggested , will become more a part of the business of life american music knows how to swim it must continue to dive as well
berlin , jan 6 after more than 20 years of planning , the artist christo may soon receive permission to execute one of his most ambitious projects wrapping the historic reichstag building in a million square feet of silvercolored fabric at a news conference today , christo said he had won support from the president of germany s parliament , rita sussmuth , who is to attend the opening of an exhibition of his works in berlin this week mrs sussmuth s support is vital because parliament , known officially as the bundestag , administers the reichstag building previous bundestag presidents opposed the project , as did chancellor helmut kohl , who said in 1987 that it would never be realized as long as he was in office but mr kohl s chief spokesman , dieter vogel , said today that the chancellor had no plans to comment on the project now his opinion is not important , mr vogel said the decision is up to mrs sussmuth and the bundestag much of the past opposition was based on fears that the project would be viewed as a provocation to east germany and the soviet union now that both of those countries have ceased to exist , prospects for the project appear to have improved for the first time in 20 years , we have a bundestag president who is open and a great supporter of the idea , christo said she hopes to finalize her decision in the next three or four or five weeks asked about the project today , mrs sussmuth said she viewed it positively and expected a decision to be made in the coming weeks disguising a building can serve to emphasize its most striking features , mrs sussmuth said by wrapping this building , the artist not only displays his own feelings , but also gives citizens a chance to react to an edifice that is so important both to their tradition and their future wrapping history s aura christo is known for his audacious works of public art , which have been praised by some as deeply perceptive and dismissed by others as intrusive and banal among his most celebrated projects have been running fence , a 24mile fabric curtain erected in california in 1976 surrounded islands , in which he laid pink polypropylene fabric around islands in biscayne bay off miami in 1983 , and the umbrellas joint project for japan and usa , a simultaneous display of 3 , 100 immense blue and yellow umbrellas in california and japan in 1991 the umbrella project was dismantled after an uprooted umbrella crushed a tourist to death in california , and then a crane operator was electrocuted in japan during the dismantling each of these projects took years to plan and organize , but none have taken as long as wrapped reichstag part of the difference is that the reichstag , one of the world s bestknown buildings , is enveloped in a strong aura of history and ideology the reichstag was built to house germany s parliament shortly after the country was first unified in 1871 it was a symbol of the illfated democratic government that ruled germany between the two world wars and was seriously damaged by a mysterious fire in 1933 hitler blamed the fire on communists and used it as an excuse to seize power later that year in a 1942 speech at the reichstag , which was still scarred , hitler promised germans that great victories lay ahead let nobody now preach about his wellearned rights , he warned from now on there are only duties as hitler s dictatorship collapsed in 1945 , what remained of the reichstag was further damaged by soviet bombing the shell stood for years , only a stone s throw from the berlin wall , erected in 1961 the building was on the western side of the wall , and for a time west german officials considered demolishing it they finally decided not to do so , and several rooms were restored to house an exhibition about german history after the wall was breached in 1989 and germany was reunified the following year , parliament voted to move the seat of government from bonn back to berlin when the move is completed several years from now , the reichstag is to become the seat of parliament once again christo s plan calls for wrapping the building for two or three weeks he said today that he hoped to schedule the wrapping for august or september the wrapping , he said , will take three or four days and employ 200 experienced climbers he proposes to use synthetic fabric secured by about 30 miles of rope the wrapping is to be loose , creating what he called a completely new form for the reichstag he suggested that the final project would have an almost gothic quality and convey some kind of wagnerian presence the folds will be angular , not rounded , he said even myself , i do n't know how this reichstag will look he estimated the cost of the project at 6 million to 7 million as is his custom , he said , he will accept no corporate or public sponsorship and will raise the money by selling drawings , plans , books and other related materials a catalyst for reflection the 57yearold artist , whose full name is christo javacheff , was born in bulgaria and lived in czechoslovakia before fleeing west in 1957 he said today that because of his background , he had had a very human relationship to the eastwest situation berlin is a city that has profoundly lived the separation of the world , he asserted the reichstag is completely related to that because it was so close to the wall he said the project had a very strong political dimension and would stimulate viewers to reflect on what this building means to europe , germany , and many people around the world a 23member jury of architects , politicians and berlin residents is to convene this week to consider proposals for the reichstag s permanent renovation its recommendations are expected to be made public next month although the jury is not charged with ruling on christo s project , it may issue a nonbinding recommendation the final choice will be made by parliament , probably by mrs sussmuth in consultation with senior legislators christo today described the reichstag as almost like a sleeping beauty and said his idea of wrapping it is about freedom he conceded , however , that the project could absorb all kinds of interpretations i create gentle disturbance for a short time , he said i cannot claim that i fully know what the project means photo christo , whose 20yearold ambition to wrap the reichstag building in berlin in a million square feet of fabric may soon receive approval \( wolfgang volz for the new york times \)
boston the over30 generation vividly remembers the temperamental 16millimeter movie projectors and grainy , outdated films on the belgian congo that constituted a media experience in yesterday s classrooms nowadays , even such modern gadgets as the vcr are headed for educational extinction as teachers turn to personal computers , interactive videodisks , cdrom and stateoftheart multimedia software to create lesson plans for the 21st century computerliterate students can point and click their way through history , geography or math simba information inc , a marketresearch firm in wilton , conn , estimates that the market for electronic media in schools will grow 24 percent annually for the next five years and that sales of educational software for videodisk players and cdrom or compact diskread only memory will reach nearly 400 million by 1996 this market already includes strange bedfellows like time warner inc , the national geographic society , encyclopedia brittanica , and abc news but one leading producer of interactive multimedia teaching tools is wgbh , the public television station in boston known nationally for producing awardwinning fare like masterpiece theater , this old house , mystery ! and nova , wgbh has quietly established itself as a hightech horn of plenty the innovative nonprofit station , which must constantly seek financing for its ambitious broadcast projects , has married its vast programming skills with a variety of technologies to produce what its president , henry becton , calls multiversioning programs and series are no longer considered standalone projects at wgbh , mr becton said every broadcast project is viewed as a potential book , an interactive video , a teaching module , a study guide or other course material the net effect is that we bring in other revenues , which help pay for the productions to begin with , he said much of the multiversioning emanates from wgbh s special telecommunications services unit , which has grown from a small research project in 1980 to a 20 million , 200employee segment brigid sullivan , vice president of the unit , said it not only oversaw educational opportunities like interactive video , but a range of businesses that provide media access to the hearing and visually impaired audience that is generally ignored by commercial media outlets wgbh , a pioneer 20 years ago of closedcaptioned television for the deaf and hearingimpaired , is currently creating technology that will allow the hearingimpaired to go to movies the station s caption center , for example , is building several prototype devices , including one that will provide movie captions for the hearingimpaired that will appear on a tiny screen in a headset that can be picked up at the candy counter for the totally blind and visually impaired , a wgbh programmer invented software that makes it easy to add descriptive voiceover narration to movies and television programs the station , in partnership with hollywood studios , has added detailed descriptions to dozens of home videos , including field of dreams , top gun and ghost , and made them available to the 115 million visually impaired americans the special services unit also produces several regular offerings for the prodigy online bulletin board , like a monthly feature based on the nova science programs the unit s software programmers and graphic designer have also created a multimedia software version of the macmillan children s dictionary but the station s most ambitious technology effort is in its interactive multimedia software working in collaboration with educational publishers like scholastic inc and the optical data corporation and computer makers like apple and ibm , wgbh spends months designing and producing lavish , multilayered software packages and accompanying educational support material based on television series like nova or columbus and the age of discovery peter kelman , vice president and publisher of scholastic software , a division of scholastic , praised wgbh for forming strategic alliances rather than going it alone everyone else is out there reinventing the wheel , he said other public television stations have moved recently to offer similar hightech products , but none come close to rivaling wgbh attention to detail geoffrey p miller , director of marketing for wbgh s interactive multimedia group , stressed that the station s advantage in creating its packages was not in the technology , but in its attention to both educational and production values in the software and accompanying material for schools wgbh producers , longtime broadcasters who understand how to make compelling television programs , work with educators and informationtechnology specialists on each project , mr miller said up to six months of research will be done before production is started , he added wgbh started by producing interactive videodisks from its nova series , but those were used solely on videodisk players now the station is combining its videodisk and personalcomputer expertise with plans to take advantage of cdrom s as soon as that technology becomes more widely available in schools
san diego , may 1 there was no need to track what there was of a flight gary sheffield had demolished the baseball crushed underneath again were the mets , who thereby came closer to being extinguished from relevance in 1993 sheffield s tworun mauling of a 11 pitch from mike maddux lifted the padres to a 53 triumph tonight the defeat for the mets , their seventh in succession , sunk them to 814 , another game back of the marlins in the national league east , and exiled them to another 24 hours of abject uncertainty about what has happened or what might the dissections of the defeats for the mets have become joyless enterprises there is always so much to pick at , so much to indict the bullpen , though , has clearly established itself as a major culprit and tonight , with the failures of maddux , jeff innis and mike draper , the corps of relievers saw their collective record slide to 06 the mets had evened the game in the eighth after innis had been bombed by phil clark for a solo home run that put the padres up 32 in the seventh dave gallagher s pinchhit single scored joe orsulak , and the recovery offered yet one more opportunity to end the misery for the mets maddux never got an out before the agony was insured tony gwynn , the rightfielder for the padres who has put on a personal clinic for the mets in the last 48 hours , collected his ninth hit in the two games with a bunt single sheffield , with that terribly swift and deadly cut , bludgeoned a 11 pitch on an unbending line to left there was plenty more , though , for the mets to torture themselves with afterward bobby bonilla made the third out with the bases loaded in the seventh and the score deadlocked at 22 the mets could do nothing but score a couple of runs in six innings of effort against a starter for the padres who was making his second majorleague start none of it was novel mixed reviews all the recent losing for the mets has transformed individual sagas into significant dramas , from the shortstop s health to the second baseman s development , and on and on pete schourek thus began tonight with the demand for a quality start greater than maybe it ideally should have been for a 23yearold without a dominant pitch the showing , as so many have been in the lefthander s brief career , was acceptable but shy of strong after being roughed up in two of three 1993 starts , schourek tonight wound up further bruised , but his moments of clutch pitching did keep the mets in the game and allowed the lefthander to exit with his pride intact but schourek , who had stranded nine padres through five innings , left himself no effective chance for victory when he allowed a leadoff double to dan walters in the sixth he had thrown 98 pitches , and he was out of both imagination and stamina his replacements had no great ideas or pitches for the second straight night , mike draper was charged with allowing the tying run late in a game , a bunt base hit by kurt stillwell and a groundout by ricky gutierrez evening the game at 22 murray delivers the mets , with the kind of industry that has escaped them all season , generated a run without a hit in the first to take a 10 lead vince coleman did n't have to take the bat off his shoulder to earn a walk leading off the game he stole second on the first pitch to tony fernandez , and was at third after the shortstop s sacrifice eddie murray then executed a thoroughly professional swing of the bat , his fly to center easily scoring coleman any sense of security , though , went up in an early storm of hits and walks , and the mets were fortunate the padres only turned all that traffic on the basepaths into the tying run schourek gave up a single to gwynn and then winced as sheffield s laser line drive froze coleman and then went whistling past him in left fred mcgriff s infield hit leveled the score but schourek , in the first of a succession of escapes , struck out derek bell on a gorgeous change then after walking tim teufel to load the bases , the lefthander stranded three padres when phil clark sailed out to right the mets at last and at least hit san diego starter kerry taylor hard enough to get a run with a bang when tony fernandez smoked the righthander s 12 curveball on a long loop over the fence in rightcenter for a 21 lead that appeared as perilous as have all such early leads for the mets in 1993 inside pitch sid fernandez , who began the season having held the opposition to a 205 average in his career , yielded nine hits in five innings friday night the lefthander has now allowed 17 hits and 3 homers in his last nine and onethird 3 innings fernandez , who has been bothered by flareups of tendinities in his left shoulder in 1993 , said his health is fine my mechanics are n't too sound , he said the mets wasted a chance at a run in the fourth when howard johnson was sent home on a double by joe orsulak with one out and was cut down easily phil clark s 10 putouts in left field tonight set a club record for a san diego outfielder
in a trial where minutiae have often seemed to reign supreme , almost a full morning of the world trade center bombing trial last week was devoted to a close examination of a minor traffic accident in new jersey that took place a month before the trade center explosion and involved two suspects in the case one was mohammed a salameh , the lead defendant , and the other ramzi ahmed yousef , who left the country the day of the explosion and whose whereabouts are unknown the point of the testimony seemed to be that since mr salameh and mr yousef were in the same car , they must have been doing things together \( it had already been established that the two men were roommates in an apartment in jersey city \) witnesses also threw the net over a third man indicted in the case , mahmud abouhalima , who , according to a nurse , picked up mr yousef when he was discharged from the hospital after recovering from injuries he suffered in the accident getting the association among the three men into the record was of obvious importance to the prosecution , which has been spinning a web of circumstantial evidence around the four men on trial , trying to convince the jury that a myriad of small details can lead only to the conclusion that the defendants conspired to blow up the trade center yet the prosecutors seem to be engaging in a certain evidentiary overkill , which raises the question of whether the prosecution is introducing too much undifferentiated detail into their reconstruction of the plot the main witness in the accident was a new jersey police officer , fred weinmann , who was on the stand for an hour government prosecutors asked him to describe the accident in great detail , the direction the car was going , how the driver ran into trouble , the names of the streets that crossed at that intersection they even put an aerial photograph of the area in front of him so he could put a colored sticker on the site of the accident given the fact that mr salameh is not on trial for reckless driving , it was difficult to see what purpose the sticker on the map served and , since nobody in the united states attorney s office is willing to talk about the case to inquiring reporters , it is not possible to find out whether there is more method to the tedium is the tedious meticulousness of the prosecution , which by the end of the eighth week of testimony had called 110 witnesses and had dozens still to go , helping or harming its case \? certainly , a number of important pieces of the puzzle have dropped into place the prosecution has shown that three of the defendants , mr salameh , mr abouhalima and nidal a ayyad , knew one another it has shown some of them opening bank accounts together , renting storage lockers together and ordering chemicals suspiciously like the chemicals often used in improvised explosives mr salameh has been established as the renter of a ford econoline van whose twisted parts were pulled from the trade center wreckage and that , investigators say , carried the bomb that on feb 26 killed six people and blew a hole five stories deep beneath the twin towers in lower manhattan still , seemingly worried that some important points might be lost in the flood of detail , the presiding judge in the case , kevin t duffy , has warned the four prosecutors that their presentation is unfolding too slowly it s one thing to bore the jury , judge duffy intoned at the end of the court session last monday , but when you 're boring the judge , you 're in deep trouble attention to detail it came out just before the thanksgiving break that mr salameh was in a second accident , less than a month after the first , but that information , while certainly suggesting that you would not want mr salameh as your taxi driver , seemed also to have only a vague connection with the case the second accident was revealed in the prosecution s questioning of sarah o'brien , the manager of travel services of the alliedsignal corporation ms o'brien testified about three occasions , feb 15 and 23 and march 9 , on which she arranged rental cars for mr ayyad , an alliedsignal chemical engineer again , it seemed as if the jurors might be able to decide the case without knowing some information ms o'brien read , like the rental contract numbers and the license plate numbers of the cars rented , or the times the cars were picked up and returned again , even if some of the detail seemed unnecessary , the point of the testimony seemed to be to establish connections this time the fact that mr ayyad seems to have rented cars for use by mr salameh another interpretation was also possible , however mr salameh s defense lawyer , robert e precht , asked ms o'brien if the normal car rental company , knowing of his atrocious driving record , would rent again to mr salameh mr precht s point seemed to be that his client was such a bad driver that no reasonable terrorists would have entrusted him with any significant task involving the operation of a motor vehicle such as renting a van sound problems in september when the jury was still being selected , judge duffy warned i have a bad habit of mumbling it was not an idle statement there are microphones all over the courtroom , and most of the testimony is amplified enough to be audible to courtroom observers , or at least 80 percent of it is everything else , especially dialogues between the judge and the lawyers , is mostly inaudible this is in part because the sound system is simply not very good it is also because some of the trial participants , especially the judge , do not bother to speak into the microphone and the courtroom itself has the acoustics of a railroad station waiting room , amplifying extraneous noises like the rustling of papers or the coughing of an observer but suppressing the human voice but the sound problems seem to be worsened by the fact that the courtroom has a higher percentage of mumblers than would be found in the public at large once there was even a bit of dialogue between the judge and the lead prosecutor , j gilmore childers , over who mumbled more you 're mumbling again , the judge told mr childers i hope it s not contagious , mr childers replied where you 're concerned , it s an epidemic , rejoined the judge none of this exchange was audible to the courtroom observers , since each side s accusations of mumbling were mumbled by the accuser that portion of the trial record , fortunately for posterity , is available in the official transcript of the trial , for those willing to search it out
boston you are an immigrant from ireland , five years in the united states you and your wife are expecting to become citizens soon then one day you get a notice from the government it says a judge has found probable cause to believe you are an alien terrorist and must be deported it is the first you have heard of the charge or the proceeding , whatever it was , before the judge the notice says you are entitled to a hearing before you are deported but you discover , when you ask , that you cannot find out who accused you of being a terrorist or what the accuser said you have done unknown to you , the accuser is an old girlfriend she told the authorities that years ago , when you were 17 , you were a member of an ira bomb squad she invented that story , but there is no way to show it is false because it is kept secret from you could such a travesty of justice occur in this country \? it could if some republican members of congress have their way in their draft of a crime bill they have a section that would set up just such a secret process to deport people without ever telling them what they are supposed to have done or who made the charge the bill would set up a special court of seven judges whenever the attorney general wanted to deport someone as an alien terrorist , she could go to one of the seven judges and say that the usual fair hearing would be a risk to national security because classified information would be disclosed the judge would consider the government documents in secret , without telling the alien in that onesided proceeding the judge would decide whether there was probable cause to believe that the alien was a terrorist who presented a risk of death or serious bodily harm to others if the judge so found , then and only then would the target of the proceeding be informed there would be a hearing , but again the evidence would be kept secret from the accused the alien could appeal a decision to deport him but not the decision to allow secret evidence that process sounds like a totalitarian invention to give the appearance but none of the substance of justice once a judge has found reason to consider someone an alien terrorist without even hearing from him , the chance of upsetting that onesided judgment would be near zero the limitation of secret proceedings to cases where classified information would be disclosed is really no limitation at all millions of harmless documents are routinely classified every year concealing the names of accusers and their evidence is a sure way to injustice americans learned that long ago , in the time of the red scare , when government employees were often fired with no real chance to defend themselves there is a dramatic historic example in the immigration field of how secret proceedings may go wrong it involved a german woman , ellen knauff , who was brought back by an american soldier after world war ii as a war bride when ms knauff reached the united states , she was excluded as a security risk without being told the reason her case went to the supreme court , which by a divided vote upheld the government s right to act against her in secret because entering aliens do not have the same rights as people inside the united states justice robert jackson , a former attorney general , wrote a memorable dissent in the knauff case beginning security is like liberty in that many are the crimes committed in its name the case caused such outrage that ms knauff was finally given a hearing it turned out the secret evidence came from a jilted former lover and was worthless she was admitted the bush administration proposed a similar bill two years ago for secret deportation proceedings but republican senators dropped their support of it when its unjust character aroused criticism why revive such a dangerous idea now \? the reason is obvious growing public animosity toward immigrants and fear of terrorism after the bombing of the world trade center there have been periodic rages against aliens in this country , from the alien and sedition acts of 1798 and the anticatholic know nothings in the 19th century to the palmer raids of 1920 they have always left americans feeling ashamed of hysteria on reflection , republicans might think it wise not to try to ride the back of today s hysteria
the golden thirteen recollections of the first black naval officers edited by paul stillwell foreword by colin l powell illustrated 304 pp annapolis , md naval institute press 2195 in 1943 the secretary of the navy , frank knox , sniffed at the idea of having blacks serve as naval officers they are perfectly happy being cooks , steward s mates and mess attendants , he said but pressure from the national association for the advancement of colored people , from eleanor roosevelt and from adlai stevenson , then one of knox s young assistants , persuaded the secretary to allow 13 young men to become the first black american naval officers none of them saw combat only one made a career of the navy but together they made history in the golden thirteen , paul stillwell , the director of the history division of the united states naval institute , has stitched together a fascinating and moving collection of oral histories from the eight survivors of the group the book also includes recollections from three of the white officers who trained and supervised the black men they heighten the differing perceptions of various participants the navy of world war ii , like virtually all american social institutions of the time , was a reflection of the racist society that produced it one of the 13 , james e hair , recalled having witnessed the lynching of his brotherinlaw in 1935 in fort pierce , fla the society that could countenance that horror did n't evaporate when 13 young black men were made naval officers after their commissioning , they encountered white sailors who haughtily refused to salute them , and others who were blithely insulting and they were given lowgrade assignments that precluded winning honors for valor or distinguished service but the men also met whites who went out of their way to be supportive for example , graham e martin , one of the black officers , tells how he was spared a career disaster while an officer candidate at the great lakes naval training station near chicago a white chief petty officer whom he was assisting at an inspection found a cigarette in the jumper pocket of a black recruit that was against regulations the chief petty officer told mr martin to make the recruit eat it mr martin , a graduate of indiana university , refused on the ground that it would be harmful to the recruit s health vindictively , the chief petty officer filed a report mr martin thought he was washed up the white officer in charge of the unit was called on the carpet by the base commander for tolerating insubordination but mr martin escaped punishment and certain loss of his rank when his unit commander , an annapolis man , amused the base commander with a story about how lord nelson got away with violating an order by deliberately holding a telescope to his blind eye when reading a signal the black officers were also supported by white officers like steve belichick , who helped samuel e barnes desegregate the officers' club on okinawa , and e hall downes , who dealt with a pugnaciously racist white officer at the training school attended by the blacks by arranging for his transfer to alaska to be sure , the program was tokenism but , in the words of one of the men , the navy as an institution was making a goodfaith effort in our training with such small steps profound changes are begun one of the blacks , john w reagan , now a successful california real estate investor and manager , recalls his commissioning as possibly the outstanding event of my life and william s white , who retired in 1991 as a judge of the illinois appellate court , says , i still think , on the whole , that the navy is more democratic than the country it serves one merit of this book is purely fortuitous the striving of blacks for acceptance in the military services a generation ago may not be strictly parallel to presentday efforts by homosexuals , yet there are enough similarities to make the golden thirteen especially pertinent one wonders how these similarities escaped the notice of gen colin l powell , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , who has contributed a foreword to this book his outspoken opposition to gay people in the military is well known it is strange that he cannot detect at least some commonality shared by these two groups in the population when he writes that the first 13 black naval officers helped open the blind moral eye of america , and inspired a skinny 7yearold kid in the bronx named colin powell
by now , it might seem that maurice sendak would be used to the furor that often greets his children s books the complaints that where the wild things are was subversive , its monsters too nightmarish the criticism that outside over there dealt too sharply with the darkness of sibling jealousy the outrage over the inclusion of a little boy s penis in in the night kitchen but mr sendak is n't used to it at all , or at least he says he is n't and with the publication of his first original illustrated book in more than a decade , we are all in the dumps with jack and guy , the 65yearold author and artist is somewhat reluctantly bracing himself for another round of conflict over meaning , subtext , context and , as always , whether his work is even appropriate for children i have this idiot name tag which says 'controversial , ' mr sendak said in an interview at his wild thingfilled house in ridgefield , conn i 've had it since 1965 , with 'where the wild things are' it s like pavlov s dogs every time i do a book , they all carry on it may be good for business , but it s tiresome for me shades of dickens no matter what people s objections were in the past , mr sendak is likely to raise a whole new round with dumps , because of its bleak world view and its depictions of poverty , cruelty and homelessness , of children who are ill and alone while his other famous children s books have certainly plumbed children s \( and adults' \) deepest fears and most distasteful emotions , dumps is darker on its surface , with clear shades of dickens and the brothers grimm the story , set in a desolate community of homeless children dressed in tattered newspapers , concerns a painfully skinny black baby who is kidnapped and spirited away by a gang of giant rats after a miraculous rescue orchestrated by the omniscient and quite indignant moon , the baby finds a family of sorts in jack and guy , two faginlike characters who start out as street toughs and are transformed by their new responsibility in the end , the baby is still living on the streets , but he has guardians , and jack and guy vow to bring him up as other folk do the publisher , michael di capua books harpercollins , has high hopes for the book , which is lavishly illustrated by the author it is priced at 20 , and 250 , 000 copies have been printed but will children recoil at its frighteningly real themes \? not at all , said mr sendak if anything , it s adults who tend to feel queasy about his work grownups desperately need to feel safe , and then they project onto the kids , he said but what none of us seem to realize is how smart kids are they do n't like what we write for them , what we dish up for them , because it s vapid , so they 'll go for the hard words , they 'll go for the hard concepts , they 'll go for the stuff where they can learn something , not didactic things , but passionate things mr sendak is just beginning a lecture tour , but he is already spending much of his time answering questions about the book s hidden meanings , about whether he modeled a picture of the moon returning the baby to jack and guy after the pieta , for instance , or whether jack and guy are supposed to represent a gay couple who adopt a child , a la heather has two mommies 'a very literal illustrator' no , no , no , but some of those are very good meanings , mr sendak said i like these overtones , but i ca n't be either praised or blamed for having consciously put them in i'm a very literal illustrator , and people give me far more credit than i deserve what i meant was a continuation of my oldest theme the tenaciousness of children to survive they will go live with a porcupine and a kangaroo if they 're provided for they do n't stop and say , 'oh , this is a samesex marriage' and mr sendak describes the book s social commentary as almost incidental he came to the story backwards , in a way , finding two mother goose nursery rhymes called we are all in the dumps and jack and guy more than 20 years ago and always planning to make a book from them , as he had done in 1965 with hector protector and as i went over the water but he never knew what the rhymes meant , nor did his close friend , iona opie , a mother goose scholar and his collaborator on the recent i saw esau it was not until 1990 or so , in los angeles , that mr sendak found his bleak inspiration a homeless child sleeping in a cardboard box , his legs sticking out \( the book is filled with pictures of children in boxes , as well as with tiny personal asides , like two references to his great friend james marshall , the children s book illustrator who died last year \) the sight of the homeless child came at a time when mr sendak was emerging from a period of particular downheartedness , with friends seeming to die everywhere after years of illustrating , of designing ballet and opera sets and of working on the night kitchen , a theater group for children that he founded in 1990 , mr sendak finally felt ready to write and illustrate another book , he said 'what the verses meant to me' i must insist although that moved me terribly and explained what 'we are all in the dumps' meant , i did n't set out to write a tract , mr sendak said i set out to solve these two poems after all these years , i was thrilled that i could figure out what the verses meant to me it obviously was n't what the verses meant originally , but they suddenly had an extremely contemporary meaning for instance , he explained , the nursery rhyme s last line , the houses are built without walls , inspired his drawings of the children s shantytown , which he modeled after similar communities in south america and the line the moon s in a fit gave rise to his use of the moon as a formidable character in her own right , outraged at the misery she sees below mr sendak says that at heart , the book really reflects his earlier themes it s about a little baby who s determined to have a family and to have a home , he said speaking of where the wild things are , in which the main character , max , goes on a mad , imaginative journey after his mother sends him to his room without supper , mr sendak says if max screams at his mother and he s monstrous and he has a huge temper tantrum , he does get back home again he never left home , actually and of course his mother loves him and in in the night kitchen , the main character , mickey , turns up back in his bed safe after his own wild adventures in a giant bowl of cake batter the only difference here is that the baby has no home , mr sendak said but the intention and the passion is the same here is a stray baby , and come hell or high water it will find a home , because every child needs a home mr sendak has been called difficult , a curmudgeon with a warped view of the world , a children s book writer who sets out to terrify children but he passionately resists such interpretations , arguing , in the end , that it is children who finally understand a good friend of mine in california got an early copy of the book and read it to his daughter , he related and he said , 'it was sad , was n't it \?

after many years as an artist perhaps best known for not being better known , richard goode has finally achieved a measure of the fame as a soloist that he deserved long ago having spent nearly three decades as a performer , especially of chamber music , before making his carnegie hall debut in 1990 , he is now something of a fixture there as well as on the world s other major stages his recital on monday evening at carnegie is one of the most anticipated events of the musical season , and not only among aficionados of the piano but if much has changed in mr goode s career , not much has changed about mr goode himself because of his stocky build and broad features , his looks have been aptly compared with a rembrandt selfportrait from the 1650 s beethoven is n't a ridiculous comparison , either now that he has turned 50 , his longish , scraggly hair has become silver he is a slightly tamer , less gyroscopic presence at the keyboard and his playing has steadily deepened still , the strength of his artistry has always resided in its integrity and consistency there has been something almost audacious about his steady refusal to conform in either his stage appearance or his programming to the expectations of promoters and a thrillseeking public he has always gone about his business and simply waited for the world to come around and now it has one big reason is beethoven six years ago , mr goode performed the complete cycle of 32 beethoven sonatas at the 92d street y , and the enormous success of that series of recitals proved a turning point it occurred to many people then that the beethoven mantle worn by artur schnabel and for more than half a century since , no one as assuredly had been assumed by mr goode , that he was to be a standardbearer in this central part of the piano repertory that impression is bound to be furthered by a 10cd set of the complete sonatas just released on elektra nonesuch \( 9 793282 some of the disks had been released individually on either bookofthemonth records or elektra nonesuch \) these beautifully engineered recordings may well become a landmark mr goode s playing is remarkable for its organic naturalness and its combination of freshness and maturity the former comes out of the latter he sounds so entirely at home , understanding the music and feeling it emotionally on such a deep level , that he has the confidence to be spontaneous although in command of an unimpeachable technique \( listen to the thrilling , unbelievably clean and pearly first and last movements of the waldstein , for instance \) , mr goode is never primarily thought of as a virtuoso but what , after all , is virtuosity about except the sense of creative freedom that comes from having mastered the score and its physical demands \? one clear example of this virtuosity is his playing of the late amajor sonata \( op 101 \) , which will be part of the carnegie program \( along with schubert s cmajor sonata , d 840 beethoven s eroica variations , and debussy s children s corner \) it can be a difficult piece to grasp , by frequent turns intimate and exclamatory , whimsical and unexpected and sometimes explosive , with occasionally lurching rhythms in the quirky secondmovement march and the finale that can put you in mind of a sputtering jalopy many of the gestures here would be elaborated on in the subsequent four sonatas \( think of the jazzy , syncopated variation in the arietta movement of opus 111 \) yet it is a frangible work , and making it hold together is a challenge for any pianist mr goode manages on the recording to have the whole sonata breathe with unexpected ease and elegance , not just in the reflective opening measures and in the mournful slow section preceding the last movement but also in that last movement , which virtually prances in a performance of extreme and unusual clarity and spareness of pedal no theatrics or grandiosity instead , a blend of quiet beauty and buoyancy \( if sonatas are people , mr goode mused in a recent conversation , then the later sonatas may be more profound , but 101 is the one i want to know all the extremes of late beethoven are gathered up in a healthy classical way it may be his favorite of all the sonatas , he ventured , and mr goode has none of the salesman or promoter in him , although a bit of the provocateur \) in the performance of opus 101 and throughout , these recordings are characterized by mr goode s unerringly lyric sensibility the performances are often surprisingly intimate , and when they rise to heroic heights , it is as likely as not to be in those places where the music calls for a kind of plangent and melancholic grandeur that s not to say these are precious or miniaturist performances , because they are not \( true , the pastoral is a little too sleepily bucolic at the start , but it gathers considerable steam \) they are on their own terms very big statements , and especially in the late opus 106 and opus 111 , they are truly monumental there s less heavenstorming here than usual , though no doubt too little for some tastes in some of the sonatas , as in the finale of the tempest in its place are qualities that speak at least as much to the heart of beethoven s music as sturm und drang does , if not more
washington , july 2 in an effort to determine how sheik omar abdel rahman entered the united states , the state department ran the names of four highprofile terrorists through a computer system meant to identify undesirable immigrants all four passed the failure of the system was one of a series of deep and pervasive flaws in the united states visa system uncovered by state department investigators they concluded that it was these flaws , as well as bureaucratic bungling , that allowed mr abdel rahman to enter the united states , according to congressional officials from both parties mr abdel rahman , who was detained today by immigration authorities in brooklyn , received four united states visas even after he was placed on the lookout list in 1987 but the classified review by the state department s inspector general found failings that extended well beyond that individual case 'a cavalier attitude' representative olympia j snowe , republican of maine , said the report showed that the state department and the immigration and naturalization service maintained a cavalier attitude toward the serious business of keeping dangerous foreign nationals out of the united states a democratic congressional official who also provided an account of the findings described an incredibly inefficient visa system the state department refused today to comment on the report , which its inspector general , sherman m funk , presented to congress in a closed hearing earlier this week but representative snowe said the inspector general s office had said she could make the findings public mr abdel rahman , who was tried and acquitted in the 1981 assassination of egyptian president anwar el sadat , entered the united states in 1990 despite being on the state department list of undesirables he obtained his visa from the united states embassy in khartoum , the sudan , and state department officials had suggested that primitive conditions there may have contributed to his case s being overlooked improvements not enough although it did not directly contradict that account , the investigation found evidence that the lookout system itself was inadequate , according to the congressional officials they said its failure to recognize the names of the four known terrorists was the most stunning evidence of those flaws in the test , mr funk and his staff selected the names of four egyptian terrorists who had been convicted of crimes in egyptian courts at least five months before , the officials said but they discovered that none of the names had been added to the state department watch list , which is maintained on a computer data base representative snowe , who said mr funk had been assured that the system had recently been improved , described his testimony about it as one of the most revealing moments of wednesday s private briefing for two house subcommittees mr funk , who serves as the state department s own internal investigator , had been asked to look into mr abdel rahman s entry into the country by representative tom lantos , democrat of california , who chairs the house foreign affairs subcommittee on international security multiple mistakes cited mr lantos refused to comment tonight on the details of the report because it was presented in a closed hearing but he said that mr abdel rahman had been able to enter the united states not only because of serious , multiple mistakes but also because of a systemic problem with the nation s visa system there has been speculation that mr abdel rahman , who helped to recruit young men to fight in the americanbacked guerrilla war against the afghan government , might have been assisted by the central intelligence agency or other spying agencies in obtaining his visa but the congressional officials said mr funk s investigation had confirmed his preliminary finding that no such assistance had been given instead , the inspector general identified a long list of mistakes made by the state department and the ins that made it possible for mr abdel rahman to effectively establish residence in the united states his report said the united states embassy in khartoum had only verbally reprimanded a sudanese employee who apparently falsely certified in 1990 that mr rahman s name did not appear on the terrorist watch list an employee s error in lesstraveled capitals like khartoum , the list is maintained not on computers but on microfiche sent from washington some state department officials had suggested earlier that the cumbersome nature of that system might have contributed to any errors but mr funk and other officials told the lawmakers in the closed hearing that the sudanese employee had apparently never checked whether mr abdel rahman was on the list a state department consular official testified that the man was not dismissed for his action because he was otherwise an exemplary employee , representative snowe said tonight the investigation also disclosed that the state department did not notify the ins of its mistake until four months after discovering that it had inappropriately issued the visa to mr abdel rahman , the congressional officials said the report also called new attention to the fact that mr abdel rahman was not placed on the lookout list until seven years after he was linked to the terrorists who assassinated mr sadat
of the relatively few stereotypes that have slipped past politicalcorrectness watchdogs in recent years , none has more stamina than the exaggerated jewish mother , a stock character once again very much in vogue in primetime entertainment the british music hall once had its bandylegged , boozy irish paddy today s television seems curiously partial to neurotically overprotective , brash and often garish mothers of the unmistakably jewish persuasion one reason may simply be oedipal revenge from seinfeld to mad about you , many of the writers and performers are jewish perhaps this is one way to get back at mommy viciously \? no most of the characterizations are rooted in fondness , albeit backhanded and very wry probably more significant is the tradition of standup comedy , especially of the maledominated catskill borscht belt variety in which women served as standard foils that was the dominant style from henny youngman \( take my wife please ! \) to alan king with the new feminism and , equally important , the emergence of female comics , wives are now generally offlimits but evidently mom , no matter how maligned , is still good for a laugh and some gifted character actresses make the most of the opportunity catch renee taylor in fox s daddy dearest or doris belack in cbs s family album there always have been exceptions to the loudandbrassy cliche back in 1949 , gertrude berg created the warm and wise molly , doyenne of her bronx neighborhood , for a fiveyear run in the goldbergs on various networks and just recently , gary david goldberg packed cbs s brooklyn bridge with mothers and grandmothers who behaved like thoroughly normal people but the thrust toward caricature persists these are among this season s more prominent examples on mad about you , paul s takecharge mother moves into high gear when her husband is hospitalized with a heart spasm the family shudders paul s sister , noticing that her father s heart monitor goes berserk every time mom approaches , cries , oh god , she s going to kill him and come live with me bursting in on paul and his wife , jamie , during some of their more intimate bedroom moments , mom sneers , ca n't you skip an evening \? on seinfeld , jobless george is forced to move back in with his parents careful with the suitcase , growls mom , we just painted george clutches his head as the family conversations swerve dizzily from the worth of a civil service test to the advisability of putting bananas in the jello on daddy dearest , mom fusses maniacally over the eating habits of her son , himself a father i do n't want anything , he insists so only eat half , she counters before going on to take on and emotionally demolish several people at her grandson s grade school on family album , mom is convinced that her son s quite capable wife ca n't keep house or cook \( food obviously looms large in these routines \) and , despite pointed hints , keeps arriving at the doorstep with huge dinners of brisket , her son s favorite for balance of a sort , this series also features the wife s nottobestopped italian mother the onenote stereotype is hardly limited to the networks in a tracey ullman special currently on hbo , that superb mimic includes in her gallery of characters fay rosenthal from long island , in manhattan to dominate her daughter s wedding at a midtown hotel fay is a hysteric and control freak with a complete stranglehold on her resigned husband \( i do n't know why you put up with me you could do so much better , says fay when the groom s jewish mother from minneapolis \( i'm concerned , sniffs fay , that this family is not good enough for our sheila \) seems to be an ultraoverachiever \( she not only speaks chinese but also studied cooking in beijing \) fay goes into neuroses overload play hava nagilah , please sure , caricature is endemic to prime time but why do jewish mothers seem to have a monopoly on its more extreme forms \? in years past , white anglosaxon mothers in shows like father knows best were models of decorum today , black mothers like thea are paragons of warmth and nurturing but too many jewish mothers , it seems to this puzzled goy , become props for humor that often teeters on outright ridicule or even occasional cruelty most of the jewish mothers i know , who usually have a delicious sense of humor , deserve far better
washington , jan 18 in the middle of one of the most glittering events of the inaugural week , the sunday concert at the lincoln memorial , people watching on cnn and cspan found themselves cut off from the songs of stars like diana ross , bob dylan and kenny rogers many viewers called the two cable networks to complain , wondering how exclusive rights to an event in so public a place as the lincoln memorial could be bought they were told that hbo had paid about 15 million to the presidential inaugural committee for exclusive rights to tape the performances for transmission sunday night hbo allowed other networks to cover up to three minutes of the concert as a news event unscrambled telecast eileen murphy , a spokeswoman for cnn , said today we thought it was a public event on public grounds and that , therefore , the rights should not have been sold however , we were pleased with hbo s giving us access to their footage though hbo usually scrambles its signal , it made the edited twohour version of the performance available free to all cable subscribers whose carriers chose to make it available bridget potter , hbo s senior vice president for original programming , said her company had accomplished two things it made the event widely available , and it promoted hbo to nonsubscribing cable viewers when asked about the propriety of selling exclusive rights to something at the lincoln memorial , she said , that s more of an issue for the inaugural committee richard i mintz , the communications director of the inaugural committee , said the rights had been sold to hbo because it was the only outfit willing to commit the resources to do it none of the networks made commitments to carry the show live , mr mintz said any criticism of the arrangement was unwarranted , he said , since hbo s fee had made the performances possible susan swain , a senior vice president at cspan , said , there was definitely a sense of disappointment on the part of viewers who could n't see the events at the memorial in their entirety she said cspan would have broadcast the entire event live had it been permitted to
batavia , ny , july 13 pedro jova perez shaded his eyes and shifted his weight in a creative but futile attempt to avoid the heat then the cuban baseball manager stepped into a shaded area beneath a news media tent and braced for an avalanche of reporters' questions the game spoke for itself cuba , in classic red jerseys and red caps with the neat , scripted c , had battered italy , 120 the game was mercifully ended after seven innings by the 10run rule from panamerican games to olympics to world cup to these world university games , cuban baseball players have established a veritable empire in amateur baseball many of the fans who braved sweltering heat this afternoon had come less to watch a competitive game than to watch the cubans play their classic , textbook style only losses off the field indeed , the only losses for the cubans had occurred off the field on monday reinaldo ordonez perreira , a 22yearold shortstop , defected as did edilberto oropesa , a 23yearold pitcher , last saturday most of the reporters' questions today centered on whether the loss of those two players had led to a loss of confidence for this team , made up of the country s top junior players during a news conference this morning , cuban officials downplayed the defections , and the baseball coaches stressed that the players who had left were not essential or whose absence would negatively impact the team after the game this afternoon , perez underlined that point and all but said that the cuban team was better without the defectors 'brought us closer' really , it has brought us closer as a team , he said the team is closer than before and playing better pressed about his feelings on the defectors , the manager a shortstop on the cuban national team from 1975 to 1985 shrugged people who want to stay , stay , he said the ones who want to leave , leave we want the people who want to play we come here to play baseball on wednesday , the cubans will face the united states in a fierce but friendly rivalry dampened somewhat by the americans' loss to japan on monday cuba and the united states are expected to meet again later , in the medal round it s an important game for us , perez said through an interpreter the united states is always wellprepared we saw them play in the world cup they are very good about the americans' loss to japan , he said it can happen throughout the game today , a number of fans , watching cuban pitchers nibble around the edges of the plate and infielders smoothly executing the double play , wondered how long it would be before cuban players no longer had to climb over center field fences to play major league baseball in the united states at the same time , those who follow cuban baseball realized that the attraction of the cubans is precisely the fact that they do not , as a whole , throw themselves at the mercy of the majors in a way , it s kind of neat watching them , 'cause you know they 're playing baseball because they love baseball , said mark madgett , a fan and the owner of alex s restaurant in batavia they 're not trying to get to the major leagues , for the most part they just enjoy the game of baseball , and they enjoy playing the game the way it s supposed to be played someday , i 'd like to see the cuban champions play the world series champion some say that day is not so far away , others say the day will never come cuban athletes will not speculate while the desire to compete at the highest level must certainly drive cuban players to wonder how they would perform against major league players in the united states , none will concede even that the two players who defected mentioned rene arocha , who defected from cuba s national team in 1991 and is now a successful pitcher with the st louis cardinals cuban players play for cuba , he said , repeating a popular refrain our goal is not to play baseball in america , but to play baseball and be successful for cuba perez , asked about cuban baseball players and major league baseball , shifted his weight
cluj , romania , nov 8 for more than a year , a fraudulent financial scheme involving about three million romanians paid 800 percent profits to investors who deposited money for three months these newly rich spent lavishly on previously unimaginable luxuries like refrigerators , washing machines and even vacations abroad but for the last several weeks , the ponzistyle pyramid scheme , which economists say has pulled in the equivalent of 1 billion to 5 billion , has failed to pay back anything tens of thousands of romanians , who live in one of eastern europe s grimmest economies , face losing their meager savings , while the scheme s founder is said to have stashed away as much as 40 million government officials , fearful of riots and protests , are reluctant to stop it how the scheme known as caritas , after the latin derivative for charity took such hold seems to be a story of crude political forces and the susceptibility of an impoverished society desperate for better times it also involves the unrealistic expectations of a people who have heard about capitalism but never experienced it the effects of the scheme s crash are likely to be particularly severe , economists say , because it comes as the romanian government is preparing to sign an agreement with the international monetary fund under the agreement , romania will receive 300 million in imf loans plus 200 million from elsewhere but in return , the country must take austerity measures that would result in shortterm higher fuel and food prices at the caritas offices here , depositors wanting to claim their profits after the required waiting period of three months have been turned away for several weeks the founder of caritas who , until recently , had been transformed from a littleknown bookkeeper into an almost unassailable national folk hero harshly told a desperate elderly man at the scheme s office in the mining town of petrosani today that he was ruining the game by demanding gains from money deposited in july inside , two dozen young women sat behind computers in an empty room waiting for customers but a month ago , the crush was so great that people slept overnight in tents outside the sports stadium here waiting to make deposits sometimes only 2 , 000 lei , or about 2 , or sometimes pools of 200 , 000 lei \( 200 \) collected in factories and mines those people , whose average wage is about 60 a month , are almost certain never to see their money romanian and western bankers warned this week that failure of the scheme , which had been allowed to spiral out of control by the neocommunist government , portended grave social and economic consequences for the country pyramid schemes , which have historically popped up in different countries in hard times , survive as long as higher and higher returns can lure investors caritas promised a particularly spectacular return of 800 percent after 90 days but deposits cannot rise exponentially in perpetuity it is a matter of time before people lose interest , funds evaporate or the authorities shut the scheme down but early on , investors in such schemes can get rich in romania , politicians and businessmen are reported to have cashed in early and even been given their returns without having to wait the full three months none of the money was invested outside caritas but the most recent investors seem destined for disappointment they include the thousands of peasants , factory workers and miners who trekked in on special buses , trains and even donkey carts to this north central romanian city of 320 , 000 this summer and fall some romanian officials said they feared a violent backlash from the nation s miners , whose volatile union leader , miron cosma , inexplicably embraced the scheme during its last gasp several weeks ago in 1991 , mr cosma led miners on a rampage through bucharest that resulted in the downfall of the government i'm really very concerned , said dan pascariu , the chairman of the romanian bank of commerce , adding that he estimated that three or four of every eight families in the country had invested there could be riots by those who are the losers i think the founders of the scheme made a big mistake by going to the miners you do n't kid with these people daniel daianu , the chief economist of the national bank , said the new austerity from the imf , combined with the psyche of a population after the collapse of caritas , could increase the likelihood of social disruption there s already a lot of opposition to the imf measures mr daianu has been publicly warning for weeks that the scheme is a fraud , but the government of president ion iliescu , nervous about its grip on power and afraid that closing the scheme would make the government even more unpopular , has refused to stop it mr iliescu was a high official in the ceausescu government this is something that should have been debated but everyone is shunning responsibility , mr daianu

the staff of the nuclear regulatory commission has identified 15 nuclear reactors around the country whose reactor vessels have become so weakened by radiation that they will require careful analysis to determine if they are still safe the staff s report , affecting one in seven of the nation s dwindling fleet of reactors , is a sign that they are aging faster than their builders had anticipated and will take more effort to keep running the staff singled out the plants in a study that it began last year after a 32yearold massachusetts plant , yankee rowe , was retired because of questions about the strength of its reactor vessel trying to avoid surprises james e richardson , the engineering director at the commission s office of nuclear reactor regulation , said the study was undertaken to identify problems before they were so severe that the plants had to be shut down while the analysis was done we 're trying to avoid any more surprises like we had with yankee , mr richardson said in that case , the owners and the commission could not agree on what would constitute a clean bill of health with the plant shut until the issue was resolved , the owners decided to save the payroll and maintenance costs by retiring the reactor the reactors on the new list will probably not have to shut soon , industry experts say rather , their owners will have to provide extensive analyses to show that the weakened metal is still stronger than the minimum calculated to be necessary some have already submitted analyses to the commission , although none has been approved yet bombarded by neutrons the reactor vessels are becoming brittle because of years of bombardment by subatomic particles called neutrons , which sustain the chain reaction in the reactor cores in a report to the commissioners dated feb 25 , but not made available to the public until three weeks ago , the staff noted , the integrity of the reactor pressure vessel is essential in ensuring reactor safety embrittlement depends mostly on plant design , metallurgy and years of operation owners of the plants said they were confident their reactors would be found safe for continued operation but robert pollard , an engineer with the union of concerned scientists , a watchdog group , predicted that some of the 15 plants will probably retire early mr pollard , who was formerly on the commission staff , said that if the reactors had reached the point where further analysis was needed they should be shut until the operators had proved their case the nrc is supposed to be on top of this stuff , he said spokesmen for three of the utilities , operating six of the plants , insisted that even if their reactors had reached the point where new calculations were required , all met the commission s safety criteria other challenges to plants yankee rowe was at a particular disadvantage , industry experts said , because it was built in the 1950 s , before builders saved extra pieces of metal from the vessel for later testing most other reactors have such samples available but some of those on the list already face substantial challenges to continued operation one , the nine mile point 1 reactor , in scriba , ny , is already a candidate for retirement because of rising operation costs and declining need for its power in the last year , the owners of three reactors , including yankee rowe , have announced plans to retire the reactors and no new plants have been ordered in nearly 20 years on the other hand , commonwealth edison s zion 1 and 2 reactors , near chicago , will live out their 40year design lives , said peter c leblond , an engineer at the site the operators knew by 1985 that the reactors would eventually reach a point requiring utilities to sharpen our pencils and calculate just how strong the metal would have to be , he said in a telephone interview the measure used by the commission is how much force is required to split a sample piece of metal when a wedge is dropped on a notch carved in the sample when the vessels are new they are supposed to withstand a force of 75 footpounds , which would be the equivalent of a 75pound weight dropped from one foot the 15 reactors now have metal that could be split with less than 50 footpounds of strength , the commission said , although some operators say that the number is above 50 footpounds for their plants the basis of the disagreement is that steel has a grain somewhat like wood , and strength depends on whether the notch is carved parallel to the grain or perpendicular to it map nuclear plants facing scrutiny shows the states with plants that require additional analysis now to determine if they are safe , and the states with plants expected to require such analysis later \( source nuclear regulatory commission \)
washington , june 12 despite the clinton administration s recent diplomatic recognition of angola s formerly marxist government , guerrillas in the southern african nation are urging the united states to broker a peace accord to end the civil war there there is no other country , no other observer that can do it , said fatima roque , the shadow economic minister for the rebel organization that goes by the portuguese acronym unita , during a visit to washington this week frustrated by the collapse of a 1991 peace pact and angered by the rebels' refusal to accept the results of free elections last fall , the united states granted recognition on may 19 to the government of president jose eduardo dos santos the decision , long expected , ended 18 years of official enmity toward the ruling movement for the popular liberation of angola peace talks between the angolan government and the rebels broke down three days later over unita s refusal to withdraw from towns and villages it has conquered since the civil war resumed last october military aid discussed since the talks collapsed last month , the rebels have retaken the northern oilexporting town of soyo and shelled some offshore oil platforms that belong to american companies , clinton administration officials say they now hold most of angola s territory even as the guerrillas say they want the united states to help get the negotiations back on track , the clinton administration is drawing up options to support the angolan government in case the talks cannot be revived and the unita offensive continues to gain ground a senior administration official said on friday that these options could include providing military aid to angola we have asked the bureaucracy to think about options down the road if the negotiations do not succeed , said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity he emphasized that none of the options had been presented to the white house still , the discussion of military aid as an option , however remote at this stage , is a sea change from the cold war years , when the united states armed and supported unita to combat a government viewed by washington as a soviet proxy a peace accord reached in may 1991 led to internationally supervised elections in which mr dos santos s party won a parliamentary majority last september rebel offensive deplored also emblematic of washington s shifting postcoldwar policy is the harsh criticism of the rebels for the breakdown in talks and the offensive launched recently by jonas savimbi , the unita leader unita stands for the national union for the total independence of angola unita representatives met this week with the assistant under secretary of state for african affairs , george e moose , who handed them a copy of a communique in which the united states , russia and portugal said the rebel group s recent military actions call into serious question unita s intention to reach a negotiated settlement portugal was angola s colonial ruler until 1975 the communique said the three countries had discussed potential actions that could be taken should unita continue to fail to respond to appeals to end its military campaign and return to the peace talks the envoys suggested that the clinton administration s decision to recognize the angolan government might make washington a more effective mediator between the sides i think the united states and the clinton administration can play has to play an active role in order to make the angolans find a solution to end the war , ms roque said i think they have to maintain the same relationship that they 've made now with the mpla last month , unita harshly condemned the clinton administration for extending diplomatic recognition to mr dos santos s government state department officials said unita s new conciliatory remarks seem to be aimed at convincing supporters of the guerrillas inside angola that the rebel movement s ties to its former benefactor were still strong we feel it s for internal unita consumption to demonstrate they are not isolated , said a state department official , speaking on condition of anonymity ms roque and jorge veiga morgado , a unita member in the angolan parliament , maintain that unita is refusing to withdraw from areas it has recently captured or lay down its arms because it fears that its leadership and fighters would be slaughtered by government troops what is needed , they say , is a united nations buffer force that is at least as large if not larger than the 5 , 700member contingent that is to be deployed in mozambique map of angola shows location of soyo

generations in world affairs are marked by their greatest challenges castlereagh of britain and metternich of the austrohungarian empire maneuvered to create stability and legitimacy in a europe reeling from napoleon s victories and defeat roosevelt , churchill and de gaulle rallied their nations to defeat nazi germany and japan from truman to bush , the task was to contain soviet communism and nurture freedom , and it was done for the clinton generation , the challenges are much more diffuse , multiple and uncertain bill clinton and his partners in world diplomacy are playing on a chessboard where international and domestic transactions form a seamless web , where the number of public and private players are barely countable let alone controllable , where the rules are yet to be defined , where the true nature of threats remains shrouded by their very multiplicity and complexity and where it is hard to judge what constitutes winning and losing the cold war s end has left statesmen in an impenetrable smog of peace in this new world , there is no central challenge , and therefore there can be no central organizing principle for foreign policy mr clinton and other leaders will find it hard to order their priorities they will have to play all over the board until they can begin to make sense of things the only sure star to guide them through the smog is this they should do what they reasonably can to prevent the worst such a modest formula falls far short of the precision of an algebraic equation and the moral clarity of the ten commandments but it can serve to remind world leaders that history will not forgive them if they use economic hard times as an excuse for inaction , if they allow narrow shortterm national concerns to destroy the longterm fruits of international cooperation and if they fail to see the ultimate material and moral rewards of being their brother s keeper the us and other powers obviously cannot and should not use force in all places where people are killing each other but to argue that the big powers or the un should not intervene anywhere unless they intervene everywhere is pure sophistry to intervene nowhere pleases only the foolish god of consistency leaders will have to practice highly imperfect international triage and save as many as they reasonably can they cannot maintain civilization and look away the us intervened in somalia to give its people a chance to restore some order , not to remake somali society similarly in bosnia , the us and its allies can win no military victory at reasonable cost nor can they extinguish ethnic hatreds by force but they can use force to give muslims a chance to defend themselves and lessen serb genocide and they need not be dragged into a quagmire if they make plain at the outset what lines they will not cross , as in somalia free trade negotiators have toiled for 30 years with only limited success to break down trade barriers yet without their modest accomplishments , the protectionist tide would have overwhelmed the one sure means to open markets and expand economies asian nations are rapidly acquiring modern arms to match their mighty and growing economic power because of the easy availability of such weapons , this buildup cannot be stopped but it can be attenuated by keeping us troops in the region and by expediting security talks among asians an equally staggering list of new agenda issues helping russia , population control , refugees , environment and the like demand the attention of all for none of these priorities are adequate monies available but courageous leaders must squeeze some money from somewhere lest a tidal wave of misery overcome them the world herein described where leaders will have to strive mainly to do what they can to prevent an endless array of challenges from overwhelming humankind does not lend itself to grand dreams and visions nor should it inspire pessimism for all the horrors and blinding complexities unleashed by the cold war s end , the smog of peace is far preferable to the fog of war or the fog of the cold war peoples long chained in darkness have now tasted freedom , felt its material and spiritual blessings , and will not easily give it up
management changes announced last week at the times mirror company accelerated an evolution that is changing one of the largest familydominated media empires in the country the company s president , david laventhol , said he was stepping down and two senior vice presidents were given new responsibilities and titles in what was widely seen as the start of a competition over who will succeed the company s chairman , robert f erburu , who is 63 and is expected to retire in two years mr erburu , a longtime adviser and intimate of times mirror s founding chandler family , is likely to be the last chairman with such close ties to the chandlers the transformation is likely to leave the company with a cadre of professional managers who are less concerned with the influence of the family and more concerned with hard numbers for generations since 1882 , the chandler stewardship of the company s flagship , the los angeles times , virtually defined the power that can go with control of an important newspaper times mirror sold shares to the public beginning in 1964 the signs of change chandler family members remain on the company s board and own about onethird of the company , though they control 54 percent of shareholder voting power still , the corporatization of times mirror has been under way for years as the company has grown , felt shareholder pressure and , more recently , been pushed to control costs because of sagging advertising revenues after this next step in the transformation , the new generation of managers will be measured against a family standard that for decades has included a commitment to journalistic excellence in addition to the los angeles times , the company owns newsday on long island and in new york city and newspapers in baltimore , hartford and elsewhere the company , which derives about half its 37 billion in revenues from newspapers , has been enormously influential in helping to define the future format of newspapers the emerging group of managers will also be watched for decisions that could affect newspapers nationally in baltimore , for example , the company has long been toying with whether to preserve that city s valued evening sun as well as its morning sister publication in new york , some analysts say , new managers might be tempted to review the company s resolve to support its expensive nineyear effort to make new york newsday a financial success mr laventhol , who is suffering from parkinson s disease , is stepping down on jan 1 as president of times mirror and as publisher of the los angeles times he is to remain a member of the board because of the types of managers now rising within the company , his departure is likely to be seen as the final phase in the company s move away from the chandler family s direct involvement in management otis chandler , the last of the chandlers to be so involved , stepped down as chairman in 1986 experience from outside the two men who are said to be in the running for the top job are both 49 years old richard t schlosberg 3d , an executive for many years at small newspaper companies who has recently been running times mirror s eastern newspapers , and curtis a hessler , a former vice chairman of the unisys corporation who joined times mirror in 1991 what may be more significant than their relative youth , however , is the broad experience both men bring from places other than times mirror mr schlosberg is seen as ahead in the competition because he was named to take over mr laventhol s highvisibility responsibilities as publisher of the los angeles times but some securities analysts said it was possible that times mirror could turn to a complete outsider analysts said last week that the emergence of a new generation of professional managers was welcome at a company that has come under criticism in recent years for weak financial performance last year , times mirror reported a loss of 67 million after onetime charges that included employee buyouts largely because of the recession , it has seen operating profit from its newspapers shrink from a high of 377 million in 1987 to 126 million last year kenneth t berents , an analyst at wheat , first securities , said times mirror had been known as a company with excellent properties but , recently , not excellent financial results as it shifts toward the first group of managers without family links , mr berents said , the financial community expects a more coldblooded management style you will see this company much more focused on the bottom line , whoever replaces the current management , he said a source of success some in the industry do not welcome such changes they say the historical success of familydominated newspaper companies came partly from the managers' ability to separate the drive for profit from the drive for quality some of those strengths are lost , they say , if professional managers , struggling to meet traditional business benchmarks , lose sight of journalistic values the los angeles times , sharply conservative and stridently antiunion through most of its history , is often cited as an example of the success of family management otis chandler , who was its publisher from 1960 to 1980 , was widely credited with turning what had been a financially successful but parochial publication into a worldclass newspaper
fans of the sevenheaded mouse king will be thrilled to see their favorite villain in yucky detail as he sallies forth in the film george balanchine s 'the nutcracker' like tchaikovsky s two other ballets , the sleeping beauty and swan lake , the nutcracker incorporates a fable about the forces of light and darkness but in the nutcracker , this struggle is seen , delightfully , from a child s point of view and is symbolized in the nutcracker s battle with the mouse monarch details and closeups would seem inimical to the sweep and grandeur of balanchine s choreography , with its sophisticated use of pattern and structure yet the newly released film , which is based on his 1954 production of the nutcracker , embodies a marriage of art forms that balanchine once envisaged in january 1934 , shortly after emigrating from europe to new york , the choreographer told the british critic arnold haskell that he hoped to wed film to ballet film , he said , could explore pattern and new angles and provide closeups of the face , the arm , a wrist , the pointes , all arranged so that the full significance of the work could be revealed in this penetrating interview , which foretold the course his career would take \( i do not believe in anything in ballet but classicism \) , balanchine spoke of film as a tool for popularizing ballet i am thinking of ballet in a much wider sense of bringing it back to the masses as the ideal form of entertainment george balanchine s 'the nutcracker' is that form of entertainment , lovingly directed by emile ardolino and with balanchine s choreography faithfully staged for the new york city ballet s dancers by peter martins , the artistic director of that company , which balanchine cofounded with lincoln kirstein the film , with its wellrehearsed perfection , is no substitute for a live performance of balanchine s nutcracker , which makes its 19thcentury stagecraft visible and exerts its charms through the immediacy of a threedimensional performance but this film is not merely the nextbest thing it is an alternative version that keeps balanchine s dance values intact you would be hard put to find a more gloriously danced pas de deux on film than the grand image of idealized happiness by darci kistler s sugar plum fairy and damian woetzel s cavalier luckily , what you wo n't find in this movie , as opposed to other film or video versions of the nutcracker , is the pop psychology that insists on a subliminal erotic element in the scenario in those versions , it is not enough for marie , a preadolescent girl at a christmas party , to project her fantasies from a male nutcracker doll onto the prince of her dreams her godfather , drosselmeier , even has designs on the little heroine drosselmeier was up this sort of mischief in the 1986 commercial film of the pacific northwest ballet s version , directed by carroll ballard balanchine would have none of this his ballet , while original in its choreography , refers to what the nutcracker was at its creation in 1892 in russia a tale of domestic warmth in the first act and a danced entertainment in the second the choreographer did not live to make his own film of nutcracker , but in the 1970 s he did collaborate with the pbs dance in america team that translated his other choreography so effectively for television that team included mr ardolino and merrill brockway , who collaborated on this film mr ardolino , who died on nov 20 , remained faithful to balanchine s principles he never cut away from the dancing s most important features , and he knew how to zero in on the details that balanchine , in 1934 , said would reveal the significance of the work there is one weakness in the camera work the fabled speed of the city ballet dancers makes the ensembles \( the snowflakes dance and the waltz of the flowers \) look blurred the city ballet states that the film is not speeded up perhaps it needs to be slowed down nonetheless , there is some firstclass dancing on view from the soloists , notably kyra nichols as dewdrop and wendy whelan as coffee in act ii yes , macaulay culkin is in the film , and he does n't do badly it was balanchine who added the character of drosselmeier s nephew to the ballet , identifying him with the nutcracker , who is transformed by marie s love into a little prince there is an unexpected glint of evil in mr culkin s eye when he helps his uncle unwrap the toys but then drosselmeier is scary , too once transformed into a prince , mr culkin should have exchanged the smirk for a smile his mime scene , if devoid of classical style , is fresh in its naturalness the movie s genuine child stars are jessica lynn cohen , an enchanting marie , and peter reznick , all frisky charm as her brother , fritz for a ballet company short on acting experience , the city ballet offers some scenestealing moments bart robinson cook s drosselmeier is a smart old codger , brilliantly timed to the music an inside joke comes with two alumni , edward bigelow and karin von aroldingen , being cast as hilarious grandparents on stage , the nutcracker divides into the reality of act i and the fantasy of act ii was the film s voiceover , by kevin kline , added because it was feared that viewers would not realize they were watching a splendidly filmed ballet , that they would confuse ballet reality with film realism

washington , july 9 another battle appears to be brewing over a top nominee of president clinton a number of conservative groups are mobilizing to block the president s choice for surgeon general , dr joycelyn elders , asserting that she wants to bring sex education to kindergartners her defenders contend that the religious right is trying to smear one of the most innovative thinkers on sexual responsibility for the young dr elders , a pediatrician who was director of the arkansas health department when mr clinton was governor of that state , would succeed george bush s appointee , antonia c novello , as the public health service official who serves as the president s top medical adviser dr elders has a reputation for being an outspoken proponent of sex education and aids prevention programs among elementaryschool children as a means to promote better public health and inhibit unwanted pregnancies dr elders , who has been credited with improving programs on prenatal care and childhood immunization in arkansas , also favors abortion rights and believes that norplant , the surgically implanted birth control device , should be distributed to prostitutes white house officials say they are confident that they have a comfortable margin of support for dr elders on the senate labor and human resources committee , which will hold hearings on her nomination next friday the committee has 10 democrats and 7 republicans , and none of the democrats has shown any inclination to vote against her but given the difficulties encountered last month with the failed nomination of lani guinier to head the justice department s civil rights division , the white house is not taking any chances officials there have spent this week lining up a broad range of endorsements for dr elders , who would be the first black woman ever to serve as surgeon general endorsed by 74 groups a white house document entitled public endorsements for dr elders as of 5 20 pm , july 8 , 1993 , lists 74 diverse groups , including the american medical association and the national urban league , that are backing her jan parshall , a spokeswoman for concerned women of america , which was founded in 1979 to oppose the feminist movement and claims to have 600 , 000 members in 50 states , said her group was leading the charge against the nomination the group is being assisted by the christian coalition , the traditional values coalition and the family research council we cannot afford to let dr elders do to america what she did to arkansas , mrs parshall said she believes in comprehensive sexuality education beginning in kindergarten these are children , many of whom do n't know their colors and numbers yet , and she would propose violating their innocence and modesty that is tantamount to educational child abuse , she went on it has not worked in arkansas to reduce teen pregnancies , and it wo n't work on the country america needs a second opinion on the position of surgeon general avis lavelle , a public affairs official at the department of health and human services , the parent agency of the public health service , said the president would stand behind dr elders president clinton has known her for years , he knows her views , he wants her to become surgeon general , ms lavelle said , and we are prepared to do whatever is necessary to secure her nomination white house officials say that while they see no problem within the labor and human resources committee , they do expect a fight on the floor of the senate when it votes on the nomination sometime before the congressional summer recess , which begins on aug 5 but unlike ms guinier , white house officials say , dr elders enjoys strong support among conservative democrats , including senators david l boren of oklahoma and david pryor and dale bumpers , both of arkansas i guarantee you that by the time she finishes her testimony , anyone who votes against her will be labeled antichild , one white house official said she supports the things the overwhelming number of american people support to improve the lives of children it is precisely her views on that subject including her support for distributing condoms in high schools , sex education beginning at an early age and governmentfinanced abortions that have galvanized antiabortion , antifeminist and religious groups to band together to fight her nomination taking note of that opposition , donna e shalala , the secretary of health and human services , defended the nominee in a statement those who would portray dr elders as being radical or out of touch with the desires of the american people are distorting her record in an effort to prove their claims , she said dr elders supports comprehensive health training for our nation s children , but that does not mean inappropriate sex education topics for young children , as her critics suggest photo dr joycelyn elders \( associated press \)
atlanta , oct 1 the erstwhile gate city of the south , capital of the new south , city too busy to hate , black mecca and world s next great city has a problem after a year of earnest groping and with sydney , australia , already selected as host of the 2000 summer olympics , atlanta s best consultants and image meisters have yet to come up with just the right slogan to market their city before the world comes calling at the 1996 olympics here as the effort lurches along , the impression is growing that atlanta s quest for the perfect catch phrase is saying a lot more about a place that is a mixture of myth , charm , hype and hustle than the anointed slogan ever will the search began a year ago when atlanta unveiled five marketing slogans under the aegis of joel babbit , a former chiatday adman who gained national attention last year with marketing plans to sell corporate sponsorships for everything from city parks to garbage trucks they ranged from the pithy but vague atlanta unforgettable to the redwhiteandblue atlanta hometown of the american dream to the appropriately international atlanta what the world is coming to none was judged a home run later , another marketing consultant , the nucifora consulting group , was called in to tap the mood of the populace this summer , the consultants declared , not since margaret mitchell s flames swept tara has the city of atlanta invited such focus on its image from those who live here and those who do business here from across the country and around the world emphasizing that its mission was not about finding a slogan but rather defining the city in terms of its attributes and how the public perceives it , the consulting group sketched out five marketing platforms they included atlanta anything is possible and atlanta claiming its own international destiny after town hall meetings , polls of 1 , 000 influential people around the world and about 5 , 000 responses ranging from rap songs to detailed marketing plans , the consultants plan to present a broad marketing strategy and possible slogans to the atlanta convention and visitors bureau at the end of october in a city that has never been loath to reinvent itself , the process has a familiar ring the image that best sums up atlanta is the cash register , said the novelist anne rivers siddons so far , the soul of the city has been money and business you think about chicago and you think of broad shoulders i do n't think we 're old enough for this kind of identity indeed , age and circumstance do provide image problems for atlanta not founded until 1842 , atlanta made its biggest historical mark when general sherman set a torch to it 22 years later with no defining port , river or mountain , atlanta ca n't ever become a crescent city or rocky mountain high the city s most enduring imagery has to do with margaret mitchell and gone with the wind , but in a city that is almost 70 percent black , something harking back to mint juleps and hoop skirts does not have much of a constituency as the slogan search has dragged on , almost everyone has weighed in a recent letters page in the atlanta journalconstitution offered suggestions varying from cheery southern pride \( atlanta y'all come !

washington , nov 15 the discovery that five additional patients may have died in tests of a new drug for hepatitis b has prompted the food and drug administration to propose a major change in the rules for reporting side effects from drug trials the announcement today came as the agency issued the first of two reports on the latest test of the drug , which was conducted at the national institutes of health in bethesda , md this test was among the worst catastrophes in the recent history of drug testing deaths occurred in 5 out of 15 patients who took the drug for 4 weeks or more the food and drug administration has now discovered from a review of earlier tests of the drug that five other patients in the earlier experiments may have died as a result of taking the drug or its experimental predecessor overoptimism is seen the agency , which approved the latest test and reviewed data as it proceeded , said scientists could have found out that the drug would be toxic but had not collected the available information the scientists were too optimistic about the possibilities for a cure and failed to think skeptically about the data they were collecting , said dr david a kessler , the commissioner of food and drugs some of the problem was optimism , dr kessler said the data were not pulled together in one place or analyzed in a way that would lead the scientists to see the drug s danger in retrospect , the data were there there were five deaths here that demanded greater scrutiny deaths in earlier tests dr kessler said it was possible but not certain that the five deaths in the earlier tests , conducted from 1989 to 1991 , were associated with the drug fialuridine or the closely related drug fiac \( fialcytosine \) , which was used in the earliest experiments yet none of the deaths was reported by scientists or the drug companies , since in each case those conducting the experiments assumed that the death was not caused by the drug dr jay h hoofnagle , director of the division of digestive diseases and nutrition at the national institutes of health , was the chief scientist in the latest clinical trial of fialuridine , which began last march the trial ended in disaster in july , eventually resulting in the deaths of 5 patients others suffered severe side effects and 2 of the 15 were saved only by liver transplants the food and drug administration said that each time a serious adverse symptom appeared in the patients , scientists sought an explanation besides that of the drug being at fault thus , last march , when dr hoofnagle began a series of experiments in which fialuridine was used to treat people with hepatitis b , he said he did not expect to see toxic effects when they occurred , he again attributed the symptoms and even the first death to causes other than the drug , and therefore did not report the incidents to the drug agency until after the second person had died in that study phone calls unanswered telephone calls to dr hoofnagle , who also led one of the earlier experiments , were not returned today officials of the national institutes of health declined to comment on the report today hepatitis b is transmitted by blood , sexual intercourse or contaminated needles , unlike hepatitis a , which is transmitted by fecaloral means many hepatitis b patients become chronic carriers , and a small percentage go on to develop chronic liver disease leading to cancer or cirrhosis dr roger l williams , the chief author of the report , said that several factors made it difficult to see the link between the toxic effects and the drug first , the toxic effects appeared very like the effects of the patient s own disease second , the toxic effects appeared only weeks or months after the drug was administered and third , animal experiments did not show the kind of toxicity seen in humans the experimenters beginning the march study either failed to find the previous data , which showed toxic effects , or failed to draw it together in a way that would make the problem clear , or both , the report said the most important point of all , said dr kessler , is that if you are starting to give people a drug , you must be skeptical and each time you see a problem must ask if it is associated with the drug he said that currently , fda regulations require scientists and the drug companies sponsoring an experiment to report deaths and illness to the fda within 10 days only if they determine that the deaths or illnesses are linked with the drug recommendations of report today s report recommends that those doing the experiments should begin reporting all deaths , serious symptoms and instances in which patients must stop taking a drug , regardless of whether or not the scientists have decided that they are linked to the drug in addition , the scientists and the company must give an analysis of each case and all cases together , explaining why they believe they are linked or not linked to giving the drug dr kessler said he intends to put the recommendations into effect as soon as possible in the future , we need to increase the likelihood that these warning signals will be seen early , dr kessler said the drug agency s report said there were three separate studies of fialuridine and its sister drug before the one that began last march scientists at the agency reviewed the symptoms of patients in those studies , looking chiefly for liver failure or an elevation of a liver enzyme to three times its normal level , an indication that the liver was beginning to malfunction there were 79 patients all told in those three studies , and federal researchers said that 23 of them showed high levels of liver enzymes the report today emphasized that though five deaths appeared to be caused by the drug , the link had not yet been firmly established but it maintained that the researchers and companies were dutybound to seek connections between symptoms and the drugs and not to seek alternative explanations to free the drug from blame in one case , the report noted , a patient died , and the autopsy report suggested that the death might have been related to an operation the patient had or could have resulted from toxic effects of the drug , but the scientists and the company did not report the possible association under the proposed new rules , dr kessler said , scientists and companies will be required to pass along to the drug agency autopsy reports whenever they are available if scientists and drug companies had worked to put together all the reports of adverse symptoms associated with the drug , the fda report said , it could have become clear that patients who got a second series of doses of the drug had very serious problems in each of the studies for example , in a study in 1990 , three of the four who had a second administration of the drug died , and the fourth had severe symptoms of liver failure
chicago , nov 27 as larry morris , a 39yearold security guard and father of six , folded his sixfoot frame into a desk made for 14yearolds , his knees knocked against the desk rim and his back crouched stiffly in his seat next to a girl in a bugs bunny tshirt it has been 22 years since he last sat in a classroom and carried a book bag he dropped out of high school at 17 , when his girlfriend became pregnant and the streets had more pull than geometry in those 22 years , he had six sons by two wives , got hustling stints and minimumwage jobs , and was rejected for betterpaying work because he had no diploma he also grew up he decided he would never get anywhere unless he finished high school and figured that having a ged was no better than being a dropout you feel less of a person , mr morris said of life without a diploma you feel incomplete you 're reminded everyday that you ca n't get anything but mcdonald s you have to go through that disgrace so now he is a high school sophomore again , taking notes in geometry or physical science , walking the same halls where he hung out as a teenager , attending the same school as his 17yearold son jermaine , but struggling two grades behind him he goes to class before working eight hours as a night security guard mr morris and six other older dropouts long since wiped from the rolls have returned to dusable high school , an allblack school in the shadow of the notorious robert taylor housing projects , through a window built of necessity and the wisdom that comes with age after chicago decentralized its schools in 1989 and gave broad powers to parent boards at each school , the parents at dusable , where only a third of the students graduate , wondered if that meant they could go back to high school themselves and get the diplomas they regretted not earning the local school council voted unanimously last year to let parents enroll , and the program had its first four middleaged graduates in may adults who giddily , tearfully marched in their red caps and gowns with the 18yearolds in what education specialists and government officials say is the only such program they know of the parents are urban rip van winkles picking up where they left off decades ago my first day was like when i went to kindergarten , said ida gardner , a 39yearold junior and a mother of five i did n't know none of the kids as a condition of their enrollment , the parents must follow the rules like any other student they are forbidden to smoke or leave the building during school hours , must show up at homeroom and eat mystery meat at lunch like the rest of their classmates the parents are easy to spot they are the ones with the wider midriffs , huffing and puffing up the stairs while teenagers bounce past them in their plain sweaters and noname shoes , the parents stand out in other ways they ca n't afford to dress like the students , said melvin goodman , a school counselor , because many are sacrificing for their children they were these teenagers 20 years ago , sneaking a smoke in the restroom , drumming pencils on desk tops and primping and flirting at their lockers before the bell now , that is all behind them they are all business they sit rapt , front and center , right in the teacher s face , copying down assignments as if their rent check depended on it , sometimes bored because they already did next month s homework no time for foolishness i bust my butt to be here , mr morris said i do n't have no time for no foolishness the parents have endured the ridicule of some students who consider them intruders and some teachers who see them as failures one teacher told a returning parent , if you did n't get yours before , you should have stayed out there many teachers wondered how they could teach with adults in the room we thought , 'have they gone crazy \? ' said susan wills , the workstudy teacher what has dusable come to \? who are we to tell an adult anything \? ' the parents turned out to be model students when you ask for a report of a page , they do 10 pages , said jim westphal , an english teacher they can send me any parent they bring calm and wisdom to the building , teachers say , and serve as unofficial teacher s deputies , correcting wayward students , many of them friends of their children , with a roll of the eyes or merely by their presence respect for adults alex lee , a 17yearold senior behaves differently now i do n't want to be cursing and acting silly around them , said mr lee , eating pretzels in mr morris s homeroom i got respect for old people some of them are 40 , 45 years old to me , that s old the parents try hard not to play teachers' pet after all , they were hardly that the first time but it is tough not to be when you have come in from the cold after 20 years in his workstudy class , mr morris could not resist raising his hand when a student angrily recounted an hourlong wait for a job interview mr morris told the student that those things happen sometimes and that people should not let it stop them from trying then , he started talking about the times he got the runaround looking for work , and another parent in the class shook her head in agreement here they go again , a couple of students said , elbowing each other since then , the parents have learned not to say things like , i have a son your age , or , when i was a teenager

against the bosnian serbs but none embraced what senior british and french officials described as the core of the american plan the selective lifting of the united nations arms embargo so that the united states and its allies can arm the bosnian muslim government the second part of mr clinton s plan involves the use of air strikes in the period before alliedsupplied arms begin to flow to the bosnian muslim forces , the european officials said such a step would be taken only if the serbs launch new attacks , they said both the french and british governments would agree reluctantly to the use of air strikes , but in a different context to support the creation and protection of safe havens guarded on the ground by united nations forces the russians would probably go along with air strikes as well , one senior european official said 'consultation to closure' it will take some time to achieve the consensus that i believe we 're building toward tonight as we move from consultation to closure , a senior administration official traveling with mr christopher said when asked whether mr clinton could go to the american people now with his plan of action for ending the war , the official said at this point there s very little that the president can go to the american people with because we have not developed a consensus it would be premature for him to try to persuade the people of a package when the package had n't come together mr clinton said today that the decision of the selfstyled bosnian serb parliament to reject for a third time the peace plan for ending the fighting in bosnia and herzegovina simply makes the christopher mission more important , adding that secretary christopher will be insistent that the time has come for the international community to unite and to act quickly and decisively consultations by telephone the president s statement raised speculation that instead of returning to washington on friday , mr christopher would meet again with key nato allies and the russians to forge a common position instead , mr christopher told reporters that he will head home as scheduled after a brief stop in rome on friday morning and continue his consultations by telephone the secretary said that president clinton told him to continue on the track i began last saturday , to complete it with resolve and determination and to return home and talk to him and that is what i intend to do there are no different instructions , simply a confirmation of his determination that i move forward on the way that we have decided last saturday and continue now with this being the only track that is relevant at the present time , mr christopher said after meeting with chancellor helmut kohl of germany in bonn asked why mr christopher did not stay to meet the russians and the nato foreign ministers again , the senior official said , i'm a strong believer in having international meetings of that character wellprepared when asked whether such a meeting was considered , the official replied that it was not given extensive consideration a wide gap remains a number of european officials who met with mr christopher in the course of his trip said that there is such a gap between the american plan of action to stop the fighting in the balkans and what the allies are prepared to do that there is no reason for mr christopher to stay on but mr christopher did not come to europe to sell america s allies a fullfledged plan of action in announcing what he called the president s direction on bosnia , mr christopher described his goal as consulting with our partners on the direction the president believes the international community should take together mr christopher insisted that he will continue to consult with the allies to reach agreement on a tougher approach , and a senior administration official said i see this coming around i see this coming together 'direction' is negotiable as mr christopher moved from capital to capital , the goal of his mission seemed to become even more modest at one point , for example , he said that the american direction was on the table not only for discussion but also for amendment today , hikmet cetin , the foreign minister of turkey , the only nato country that has publicly called for both the lifting of the arms embargo and the use of air strikes , told reporters in brussels that limited air strikes will be needed to reach any peaceful settlement asked whether the united states agreed with mr cetin , mr christopher said only that washington was considering steps , including military steps , but i would not indicate that we have decided in favor or even recommended the kind of action the turkish foreign minister has recommended photo two muslim fighters waited at a bunker near the front line in jardol , bosnia , near a british united nations armored vehicle \( reuters \)
this year s small crop of civil court races in new york city leaves defenders of the current system of judicial elections with a lot of explaining to do they oppose changing to a nonpartisan system of selection by merit and speak highmindedly about the democracy of letting voters decide who gets to become a judge yet of 17 civil court seats in contention in november , only 7 are being contested in next tuesday s allbutdecisive democratic primary election capable judges do emerge from this sorry process , but it also elevates some real clunkers the bronx none of the candidates in the dismal countywide civil court race hold much promise but howard liker , a civil court law clerk , is preferable to lucindo suarez , an attorney rated not approved by the city bar association , or richard tolchin , a state supreme court law clerk who seems to lack the patience the job demands brooklyn the race for a countywide civil court seat in brooklyn poses an uninspiring choice between lila gold , a motor vehicles administrative law judge , and solomon handler , an administrative law judge with the state workers' compensation board with misgivings about his close ties to the brooklyn democratic party , we favor mr handler for his judicial experience manhattan second district \( lower east side \) this race has attracted two capable candidates housing court judge marcy friedman and martin shulman , an attorney specializing in real estate matters ms friedman s proven talent for presiding in a contentious courtroom and her potential for legal scholarship earns our endorsement third district \( 14th street to 65th street , west of seventh avenue \) four good candidates vie for two vacancies eugene prosnitz is an attorney with broad legal experience saralee evans , an assistant city housing commissioner , is sensitive to the problems facing poorer litigants we support marilyn shafer , a housing court judge whose fine record and judicial temperament warrant special praise , and katharine law , a civil court law clerk whose varied legal background holds great promise fourth district \( 14th street to 59th street , east of lexington avenue \) voters ca n't do wrong by selecting any of the three candidates jay litwin , a city administrative law judge sherry kleinheitler , an attorney specializing in matrimonial cases , and steven smollens , an attorney specializing in landlordtenant matters in a close call we prefer mr smollens , who has superior experience and a proven commitment to improving the legal system , especially for less affluent citizens seventh district \( north of 110th street , west of fifth avenue \) stephen gottlieb , a former state legislator and liquor authority commissioner , is a much better bet than alexander colgan , who served without distinction as a housing court judge
the president of the united states has a good deal to do this spring before he gets around to what will likely be the summer announcement of a nominee for the supreme court he may not have decided yet who will get the job , but the question of how that person will be selected should be much on his mind and guidance will surely come in the lessons of recent history from the public humiliation of the conservative ideologue jurist robert bork , to the empty questioning of david souter , to the evasions and obfuscations of clarence thomas , the president can figure out what not to do to wit no rads , no stealths , no unqualified guys with paper trails they 're prepared to disavow to snag the seat the good news is that the president need resort to none of the above looking across america , any student of the judiciary can see many qualified candidates who have been passed over during the last 12 years because they were not conservatively correct enough for the reaganbush administrations the most talked about is gov mario cuomo , whose learned monologues define the term continuing education the idea of putting mr cuomo and justice antonin scalia in a room together and having them duke it out from opposite ends of the ideological spectrum is entertaining , not because of their common socioethnic background but because of the similar rigor of their intellects if the world is full of those who do not suffer fools gladly , these two do not suffer them at all but mr cuomo would bring much more than scalia counterweight to the court he is a brilliant rhetorician precisely because he understands and can capture the sweep of history , the pith of the big picture , the promise implicit in democracy his 1984 speech on abortion at notre dame remains one of the defining statements on the necessary distinctions between personal morality and public policy , a difference that will underlie our national discourse well into the next century but mr clinton has terrific choices among the judiciary as well the most obvious is judge patricia m wald , who has served on the federal appeals court in washington since 1979 she is one of those many carter administration appointees to the bench who have grown in experience and stature as they have been passed over during republican administrations if mr clinton is inclined to make the court look more like america , that pool contains qualified candidates who are female , black , or both but the president has to make sure that he does n't make some kneejerk mistakes he ca n't be ageist mr clinton should avoid the obvious temptation , amply indulged by george bush in his selection of justice thomas , to choose a young candidate in order to influence the court for the next 40 years judge wald is 64 , which would put her in good company justices appointed after age 60 include harry blackmun , benjamin cardozo and oliver wendell holmes and mr clinton cannot be scared off by all this litmustest bluster emanating from senators who want to be saved the political consequences of the confirmation process during recent hearings , judges have been asked about a number of issues that would surface during their tenure on the high court no one screams litmus if they are questioned closely on the rules of evidence litmus is code for abortion let the president ask let the senate question let the nominee answer as the nominee sees fit judges are not ciphers we have simply gotten used to the conceit that on this single issue , they should pretend to be let the pretense end it is most unlikely that , choosing among fairly likeminded liberals , the president would choose one who does not believe in the privacy rights that are the underpinnings of roe v wade why play this foolish game \? sometime this summer the president will make the first of what may be several appointments to the court and he will do it before a nation that has witnessed a series of quite cynical confirmation processes in recent years this time , the members of the senate should have something , someone , to vote on no stealth , no subterfuge no nomination doomed to failure luckily , none of these are necessary the gene pool is impressive and mr clinton has a clear opportunity to use the ultimate litmus test experience and intellect
port st lucie , fla , feb 20 lefthanders , the fraternity of the weird they are as close to a legal cult as exists in baseball otherworldly powers are attributed to them idiosyncrasies of intrigue are ascribed to them large , often disproportionate dollars are paid to them and the mets , when they signed frank tanana , hired one of the strange sect s great mystics the lefthander has 19 years in the major leagues he has 233 triumphs on record he has nearly 4 , 000 innings in his arm and brain crazy is a favorite adjective used for us , said tanana the lefthanded material is all taken with a grin it sells well the mets are trusting that it transmits well , too the organization , anxious about the development and sophistication of 23yearold lefthander pete schourek , signed tanana to his oneyear contract at least in part because they anticipated he would earn his checks with tutorial work in the clubhouse as well as with another 180 or so innings of effort on the mound that was n't our primary reason for signing frank , but it was one of them , gerry hunsicker , the mets' vice president for baseball operations , said of the tutor role it certainly does n't hurt , and it s extremely important for a lefthander he s a great role model he s been through a lot and he s got people out a whole lot of different ways jeff torborg , now the manager of the mets , was behind the plate when tanana recorded his first major league out torborg was a catcher with the angels when tanana faced the royals in his 1973 debut he was 19 and he was precocious , the manager recalled he was a pitcher tanana was a power pitcher first surgery forced him to be an artist always , though , he has been lefthanded and always he has been willing to share with the younger , less polished , less bruised , less finished of his curious comrades these kinds of arrangements , with younger pitchers and myself , work themselves out in time , said tanana you cannot force it , and many younger pitchers simply do not want it i was guilty of that myself early on , and i almost ruined a career hey , i have been through the wars of performing i'm available and schourek says he will not be shy about seeking the counsel of the imported guru there have to date been only formal introductions and occasional glances stolen at adjacent mounds we had a toss the other day as we warmed up , said schourek he told me not to stand too far away to start out tanana at 39 it does take the 39yearold tanana a while to identify the creaks and rearrange his bones there is no doubt that he 'll eventually throw , and almost as few concerns that he and his various speeds and myriad pitches will regularly give the mets a chance to win every fifth day there s this great misconception that frank relies only on offspeed stuff , said paul gibson , another lefthander , who was a teammate of tanana s in detroit but he 'll get the fastball by people when he has to or when it counts the guy works the inside of the plate against righthanders as well as anyone , righty or lefty , in the game tanana said there s no great mystery to the essentials of pitching the basic constant is that a pitcher has to have more than one pitch he can throw for a strike when he has to , when he is in a jam , when the count is 20 i have four pitches i can do it with for younger pitchers , the single greatest obstacle might be focus the ones who have lasted , the ones who have succeeded are those who have taken their trade seriously it is a trade varying the sequences it s been a trade whose subtleties have confounded schourek he was 68 for the mets in 1992 , and he probably pitched better than the record reflects but there were countless moments of uncertainty on the mound , scenes of failed confidence in one pitch or occasionally in his entire purpose there was one excrutiatingly revealing incident at shea stadium in which schourek , while on the mound , had to engage in an extended pantomime with the dugout to settle on what the next pitch out to be situational pitching is what i have to address , said schourek i do n't want to be in a position where i have to always throw a 21 fastball i want to throw a 21 changeup and be able not to be hurt schourek believes he can have three quality pitches at his disposal the fastball , the curveball and the change he said that despite being able to throw an 88mileanhour fastball , he wants to get to the point where he is throwing 25 to 30 percent changeups the idea of learning from frank sounds easy , said schourek but i think you have to go to him with a particular question then you can let him take over the great lefthanded mystic wo n't be at a loss for secrets i have plenty of stuff , tanana said plenty inside pitch none of the mets' premier pitchers reported any significant damage after friday s first work off the mound john franco , the most closely watched patient pitcher , said he felt normal stiffness in his left forearm but nothing cataclysmic i had spent my whole career with some discomfort in my elbow , said the club s closer but i feel nothing like the burning sensation i did last year joe orsulak , the reserve outfielder who could see substantial action in the event of injury to vince coleman , worked out informally saturday for the first time with the mets the lefthanded orsulak was promptly reaquainted with the hitting instructor , tom mccraw , his mentor in baltimore he s a hitter , though he 'll never be able to shake the platoon player label , said mccraw he 'll hit 280 whether you throw righthanders or lefthanders at him and he 'll get in a streak for three or four weeks where he 'll hit everything
promise and power the life and times of robert mcnamara by deborah shapley illustrated 734 pp boston little , brown company 2995 robert s mcnamara has not exactly made things easy for his biographers mr mc namara rose within the ford motor company to become its president briefly in 1960 , but by that time he had already emerged as a sharp critic of the corporate culture that nurtured him as john f kennedy s secretary of defense , mr mcnamara developed a reputation for possessing a steely , computerlike mind that seemed to feed on and disgorge statistics and yet that same mr mcnamara was emotionally fragile , capable of breaking down in tears to his own intense embarrassment on public occasions although he quickly discovered that kennedy s 1960 campaign allegations of a missile gap had been exaggerated , he presided over a significant buildup in american nuclear weapons and delivery systems during the early 1960 s , which may well have provoked the soviet union into following suit now he claims that he regarded nuclear weapons as unusable all along , and that he so advised the presidents he served more than anyone else apart from president lyndon b johnson himself , mr mcnamara bears responsibility for the escalation , and ultimately for the failure , of the american military effort in vietnam almost alone among johnson administration officials , however , he has made no attempt , until now , to explain or defend his decisions mr mcnamara chose instead a kind of silent penance at the world bank , which he ran for 13 years as if by saving lives in the third world he could somehow compensate for the lives lost in indochina mr mcnamara has written no memoir , and apparently intends none he has been content to let the historians sort all of these issues out but as deborah shapley , a washington journalist and the coauthor of a book on american technology , comments in the most comprehensive biography of mr mcnamara to date , what this has really meant is , let the historians sort me out ms shapley has bravely undertaken this task in promise and power , and has even managed to elicit a certain amount of cooperation from mr mcnamara , who with some reluctance made himself available for interviews she has consulted mr mcnamara s family , friends and associates , few of whom have been as reluctant to talk as he himself is and she has used declassified documents to supplement her account , confronting mr mcnamara with them directly when they seemed to contradict what he had told her the result is the best study of mr mcnamara yet available , especially for what it tells us about his upbringing , his family life , his years at ford and the world bank , and his role in shaping the war in vietnam it is nonetheless an unsatisfying biography , because ms shapley herself often seems unsure what to make of her subject the difficulty she faces , as any biographer of mr mcnamara must , is to explain the contradictions that have been so striking a feature of his public life how was it possible for the same man to be both a corporate success and a corporate critic \? to be a number cruncher and a sentimentalist \? to build up , but also to abhor , america s nuclear weapons arsenal \? to be a hawk and then a dove on vietnam \? one explanation , to which ms shapley returns repeatedly throughout the book , is that mr mcnamara may simply be a liar that he habitually told those he most wanted to impress what he thought they most wanted to hear having thereby satisfied his bosses at ford , or the presidents for whom he worked , or the scholars who will ultimately determine his historical reputation , he then went on , she suggests , to believe his own falsehoods , passionately and with utter conviction ms shapley does indeed catch mr mcnamara in a number of instances in which he appears to have been less than candid examples include his flat denial to reporters that there were soviet missiles in cuba just days before kennedy announced that fact in october 1962 his failure to inform congress of difficulties in developing the tfx fighter plane and his upbeat public portrayal of the war in vietnam , when he knew it was going badly but she provides no standard against which we can judge what she calls these tactically useful fibs did mr mcnamara employ them more frequently than other public figures do \? to what extent were they really tactical , which implies deliberate intent , and to what extent did they reflect the malleability of memory , something that afflicts even those not particularly concerned with how they will be remembered \? since ms shapley so strongly emphasizes mr mcnamara s alleged habit of prevarication , she owes her readers a more thorough discussion of these issues than she provides there is another possible explanation for mr mcnamara s inconsistencies over the years , however , and although ms shapley offers considerable evidence for it , she does not fully develop it it is that , in contrast to many figures in public life , mr mcnamara may actually have learned on the job top officials usually take up their responsibilities with their positions on the issues more or less in place it is unusual for them to alter those views while in office , and even rarer for them to admit to having done so
when al leiter pitched seven shutout innings against seattle and gained the victory in the toronto blue jays' second game of the season , he officially ended a personal fouryear ordeal and struck a blow for players everywhere who are presumed to be baseball dead there may even be hope for mike witt and ted higuera i had to wait four years for my next win , since that wonderful cold evening in yankee stadium against minnesota , leiter said , recalling his last previous major league victory , april 14 , 1989 sometimes , i remember it like it was yesterday other times , it seems so long ago but i'm very happy , very happy completing his comeback from shoulder and elbow injuries , leiter pitched himself back to the major leagues this spring ken dayley , racked by arm and innerear problems for two years , joined leiter in winning a job on the blue jays' pitching staff john farrell , a nonperson in baseball the last two years after two elbow operations , is a member of the california angels' pitching rotation and was scheduled to pitch last night for the first time since sept 27 , 1990 , trying for his first victory since june 24 of that season farrell was joined on last night s list of probable starters by joe magrane of st louis , who spent two years overcoming elbow and shoulder injuries frank dipino , who pitched three shutout innings in relief for kansas city on thursday , has paralleled magrane s return after suffering an elbow injury at about the same time as his thenteammate bo jackson has received by far the most attention for his dramatic return , but these pitchers have demonstrated remarkable perseverance in resuming their careers 'i'm a positive person' i never doubted i could get back to where i could compete on the major league level , leiter said after making his first major league start since may 6 , 1989 people want to hear negative , doomsday things , but it never has happened i guess i'm a positive person not only have i learned how to pitch , but the adversity i 've gone through has made me a better person this spring i went in the underdog nobody thought of me and i came through i worked hard to earn it it s a wonderful feeling leiter , who at 27 is still young enough to have a lengthy career , pitched once after the blue jays acquired him from the yankees on april 26 , 1989 he went on the disabled list with a sore left shoulder may 11 and remained there the rest of the season , undergoing arthroscopic surgery sept 6 he spent the 1990 season rehabilitating his shoulder and appeared to be ready to resume fulltime pitching in 1991 , but his elbow flared up early in the season and he wound up back on the disabled list for the season april 22 recovered again , leiter started 27 games for syracuse of the international league last year , then made one relief appearance with the blue jays on oct 4 four years of valuable pitching time squandered , four years of his youth wasted i never felt that way , he said when asked if he ever considered quitting out of frustration i got to the big leagues when i was young , and being lefthanded with the stuff i have , i felt i could still make it my brother mark was another example for me , seeing a guy who was worse off , playing semipro ball i asked bob quinn to give him a tryout and the rest is history i knew that side of it mark leiter s pitching career appeared to be over after three shoulder operations in a 17month period and three years out of professional baseball but the yankees signed him to a minor league contract for the 1989 season he began to salvage his career \( he has recorded 17 victories for detroit the last two seasons \) just as his younger brother was seeing his plunge into jeopardy the lowest point for me probably was going on those stupid rehab assignments in florida in 1991 , al reiter said my wife and i went down for rehab and it turned out to be two months for newlyweds to be living in a little motel for two months , me not being able to throw well , that was a tough time piniella gets to watch no more rehab now , no more little motels in small florida towns having won the fifth spot in the blue jays' rotation , leiter moved up and started the second game after dave stewart went down with an arm injury with lou piniella , his first major league manager , working in the other dugout , leiter retired the first 13 mariners , then allowed only two singles in seven innings i really was n't nervous , leiter said my arm felt great i did n't think any negative or scary thoughts , like how am i going to get them out asked what the game did for him , leiter said what it does is boost my legitimacy , showing your teammates and the manager and general manager , whoever else is instrumental with this ball club , that this guy is for real now two others are still struggling the milwaukee brewers signed ted higuera to a fouryear , 13 million contract dec 5 , 1990 four weeks later , the yankees signed mike witt to a threeyear , 8 million contract in the two years since , higuera has pitched in seven games for the brewers , witt two games for the yankees
choosing outdoor house paint has always been challenging , especially since airpollution laws have become stricter as a result , manufacturers are reformulating products , causing some , specifically oil or alkydbased varieties , to have different qualities most paint today is latex based the term refers to the chemicals in the binders , which make up the film that forms when the paint dries the best latexbased paint contains 100 percent acrylic binders , which adhere more strongly than other types and also bond to a wider range of surfaces next is paint with vinylacrylic binders , followed by paint with binders of vinyl terpolymer in all latex paint , water is used as thinner to maintain the correct consistency for application as the water evaporates , the paint dries oil and alkydbased paints use as binders vegetable oil like linseed oil , or alkyd resins , which are synthetic because neither paint is dissolved by water , mineral spirits are used as thinner for practical purposes , the terms oil and alkyd are interchangeable paint containing solely oil as a binder is virtually nonexistent most varieties contain just alkyds , or else a blend of the two because of its water content and the composition of its binders , latex paint emits few of the hazardous fumes called volatile organic compounds that new pollution laws limit as a result , most manufacturers have done little reformulating of latex paint highquality latex paint continues to be a better choice than alkyd paint for painting house exteriors its assets include durability , ease of application and cleanup and faster drying time latex paint also resists bleaching and fading better , has less odor and has better resistance to mildew alkyd paint , on the other hand , contains chemicals that emit volatile compounds , heretofore in large amounts conventional alkyd paint has traditionally been admired for its hardness , sheen and smooth application on rough surfaces newer varieties , reformulated to comply with new regulations , are softer and less shiny but they also tend to fade and chalk more readily as they age , because they contain fewer solvents and more solids , and their thickness makes them less easy to apply the newer alkyds are generally a better choice than latex on heavily chalked surfaces that do not respond to cleaning , on surfaces to which three or more coats of alkyd paint already adhere and when temperatures are below 60 degrees or above 85 , the optimum conditions for applying latex because of their flexibility , the newer alkyds are less brittle and therefore less prone to cracking and peeling than the older variety newer alkyd paint also has less odor and is less of a fire hazard to estimate how much paint is needed measure the rectangular areas to be painted by multiplying their widths by their heights and measure the triangular areas by multiplying their heights by half their widths add the figures together and show your answer in square feet next , measure the areas of any features that will not be painted add them together and subtract that sum from the total divide the answer by the spread rate on the paintcan label , which is the approximate number of square feet a gallon will cover the result is the estimated number of gallons needed to apply one coat of paint to the area calculated the best results with latex and alkyd paint depend on proper surface preparation , and that may require applying primer and sealer primer promotes adhesion of new paint sealer keeps paint from being unevenly absorbed primersealers contain both ingredients primersealer is usually not needed when repainting previously painted wood surfaces that are in good condition but wash such surfaces free of dirt and chalked paint , preferably with a rented power washer , before repainting sand shiny areas lightly , so that the new paint will grip better primersealer is required on painted wood surfaces in poor condition and to cover places where bare wood is exposed it is also required on unpainted new wood latex or oilbased primersealer can be used under latex paint use oilbased primersealer beneath alkyd paint and for severely chalked surfaces that cannot be thoroughly cleaned for wood that stains easily , notably cedar and redwood , use a waterbased acrylic primersealer , regardless of the paint type to cover individual stains like those from nails or knots use primersealer containing shellac before repainting masonry , wash and scrub the surface thoroughly to remove loose particles if that exposes masonry , apply masonry sealer or waterbased acrylic primersealer otherwise , none is required to prepare new masonry , apply either product aluminum and vinyl siding can be painted with acrylic latex paint without using primer surfaces have to be thoroughly cleaned , and aluminum siding has to sanded when selecting paint for aluminum siding , choose a flat variety , to avoid highlighting dents never sand vinyl siding or scrub it with a wire brush , because that can damage the surface choose a color that is the same or lighter than the existing one a darker color can allow siding to absorb too much heat , causing it to warp galvanized metal like that of gutters and downspouts need not receive primer , either , unless rust is visible or extra protection from rusting is desired in such cases , clean the metal by washing it and then wiping it with mineral spirits treat rust damage if there is any and apply two coats of a rustinhibiting primer diagrams latex and oil paints use similar pigments but have different binders and thinner to estimate amount of paint needed for one coat , total the surface area and subtract areas not to be painted divide answer by spread rate printed on the can \( edward

thanks to operas by massenet and puccini , films and even the original tale , the world is hardly unfamiliar with manon , the virginal heroine turned courtesan of abbe prevost s 18thcentury french novel in 1974 , sir kenneth macmillan took the same sordid story of love , lust and greed and choreographed an unexpectedly grand ballet a spectacular threeact costume drama that roamed with panoramic scope over a decadent era in amazingly minute detail and also zoomed in on the amorality of its principal characters now macmillan s ingenious version , created in england for the royal ballet , has come up a winner with american ballet theater the company premiere on friday night at the metropolitan opera house was led passionately by alessandra ferri , julio bocca and gil boggs two other excellent and very different casts followed amanda mckerrow , robert hill and keith roberts were the principals on saturday afternoon cynthia harvey , guillaume graffin and robert wallace on saturday night the big surprise of this first american staging of manon is how wonderfully the entire company throws itself into the acting this is the kind of ensemble spirit that a great theatrical repertory troupe could be expected to produce , and not , in all frankness , american dancers whose experience has stressed dance over drama credit for this superb staging , which was planned before macmillan s death in october , must obviously go to the two british regisseurs , monica parker and patricia ruanne but there is also a lesson here given the chance , ballet theater s dancers can plunge into classical dramatic ballets with the kind of gusto that the royal itself showed at the met in manon in 1991 , not to speak of its memorable first cast in 1974 the truth is that the principals at ballet theater , for all their high points , have yet to settle into every aspect of their roles the first performance got off to a slow start , partly because the selections from massenet s music , none of which comes from his opera manon , sounded unusually thin the beauty of macmillan s production , nonetheless , is that it allows for highly individualized intepretations , and the cameos of the supporting players are already perfect when the schoolgirl manon abandons her lover , the student des grieux , because her pimping brother , lescaut , makes her the mistress of monsieur g m , that aristocrat is portrayed marvelously in two separate ways michael owen , on friday and saturday nights , made him an impressive tightlipped tyrant , used to getting his way victor barbee , at the saturday matinee , made him even more dramatic a younger , more sexual , smirking cynic martine van hamel made her merry madam in an upperclass bordello hilariously exuberant , while georgina parkinson was equally persuasive in her brisk efficiency as for ballet theater s men , they look terrific in their 18thcentury wigs and costumes , acting up a storm as fops , gallants and villains the ballet s crucial second act features a sinister dance as manon is passed in the air , like a package of goods , from one man to another until she settles at her protector s feet miss harvey , who had started out as a freshfaced ingenue , made clear that she liked her new life as she came to rest at mr owen s feet miss ferri had made clear from the start that she wanted it all both the purity of love with des grieux , and the pleasure and wealth of her prostitution yet for all their formidable dancing , miss ferri s brazen and aggressive manon and mr bocca s melodramatic des grieux did not catch the human vulnerability that miss mckerrow and mr hill showed in their lyricism and quiet passion mr graffin , who could not handle the partnering of macmillan s first duet \( there are four major pas de deux to chart the lovers' emotional development \) , improved as the performance wore on , and his anguish , opposite miss harvey s volatile manon , was eventually convincing there is no reason to choose among these three casts each stressed strong points that the others did not have , and all their interpretations were valid as lescaut , however , mr boggs and mr roberts did not dance as well as mr wallace , the only one to capture the shape of the choreography in the sensational drunken solo of act ii this is a performance not to be missed still under the weather , lescaut then has a tipsy duet with his mistress in which all the partnering is deliberately askew kathleen moore s goodhumored wench on friday was the best technically , but christina fagundes on saturday

the opening moments of the protecting veil , a 45minute work for solo cello and string orchestra by the english composer john tavener , are hauntingly simple with awesome majesty , as the score puts it , the cello plays sustained notes in f major , circling around the fourth tone of the scale the line has a modal , medieval feeling it does n't go anywhere or resolve anything it seems to float in melodic space when parts of the melody are heard later , they carry none of the dramatic weight that much of western music associates with returning themes mr tavener , like his eastern european colleagues arvo part and henryk gorecki , is after something quite different an experience of timelessness and devotion rather than contrast and evolution the protecting veil , which was given its new york premiere recently by the cellist steven isserlis and the new england conservatory orchestra conducted by michael tilson thomas , is unevenly successful in creating that experience but its iconlike simplicity , along with its programmatic evocation of the life of the virgin mary , has helped make this piece an enormous success in a recording on \( yes \) the virgin label mr tavener s works , like those of his eastern european counterparts , try to strip away western music s accouterments of harmony and development , aiming for a premodern spirituality in the process , they are also redefining our experience of melody nothing in mr tavener s opening theme follows any of the manners of melody that have evolved in the classical repertory the fourbar phrases , the conversational point and counterpoint , the motion cresting in a peak of tension , the descending lines melting into resolution for most of recent history , listeners in the west have had a conception of melody based on those characteristics much is excluded melody is not usually associated with plainchant or madrigals \( however melodious the sounds may be \) it is also not associated with sacred music of the renaissance listeners would probably begin to find familiar examples of melody only with the baroque period even then , there are restrictions melody is not , for example , heard in the ornamented , almost painfully eloquent line in the second movement of bach s italian concerto that line may be songful in the best italian style , and its melismatic character is surely melodic but it is not a melody it is continuously spinning , seeming to have no boundaries melody is also not generally identified with beethoven s major compositions many of his works are based on very brief motifs and fragments \( think of the fifth symphony \) they have little meaning or appeal on their own they are given sense by the structure and context built around them melodies , on the other hand , have autonomy they can stand on their own \( like the ode to joy theme of beethoven s ninth \) they are not fragments of some larger whole , but they are still compact and when split apart from their compositions , they can be comfortably heard in an elevator , an ad jingle , a movie score or even , in quotation , in other works a melody can be catchy this kind of melody , so closely associated with the development of tonality , was described by arnold schoenberg \( who produced melodies , though few that are commonly recognized as melodic \) a melody , he wrote , can be compared to an 'apercu , ' an 'aphorism , ' in its rapid advance from problem to solution a melody , in this view , is a miniature composition it says something complete yet is so condensed that it possesses the musical equivalent of wit its completeness gives a great melody compelling power if it is left unfinished , the ear knows that something is missing this type of melody creates an internal world of tension and resolution melody becomes a microcosm of a composition melodic styles vary widely , of course , but this esthetic seems fundamental to the mainstream repertory of contemporary musical life the same notion of melody is present in much popular music as well so dominant has this approach become , in fact , that listeners now treat melody as the end of music rather than a means melody has become so important partly because it is associated with the listener s own private voice the melody s turns and twists become expressions of mental and emotional life , a source of identification its sojourn through a composition becomes the listener s adventure as well melody can be classically balanced \( schubert s trout theme \) , or it can evoke all the nuances of desire \( as in the song full moon and empty arms , whose title accurately interprets rachmaninoff s melody \) melody turns compositions into concertos for solo listener the comforts of melody still dominate concert life but as every melodophile now knows , music began to change its goals early in this century , often abolishing melody even popular music has recently made melody secondary and tonal melody in new music can have an almost nostalgic character \( as in the works of john corigliano or david del tredici \) the religious minimalists have been taking another approach they do not treat the listener as an isolated being so they reject traditional western melody , returning to its chanting origins their melody seems to give voice to a worshiping community , not the individual listener this may be part of a transformation in the chronically uneasy relationship between new music and its listening public we may , in time , stop listening to music to hear a song of ourselves
bradley brookshire harpsichordist mannes college of music a listener had to admire bradley brookshire s stamina and sense of responsibility on sunday afternoon as a faculty recital project , the harpsichordist planned to play the second book of bach s welltempered clavier in two concerts , the first on sunday , the conclusion on may 9 but because of a mixup , two starting times were announced for the first concert audiences turned up at each published time , so with just a short break after his 2 30 pm performance , mr brookshire played the concert again at 4 o'clock mr brookshire , whose playing is secure and reasoned , seemed none the worse for wear in the second recital his playing had the directness and clarity of purpose necessary for bach s keyboard music and although his instrument , a 1991 singlemanual harpsichord by tyre and gaudzwaard , allowed for only a modest coloristic range , he made much of the generic and formal differences among the preludes thus , his account of the dminor prelude was pressurized , ominous and dramatic the fmajor prelude had an almost pastoral elegance , and the dmajor prelude had a martial brightness in the fugues there were times when the filigree overran the more interesting thematic development , but for the most part mr brookshire s textures were suitably transparent his interpretive touches included judicious ornamentation , occasional rolled chords and a mild rhythmic loosening in sequential passages even if one did not fully accept all of his conclusions , it was clear that he had pondered these pieces carefully ex umbris christ and st stephen s church the five young musicians who make up ex umbris , a new medieval ensemble devoted to medieval and renaissance music , come to their work with a breadth of experience reminiscent of the homespun eclecticism that enlivened the earlyinstrument movement in the 1950 s and 60 s their program biographies mention country and gospel performances , music theater , avantgarde works , gamelan music and jazz most also served apprenticeships in established renaissance ensembles , and perhaps the group s name , which means out of the shadows , is partly a declaration of independence like most ensembles devoted to this repertory , ex umbris is a band of polyinstrumentalists except for karen clark young , a mezzosoprano , each of the musicians was responsible for an arsenal of blown , plucked and struck instruments , and on sunday evening they played and sang with flair and flexibility they also showed a welcome sense of drama in their arrangements , particularly in spirited works by juan del encina and joan ambrosio dalza granted , their sudden changes of coloration within a work from a string and wind accompaniment to an a cappella choral texture , for example might not be the last word in musicologically sanctioned period practice but it worked splendidly in the here and now the ensemble s program was a tour of francoflemish , italian and spanish music composed mostly at the turn of the 16th century the notable exceptions were lively , stylish basse danses contributed to the french section by grant herreid and karen hansen , members of the ensemble there were a few jarring moments sacred and profane works nestled together awkwardly and surely the musicians could have found a better example of josquin s art than victime pascali , his setting of a glancingly antisemitic latin text philadelphia orchestra carnegie hall long before the philadelphia orchestra took the stage on tuesday evening , clouds of doom had gathered around its program the announced soloist , murray perahia , is reportedly having hand problems and withdrew and for reasons that the orchestra s officials say they cannot fathom , its management is at odds with riccardo muti , the philadelphia s former music director and now its laureate conductor , who was scheduled to lead the concert until he canceled two weeks ago in march , not long after the orchestra s management noticed that mr muti had booked a tour with the vienna philharmonic that conflicted with his philadelphia dates next fall , mr muti withdrew from all his philadelphia performances in the 199394 season his manager said that there was nothing amiss and that he would turn up for the current run of concerts the next the orchestra heard was that the 51yearold conductor s physician had ordered him to cancel his engagements for a few weeks , including both the philadelphia concerts and performances at his home base , la scala the centerpiece of the program at carnegie hall was luciano berio s epiphanies , and mr berio , who also conducts , was therefore a logical replacement for mr muti mr perahia , who was to have performed the brahms concerto no 2 , was replaced by garrick ohlsson , who played beethoven s emperor concerto instead and at the last minute , the orchestra added mahler s ich bin der welt abhanden gekommen to the program , as a tribute to marian anderson , who was born and made her early career in philadelphia and who died on april 8 charlotte hellekant gave the song a tender , graceful reading
hoboken , nj kenny and moose are no longer invisible on the streets of hoboken , which is not to say they have become celebrities but it was n't so long ago that residents stared right through them those days are gone now , like slides on a microscope , they have come into sharp focus from a distance , it s their bright orange jumpsuits up close , it s the message printed across their backs comments \? 4202230 kenny , whose real name is charlie klotz , and moose , whose paychecks say bill phillips , are street sweepers for the department of public works as part of a 16member crew , they spend their weekdays from 8 am to 1 pm looking down and picking up until midaugust , they went about their business attired in whatever they had at home jeans and old shirts thus casually turned out and with only their battered carts for identification , they were as anonymous as air to mothers with strollers , commuters rushing to the path tubes or shoppers on washington street , the city s broadway what was visible was trash and litter citizens did n't like it , and city officials responded they ordered uniforms the mayor wanted the taxpayers to be able to see that the workers were out there doing what they were supposed to be doing , said timothy calligy , the public works director since then the people have seen them out in the neighborhoods on a daily basis in case of complaints , we can send them to another place , like a swat team but it s not complaints he is hearing , mr calligy said almost instantly , callers responded with compliments the first one , he said , came in within an hour after the jumpsuits hit the streets this is the first time in four years i can say i walked washington street and it was a pleasure , said the first caller , an unidentified man whose praise was recorded on tape obviously , mayor russo is responsible now , this being hudson county , a place where politicians will do almost anything to get ahead , even cynical city hall veterans wondered aloud about this spontaneous outpouring of congratulations we asked each other , 'is that your father who called in \? ' mr calligy said with a laugh so far , though , the response seems to be genuine about two dozen calls the first week and two or three a week since then but the question must be asked do clothes make the man \? is this governmental eyewash \? or is hoboken , once dirty , now miraculously clean \? the answer , said anthony russo , who took office as mayor on july 1 , is a little of each during the campaign it was one of the issues , he said we were n't getting proper productivity out of the work force really , it was not good all over the main thoroughfare , washington street , was extremely dirty what changed , he said , were two things the sweepers and other crews have been deployed more efficiently , resulting in what the mayor called a larger degree of concentration , neighborhood by neighborhood before it was kind of vague , who was sweeping where , he said and we had to be more visible it s true , there is a psychological effect , and it s significant success like this suggests wider application think of the possibilities embossed flak vests for the police , stenciled slickers for the fire department , straw skimmers with lettered hatbands for the mayor and council but why stop there \? gov jim florio and his rival , christine todd whitman , could wear red , white and blue tshirts with 800 numbers on the back and how about the white house press corps , the second circuit court of appeals , or the mets \? perhaps , though , this could work only in hoboken , a city famous for its milesquare intimacy and sense of place imagine a sanitation phone line in new york the first hour s worth of calls would rival dialogue in a oneact by david mamet the sweepers themselves tend not to be outspoken on the subject , and none made outright complaints that the city had somehow unfairly singled them out from the 80 other department employees , who continue to wear the standard dark blue slacks and shirts in fact , mr calligy said , one sweeper was so taken with his new uniform that he came in early one day and gentrified his trash can with silver spray paint inevitably , though , there were a few goodnatured gibes , from those who said the sweepers resembled bumblebees or pumpkins it s really funny , moose said some people say we look like prisoners but , kenny said , they told us we do good work , that we 're hustling more that seems to be the overall impression those suits are so loud , but you do notice a difference , said rose sciarra , running an errand on garden street you know they 're there to clean it s nice no complaints photo in a bid to clean up the image of street sweepers in hoboken , nj , and give them higher visibility among the residents , city leaders have outfitted the crews with new , bright orange jumpsuits \( william e sauro the new york times \)
it s not like the yankees were ordering those playoff tickets touting a new yorkchicago american league championship series but they might have been stretching the truth if they said that the chicago white sox visit to the bronx this week did n't have more than thoughts of sugar plum fairies dancing in yankee heads after all , the white sox are starting to look as if they 're about to make the division race in the al west a nonissue and the yankees , though certainly not a shoein in the east , are the closest challenger to the firstplace toronto blue jays so who could blame either the white sox or the yankees at the start of a threegame series if they wondered about the whatifs \? the white sox certainly made no attempt to hide their delight in winning the first two games of the series after all , the yankees had won seven of their previous nine meetings a sweep would have been even sweeter for chicago and conversely , one would assume , even more alarming for the yankees so there was a fair amount of determination on the yankees' side , to be sure , not to surrender too much in the way of bragging rights sure , the yankees were trying very hard to keep perspective there s no doubt you look at them as a potential team to play , don mattingly said before the final game but really , i do n't think we necessarily need to prove points we need to win games still , that did n't mean the focus was n't twofold and that did n't mean the yankees did n't manage to plant one last seed when they proceeded to deny chicago a sweep by winning thoroughly , 71 , at yankee stadium last night it is why the loss of the series probably hurt the yankees less than it would have hurt chicago in the psychological sense after all , as jimmy key , the winning pitcher , said we 've proven to chicago that we can beat them , if we face them in the playoffs we 've played very well against those guys not to say that they do n't have a good team , because they do but really , we just needed to win the game we had this thing going the wrong way we 're at home and we need to win home games when we have a chance of course , every time key takes the mound , the yankees have to think they have a chance the very fact that the pitcher who is 165 over all is also now 93 in 17 starts following yankee losses shows the settling effect he can have on a team in a pennant race and the yankees needed settling last night to some degree for even they had noticed a certain amount of anxiety settling in the team that had departed from cleveland on sunday in a flatfooted tie with toronto started action last night two and a half games out four losses in five games will do that sort of thing combine that with a sudden hot streak by the blue jays \( four straight \) , and the yankees found themselves trying to calm the waters as well as avoid a sweep mattingly offered this advice to anyone who was interested before the game do n't panic what is happening is what the yankees expected all along a fight of immense proportions i do n't think anybody here should expect toronto to lose a couple games and go into a monster skid , mattingly said you do n't expect that of the bulls or any championship team , that they would just fall over it would be nice to be 8 or 10 up , but that s just not the way it is and not the way it s going to be still , mattingly pointed out even before play that the yankees remain in the best position of any secondplace club in baseball by game s end it was even better , as the yankees pulled to within two games of the idle blue jays any time the yankees fall out of a tie or even seem on the verge of losing sight of the jays , anxiety is bound to set in and when toronto manages to build a lead larger than any it had enjoyed since aug 3 , klaxons are all but sounded then the yankees have to fend off the temptation to look at toronto s track record , its championships and its tenacity and become unnerved yankees shortstop mike gallego did n't miss a beat when reminded that toronto players have made decent livings in recent seasons living on the edge in september yeah , they can say they 've been there and did it once before and they 've got the experience , gallego said and that s great i'm glad for what they 've done they should be proud of that but this is a new year and i know for a fact that it does not matter what i did last year or what we did last year what matters is what happens this year , so it s still anybody s game the yankees believe that all the more not only because they trail by 2 and have 27 games left they believe that because they also have three games left with the blue jays in three weeks , games in which they see their future being decided by none other than themselves i do n't look at them as invincible , by any means , mattingly said of the blue jays i do look at them with respect , knowing who they are and what they did last year you know they have a championship mentality over there so all that means is we know that we just have to play good , keep the pace keep winning that s all we expect of ourselves , to win every day and not so much worry about them

' but before she could call his pager , she received a call from one of mr johnson s friends , who had left the group of men earlier that night he told her that mr johnson and a friend who had grown up with him in brownsville , lorenzo franklin , 33 , were dead 'just wanted to be safe' a 32caliber revolver was found on mr johnson s body , unfired , the police said but ms sanders said many neighbors carry guns to protect themselves , even if they do not expect to use them he was not in any trouble , she said he just wanted to be safe less than 10 minutes after mr johnson and mr franklin were shot , kelvin purvis , a daytime security guard at kennedy international airport , was approached by the gunman as he was returning to his car from a bodega at st marks place and ralph avenue the man asked for money , the police said , and grew angry with the amount mr purvis offered he fired once , striking mr purvis in the neck when his victim lay still , the gunman walked away and mr purvis survived the owner of the building where mr purvis lives on essex street in crown heights said he was first shocked , then deeply saddened when he learned of the shooting the next day 'did not carry a gun' let me tell you one thing , said the owner , who insisted on anonymity this was not the kind of a man who did drugs he did not carry a gun you just do n't find too many people like him the way the city is these days how could somebody do this \? the shootings began in the early hours of aug 12 on president street in crown heights , where the gunman knocked once on the door of a basement apartment and then entered , the police said he shot floyd moore , 34 , who owned a floorcleaning business , and his companion , tina haynes , 31 , several times each mr moore died in the hallway of the apartment and ms haynes was taken to kingsbrook jewish medical center by a rabbi who heard the shots she is in critical condition at the hospital the police said yesterday that they did not have a suspect and were still seeking witnesses photos arkebba kelley , 9 , resting her head in the lap of her sister tamesha , 17 their father , tony gray , 40 , an unarmed security guard at a fourstory apartment building on st marks place nearby , was killed with the same gun that had taken the lives of three other people in crown heights and brownsville michael john , who was barbecuing across the street from a bodega at 104 ralph avenue in brooklyn , was shot in the leg by a 9millimeter automatic pistol mr john must use a cane as a result of his injury \( photographs by ed quinn for the new york times \)
in an attempt to make peace with a rebellious , corruptionplagued bronx school district , schools chancellor ramon c cortines yesterday reinstated 10 school administrators who had been removed from office in may by his predecessor , joseph a fernandez mr cortines said in an interview that his aim was to restore academic stability to a district characterized in a scathing report last spring as a patronage mill , in which school jobs were up for sale and relatives and friends were rewarded while no charges were filed against the 10 administrators nine principals and an assistant principal mr fernandez dismissed them because of accusations that the district s entire hiring process was corrupt in explaining his decision to countermand the dismissals , mr cortines said i want to bring a different focus to the new york city school system i want everyone in this system to focus on instruction , and that s why i took this decision protest from chief investigator the action brought an immediate protest from the special commissioner of investigation for the new york city school district , edward f stancik , who led the investigation of district 12 he warned mr cortines by phone and letter that the reinstatement would encourage new corruption , undercut the district s new reformminded superintendent and invite only cynicism , not respect for education but within the district , which includes 22 schools in the morris park and east tremont sections , there was praise for mr cortines i'm glad its over and i'm grateful to mr cortines , said ana i amaez , principal at ps 6 at 1000 east tremont , one of those reinstated mr cortines s decision was one of the most ticklish that he has made since his appointment six weeks ago , and in the letter he sent to the district 12 board explaining it he adopted a conciliatory stance that contrasted dramatically with the tough , confrontational approach often used by mr fernandez in community school districts plagued by graft later in the day , however , apparently stung by mr stancik s complaints , mr cortines faxed a second letter to district 12 in which he voiced an anticorruption message that was considerably harsher in tone than the first mr fernandez ordered the dismissals in june , one week before he left office after his ouster in a showdown with the city s board of education over curriculum and other issues none of the 10 supervisors were ever removed from their schools because before the dismissals were to take effect on june 30 a court injunction halted mr fernandez s order the former deputy chancellor under mr fernandez , stanley s litow , said yesterday that mr cortines s reinstatement of the administrators saddens me district 12 s superintendent , robert henry , whom mr fernandez appointed in may to clean up the district but who has faced mounting opposition from the local school board , said he would abide by the chancellor s decision i just have to fall in line and move forward , he said there is n't much i can say or do to affect this i respect the chancellor s sense of wanting to get back to the processes of education , and if this was one of the ways that he sees of doing that , i have to accept it turbulent recent history the district has a turbulent recent history the former superintendent , alfredo mathew , committed suicide in january amid an investigation into his business dealings , and mr stancik s investigators this year filmed a wouldbe principal paying 2 , 000 to a former schoolboard member who had promised her an appointment under the complicated structure of new york city schools , elementary and junior high schools are governed by 32 community school boards the schools chancellor oversees these districts in the hiring of teachers and other matters , but the hiring of superintendents and administrators is the responsibility of local boards mr fernandez stepped in to install mr henry , however , during an emergency takeover of the district after the investigative report was published in the 120page report , power , politics and patronage education in community school district 12 , released in april , mr stancik documented widespread abuses in the hiring of administrators in district 12 in response , mr fernandez removed the 10 supervisors on june 24 almost immediately , the principals' union sued the board of education to overturn mr fernandez s dismissals , arguing that he had overstepped his powers justice philip modesto of the bronx supreme court issued a restraining injunction that allowed the 10 supervisors to keep their posts pending the outcome of the case union to withdraw suit bruce bryant , a lawyer for the principals' union , said that as a result of mr cortines s order yesterday , the union would withdraw its suit these schools have principals who were removed in june and reinstated yesterday ps 6 , at 1000 east tremont avenue ps 44 , at 1825 prospect avenue ps 50 , at 1550 vyse avenue ps 61 , at 1550 crotona park

rosemont , ill , march 19 you could find todd bozeman seven years ago as a key player for rhode island or five years ago in crystal city , va , just outside the nation s capital , delivering federal express packages or four years ago at courtside as an assistant coach at tulane or over the past three years as an assistant at california saturday at the rosemont horizon , when california \( 208 \) takes on duke \( 247 \) in the second round of the midwest region of the national collegiate athletic association tournament , you will find bozeman calling the shots for the golden bears he has become head coach , mentor , friend , confidant and savior to his players and , by any account , one of the most unsual stories in the tournament for much of bozeman s ripe 29 years , plenty that he has touched has turned to gold debt to the pioneers i get on these guys pretty tough , bozeman said but they know i am criticizing their game and not them as people they know that i care they understand that i'm coming from the heart i am a product of the civil rights movement there are many who have died that made this opportunity possible i'm the product of the guys like big house gaines , will robinson , ed martin , john chaney , guys who toiled long and hard for opportunities to coach and waged wars on stereotypes and racism that opened doors for black coaches none of this is lost on me i thank god every day critics think of bozeman as something else disloyal and an extreme opportunist he has heard the rumors , how he campaigned for lou campanelli s dismisal as california s coach on feb 8 , how he encouraged the players to push for campanelli s ouster he heard of the plans of the nation s most powerful college coaches to lead a boycott of the california job and how , if he were loyal to campanelli , that he should have resigned i was loyal i busted my tail for coach campanelli , bozeman said i was in no position to resign i have a wife and a 10monthold son and responsibility i always talked to coach campanelli about any problems with the team from the first day i came we tried to find solutions together after the arizona loss , his last game , it was coach campanelli that encouraged the players to have a meeting among themselves they did and went to the administrators and the school had already made its decision the decision was to dismiss campanelli and what his players called a boorish , attacking and negative coaching style and name bozeman interim coach this week , he was named the permanent coach he is 101 since taking over , including a thrilling 6664 victory over louisiana state in the opening round here thursday night it was bozeman , during a timeout with 22 seconds left , who called for the play that resulted in guard jason kidd s winning basket with only one second left 'everything is different' regarded as a superb recruiter , bozeman has shown he is much more california has now won seven straight games and bozeman is 50 in games decided by 5 or fewer points the team was 05 this season in such games before he became coach and was 29 in its last 11 such games you watch him and it is obvious that coach bozeman knows the x s and o s of basketball , but his contribution goes beyond that , kidd said he was one of the primary reasons i went to cal , and both me and my parents believed in him i think coach campanelli cared about us and was a familyoriented coach but there was a big gap in his feelings and in his communication plus , he wanted to play basketball in a style that almost brought the game to a halt with a young team that wanted to run , it was friction and an impossible situation now everything is different coach bozeman eats with us and it s like he s one of the players he plays on the scout team and the games get rough he is in control and he has our respect on every level started at bottom bozeman grew up in forrestville , md , and after graduating from rhode island was a parttime assistant coach for his old high school while working as a deliveryman he saw how he could speak the players' language , how much fun the job was , and quickly decided that coaching would be his profession his goal was to be a head coach by the age of 30 he does not reach 30 until dec 5 when mike krzyzewski , now the duke coach , was 29 , he was in his second season as army coach he has coached in 569 ncaa games bozeman has coached in 11 krzyzewski has won 34 tournament games bozeman has won 1

washington , sept 2 formally ending decades of cold war rivalry in space , the united states and russia agreed today to merge the hearts of their manned space programs , embarking on a joint effort to design and construct an international space station in a separate agreement signed today by vice president al gore and prime minister victor s chernomyrdin , russia also agreed to place export controls on missile technology , a step the administration had set as a condition to cooperation in space russia also gained access to the lucrative international market for launching commercial satellites and texaco is to get 28 million in loan guarantees from washington to help restore production from 150 dormant oil wells in siberia page d1 some hurdles foreseen the plan announced today marks a dramatic reshaping of the nineyear , 9 billion united states effort to build a space station the joint station is expected to cost less and reach orbit faster than the current design but it could face domestic and foreign hurdles , and experts have raised questions about the russians' ability to fulfill their part of the deal today s agreements were widely seen as a watershed in the history of the united states space program , which was born a third of a century ago amid fierce eastwest rivalries after the russians launched sputnik 1 in 1957 we started a new era today , nasa s administrator , daniel s goldin , said in an interview we closed the books on the cold war this event is symbolic and very meaningful it s going to catalyze lots of action between our two countries details of the plan are to be worked out in a twomonth study by nasa officials and their russian counterparts but the broad outline calls for first sending american astronauts to use the existing russian space station , mir , then combining russian and american components in a joint station in 1997 the united states will pay russia 400 million over the next four years for the use of mir and other services missile sales a threat the potential deal was nearly scuttled by a yearlong dispute between washington and moscow over the proposed sale of russian rocket technology to india the united states said the sale violated the missile technology control regime and said cooperative efforts in space would be halted unless russia canceled the deal , which moscow did in july we could n't go forward in a number of areas of cooperation with the russians so long as we had the problem of the indian deal , said a state department official the agreement reached today stems in large part from the problems both national programs have faced in recent years russia is short of money for everything , and the proposed united states space station , freedom , has faced mounting congressional opposition as its budget has risen and its planned deployment has been frequently delayed this spring , president clinton decided to keep the space station alive but to scale it back and to seek russian cooperation in its design we will continue to work from the baseline space station model , said an administration official involved in the planning there may be changes in the configuration there may be some pieces of additional hardware that will bought from the russians a different orbit the joint station would fly in an orbit more highly inclined to the earth s equator than the one nasa planned for its space station for reasons of orbital geometry , a joint station would have to operate in such an orbit to make it reachable by both american shuttles and russian rockets nasa is already designing new solidfuel booster rockets for the shuttle and is contemplating a new lightweight external fuel tank to increase the shuttle s lift the planners envision the space outpost materializing in three phases first , united states astronauts would fly to the mir station to perform experiments and help enhance its gear and abilities in the second phase , both americans and russians would launch new modules into a higher orbit , hooking them together in an entirely new space outpost the united states would supply a laboratory module similar to the one envisioned for the space station freedom , while russia would supply a habitat for astronauts similar to one planned as a successor to its mir station invitation to other nations in the third phase , the eastwest outpost would be greatly expanded and would become truly international as nasa s old station partners the europeans , japanese and canadians have their gear and astronauts added to the mix so far none of the other partners have agreed to participate in a space station program designed by the united states and russia , and no timetable has been set questions abound whether the new plan will succeed congress is worried about protecting the jobs of american aerospace workers , and might see the merger as a threat for their part , some of the international partners have voiced bitter opposition to having the russians involved in any plan another question is russia s ability to carry out its intentions , politically and technically james e oberg , an american expert on the russian space program , argued today on the oped page of the wall street journal that russian launching facilities were falling into serious disrepair cooperation called inevitable the russians , he said , may be trying to sell the united states goods they do n't reliably possess dr bruce murray , a planetary scientist at the california institute of technology and a longtime proponent of such an eastwest merger , argued in an interview that enhanced cooperation was inevitable , even if it fell short of the most ambitious goals nothing like this is easy , he said freedom was never going to work here , at least , we 're headed in the right direction it makes sense we want to do something we can afford , and that can help us explore the solar system , together that s where the future is , rather than rattling our rocket muscles at each other the agreement on cooperation in space was one of three formal accords on space and missile technology signed today one ends the restrictions against the russians' launching any commercial satellites that contain american technology since most commercial communications and weather satellites contain some americanmade technology , the restriction had virtually shut moscow out of this market launchings to be limited officials at the department of commerce say the agreement limits the russian to bidding on eight launchings over seven years and declares that their bids must be comparable to commercial american launchers the two countries also agreed to help establish a joint investment fund to help provide equity for emerging private businesses in russia the united states will provide a 50 million loan guarantee to the fund , which is being set up by painewebber group inc , the wall street investment firm the russian government agreed to contribute 25 million
happy days are here again , or maybe they never stopped at peter luger s for the crowds that mob this venerable great neck steakhouse , the words recession and cholesterol do not exist at a time when many long island restaurants are struggling , peter luger is packed prices are not the reason , for there are no bargains here the standard steak for one is 2625 , and the menu s lone appetizer , shrimp cocktail , costs 1050 for four shrimp or 1525 for six nor is it a warm welcome that draws the crowds one evening two diners , questioning each other about the time of their reservation , were interrupted and snapped at by an unpleasant maitre d'hotel the rest of the staff , though , was courteous and friendly in fact , our waiter showed none of the gruffness for which steakhouse servers are famous instead , he resembled a warm old world grandfather efficiently seeing to our needs a neverending stream of large groups is seated elbow to elbow in the bustling roughhewn restaurant the main dining room , with its wood floors , scrubbedwood tables , dark ceiling beams , large wroughtiron chandelier and stucco walls , says steakhouse other rooms are more gentrified , with carpeting , tablecloths , redleather banquettes and brass williamsburgstyle chandeliers none of the rooms , though , will impress customers spending well over 100 a couple quiet elegant dining is not what peter luger is about food is , especially its aged reliable steaks most regulars know exactly what they will order before entering except for the nightly fish selection , there are no specials , no surprises , no difficult choices the menu is extremely limited , even for a steakhouse steaks are not listed by cut , only as steak for one , two , three or four it turns out that that steak is a porterhouse cooked precisely to order , flavorful , tender and the pick of the menu although steak is king , other entrees deserve attention the lamb chops , two doublethick loin cuts , were especially tender and juicy the lowly broiled chicken also scored , with moist meat and crisp skin the prime rib was mammoth and tender , but less juicy than the steaks diners with small appetites , who , nevertheless , want beef , should try the steak sandwich , a thin sliced steak served over toast with a garnish of lettuce and tomato an economical choice , not offered on weekends , is the commendable chopped steak for 1295 it features two eightounce mounds smothered in onions seafood lovers do surprisingly well with either the flaky salmon fillet , a fishofthenight selection , or the twoandahalfpound broiled lobster , a paragon of sweet lush meat there are three salads on the menu , but one , the green salad , can be skipped the bowl of romaine strewn with a handful of cherry tomatoes and accompanied by a mundane dressing is a sop to those who insist on a mixed salad the cognoscenti head for the sliced tomatoes or the tomatoes and onions the rubyred disks are not quite summer quality , but probably the best this time of year luger s sauce , a darkred semisweet amalgam with a horseradish kick , is the classic dressing for the tomatoes aficionados also pour it on the steaks side dishes are fine , especially the crunchy german fried potatoes and the soothing creamed spinach but here again the choice is limited desserts , all baked at peter luger s in brooklyn , are the expected treats , creamy new yorkstyle cheesecake , warm flaky apple strudel , rich chocolate mousse cake and homey pecan pie a bowl of real whipped cream is delivered to the table as the final cholesterolbedamned indulgence unlike many other traditional steakhouses like smith wollensky and sparks in manhattan , peter luger does not have a voluminous wine list rather , it is similar to the restaurant s menu , limited and on the expensive side the average price for the 19 table wines , 11 of them red , exceeds 30 a bottle a 1983 chateau simard \( 2750 \) from bordeaux s st emillion

the miller brewing company said yesterday that it would introduce a clear beer next week that was as filling as regular beer but as clear as water miller will become the second major brewer to focus on growing consumer interest in translucent drinks last fall , the coors brewing company brought out zima , a clear malt product said to have a slightly malty flavor that sets it apart from beer analysts said the new beverages were an attempt by brewers to revive an aging market that for the last decade had been almost as flat as weekold beer they also join several new clear soft drink products , including tab clear and crystal pepsi emanuel goldman , an analyst in the san francisco office of paine webber , said bottled water s popularity had led beverage makers toward the clear products on the chance that consumers wanted visible assurances of quality clear brings a certain implied purity , he said 122 calories a bottle a 12ounce bottle of miller clear contains 122 calories , the same as an oldfashioned beer , but will have only half the carbohydrates and none of the familiar golden color , company officials said a spokesman for miller , eric a kraus , said the new brew would be marketed as having full taste without heaviness he said it would be sold in a few introductory markets to be identified at a news conference in new york next tuesday the domestic beer market of just over 191 million barrels a year has been growing at only half a percentage point a year since the early 1980 s the bestselling brands have been around for a long time and the brewers find that generating excitement with them is not easy sales have also been hurt since the excise tax on beer was increased in 1991 a slowgrowth business the brewing companies are trying to generate growth or take a greater share in a very , very slowgrowth business , said benjamin s steinman , executive editor of beer marketer s insights , an industry newsletter they 've launched efforts to come up with new products in a number of directions , and clear beer is just the latest evidence of that zima was available in only a few cities , including nashville , sacramento , calif , and syracuse , when it was first sold last fall , mr steinman said he called the introduction very successful so far , and said zima was now being sold in about 40 other cities mr goldman of paine webber said that miller , a unit of the philip morris companies , had a reputation for being willing to try new products they have a history of trying anything from old barley beer , wheat beer , clipper , and others , he said to put a new venture into a limited test market costs almost nothing the real money comes from a full national rollout
how much more of this can racing take \? this is the visceral response after watching prairie bayou break down in the belmont yesterday the horse was then humanely destroyed , as they say in racing , and they say it a lot these days now the tragedies are coming one per triple crown race union city was put down after the preakness , won by prairie bayou , who had three weeks to live the breeders' cup has had nationaltelevision tragedies in go for wand in 1990 and mr brooks in 1992 , and the sport is still haunted by ruffian , the noble filly , breaking down here at belmont in that illfated match race in 1975 this business does not need very real and very visible tragedy not only are those tiny , complicated , overbred leg bones breaking down , but the business carries the fin de siecle gloom of being yesterday s sport today s thoroughbreds run in the shadow of contemporary sporting giants like michael jordan and wayne gretzky , still going strong in june , for goodness sakes colonial affair s victory yesterday will be remembered because julie krone became the first female jockey to win a triple crown race none of the three triple crown winners was going to be compared to secretariat , who 20 years ago had the ultimate springtime three triple crown races , three victories , culminating in the monumental 31length victory in the belmont secretariat secretariat he was the name you heard last week his jockey , ron turcotte , is now paralyzed as a result of a racing injury the thick clouds seemed to be in the right place yesterday if you had stood outside barn 21 in the foul drizzle last evening and watched trainer tom bohannan break into tears while he tried to graciously answer a question , you would understand this is no simple matter of exploitation it is also true that owners and trainers run these fragile animals for profit bohannan loved this big lug , who had been gelded because he was growing too large only three weeks ago , bohannan had speculated happily that prairie bayou , with no future in breeding , could be a champion for many years , the way john henry was racing badly needs familiar faces like john henry , but many thoroughbreds run a race or two and come up lame i ran across the infield and i accompanied him in the van , bohannan said , his face quivering a friend sloshed over and put his hand on bohannan s shoulder and said , i'm sorry bohannan apologized and went back into a cubbyhole in the stable , where people with ashen faces were making telephone calls a few minutes earlier , john ed anthony , the owner of prairie bayou , had tried to make sense of this the question , of course , that everyone has is , how can a horse galloping along well within himself , absolutely sound , hit the ground and break himself up like that \? well , i do n't have an answer anthony said the track was in fine shape and he noted the injury happened early , not when a horse might be tired or under stress anthony added , a bad step might wrench an ankle or cause a minor injury , but here the horse shattered his leg beyond repair mike smith , the jockey , needed half an hour before he could speak it can happen to anybody you could be walking along and you turn your ankle but maybe you weigh 150 pounds , but a horse might weigh 900 or 1 , 000 pounds or more smith added it s part of the game it s a funny game , a tough game , but a great game they are athletes and all athletes get hurt freak things happen in any sport now i 've got to put this behind me i 've got to ride tomorrow of course , a day like this affects you , but all it takes is some young horse coming along to drag you across the finish line , and you 're back into it again his reference to other athletes is important boxers and football players and racingcar drivers make rational decisions for money and fame and challenge horses are doing it for hay their legs shatter so people can bet on them , either at the parimutuel window or through ownership every time i see a horse go down , i wonder how long it will be before the animalrights people take a look at racing but i get around the barns , and i know racing people tend to love their horses , and i only hope for their sakes there is a respite from this horror photo prairie bayou before yesterday s race \( associated press \)

salt lake city , feb 21 the allstar game offered a preview today of dan majerle , one of the best defenders in the national basketball association , versus michael jordan , the best player in the world is majerle vs jordan , the series , coming next spring \? if we both get to the finals , that will be one the highlights , the bulls' jordan said of the matchup between himself and his all star shadow , the suns' majerle , after the western conference outlasted jordan and the east , 135132 , in overtime i can already see the stories in the newspapers down the stretch of an allstar game that suddenly picked up the kind of defensive intensity atypical of this indoor playground , jordan looked into majerle s face every time he crossed midcourt with the east in possession of the ball the fact that his coach with the phoenix suns , paul westphal , was pushing the west s buttons figured in majerle , who was not a starter , playing the final 4 minutes 44 seconds of the fourth quarter and all of overtime but as westphal said , the guy s not a good defensive player , he s a great defensive player so who else would you put on michael jordan \? jordan said , sure , i would have put him on me listen , he s one of the best he plays hard he competes he wears his heart on his sleeve i do n't know him very well , but when he guards me , i can feel the tension i enjoy the challenge to which the 6foot 6inch majerle added i enjoy the opportunity to guard him no one can stop him , but who would n't want to try \? jordan led the east with 30 points , but struggled on his jump shot , making 10 of his 24 shots at one point late in the fourth quarter , with the east trailing 117112 , jordan actually had to shove majerle in the chest to get off a jumper from the left side it missed , and the east appeared dead rises to challenge naturally , once the west failed to ice the game by missing free throws and mark price s 3pointer made it 117115 , jordan rose to the challenge isolating on majerle \( who had just made a foul shot \) in the center of the court , he drove right for a 15footer that made it 118117 then after a tim hardaway fould shot , he again beat majerle off the dribble , penetrated the lane , and found patrick ewing on the baseline for a 15footer that tied the game at 119 , sending it into ot but majerle s defense limited jordan to five ot points , the last three coming when the game was decided , and his own 3pointer gave the west a 124123 lead it never relinquished what i try to do is make him take a shot he s not really comfortable with , keep him outside and a hand in his face , said majerle and it s not like you can count on that working the key matchup the bulls are trying to win their third straight title the suns have the best record in the league if they meet in the finals , there would be a bonanza of highprofile players and matchups but none , possibly , might figure more in the outcome of the series we 've both got a lot of work to do , said majerle but , yeah , i 've thought about it probably will again photos utah s john stockton , who shared mvp honors with teammate karl malone , guarding the east s isiah thomas yesterday \( associated press \) bulls' michael jordan coming off the basket after dunking for the east during yesterday s allstar game \( associated press \)
washington , march 22 in a marathon series of meetings over the weekend , administration officials started to whittle down the options and to draft recommendations for president clinton s ambitious plan to reinvent the american healthcare system the president and his health team already know their general approach to curbing runaway medical costs and extending coverage to all americans a vast change in the way medical care is organized and delivered most patients and doctors would join groups like health maintenance organizations , accepting limits on their choices in return for lower costs but in the six weeks remaining in the president s timetable , as the planners refine details and begin to confront fiscal reality , administration officials face some painful choices ideas and hazards they have said they want not only to guarantee coverage for more than 35 million people who are now uninsured , but also to include costly items like longterm care , prescription drugs and mental health care among the basic benefits guaranteed to all americans but the politically hazardous prospect of additional taxes , on top of those already proposed in the president s economic package , may force the administration to scale back its desires , and in coming weeks the health task force and mr clinton may have to drop some cherished goals from public statements by officials , interviews with members of the president s health team and internal documents , it is possible to outline many of the main choices that must still be made by may 1 , when mr clinton has said he will send his proposal to congress such a status report discloses that many of the most politically sensitive decisions remain to be made , including what new requirements to impose on small businesses , whether to levy new taxes on employee health benefits and what kinds of cost controls to install already , though , it is clear that mr clinton will propose one of the most farreaching changes in american social policy in a halfcentury the health care industry industry accounts for oneseventh of the nation s economy , and the president s proposal will touch the lives of virtually all americans reforming the healthcare system will involve governmentled changes on a scale not attempted since social security , says ira c magaziner , the manager of hillary rodham clinton s task force on national health care reform as numbingly complex as it is farreaching , the proposal is certain to become a focus of bitter debate , and its prospects in congress are unclear some liberals fear that the plan may give too much power to large insurance companies , while some conservatives say it will mean too much government meddling with the freedom of doctors and patients hospitals , doctors , insurers , employers and consumers will all be profoundly affected and can be expected to try to reshape the details or the basic approach even some of mr clinton s allies say the initiative may be too ambitious , too complex and too costly but administration officials insist that a comprehensive proposal , reorganizing the entire health system , is necessary for both humanitarian and pragmatic reasons to aid the millions of people who have inadequate health insurance or none at all , and to control costs that have soared to a level of nearly 1 trillion a year , 14 percent of the national output last year basics are decided the president has decided on the basic strategy managed competition by networks of doctors , hospitals and insurance companies , operating within the framework of a national budget for all healthcare spending , public and private what that means is a transformation of american health care , offering the prospect of lower costs and more security , in return for less choice by consumers and doctors , most of whom may be forced to join prepaid plans like the health maintenance organizations that many people belong to now a snag in the complex process developed over the weekend when mrs clinton s father suffered a stroke she scrapped her healthcarerelated meetings today , and the white house said she has not decided when she will leave little rock , ark , where her father is hospitalized , and resume her schedule what follows is a guide to issues in the debate and options that are currently being considered the strategy health coverage for everyone some critics of mr clinton s managed competition approach argue that a system like canada s , in which the government pays for most health care with tax money , would be simpler and more fair but that system would collide with strong antigovernment sentiment in american politics , while the managed competition approach combines freemarket forces with federal regulation the clinton plan would guarantee coverage for all by requiring employers to provide a package of basic benefits to their workers , with the government paying for the unemployed the plan would seek to hold down costs by creating a more competitive market at the heart of the plan would be large purchasing groups , representing at least a million people in a state or region these , and the big private employers , would shop around for highquality health care at a low price the purchasing groups would act as bargaining agents for their members , which would include small employers and individuals , negotiating prices with networks of doctors , hospitals and insurance companies most networks would operate like health maintenance organizations , offering a wide range of services in return for fixed monthly payments

oceanside , calif , aug 13 highschool sweethearts who married when they were both 20 , rick and lisa hihath are the quintessential marine couple he the trim noncommissioned officer whose duty has shuffled him around the world , she the dutiful wife rearing two daughters and following him when she can , struggling to keep the marriage intact it s stressful , said sergeant hihath , now 29 , a logistics expert with the first marine division at camp pendleton here who recently returned from somalia given the amount of time marines spend away from home , the family has to adjust to dad s being away and then they have to adjust when he comes home again marital casualty toll similar stories can be told throughout the corps , and it was precisely to avoid that sort of disruption in the lives of recruits that the marine commandant recently issued a new corps policy that would have barred enlistment of married recruits , a startling departure made without the knowledge of civilian superiors once the superiors found out , they quickly scuttled the idea on wednesday , but the episode underscored the toll that military life takes on families , particularly in the marines , a kind of international 911 service and it reopened an ageold question about whether military and family life can coexist indeed , there is a considerable amount of support for the original order at least in principle among rankandfile marines interviewed here and a continent away at the marine camp in quantico , va i agree , cpl bobby shell , who is single , said as he got the obligatory highandtight haircut at the oceanside barbershop here i 've seen a lot of friends who get married too young and end up financially unable to make it and get divorced marriage detracts from readiness , said staff sgt randy w matthews , 38 , an infantry instructor at quantico a marine s mind ca n't be back home , wondering if his wife has a roof over her head but other marines and the family counselors who advise them said that it was the corps itself , not the recruiting guidelines , that must change just as many major corporations are learning to bend old tradition to meet modern times , they say , the marine corps should do even more to help families , beyond recent efforts to offer counseling and improve base housing the marines are doing a better job now dealing with married couples and their families , said debra kresch , director of the family service association office in carlsbad , calif , whose clients include many marine couples at pendleton who are reluctant to see a base counselor because of worries about confidentiality there is counseling available but there is so much uncertainty and anxiety in the marines , with the potential for deployment and relocation more than any other branch of service , in the corps you lose the general ability to direct your own life furor over directive those concerns seemed to be at least in part behind the policy change issued by the marine commandant , gen carl e mundy jr , a directive reversed by defense secretary les aspin on wednesday evening soon after he learned of it , to the general s great embarrassment the next day general mundy publicly acknowledged that he had been wrong for issuing the order without clearing it with his superiors the directive had stemmed from the marine high command s concern that marriages among young marines were too frequently leading to divorce , or at least an unstable family life , and were a cause of a low reenlistment rate among married marines completing their initial period of enlistment almost 45 percent of the 35 , 000 marines stationed at camp pendleton are married they have 46 , 000 dependents , 13 , 600 of them living on base , and the rest in nearby communities like oceanside and carlsbad the 125 , 000acre base is home to the first marine expeditionary force , which made up the bulk of marines sent to somalia no ordinary family rick and lisa hihath are among the families who live on base , and their surroundings suggest that the corps has not entirely neglected family life in recent years for 700 a month , they rent a pleasant twobedroom townhouse in the stuart mesa housing complex , a collection of redtiled tan stucco buildings on winding suburban streets that looks like thousands of private developments in southern california their two daughters , ashley , 6 , and danielle , 3 , played on the neat lawn out front on thursday evening but this is no ordinary suburban family they grew up as friends in meridian , idaho , and when rick joined the corps and came to pendleton in 1982 , lisa moved to los angeles they speeded up their marriage date when rick was ordered to okinawa , where they lived for two and a half years , during which she was alone for a third of the time when he traveled to south korea and the philippines that was just the beginning it was back to pendleton , then two years of recruiting duty in yakima , wash , and back to pendleton again they lived on base , off base , on base it s stressful , coming into the marine corps with the strictness , and then have to adjust to married life at the same time , said sergeant hihath , who takes home about 26 , 000 a year , including an allowance for dependents after 11 years of this , he believes that some type of screening out of married people at enlistment is warranted , if not a total ban on them
glens falls , ny , sept 16 a man of very little patience , mike keenan has absolutely none when it comes to underachievers coming into his first camp as head coach of the rangers , keenan , who has built his reputation on getting the most he can out of what he has , was generally vague as to what he expected from a team that played to the least of its expectations last season he did , however , mention how much he was looking forward to seeing aleksei kovalev , the 20yearold russian right wing with all the promise in the world but not a whole lot to show for it so far , at least , keenan has not been disappointed coach offers kudos i 've had a surprise already , keenan said today after he had seen the secondyear player in his second scrimmage i did n't think kovalev was that good he s a magician on the ice , just electrifying he was worth the price of admission alone today heavy praise for a player who , although a 20goal scorer as a rookie , was demoted to the minors twice last season for not listening to his ranger coaches , first roger neilson and then ron smith , and for not learning to adjust from the european style of play to the more physical american brand backchecking is a radical departure from the way kovalev likes to play , but he knows if he wants to see significant time from keenan , he will have to check some players if there were any doubts as to kovalev s desire to impress his new coach , they were dispelled on his first shift of the preseason last weekend in london when he uncharacteristically checked not one , but two toronto players into the boards the european rinks are smaller it s a faster game , kovalev said i think russian hockey is easier for technique here , all the time you are shooting , rushing the net it s power hockey but i am learning to help the defensemen in the center zone and the defensive zone a native of toliatti , russia , a village an hour s flight west of moscow , kovalev , who lives in mamaroneck , ny , during the season , looks more like an oversized teenager than a professional athlete but on the ice , the 6foot , 200pounder possesses catlike quickness on his skates , a deft passing touch , an accurate shot , an innate sense for scoring he is not short on confidence , either last season was a bad one for me i only scored 20 goals , the affable forward said this year , it will be easy for me to score a lot of goals , at least 30 a healthy sense of humor kovalev s maturation process , if you will , has not been confined to the ice goodnatured and with a healthy sense of humor , he , like many other european players , knew very little english upon his arrival , and felt uncomfortable talking to the reporters but kovalev has worked on his english , and the improvement is striking when kovalev was drafted with the team s top pick , the 15th over all , in the 1991 entry draft , the soviet union was still intact , and he was bound to the club team , moscow dynamo when the country dissolved , the russian made his passage to america with his talent , he probably should have been taken in the top three , said ranger general manager neil smith but a lot of people thought we 'd never get him out of there
should the united states allow immigrants infected with the virus that causes aids to enter the country for extended stays \? president clinton said yes during the campaign he pledged to remove the aids virus from the list of diseases that automatically exclude wouldbe immigrants but the senate gave a resounding no this week it voted overwhelmingly to turn the current ban into law , a move that would make it more difficult for the president to honor his pledge now the house must decide whether to go along , and the president must decide whether to veto any legislation that might emerge the white house , already battered by the struggle over whether to allow homosexuals to serve openly in the military , showed little stomach this week for taking on yet another contentious social issue that might distract from its economic program that s not only sound politics , it s sound policy as well whatever their political motives , and whatever whiff of homophobia is in the air , senate republicans have raised serious cost and risk questions that need to be addressed based on current information , the ban is best left in place public health authorities argue that the ban should be lifted because the aids virus unlike tuberculosis is not spread through casual contact infected immigrants are thus not a threat to the broad public but only to those who engage in risky behavior with them , such as unprotected sex or sharing drug needles but infected immigrants would pose at least a small risk to society some would inevitably spread the virus to their sexual partners or others in coming years , the us is apt to admit more than 700 , 000 immigrants annually if just 1 in 1 , 000 is infected , as some early estimates suggest , then some 700 infected individuals a year would be admitted , and some unknown portion of those might infect someone else that s not much on top of a million or more existing infections in the us but it s not so trivial that it can be ignored and as aids continues to spread around the world , the number of infections in the immigrant pool will rise the infected immigrants would also impose costs on a health care system that is already overburdened especially in the urban centers to which immigrants typically flock at an average cost of 100 , 000 to treat an aids patient from infection to death , the admission of 700 infected immigrants each year would commit the nation to 70 million for their lifetime treatment this is not a commitment that is easy to justify at a time when the administration is desperately trying to contain runaway health costs in theory , the cost problem could be handled through a provision in the immigration law that allows authorities to reject anybody likely to become a public charge that way infected immigrants with assets or high earnings potential could be allowed in while those apt to need publicly financed medical care could be screened out but the public charge criterion has primarily been used to reject immigrants who ca n't be supported by themselves or their families there is little information on how effectively it works or how well it might screen against high medical costs and although immigrants can be deported if they become public charges within the first five years of admission , it is hard to imagine expelling people dying of aids just because they ca n't pay their own hospital bills cost is a valid criterion , but it needs to be applied broadly immigrants can come down with a wide range of costly ailments , including heart disease , cancer , stroke and endstage renal disease none can be detected as readily as aids , but some are more expensive to treat thus immigrants with any costly condition ought to be excluded any decision to single out aids requires careful justification senators on both sides of the debate wisely called for estimates of the number of immigrants who will be infected with the aids virus , the probable medical costs and a comparison with the costs for immigrants suffering from other health conditions the ban should be lifted only if assessments show that the risk of spreading disease is negligible and the costs can be readily met
washington , jan 31 in a sweeping new policy statement , the national governors' association said today that the federal government should set nationwide standards for health insurance and should limit the tax deductibility of health insurance for both employers and employees but in a rebuff to president clinton , the governors rejected his proposal to impose a national limit on all health spending , public and private the governors said all americans should have access to health care such universal access is both a moral imperative and an invaluable costcontainment tool , they said more than 35 million americans have no health insurance coverage the governors' position is important because the states will have a big role in carrying out any major changes in the healthcare system approved by congress mr clinton , a former chairman of the association , has invited all governors to a white house meeting on monday and plans to address them at their winter meeting here on tuesday call for definitions in their policy statement , adopted by voice vote without dissent , the governors demand federal minimum standards for the regulation of health insurance , which has historically been regulated by the states the federal standards should limit variation in insurance premiums and prohibit insurers from denying coverage to people with a history or a high risk of medical problems , they said the governors said the federal government should define a standard minimum package of health benefits , comparable to those now provided by the most efficient health maintenance organizations under the proposal , employers could not take a tax deduction for contributions to employee health benefits exceeding the value of the standard package and employees would have to pay income tax on such excess contributions under current law , there is no limit on an employer s tax deductions for employee health benefits , and none of the benefits are counted as taxable income to employees economists contend that this arrangement encourages overuse of health care because employees are shielded from the true cost governors said they hoped that , by limiting tax breaks for health insurance , the nation could slow the growth of health spending , expected to total 940 billion this year , up 100 billion from 1992 people would still be free to buy coverage beyond the basic benefits , but the government would no longer subsidize the extra coverage through the tax code health budget opposed the governors did not specify how the unemployed or their families should be covered but they said states should organize cooperatives through which individuals and small businesses could buy coverage in his campaign manifesto , mr clinton said he wanted to establish an annual health budget for the nation to limit both public and private expenditures but in their policy statement today , the governors said , it is unrealistic to immediately enforce strict budget limits on healthcare spending , since available data are not sufficient to set accurate spending ceilings at the white house on monday , governors said , they will plead with mr clinton to allow maximum flexibility to states , both in medicaid and in any new national healthcare program mr clinton has endorsed the idea of managed competition , in which large groups of consumers seek the most efficient providers from competing networks of doctors and hospitals in general , the governors support this approach but they warned that mr clinton and congress must pay special attention to the needs of rural areas gov george s mickelson of south dakota , a republican , said , managed competition is not relevant in 55 percent of my state , which is classified as frontier in such rural areas , he said , there are not enough doctors or hospitals to have meaningful competition the governors' policy allows states to require employers to provide health insurance to their employees but it does not endorse mr clinton s proposal for a federal law to impose such a requirement nationwide i would not sign on to a policy that said we were going to have an employer mandate , said gov carroll a campbell jr of south carolina , a republican , who is vice chairman of the association the governors' meeting is dominated by talk of health care if we 're to reduce the deficit and get some fiscal sanity in this nation and in our individual states , we must attack our healthcare costs , said gov roy romer of colorado , a democrat who is chairman of the association gov ann w richards of texas , a democrat , proposed an amendment to the healthpolicy statement that said , national and statelevel spending targets should be set , and costcontrol techniques should be adopted as quickly as possible mr campbell recommended that the first half of the amendment be deleted , to eliminate the idea of spending targets , and the other governors agreed mr campbell said he feared that such targets would be set unwisely and enforced rigidly by federal bureaucrats doctors , hospitals , drug makers and manufacturers of medical equipment also oppose national limits on health spending if you can put a cap on illness , then we 'll talk about a cap on expenditures , said michael d bromberg , executive director of the federation of american health systems , which represents 1 , 400 investorowned hospitals in a separate statement adopted today , the governors asked the clinton administration for immediate relief from the crushing burden of medicaid costs they proposed changes in medicaid rules to give state officials more discretion in managing costs , especially the costs of longterm care for elderly people and for children who are disabled or mentally retarded the governors also called for a change in federal law to increase medicaid payments to hospitals serving a disproportionate number of lowincome patients the governors themselves agreed to limits on such payments , under pressure from the bush administration , in november 1991 photo president clinton watching the super bowl yesterday with his daughter , chelsea , gov ann w richards of texas and gov mario m cuomo

accused of blowing up the world trade center last feb 26 the prosecution s theory , outlined in the opening statement of the chief prosecutor , j gilmore childers , when the trial opened three weeks ago , is that the bomb was brought into the underground parking garage of the trade center in a yellow ford econoline van that had been rented three days earlier at a new jersey ryder rental agency by one of the defendants , mohammed a salameh and so , for the last week , 20 agents from the federal bureau of investigation and the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms , all of whom searched through the bomb wreckage at the world trade center , have testified so that surviving parts of the vehicle , or of the explosive device itself , can be put into evidence a glacial pace but so far none of the federal agents , or any of the other 27 witnesses who have testified , have explicitly linked the scraps and shreds of metal and rubber to the yellow ryder rental van that fact , and the glacial pace by which the evidence is accumulating , led judge duffy at the end of yesterday s session to the rare gesture of advising the prosecution on how to get to the point a bit more quickly , presumably before the jurors' minds begin to go numb with the monotony of it all i'm not running anybody s case , judge duffy said but might i suggest to the government that what you do is get the guy in here from ford or wherever and get him to say that all of this spells whatever it spells despite his evident impatience , however , judge duffy overruled every objection made by the defense to stop the prosecution from introducing yet another shard , said to be from the ryder van , or from showing it to the jury and so , during the course of the day , four witnesses , including three from the fbi and one from the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms , were prompted by the prosecution to tell the jury what they or other members of the search teams found in the wreckage , and exactly where it was found standard courtroom prop first up was david symons , a nineyear veteran of the fbi who said his job as a member of one of the teams searching through the rubble left behind by the blast was to tag the evidence found by other members of his team mr symons sat at the witness stand with a halfdozen pieces of wreckage arrayed in front of him , which he identified as a piece of a vehicle manifold , a piece of a flywheel , a generator , a pulley part and part of a pump the next witness , john goetz , an alcohol , tobacco and firearms agent from the agency s philadelphia office , examined a large number of other items that the prosecutor , henry depippo , wearing the pale yellow work gloves that have become a standard prop of the courtroom routine , pulled from a large plastic evidence bag there was a piece of tire , a piece that he said came from the steering mechanism of a vehicle , a latch from a trunk or a hood , part of a radiator , another part of a tire , and a piece of metal frame with the word ford stamped on it the other witnesses produced additional , very similar evidence , leading judge duffy , at the normal midafternoon coffee break , to quip we 're taking our break now because the coffee is hot anybody who s been watching will understand the need for that coffee what causes the proceedings to unfold at so glacial a rate is not just the prosecution s apparent determination to present what judge duffy grumpily called every shard it is not even the studied colorlessness of the prosecutors it is the need to pass through the same series of steps which , taken together , produce a kind of humdrum courtroom choreography and then the gloves each witness gives a bit of his background , especially his training in postblast investigations the prosecutors , taking objects out of plastic bags or battered cardboard boxes , ask each witness to identify each object the witness then looks at pictures and affirms that they are fair and accurate representations of the objects next , the witness puts a small , round , colored sticker on a floor plan of the world trade center showing approximately where each object was found by now , the floor plan , mounted on an easel , looks like something that might be found in a modern art gallery , with dozens of little splashes of yellow , green and red highlighting the gray background of architectural drawings finally , judge duffy tells the jurors to put on their own pairs of yellow work gloves so the smaller pieces of evidence , and the pictures of the same objects , can be passed among them without danger of injury the evidence makes its slow way to all 12 jurors and five alternates while the rest of the courtroom watches and waits , the defendants staring impassively ahead of them , judge duffy resting his head on his open hand , courtroom observers fidgeting crossexamination also follows a similar pattern , with the defense lawyers generally trying to demonstrate that the witnesses do not really know what the shards of evidence really are , exactly who found them , or where they were found , and certainly that they do not know what vehicle or vehicles they came from
he is a quarterback who doubles as a walking piece of history , a player who has outlasted several presidents and countless pro football coaches phil simms is on a grand voyage that began as a firstround draft pick in 1979 and continues in 1993 he is a slightly weathered piece of granite on a ride that has casually escaped the erosion of time simms , 38 , is currently in the zone his 949 quarterback rating is fourth in the national football conference and his eight touchdown passes are first today , the giants play the philadelphia eagles for first place in the the nfc east , with the eagles being a team that simms has not played well against philadelphia will give this simms rebirth its biggest test yet simms s rebound from being benched last season by former coach ray handley to this season s gritty renaissance may be less about the quarterback than about how he has affected others , not just in recent years but during his 15year career throughout the national football league , coaches , players , friends , enemies , redskins , cowboys , republicans , democrats have all marveled at how simms has been playing none are more impressed than other quarterbacks , past , present and future three examples joe theismann would watch from the redskins sidelines as simms stood in the pocket and took vicious hit after vicious hit but got up dallas quarterback troy aikman has learned a lot about perseverance from the giants' quarterback and gus ornstein , a highlyrecruited quarterback from fieldston high school in the bronx , says he has watched simms play on television since he was 6 years old three generations of quarterbacks , and to each simms s play and personality has a special meaning the past joe theismann , who played with the redskins from 197485 and is now an espn analyst , says he knows simms as well as a person can get to know a professional quarterback the position almost demands that you be somewhat aloof we 're good friends , theismann said we 've been around each other a lot for some years now and still i do n't know that much about him he s a private guy i think you 'd be hard pressed to find someone outside his family who knows him well but that s part of being a quarterback the job also demands the quarterback to be cocky , and theismann says that simms s cockiness is more , as theismann puts it , in the closet he does n't wear his brashness on his sleeve the way some quarterbacks do controlled cockiness can lead to explosive performances on the field , like simms s completion of 88 percent of his passes \( 22 of 25 \) in super bowl xxi theismann called it one of the greatest athletic achievements he s ever seen phil s game has not changed in my opinion in all the years , theismann said he delivers the ball the same , stands in the pocket the same , is as fearless as he s ever been he does everything the same i think he may be better at these things than he s ever been in my opinion , phil was the benchmark for what it takes to be a tough quarterback , theismann said i feel pretty confident in saying that he is one of the toughest quarterbacks in the history of football absolutely different people have different attributes bob griese was very cerebral john elway has the great comebacks dan marino has the great technique randall cunningham , the great athletic ability when they talk about tough quarterbacks , phil will be the marker the present troy aikman may now be the best quarterback in the league he has met simms several times , mostly at charity golf tournaments but it s not simms s putting that impressed aikman it was his mental toughness when he was sitting on the bench under handley aikman knows about perseverance his rookie year in 1989 , the cowboys won just one game and he was hit more than george foreman but a quarterback would rather get hit and play than sit and watch aikman respects how simms kept his composure and stayed the course during his year on the bench i like phil , aikman said i know how competitive he is and how frustrating it must have been not to play that much over the past couple of years i know that must have been very tough for him i think it helps when a team knows who is going to be the guy , and with someone like phil in there who has been so successful , he provides a tremendous amount of leadership that s his best quality , i think the future gus ornstein , at 18 , is considered by many to be one of the most gifted young talents in the country notre dame , michigan , brigham young and syracuse all want the strongarmed , 6foot5inch 205 pounder the irish went so far as to invite him to their spring game , and michigan coach gary mueller pulled him aside for a private chat during the quarterback s visit to ann arbor and , with fieldston s academic reputation , just about every school in the ivy league is interested in ornstein he wears no 11 simms s number and on recruiting visits , he always asks if no 11 will be available marked by personal encounter a few years ago after a game at giants stadium i was on the field throwing the ball around , ornstein said , and i actually got to throw with him i remember he came out and looked at me and said , 'how come you 're so skinny you need to lift weights' i started lifting then and that s one of the reasons i 've been able to get pretty strong i always watch him on television it s a good way to learn , not necessarily the mechanics of how he throws , but how he reads defenses i try to play smart like he does i used to model myself after him i think i still do the main thing , concludes ornstein , is how phil always comes through on thirdandlong situations i think he s the best quarterback at that when i play , i always try to come through when my team really needs me photo after 15 years , phil simms continues to impress teammates and opponents with his special brand of consistency and resilience \( ray stubblebine \)
in what many have been led to believe is one of the few safe places in the south bronx , the yankee clubhouse , pitcher jim abbott said he was looking forward to the second half of the baseball season here we 're only one game out of first place and we have n't even played up to our capabilities yet , abbott said yesterday and the fans are into it screaming and shouting and hollering at the other players i think things are really going to be exciting around here come september and october it could be wild for many , something wild in the south bronx conjures up mayhem of a sort beyond the simple exuberance for a pennant or division race and this perception has been fueled by the owner of the yankees , a tampa , fla , resident named george steinbrenner 3d george happens to be in the news lately because he is threatening to take the team out of the bronx and move it to some neighboring state , if the state of new york does n't drop to its collective political knees and kiss his mighty ringed fingers which means build him a new stadium , probably in manhattan george is unhappy with yankee stadium as it is now constituted , and where it is constituted there is a limited amount of parking and the neighborhood , yankee officials say behind the backs of their hands , is less than desirable in other words , if you 're coming to a game , wear a helmet and a flak jacket in his office in the 44th precinct headquarters , about a half mile north of the stadium , the commanding officer , henry krantz , has a map on his wall with pins stuck at spots where robberies in the area around yankee stadium have been committed this year in january , february and march , we had nine robberies , he said since april , we 've had one a month and none with people coming or going from baseball games i attribute that to the added security around yankee stadium and this for the busiest precinct in the city as far as radio runs are concerned that is , calls for service to 911 but the area around yankee stadium itself is rather small , and it s bounded on four sides by a park , the highway , the old bronx terminal market and a residential area to the east so the stadium is somewhat isolated from the meat of the precinct at the stadium itself , there is a detail of about 65 policeman for a game , including at stadium posts and traffic posts no fan who has come to yankee stadium this season has reported being robbed , said lieut george stamp , head of the stadium detail there has been no report of pickpocketing and nobody has reported being attacked going in or out of a parking lot the major problem is when people park their cars on the neighborhood streets instead of in parking lots then we get some breakins but that s tremendously reduced in the parking lots the lieutenant also said that , to the best of his knowledge , there were no robberies of fans last year , either he added that the transit authority beefs up its detail for games , and , besides , it has a headquarters at the ball park s station , on 161st street none of this has been reported in the voluminous news releases from the yankees their approach to their locality is the same as baseball s in general to its players put them down so we might beat them at the bargaining table and public relations be damned the ploy by steinbrenner with yankee stadium has been similar to his activity in fort lauderdale , as he threatens that florida community with taking his 32yearold springtraining camp to orlando or ocala , or , if you can believe it , tampa ! when his soninlaw , joseph a molloy , the yankees general partner , was asked by telephone about the team s fort lauderdale future , he said , we 're considering our options and there is no problem with crime or parking around the ball park there it s true that the yankees could use increased parking facilities , but , according to city officials , that s all possible at the current site , which is one of the great historical and romantic attractions in a great city the fact is , with an attractive team the fans will come to the bronx chicago stadium , for example , is situated in one of the worst neighborhoods in america , and the team , with a town pillar known as michael jordan , has sold out for 293 straight games over a period of about eight seasons the yankees will be able to manage quite nicely , especially if , as jim abbott anticipates , things in the bronx heat up in the fall but maybe we 've been too hard on steinbrenner after all , he has a good view of the neighborhood , from the tinted window of his limousine
orpheus chamber orchestra carnegie hall playing conductorless , as orpheus and other chamber orchestras have shown , is no mere parlor trick to stay in time , in tune and in balance , the players have to listen to one another particularly closely this shared sensibility can in turn produce greater nuance and expressivity the players may also pay closer attention to the music itself , on the same theory that you do n't really learn a route until you drive it yourself so it seemed , at least , on saturday evening , when orpheus performed mozart s piano concerto no 23 with alicia de larrocha seldom has the relationship between the lovely opening melody and a prominent secondmovement theme been shown so clearly not forced didactically but simply urged as a shared awareness ms de larrocha played with sparkle and grace , and the performance as a whole was a delight , with none of the sense of routine that has so hobbled mozart in recent years david jolley and his orpheus colleagues also gave a polished account of ellen taaffe zwilich s concerto for horn and strings , which was commissioned partly by the orchestra ms zwilich interestingly casts the horn against type , in a dark , introverted piece seemingly obsessed with the cramped interval of a semitone the work is finely wrought in a style that evokes shostakovich but by now must be considered ms zwilich s own orpheus added engaging performances of handel s concerto grosso in c minor \( op 6 , no 8 \) and ravel s tombeau de couperin james r oestreich
